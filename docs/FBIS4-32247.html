			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F> Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions and Hungarian Socialist  Party member of the National Assembly, by an unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [FIGYELO] How much of the success of the MSZP  [Hungarian Socialist Party] in the elections to date do you  attribute to its agreement with the MSZOSZ [National Federation  of Hungarian Trade Unions]?    [Nagy] That of course would be difficult to calculate. But  it  would be meaningless to speculate about this if for no other  reason than because the trade unions are the natural allies of a  party that is pursuing social democratic values. If you were to  ask me what would have happened to the MSZP without the trade  unions' support, that would be the same as asking me what would  have become of the MSZP if it had not started as a social  democratic party in the elections?    [FIGYELO] In 1989 the MSZOSZ still defined itself as a trade  union movement that stood above fights between political  parties. Why has the MSZOSZ altered its standpoint?    [Nagy] Many people believe that this is the final resolution  of an alliance, formed of necessity, between two organizations  forced into quarantine in 1990. But that is not how things  stand. Actually, what has changed is the situation rather than  our standpoint. It was normal for us to distance ourselves from  the elections and political parties during the change of  political systems. But now we are speaking about the possibility  and necessity of changing governments. What kind of government  comes to power cannot be indifferent to the trade unions.    [FIGYELO] In the autumn of 1993 you people regarded an  election alliance conceivable not just with the MSZP but also  with the NDSZ [National Democratic Association] and the Agrarian  Alliance. But not with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats],  the most likely coalition partner of the MSZP. How will you fit  into a governing coalition that advocates two liberal economic  policies?    [Nagy] On this I am able to express only my own personal  opinion, which does not play a role in the MSZP's choice of a  coalition partner. Nor would it be right if it did play a role.    As a trade union leader, I would not welcome a government  economic policy that could be described by a single adjective,  as liberal. Simply put, it would mean that the strong maintain  their footing while the weak go under. If thinking in terms of  shock therapy were added to all this, that would lead to  conflicts. In my opinion, incidentally, the economic policy of  the MSZP is characterized not so much by liberalism as by  pragmatism.    [FIGYELO] I assume that your acceptance of the MSZP's  economic policy concept, which bears the hallmark of Laszlo  Bekesi's name and is of a liberal nature after all, was also a  condition of your nomination by the MSZP as a candidate for a  parliamentary seat.    [Nagy] I have already declared on several occasions that  this  program--together with its associated employment, social policy,  and other programs, of course--is readily acceptable to the  trade unions. At the same time, nobody has demanded of me that  I, on behalf of the trade unions, endorse every line of this  program and thereby give the future government what amounts to a  blank check.    [FIGYELO] In the end the MSZP adopted the fifth version of  the Bekesi program. To what extent are the changes in the final  version a result of the agreement between the MSZP and the  MSZOSZ?    [Nagy] We did not take part in the program's substantive  elaboration, but our views were well known to the leadership of  the MSZP. In the course of the debate within the MSZP, wording  more agreeable to us as well were included in the program. The  final version, for instance, is socially more sensitive to the  problems of the strata in the worst possible situation, and it  regards the reduction of unemployment as a direct objective.    [FIGYELO] What do you think? Will the majority within the  MSZP parliamentary group hold opinions closer to your own or to  Bekesi's?    [Nagy] I would be unable to assess that, and I do not know  what others are thinking. But on certain questions--and here I  have primarily the social problems in mind--I would not be  surprised to see a majority holding views closer to my own.  Otherwise our relations with Bekesi are proper; we hold  consultations regularly, and also debates when necessary.    [FIGYELO] During the election campaign Gyula Horn frequently  advanced the argument that shifting the transformation's burdens  onto wage and salary earners could not continue. You yourself  said that workers have had to pay an inordinately high price for  the transformation. It suggests that this is something the new  government could remedy quickly, whereas spending at the expense  of growing internal and external debt and the long-continuing  squandering of assets have also meant the squandering of our  future, which makes illusory the promise of maintaining the  level of real incomes in the coming years.    [Nagy] Nobody is promising a quick turnaround. We know very  well that it is not possible to aim for practically full  employment and a slower rate of inflation in the short term. It  is particularly tragic that, to a large extent, the population's  sacrifices have been in vain, because in the end the outgoing  government has failed in the fiscal and monetary sphere as well.  Everyone knows that difficult years are ahead. Nowhere do I find  any expectations of a miracle.    [FIGYELO] Do you agree with Laszlo Bekesi's statement that,  under the conditions of the present crisis, social democratic  answers to the problems are not possible?    [Nagy] Yes. This period is not conducive to social  democratic  values, but they must be upheld nevertheless. The most serious  social problems have to be remedied.    [FIGYELO] Do you accept that halting the rapid worsening of  the budget deficit and its subsequent improvement will be the  principal task in the coming years?    [Nagy] Perhaps this is the correct formulation in view of  the  sequence of the tasks. But it would be more to my liking to say  that we must strive simultaneously to create the conditions for  a balanced budget and economic recovery, to reduce unemployment,  to roll back inflation, and to manage our social problems. Or  more accurately, to optimize these partially conflicting  objectives.    [FIGYELO] According to Laszlo Bekesi, budgetary reform would  be accompanied by a reduction of real incomes, by 4 or 5 percent  a year over a period of three years, and about half of this  reduction could be offset. What do these figures mean to you?    [Nagy] According to the MSZP's economic policy program,  budgetary reform would have to be accompanied by compensation  for most members of society. If the government found that this  was not feasible, it would have to negotiate with the trade  unions. It is still too early to speak of numbers. But we  certainly think it will be essential to halt the decline of  wages within the foreseeable future, and to raise the real value  of the smallest pensions, even in the short term.    [FIGYELO] All the present opposition parties are against the  current consolidation of banks and debtors, or rather the manner  in which this is being done. How does the MSZOSZ feel about this?    [Nagy] We are convinced that the rescuing of some  enterprises  is warranted. Consolidation should have begun sooner. But the  state cannot make a practice of using taxpayers' money to  rescue, time and again, the firms that get into trouble. In our  opinion, the way to reconcile these two requirements is to  complete the privatization of the banks as soon as possible.  Then it will be in the banks' best interest to choose the  solutions that will be the most suitable also in the long run.  These solutions, of course, will vary by enterprises. In other  words, we too oppose the present state-administrative mechanism  of decisionmaking.    [FIGYELO] Last fall the MSZOSZ published its standpoint on  privatization in which it demanded first of all that closer  attention be paid to considerations of employment. Does the  MSZOSZ really believe that disguised unemployment has already  ceased at the enterprises about to be privatized, and  structurally they already meet the market's requirements? In  other words, that layoffs at these enterprises can be avoided?    [Nagy] We oppose the present practice of privatization that  strives for maximum proceeds--which, incidentally, are then  squandered--and does not care what happens to the enterprises  after privatization. Therefore, we believe, preference should be  given to buyers who guarantee to maintain the level of  employment and to raise the capital.    [FIGYELO] On the one hand, I do not believe that buyers  paying cash are not interested in the enterprises' efficient  operation in the future. On the other hand, I feel that the  wider employee stock ownership, which the MSZOSZ has also been  demanding, is in conflict with your concern for the enterprises'  future. After all, workers usually do not have money to invest,  and delaying necessary layoffs could drive the entire firm into  bankruptcy.    [Nagy] It would be a misconception to conclude from MSZOSZ  support for employee stock ownership programs that the MSZOSZ  believes in employees' holding a majority interest. We think it  is more important that the firm be in good hands and the workers  hold well-paying jobs than that they become owners. At the same  time we believe that it would be expedient if also  representatives of the industrial union concerned were present  when privatization decisions were being made. Even the mutual  exchange of information could avoid many misunderstandings.    [FIGYELO] Don't you think that insistence on transferring  state assets to Social Insurance should cease? On the one hand,  a large proportion of state assets earns hardly any income. On  the other hand, Social Insurance would not be a good owner  because of its inability to raise capital and its incentive to  extract as much profit as possible.    [Nagy] Professional investors abroad welcome union pension  funds, for instance, as co-owners of equity. Social Insurance's  short-term paucity of cash unquestionably creates a  contradictory situation. All these problems should be thought  through in the bill on Social Insurance.    [FIGYELO] In your dual capacity as trade union chairman and  Social Insurance officer, you must have had opportunity to enjoy  the pleasures stemming from the contradictions between being a  ruling-party member of parliament and holding trade union  office. As trade union chairman, you should be demanding the  reduction of social insurance contributions, which entrepreneurs  particularly find detrimental and which are an especially  serious obstacle to job creation in the regular economy. But as  an officer of Social Insurance, you have an interest in  increasing its revenue, from which benefits are paid. To resolve  this contradiction, the MSZOSZ has invented a solution that has  been aired in the media, namely to offset the reduction of  social insurance contributions by reallocating tax revenues. To  my mind, that is merely juggling.    [Nagy] The contradiction you mentioned exists only  partially,  and there is an answer also to the dilemma of reducing social  nsurance contributions. The contributions are so high at present  because willingness to pay the contributions is very low, Social  Insurance has a substantial amount of contributions owed in its  receivables, and many people are working in the underground  economy. The next government should have the determination to  declare war on the underground economy, although in a civilized  manner. In that case the burdens on the regular sphere would be  reduced. It is intolerable that many private entrepreneurs are  employing even the best skilled workers merely for minimal  wages. It is conceivable that in the future the amount of the  employees' contribution fund will be determined on the basis of  empirical data gathered in the given industry. Health insurance  is where I regard as feasible the offsetting of lower  contributions with tax revenue, on the principle of universal  entitlement to health care.    [FIGYELO] In recent months, both the present opposition and  the MSZOSZ expressed support for concluding an economic and  social pact. Do you think there is any difference in the topics  on which the individual organizations wish to reach agreement?    [Nagy] At present we are able to speak only of initial and  rather tentative intentions. Obvious topics will be all the  economic problems we have already mentioned: nominal wages and  pensions, inflation, taxes, the burdens of budgetary reform, the  development of social entitlements, and of real wages and  incomes that can be predicted over a horizon of several years.  The MSZOSZ also has objectives on which others perhaps are not  laying so much stress. These objectives include laying down the  statutory and legal conditions for the current reconciliation of  interests, and the trade unions' operating conditions. These are  not primarily financial issues. In parliament, for instance, a  receiving and transmitting station ought to be established for  agreements on the reconciliation of interests. To this day there  is no parliamentary committee that could link with parliament's  work the information circulating within the system of labor  relations. There is also a need to develop the conditions for  negotiating agreements at the intermediate--i.e.,  industry--level; such agreements barely exist at present. But if  a country attaches importance to properly functioning trade  unions, then I think it is conceivable that the trade unions  could be granted tax exemptions for publishing newspapers, and  for their hotels or commercial office buildings.    [FIGYELO] Do I understand you correctly? Is the MSZOSZ  demanding the expansion of the influence of the trade union  apparatus, in exchange for the trade unions' self-restraint, the  extent of which is, of course, open to bargaining?    [Nagy] There is no question of that at all, because one is  not a substitute for the other. We obviously have to represent  the employees' interests first and foremost. The operating  conditions stem from the trade union movement's participation in  the reconciliation of interests, and related considerations rank  only second, but they too are important.    [FIGYELO] It is conspicuous that the militant job actions in  recent months--the locomotive engineers' strike, and aviation  mechanics' strike--were organized by unions that do not belong  to the MSZOSZ.    [Nagy] These strikes were staged in small, closed trades  capable of asserting their interests effectively. The workers in  these trades belong to either the League [Democratic League of  Independent Trade Unions] or the Autonomous Trade Unions. In  light of this, I am especially surprised, and occasionally  slightly offended or perhaps bemused, to hear ourselves accused  of demagoguery. During the past four years, in a period of  rapidly rising unemployment and continually declining real  wages, MSZOSZ policy has remained unchanged. We will continue to  seek the most sensible solutions, within the limits of economic  reality.    [FIGYELO] In the absence of exact criteria, I suspect, trade  union leaders are doomed to being accused constantly of either  demagoguery or capitulation. In the open reconciliation of  interests, nevertheless, there can be a role also for the views  of trades, and for the various groups within society that have  contrasting interests. But many people fear the intertwining of  the MSZOSZ and MSZP in parliament because it offers an  opportunity for bad compromises behind the scene, just as in the  period of the party-state. Especially worrisome is the growing  influence of the trade unions in lagging industries, because it  could delay structural change.    [Nagy] Nobody is thinking of secret agreements. The point is  specifically that, through the economic and social pact, the  public can be initiated into the economy's real dilemmas and  able to understand also the background of moves made under the  pressure of necessity.    But this process also has its own psychology. The government  must begin to reveal the situation with moves that demonstrate  its own determination, such as putting an end to state  squandering, unnecessary offices, and other expenditures. I  realize that the resulting savings would be insignificant in  comparison with the shortage, but they would demonstrate that  the government is practicing what it preaches. The other urgent  state task is law enforcement, the already mentioned action  against the underground economy. If the government advances in  these areas, it will have moral authority to ask even for  further temporary belt-tightening, in view of the difficult  economic situation. Straightforward talk and the government's  new work method could liberate enormous energy. Under these  conditions the trade unions could be ready and willing to  conclude an honorable agreement.</p>

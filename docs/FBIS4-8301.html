			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- The time for the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the former governing  party, is irrevocably past and after the next elections the  Slovak political scene will resemble the classic European form,  Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac told CTK today.    He said a movement that combines left-wing, right-wing,  centrist and nationalist streams can only work when there is a  common aim. Such was the case of Civic Forum and Public Against  Violence whose unifying aim was getting rid of communism after  the Velvet Revolution of 1989. Another such unifying aim was  Slovak independence. Once these goals are achieved, the big  movements fall apart, he said.    "The aim now in Slovakia's prosperity and ideas on how to  achieve it differ. Differing views can be contained in a  coalition but not in a single party... that is the fate of the  HZDS," he said. "If a broad movement wants to go one way it  needs a very authoritarian and autocratic policy, concentrated  on the person of the leader. This is the path chosen by the  HZDS," Roman Kovac said, referring to HZDS chairman and former  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.    Kovac himself was former deputy prime minister and deputy  chairman of the HZDS before being expelled from the party for  what Meciar called "betrayal." He was later instrumental in  Meciar's downfall.    Kovac said he believed the creation of the current coalition  -- comprising the left, centrist groups of "dissidents" from the  HZDS and the right-leaning Christian Democrats -- will help  crystalline the political scene. After the September general  elections he expects the emergence of classic centrist, left and  right parties.    Referring to a recent poll conducted after the no-confidence  vote toppled the Meciar government but showing the HZDS was  still the most popular party with a quarter of the respondents  backing it, Kovac said "in Slovakia as in every other state  there is a group of radical citizens who long for an autocratic  style of government as a solution to problems. They vote  Vladimir Meciar. The HZDS bloc will definitely get into  parliament... but the time for broad movements is past," he told  CTK.    Assuming the HZDS gets into parliament but does not win an  absolute majority of seats, "it's hard to say whether the party  will manage to find a coalition partner," he said, adding Meciar  could only become premier again if there is a "very radical  change in his manner of thinking and governing."    He personally reckons the HZDS will get perhaps twenty per  cent of the September vote, the left wing a similar share and  the centrist formations will have to compete for the remainder.  Although Kovac's own party, the Alternative of Political Realism  (APR), as yet scarcely figures in opinion poll results, he  remains optimistic that there is room for a political center.    "We want to give voters the chance... to vote for a balanced  center with a liberal economic policy that pragmatically  respects social needs," he said. To this end, the APR, composed  of disaffected HZDS members, and the Alliance of Democrats (AD  SR), led by former foreign minister in the Meciar cabinet Milan  Knazko, are expected to merge later this month to form the  Slovak Democratic Union (DUS).</p>

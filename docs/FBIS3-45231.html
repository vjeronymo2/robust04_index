On the bilateral relations, Sharifo said, Eritrea and China  had shared good relations before its independence in May last  year, adding that the cooperation between the two countries has  been promoted since the independence of Eritrea.    He expressed the hope that the governments of the two  countries will continue to strengthen the cooperation and  Eritrea welcomes Chinese entrepreneurs to participate in  rehabilitating the economy in Eritrea.    Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said that  China treasures the good relations between the two countries and  is willing to strengthen various form of cooperation on the  basis of equality and mutual benefit.    On international situation, Qian Qichen said after the end  of  the Cold War, the world situation is relaxed on the whole, but  it is not all well. Various contradictions and conflicts are  continuing, and in particular, the developing countries are  facing many new difficulties and challenges. For them, the most  important task now is to safeguard their sovereignty and develop  their economies.    On the Somali issue, Sharifo briefed Qian Qichen on the  efforts Eritrea has made in seeking solutions to the Somali  problem.    He said the Somali problem should be solved by the Somali  people themselves. Meanwhile, the Organization of the African  Unity and other African countries should play an important role  in solving the Somali issue.    Qian Qichen hailed the efforts Eritrea has made in promoting  the peace process in Somalia. He also spoke highly of Eritrea's  policy of "peace, non-aligned and good neighborliness."    On the issue of Eritrea itself, Sharifo said his country is  facing a heavy task to revive and develop its economy that was  seriously destroyed by the 30-year-long war. He said that the  experience of success in China is very important to the  developing countries including Eritrea. He said Eritrea would  draw on the experience of China.    Qian Qichen said Eritrea is pursuing the policies of  national  unity and rapid restoration of the economy. He expressed his  conviction that Eritrea would be successful in rehabilitating  and developing its economy. As to China's experience, he said,  some may be suitable to Eritrea. Learning others experience  must be based on a country's actual conditions.</p>

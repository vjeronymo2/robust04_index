			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: MB-Caradon The sale of MB-Caradon's 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox has ended one stock market guessing game but started another about what it will do with the proceeds. MB-Caradon was always the more likely partner to sell out of the Franco-British packaging group, given its primary interests in building materials. By contrast, the French partner, CGIP, lives by managing such investments. It was quite happy to increase its holding by another 7 per cent, giving it 46 per cent of the voting rights and ending lingering bid speculation surrounding CarnaudMetalbox. MB-Caradon sold its holding at a 12 per cent discount to its notional market value. But that is normal for such a big placing. Besides, the price tag of Pounds 473m would have been beyond the company's wildest dreams two years ago. There was also the risk that a franc devaluation would have eroded its worth. The company seems inclined to sink the cash in the UK building materials sector. MB-Caradon could easily gear up for a Pounds 1bn acquisition or put together a string of smaller deals. But given the management's reputation for caution and fixation with branded products, there is no obvious candidate in sight. Other European economies are at different stages of the economic cycle and MB-Caradon may find a suitable target overseas, should nothing suitable emerge in the UK. It is a nice enough problem to worry about. MB-Caradon's results on Monday are likely to suggest it has few others.</p>

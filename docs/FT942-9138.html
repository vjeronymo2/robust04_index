			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese state gold purchases still lagging China's official gold purchase continued to falter in the first quarter in spite of increased output, according to the Gold Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. The bureau reported that output in the three months to March grew by 17 per cent compared with last year, but state acquisitions remained at last year's depressed levels, which were down 35 per cent on 1992. Gold producers are obliged to sell to the state, but in the past year or so have been funnelling gold into the black market at prices well above the state purchase price. The state increased its acquisition price last September to Yn2,986 (USDollars 343) a troy ounce, about 10 per cent below the world price.</p>

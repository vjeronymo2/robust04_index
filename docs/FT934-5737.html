			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Past and present woes combine to test Gaidar: John Lloyd follows the advocate of reform on the campaign trail to Vorkuta Mr Yegor Gaidar, fighting for the politics of reform against worsening polls for his Russia's Choice party, at the weekend met a Soviet nightmare - and one of his own. The first deputy premier, campaigning for national elections on December 12, arrived in the town of Vorkuta on Friday. Earlier in the week, he was mauled by industrialists struggling with his market reforms in the city of Ulyanovsk. 'At the beginning of the week we met the problems of the future,' said Mr Alexei Ulukayev, a Gaidar adviser. 'Now we meet the problems of the past.' It is a hideous past: the name of Vorkuta is a horror akin to Auschwitz. Created in the 1930s by the secret police, Vorkuta had two functions: to accommodate millions of political prisoners, and to mine in an area where few would voluntarily work. The Vorkuta-Pechora basin - rich in coal, oil, bauxite and precious metals - was opened up by convicts or zeks, who built it in conditions which froze them alive when they dropped from exhaustion. Nikita Khrushchev's liberation of the zeks in the mid-1950s meant the replacement of coercion by attraction - the attraction of high salaries. Miners' wages are now between Rbs200,000 and Rbs700,000 a month, at the top of Russian state wages. The bargain has been that a worker prepared to stay through winters where the temperature falls to -50 degrees, would get relatively rich. But the bargain is coming unstuck. Desperate for savings, the government has cut regional subsidies which maintained pensions and benefits at between one-third and one-half higher than in the rest of Russia. Mrs Marina Sokolova, a miners' widow, had a cut in her pension from Rbs66,000 to Rbs44,000 a month. 'I'm not used to living on that. We never had poor people here, but now we have. They stand in the doorways of shops, out of the cold, begging.' Since autumn, the government has also delayed paying the miners' wages - by up to three months. Vorkuta's 25,000 miners threatened to strike. The threat is taken seriously by the government - even though this is not the major coal-producing region of Russia and the miners are split. One pit has four competing unions. 'When the unions went on strike in 1989, (Soviet premier Nikolai) Ryzhkov fell,' says Mr Roman Siroziev, leader of the new independent union's strike committee. 'When they went on strike in 1989, Gorbachev fell. Judge for yourself.' This is hyperbole, but with a basis in fact. The miners were promoted as the proletarian vanguard in Soviet times, and their defection from communism and support for Mr Boris Yeltsin was of huge importance for the latter's presidency. They have been kept sweet since 1991 by big rises and by a freeze on pit closures - meaning that pit subsidies now account for the largest single expenditure in the budget. Their opposition during an election would be a huge blow. The Vorkuta men deny a political aim - in spite of gleeful headlines in the opposition press declaring that they had demanded Mr Yeltsin's resignation. 'We have never said this,' says Mr Murat Bugulov, a leader of the new independent union. 'We know the risk we run of helping the communists or Zhirinovsky (neo-fascists) coming to power. But the government must fulfil its responsibilities.' Vorkuta is among the most extreme examples of resistance to market economics. It produces for the state and is kept going by the state: any enterprise beyond a small trading company would flee from the huge extra costs of working in the Arctic. Mr Nikolai Pobov, a lawyer working for the miners' unions, says that 'the miners helped create Yeltsin and supported his reforms: now they find market reform is directly threatening their interests'. Mr Gaidar flew to this unpromising campaign opportunity through a snowstorm last Friday night to meet leaders of the miners and heads of the republic of Komi, where Vorkuta is situated. He came as a minister and as head of the special commission on coal - an unwelcome responsibility dumped on him by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - and not as a party leader. But in practice these roles are now inseparable. Late upon arrival, he was taken by bus to the biggest hall in town to take his seat as guest of honour at a gala show - in celebration of the first half century of the official existence of Vorkuta. It was an uncomfortable event: not in itself, for it was well staged and jolly, but for the echoes of the place's ghastly past which could not be suppressed. A singer from the border guards (a KGB division) gave a fine rendering of an awful song, 'Vorkuta is Vorkuta', which contained such sentiments as 'the frost is cold' and 'our history is a sad one' juxtaposed with 'but our hearts are warm' and 'we believe in our future'. It was the leitmotif of the evening. Mr Gaidar, in his obligatory speech, evoked the murderous past. But his ending was upbeat - Vorkuta had a future, the lesson was to remove the hopeless pits and enterprises and move to profitable production. He got mild applause. After his meetings with the miners on Saturday, Mr Gaidar claimed that he had 'reached mutual understanding on many points' - which seemed to be code for not reaching understanding on others. Mr Oleg Soskovets, another first deputy premier, told the Interfax agency at the weekend that Rbs77bn had been found to pay back wages - largely by squeezing back debts from the steel plants. On Saturday night, he flew on to Kuzbass - the larger coal basin in southern Siberia, in which strike threats have also been made and to which Vorkuta delegates have gone for support. A strike threat from last Wednesday still stands - and talks between the national miners' leaders and Mr Gaidar resume in Moscow today. A patched solution is the best bet. But the past, and present, nightmare of Vorkuta is not lightly exorcised. 'In the end,' says Mr Bugulov, 'they have to decide: do they want us to exist or not. That's what it comes to.'</p>

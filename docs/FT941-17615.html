			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Towards a better '94 - The new year is the time for making good resolutions. Bethan Hutton asks some financial advisers for theirs Once again it is the season of good, but often doomed, intentions. Giving up smoking or taking up regular exercise involves a great deal of effort and, as January progresses, resolve can slip. But the state of your personal finances could benefit from rather less stressful initiatives. We asked some independent financial advisers to suggest 10 personal financial resolutions for the new year. Make sure you are getting the best from your bank and building society accounts. Some societies have recently started to shift investors' money from obsolete accounts paying low interest rates into more up-to-date accounts, but many societies still expect you to find out for yourself if you could be getting a better return on your savings. 'Despite the recent initiatives from two major building societies, many old accounts are still paying less than 1.5 per cent gross,' warns David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services. Harris also reminds older savers to keep an eye out for the new income bond for the over 65s, promised in the Budget and due to be launched by National Savings in January. Finally, young and old alike should be taking full advantage of the tax-free saving opportunities of Tessa and save-as-you-earn accounts. Either make a will or ensure that your existing one is up to date. The contents of your will can easily be made inappropriate by changing circumstances. Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, says potential problems he has seen in clients' wills include named executors who are no longer in contact; children possibly inheriting hundreds of thousands of pounds at the age of 18; and no residuary provisions if a spouse fails to survive. See a lawyer if you think your will needs updating. Intestacy provisions have been revised recently to give the surviving spouse the first Pounds 125,000 of the estate if a spouse dies without a will, but it is still simpler and more tax-efficient to specify in a will who should get what. Sit on your pride and ask for a cheaper company car, says James Higgins, of Chamberlain De Broe. He points out: 'Company cars are now to be taxed as a benefit in kind according to list price. Be green and get a bike.' Maintain a healthy scepticism towards 'risk-free' and high-return investments that are too good to be true. Harris warns particularly of investment and savings products offering 'guaranteed' returns in excess of those available from 90-day building society accounts, and of salesmen promising magic solutions to your tax and financial planning needs in the run-up to the end of the tax year. Also, refuse to let yourself be bamboozled by jargon into investing in complicated schemes you do not understand. 'Never accept that any investment cannot be explained simply,' advises Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services. Buy bargains, not markets, says Higgins. He thinks most equity markets look expensive at the moment, but there are opportunities for value. 'Look for short-term anomalies (eg, investment trusts at discounts wider than their sector average) and move swiftly,' he adds. Smith feels many good reasons remain for buying equities, but says: 'Timing is always difficult, and salesmen are always at their most persuasive when the markets are high.' His solution is to make regular contributions over six to 12 months or longer, using unit or investment trust savings schemes, phased personal equity plans and equity-linked personal pensions, among other products. Harris adds a recommendation to retain a prudently balanced portfolio between equities, fixed interest and cash. He advises investors to be wary of playing 'follow the herd' and switching their entire portfolio into equities because interest rates have fallen. Resolve not to put off retirement planning any longer. 'Pensions remain the most tax-efficient form of long-term saving and security,' says Harris. He recommends maximising additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to occupational pension schemes, and contributions to personal pension plans. 'Remember, in general, it is more beneficial to pay lump sum single contributions than regular monthly contributions, as the administrative charges are lower.' There could still be good reasons to go for a pension transfer, in spite of recent negative publicity. 'If you have left an employment and have a deferred pension, there are a number of circumstances in which a transfer might make good sense,' says Smith. But Harris warns that you should be certain to get an independent opinion before making such a switch. Even if you already have pension arrangements in place, review them periodically. 'You might have another serious look at just how much you are going to need to be able to retire,' say Robert Noble-Warren and Keivan Borhani, of Murray Noble. 'With the state retreating from benefits in a number of areas - college funding, state earnings-related pension, and provision for long-term care - and the impact of lower interest rates and lower investment returns, individuals now need to have much more available to them at retirement than we have got used to.' Don't expect your financial adviser to do all the work for you - keep yourself informed, advises Smith. 'We have noted a heartening trend that many clients these days, especially those seeking fee-based advice, are much better informed.' He recommends keeping up to date by reading the FT and publications such as Money Management, Money Which? and Moneyfacts. 'While the trend seems to be to penalise faulty advisers hard and ensure (rightly) that they comply with the Financial Services Act, the best protection for the client is to know what he or she is talking about, and have demanding requirements.' Be a little European, suggests Higgins. The French government is planning to privatise about 20 state-owned companies over the next couple of years, and UK investors can apply for shares. 'As in the UK, it may be better to hold on rather than just stagging these issues,' he says. 'Only relatively small amounts will get in, so spread the applications around the family.' Several stockbrokers are offering a special service using French currency accounts to make it easier for you to apply for shares, while Mercury and Kleinwort are both launching trusts which will specialise in European privatisations. Consider paying off your mortgage. The returns could be better than keeping your money on deposit, now that tax relief on mortgage interest is being cut to 20 per cent. 'If you can't pay off the mortgage, at least switch to the best fixed rate you can find - fixed lending rates are unlikely to come down much more,' says Higgins. Try to make good use of your capital gains allowance, and other tax allowances where possible. This is something on which all the advisers agree, but Boyton cautions investors never to make an investment decision for tax reasons alone.</p>

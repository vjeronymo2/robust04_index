			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Astra Training row LABOUR yesterday claimed that the government secretly promised Pounds 4.8m to prevent the troubled Astra Training Services company collapsing before the last general election, Kevin Brown writes. Astra's 35 training centres are in the hands of the receivers. The company, formerly the Skills Training Agency, was privatised three years ago. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, released leaked government briefing papers which he claimed proved that the Employment Department agreed to underwrite 'unforeseen additional costs' incurred by Astra after privatisation. 'They show that Michael Howard (then employment secretary) secretly bailed out the company just before the general election,' he said. The department said parliament had been told that Pounds 4.82m was made available for Astra after privatisation, although only Pounds 1.3m had been handed over.</p>

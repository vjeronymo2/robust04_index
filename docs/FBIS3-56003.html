National Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, who took  part  in the discussions, said the session mainly centered around  economic cooperation and U.S. assistance to Russian reform,  including financing and closer contactes with the interantaional  financial organisations.    According to Lobov, Yeltsin spoke in detail about positive  shifts and stressed that a slackening of pace is out of the  question.    Bill Clinton said the United States is set to render maximum  support to Russian reform and said his country should extend  more active support to Russia in the social sphere.    Discussions are scheduled to resume on Friday morning after  the tripartite summit in which Yeltsin, Clinton and Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk will work towards "the historic  agreement to make the world a safer place with fewer nuclear  weapons". As Presdient Clinton put it on Thursday morning.    Later today, Clinton will join President Yeltsin for private  dinner in Novo-Ogarevo, the Russian president's dacha.</p>

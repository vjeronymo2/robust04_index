			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Buy-outs MFI's debt rescheduling and Tuesday's Pounds 108m deal for Devro will doubtless revive bitter-sweet memories of a bygone age. The furniture group's buy-out will probably go down as one of the worst-timed transactions of its kind; the Scottish sausage skin company's spin-off from Johnson and Johnson will be seen as a hopeful sign that the market may shortly splutter back into life. That is almost certainly an optimistic view. It is true that small deals involving funds of Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m are still being done. But the huge buy-outs which were such a feature of the late 1980s - MFI, Magnet, Isosceles - have all but dried up. The problem is not a shortage of equity, for there are funds aplenty eagerly seeking out opportunities to invest. The reason for the low level of activity is the newly-cautious attitude of the banks. As in other areas of lending, they have drawn in their horns, alarmed in this case by the dozen or so buy-outs which have gone into receivership in the last year (equivalent to 6 per cent of the total funds invested in buy-outs since records began). Whereas the average deal in the half year to December 1989 involved one part equity to six parts mezzanine finance and debt, the average ratio during the second half of last year was just one to two. Though none of the 20 most highly-leveraged bids of the 1980s has yet failed, there is every reason to applaud more conservative structures after the excesses of the recent past. But the irony is that - for buy-outs, at any rate - the pendulum has probably swung too far the other way.</p>

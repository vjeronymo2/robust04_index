			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / India sees spurt in investments India saw a sharp rise in foreign investment inflows in the five months to August, the finance ministry said yesterday. It estimated the inflow reached Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn), compared with Dollars 4.1bn in the financial year 1993-94. Direct investment rose to Dollars 381m in the five months, against Dollars 620m for 1993-94. Ministry officials said total foreign investment in 1994-95 might surpass last year's levels. The figures do not yet include any significant contributions from planned large-scale projects in power generation and oil refining which could start producing investment inflows in the next 12 months. 'The surge in foreign investment in recent times is one of the direct manifestations of the success of the economic reforms,' the ministry said in a mid-year review of the economy. The report paints a positive picture of the economic outlook, saying growth in 1994-95 is likely to exceed 5 per cent, 'much higher' than last year's 3.8 per cent. Agricultural output is good, industrial production is recovering, inflation is being controlled and exports continue to grow, though more slowly than last year.</p>

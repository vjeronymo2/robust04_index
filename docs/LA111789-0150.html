			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO PRESS FOR PROBE OF KILLINGS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said Thursday that it will ask the government of El  Salvador to investigate the murders of six Roman Catholic priests and two  civilian women, but officials said that they have no evidence that Salvadoran  government forces are responsible for the killings.  </P> <P> "We do not know who committed this barbarous act, which we condemn in the  strongest possible terms," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.  She added that the Administration is accelerating the delivery of military aid  to the Salvadoran army, which is battling a major offensive by Marxist  guerrillas in the capital of San Salvador.  </P> <P> A human rights group and Democrats in Congress said that they had received  credible reports that Salvadoran troops carried out the murders, in which six  Jesuit priests, a cook and her 15-year-old daughter were killed.  </P> <P> "At least one eyewitness saw uniformed armed men entering the Jesuit rectory  right before the murders," the human rights group, Americas Watch, said in a  letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  </P> <P> But Asst. Secretary of State Bernard Aronson, in a closed-door briefing for  members of Congress, said that the Administration has no information about the  murders, according to representatives who were present.  </P> <P> Several Democrats said they were angered by Aronson's account.  </P> <P> "He said he had no verification that they had even occurred," said California  Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez). "Yet he could verify every FMLN (rebel)  killing for the last 24 years." "He said there are lots of armed men in San  Salvador who wear uniforms, (and asked) 'how would we know who they were?' "  recalled another source who was present.  </P> <P> California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said that she asked Aronson  whether the Administration would stop U.S. military aid to El Salvador if it  were established that the army had carried out the murders.  </P> <P> "He said we shouldn't cut off the aid, but those people should be brought to  justice," she said. "My question is, when does a violation of human rights  become the government's responsibility?"  </P> <P> Aronson's office did not respond to a request for comment on the congressional  accounts.  </P> <P> Pelosi, Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) and 113 other members of Congress sent a  telegram to Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and to leaders of the  rebel's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front asking them to agree to a  cease-fire and to resume peace negotiations.  </P> <P> But Aronson told House members that the Administration does not favor a  cease-fire, because it would allow the rebels to resupply their troops,  according to several congressmen.  </P> <P> The Administration has requested $85 million in military aid and $285 million  in economic aid for El Salvador, which has been locked in civil war since 1980.  </P> <P> Members of Congress said that, despite the Democrats' complaints about the  Administration's position, there is little prospect of any reduction in aid.  </P> <P> "People aren't willing to take that step, partly because there's no sympathy  for the FMLN," said Pelosi.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said that U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker has been instructed to  press for a full investigation of the killings by Salvadoran authorities.  </P> <P> Salvadoran officials have investigated several major murders among thousands of  death-squad killings during the past decade, but few cases have resulted in  convictions.  </P></p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Boost for Maxwell pensioners TRUSTEES agreed yesterday to a mechanism that will release money to some of the Maxwell pensioners from the Common Investment Fund, in which pensioners' assets from the different companies in the empire were pooled. Law Debenture Trust Corporation, trustee to the Maxwell Communication pension plan, has been authorised to remove Pounds 460,000 from the CIF as the first of a number of with-drawals. The agreement does not affect some of the other Maxwell pension funds, which have contested claims to the money held in the CIF, at present valued at about Pounds 148m. The action represents a breakthrough in negotiations when the liquid assets available to the plan - known as the 'staff scheme' - were running out. It will free the scheme from having to draw on the government's emergency fund, created to help fill the Pounds 400m gap left by money taken from the Maxwell pension funds. Mr Patrick Harrex of Law Debenture confirmed that agreement in principle had been reached with the other Maxwell pension trustees to allow the staff scheme to withdraw money. About half of the initial amount will go to pensioners and the rest towards professional fees.</p>

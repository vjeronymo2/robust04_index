Mustapha's son, Datuk Amirkahar, who is former president of  USNO, Datuk Salim Bacho (former deputy president), Pitting Ali,  and Said Senang (former vice presidents), who had joined PBS  "temporarily" to contest in the recent state election, confirmed  they are staying on in the party. Another USNO vice-president  Ramli Wen and five former Supreme Council members also joined  the PBS with Mustapha.    Mustapha was welcomed into the PBS by its president Datuk  Sri  Joseph Pairin Kitingan, his once bitter political rival, at a  simple ceremony at Sri Gaya, Pairin's official residence. The  74-year-old founder of the deregistered USNO said he decided to  join the PBS because he was now convinced that only the PBS  could protect the interests and rights of the people in the  state. [passage omitted]    In January this year, Mustapha resigned from his federal  cabinet post and as an UMNO member, citing his deteriorating  health and failure to unite the people under UMNO. The veteran  politician's decision to join the PBS did not come as a surprise  as he had thrown his weight behind the party in the recently  concluded State election. [passage omitted]</p>

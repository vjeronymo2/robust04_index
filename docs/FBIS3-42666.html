Even the boldest classifications of world markets  by Western institutional investors did not view Russia as a  high-risk but potentially high-return financial market,  preferring to just pass it over in silence. However, it appears  that the incredible has happened: A large American finance  company, Pioneer Group, Inc., yesterday announced its intention  to invest on a large scale in the stock of enterprises from  Russia and the CIS; the volume of such investment at the first  stage will come to $3 million, and is expected to grow by  another $100 million. This is the first case in which  specifically institutional foreign investment in Russia has been  organized.    Pioneer Group is one of the large American finance  companies,  which manages a family of "mutual" funds in the United States,  Poland, India, and a number of other countries. The decision of  the Pioneer Group to establish a mutual fund solely to invest in  the Russian market represents the first case of an institutional  approach to organizing capital investment in the Russian  economy. It was no accident that the announcement of the Pioneer  Group concerning the creation of the "Russian" mutual fund was  timed to coincide with Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow. The  important political aspect of the institutionalization of  American investment was stressed in this manner.    In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, two considerations at  once compel a serious attitude towards the intention of the  Pioneer Group to be the first American mutual fund to make money  on the Russian stock exchange. First, the Pioneer Group has  succeeded in winning considerable support from two influential  Russian organizations--the Institute of Economics of the  Transitional Period and the Association of Privatized and  Private Enterprises. Both organizations have acted as founders  of a Russian finance company established with the majority  participation of the Pioneer Group. This company will manage  financial resources raised by Pioneer in the United States and  earmarked for investment in the Russian market.    Second, the Pioneer Group has the currently unique favorable  experience of effectively managing financial resources in East  European finance markets. Three years ago, this company  established the first mutual fund in Poland, which within a very  short period of time became the main institutional player in the  financial market of that country, and introduced quite a number  of financial techniques in the Polish market that were new to  Poland (in particular, standards of professional investment  analysis). In Poland, Pioneer also started out with $3 million;  as of today, the amount of assets of the Polish fund exceeds  $400 million.    The well-known international company Ernst and Young has  been  selected to be the main financial consultant and manager of the  Pioneer project in Russia. According to an official Pioneer  press release, this company was selected because its specialists  have considerable experience and knowledge of the Russian  market. In addition, Ernst and Young has an extensive  international network.    KOMMERSANT experts note that the fact that mutual funds are  organizing investment in the Russian economy may, in and of  itself, serve as a reliable external indicator of a change in  the quality of the Russian financial market. As the president of  the Pioneer Group, John Cogan (John Cogan [name rendered in  English in parentheses]), stated in yesterday's official press  release, his experts have been following the evolution of the  financial market of Russia for a long time. In Mr. Cogan's  opinion, the current stage of development of privatization and  structural changes in Russia's economy provide unique investment  opportunities "for experienced investors" in the coming decade.    KOMMERSANT experts believe that the appearance of a  professional American mutual fund in the Russian market will put  Russian check funds into a serious competitive situation,  especially with regard to a dialogue with privatized enterprises  and organization of their effective transition to market  conditions for economic operations. Besides, participation of a  sizable amount of capital from Pioneer in operations on the  stock and state securities market may influence the liquidity of  these markets very beneficially.    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Pioneer Group--the First Foreign Mutual Fund in Poland </H5>   Based on 1993 performance, operations of the Pioneer Polish  fund turned out to be the third most profitable within the  general structure of operations of the Pioneer family of mutual  funds. Polish observers maintain that the presence of a powerful  foreign institutional player became one of the reasons for the  creation of a liquid market on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It is  essential that the Pioneer Polish fund uses for its operations  not only American investment but also contributions from Polish  citizens by extensively distributing its stock in Poland. [End  boxed item]    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Investment Preferences of the Pioneer Group </H5>   In the United States alone, Pioneer manages an entire  "family" of mutual funds, of which Pioneer Bond, Pioneer Capital  Growth, Pioneer Equity-Income, and Pioneer 1, 2, and 3 are the  largest. Pioneer also manages funds in Poland, India, Taiwan,  and a number of other countries. In its press release, Pioneer  announced its intention to concentrate on the stock of  privatized Russian enterprises. However, the investment strategy  of Pioneer will be defined more clearly at the official  presentation of the fund on 19 January.    [End boxed item]</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): 'Now look for yield rather than capital gain' - Investing offshore, bond funds / Anyone who invested three or four years ago has been rewarded. But the climate is changing Since they can receive the income gross, UK resident non-taxpayers derive the clearest advantage from offshore bond funds. Unlike banks and building societies, onshore bond funds have to pay the income net of basic-rate tax, which means that UK resident non-taxpayers have to go through the rigmarole of reclaiming tax back from the Inland Revenue. (From the beginning of the 1994-95 tax year, however, UK-based bond funds will be able to pay income gross to non-UK residents.) Even resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may find offshore bond funds attractive, because of the potential for delaying payment of the final tax bill. Anyone who invested in bonds three or four years ago, in anticipation of declining interest rates, will have locked into relatively high fixed rates and enjoyed the additional bonus of strong capital performance. The tables list the performance of offshore sterling fixed-interest funds. The figures may, at first glance, look surprisingly high. This is because they are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis, instead of offer-to-bid as is usually the case. Some offshore funds have a bid-offer spread (as in the UK), while others have a single price but add on an initial charge. If all the funds were quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. However, the effect of quoting on an offer-to-offer basis is that the performance figures are inflated; and the returns which would actually have been achieved by an investor will have been lower. Many of the funds invest in sterling-denominated Eurobonds - bonds issued outside the domestic market of the issuer. Barclays Sterling bond fund, which heads the three-year table and is managed by BZW, the securities arm of Barclays, has a 70 per cent holding in Eurosterling issues, with the rest invested in gilts. The fund also has the highest yield of those listed, but Anita Higgins, fund manager, warns that the yield may be cut back a little in the future. 'Over the last year the fund has had high-yielding bonds, but we will not maintain income at the expense of capital; so if the gilt market levels out over the next couple of years, we may cut the income a bit.' The other fund with a noticeably high yield is John Govett's GSI UK High Income fund. Some 75 per cent of its holdings are in UK Eurosterling bonds, most of which are 10-year bonds. About 25 per cent is held outside the UK in Italian government bonds, high-yielding Mexican paper and Swedish bonds, the last in expectation of falls in Swedish interest rates. The two funds which top the one-year table are both from the same stable - Guinness Flight - but are very different in character. The Accumulation Sterling High Yield bond fund is a roll-up fund (see opposite page), aimed primarily at investors wishing to delay their tax bill until they fall into a lower-rate band. The much larger Global Strategy Gilt and Sterling bond fund is a distributor fund, which pays out income quarterly. Can investors looking to gains as well as income expect the same performance in the next few years as in the past? Peter Jones, director of Hill Samuel Investment Management, believes that the best performance is now over, and that investors should concentrate on yield rather than capital gain. 'At the beginning of 1991 longer dated gilts were yielding 10.25 per cent but are now down to 6.5 per cent. This size of fall in yields is very unlikely to be repeated. A second element of performance has been the narrowing of the premium which non-government sterling bonds had over gilt yields. These yield spreads have roughly halved over the same period. Again, this is unlikely to be repeated.' Simon Osborne, fund manager of the Govett UK High Income fund, sees scope for capital gains in some areas, such as Sweden and Italy, but agrees that in general the UK cannot deliver the same level of returns. Many investors may be concerned about the security of investing in a bond fund that is situated offshore. Some offshore funds, which appear at the back of the FT in the Managed Funds section, do so under the heading 'SIB-recognised'. This means that the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's main financial services regulator, has accepted that regulation in that centre is of an equivalent standard to that in the UK. The tables list only those funds which are SIB-recognised. Charges tend to be similar to onshore bond funds. The Guinness Flight funds have an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual 0.75 per cent annual. Govett also has a 5 per cent initial charge, but the annual fee is 1 per cent. The initial charge on the Hill Samuel and Barclays funds are lower at 3.5 per cent, and the annual fees are 0.875 per cent and 0.85 per cent respectively. Investors should note that, unlike onshore funds, where the standard practice is to deduct the annual fee against income, offshore funds are allowed to charge the fee against capital. Both Barclays and John Govett implement the latter practice, allowing them to deliver a higher yield than would otherwise be possible. However, investors who fear capital erosion as a result, should note carefully their chosen fund's practice before making an investment. Last days of the bond bull market?

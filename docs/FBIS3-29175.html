Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a  statement that the Japanese Government welcomes the fact that  Ayala Lasso officially assumed the post Monday, with the  approval of the UN General Assembly.    Japan has supported the creation of such a post since it was  first discussed at the World Conference on Human Rights in  Vienna last June, Terada said.    He said the Japanese Government will actively support the UN  High Commissioner for Human Rights so he could fulfil his  important role to promote respect for human rights in the world.    UN General Secretary [General] Butrus Butrus-Ghali on  February 1 named Ayala Lasso to become the first UN High  Commissioner for Human Rights, for a four-year term.</p>

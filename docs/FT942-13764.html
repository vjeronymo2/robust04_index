			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Kiev in stand over Chernobyl: International News Digest Ukraine is refusing to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Mr Valery Shmarov, deputy prime minister, told a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna yesterday. Dismissing suggestions by the agency and western governments that the plant was unsafe, Mr Shmarov insisted Ukraine would keep the plant going even after five other nuclear reactors now under construction were commissioned. Ukrainian officials say their country cannot afford to buy oil, gas or coal, and that 15 per cent of the government's annual budget has gone towards cleaning up the contamination from Chernobyl since the 1986 accident, when one of its reactors exploded and released a cloud of radioactive dust into the atmosphere and Europe. Officials discussed the findings of an IAEA team's inspection of Chernobyl at the beginning of March during which several safety deficiencies were detected at the plant's two reactors, both of which were due to be decommissioned this year. Ukraine's hard line at the two-day meeting called by the IAEA to try to find a solution to the Chernobyl problem effectively leaves western governments without an alternative. The plan had been to offer western help in completing other reactors in exchange for closing down Chernobyl.</p>

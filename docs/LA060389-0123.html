			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MABEL BECKMAN, NOTED PHILANTHROPIST, DIES AT 88  </P> <P> Mabel Beckman, wife of Arnold O. Beckman, an inventor and entrepreneur who made  a fortune developing and marketing scientific instruments, died early Thursday  at her home in Corona del Mar. She was 88.  </P> <P> She had been repeatedly hospitalized for cancer at Hoag Hospital in Newport  Beach over the past two weeks, according to friends and hospital officials.  </P> <P> During 64 years of marriage, the Beckmans were nearly inseparable. About 10  years ago they formed a foundation to direct their philanthropy in support of  scientific and medical research at hospitals and universities.  </P> <P> Publicly disclosed gifts from the Arnold O. and Mabel M. Beckman Foundation  total more than $100 million.  </P> <P> Among the gifts were $20 million for the construction and endowment of the  western headquarters and study center of the National Academies of Sciences and  Engineering in Irvine, more than $6 million to the Beckman Laser Institute on  the campus of the UC Irvine College of Medicine, $40 million to establish a  research center at Caltech and $2 million toward development of the Hoag Cancer  Center at Hoag Hospital.  </P> <P> Friends of the couple said Arnold Beckman always relied upon his wife for  advice in deciding which projects deserved support. He has said their goal was  to distribute their personal fortune, once estimated to be in excess of $500  million, before their deaths.  </P> <P> Much of the money was realized from the sale in 1981 of Fullerton-based Beckman  Instruments Inc., which Beckman founded in 1935, to SmithKline Corp. of  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> At Husband's Side  </P> <P> Michael Berns, director of the Beckman Laser Institute and professor of surgery  and cell biology at the UCI Medical School where he fills the Arnold and Mabel  Beckman chair, said Mabel Beckman always showed up at her husband's side when  the institute held meetings for members of the community who were interested in  its work.  </P> <P> Michael Stevens, president of Hoag Hospital, said: "Mabel Beckman was a very  delightful person. I personally was very fond of her and will miss her." He  said that when he informed members of the Hoag board of directors of her death,  they remarked on the closeness of the Beckmans' marriage. "Despite his (Dr.  Beckman's) eminence in the scientific community, they had a very down-to-earth,  loving relationship," Stevens said.  </P> <P> Friends said Arnold Beckman likes to recount how he met his wife in 1918 when  he was an 18-year-old Marine whose train arrived late to New York, causing him  to miss a ship that had already set sail. Stranded in the city for  Thanksgiving, he went to a dinner hosted by the Red Cross. One of the Red Cross  volunteers whom he met at the dinner was Mabel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Employees Notified  </P> <P> Elke Eastman, a spokeswoman for Beckman Instruments, said the company Thursday  notified its employees throughout the world of Mabel Beckman's death because  "Mrs. Beckman was a part of the company since its beginnings in 1935."  </P> <P> Eastman said Arnold Beckman told her it was his wife's wish that no flowers be  sent. She said he suggested that instead donations could be made to the Hoag  Cancer Center. Details about funeral arrangements were not disclosed. Only  family members will be invited to attend, Eastman said.  </P> <P> Besides her husband, Mabel Beckman is survived by a daughter, Patricia, and a  son, Arnold O. Beckman Jr., as well as grandchildren and great grandchildren.  </P></p>

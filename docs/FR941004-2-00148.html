To create the Index, a portfolio of equity securities will be established by the issuer representing an investment of a specified dollar amount in each component security (rounded to the nearest whole share). The value of the Index will equal the current market value of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the component securities divided by the current Index divisor. The Index divisor will initially be set to provide a benchmark value of 100.00 at the close of trading on the day preceding the establishment of the Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of shares of each component stock in the Index will remain fixed except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend (other than an ordinary cash dividend), a stock distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component securities. The number of shares of each component security may also be adjusted, if necessary, in the event of a merger, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation of an issuer or in certain other events such as the distribution of property by an issuer to stockholders. Shares of a component security may be replaced (or supplemented) with other securities under certain circumstances, such as the conversion of a component stock into another class of security, the termination of a depositary receipt program, or the spin-off of a subsidiary. If the security remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure continuity of the value of the Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The issuer will not attempt to find a replacement stock or compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy or a similar event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

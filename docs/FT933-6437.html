			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional redundancy costs leave Weir down 10% at Pounds 16.7m WEIR GROUP, the engineering company with about 60 per cent of its sales overseas, reported a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to July 2. The decline from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 16.7m was after an exceptional item of Pounds 2.43m covering redundancy and reorganisation costs. Operating profit rose to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 14.6m). All but Pounds 400,000 of the exceptional charge related to severance pay for the loss of 200 employees, reducing the workforce to 6,700. The scale of the job cuts surprised analysts. The group said there were unlikely to be further reductions in the second half. Turnover rose to Pounds 223.5m (Pounds 194.8m.) Earnings fell to 7.4p (8.2p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.925p (1.75p). Lord Weir, chairman, said the company had a flat half, but was confident that orders would pick up in the UK. The level of inquiries remained encouraging, although a fall in spare part orders and bookings would affect the second half. The outlook on the Continent was worse than expected. 'The cut in prices has more than swallowed up our exporting advantage since the UK left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism last year.' The period ended with Pounds 67m net cash, against Pounds 52m at the end of 1992. Lord Weir said he was pleased with the recent acquisition of Darchem, and the group was looking at further acquisitions. COMMENT For a company as predictable as Weir, its announcement of a Pounds 2.4m redundancy and reorganisation charge took the market by surprise. But the lay-off of 200 employees appears to have more to do with productivity gains than a serious downturn in the group's markets. The built-in strength of long-term contracts has enabled the group to largely buck the recession which has affected many of its competitors. The profit fall is disappointing, but was mainly because of the exceptional charge. It would also be unfair to forget that last year's performance was particularly good even by Weir's standards. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 37.5m the shares - down 30p to 318p - are fairly priced on a prospective multiple of 19.</p>

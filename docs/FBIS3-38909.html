The source added that Joe  Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in  Cyprus, is expected in Cyprus on Saturday [12 February]  accompanied by a group of UN experts. The same source clarified  that it is not the same group of experts who visited Cyprus  earlier and prepared reports on the fenced-off area of Famagusta  and the Nicosia International Airport.    Referring to the UN secretary general's two-month deadline  for the Nicosia-New York talks to conclude, government spokesman  Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the government believes this is the  maximum period that should be allocated, adding: Discussion on  the substance of the Cyprus issue should begin immediately  afterward.    The spokesman said that negotiations are now being held with  the UN secretary general's representatives to prepare a list of  points described as key positions--the answers to questions such  as how the Nicosia Airport will operate and how the fenced-off  area of Famagusta will be opened up. Kasoulidhis added that  this list will remain open until late next week for suggestions  to be added by both sides.    Answering another question, the spokesman said the National  Council members will have the opportunity to express their  positions on the points in the list before it is finalized.</p>

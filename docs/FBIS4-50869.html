			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang said Saturday [21 May] that Taiwan's indirect trade  volume with Mainland China is helping to offset its trade  deficit with Japan.    Chiang made the remarks Saturday while speaking on  challenges  to Taiwan's economy at Chinese television system headquarters.  The speech was sponsored by GLOBAL VIEWS MONTHLY.    Chiang said that in 1993, Taiwan's indirect exports to  Mainland China via Hong Kong reached U.S.$12 billion, almost  offsetting its US$14.2 billion trade deficit with Japan.    He said the mainland market has become increasingly  important  to Taiwan despite the fact that Beijing is trying to isolate  Taiwan internationally, and added that cross-strait economic and  trade activities would be complementary except for Beijing's  policies.    Chiang said that although Taiwan can be proud of its past  economic achievements, it needs to focus on future development,  which he said it can do by improving the environment for  production technology.    He said Taiwan is experiencing a great change in its  economic  development that can be seen in the drastic trade surplus  decrease, the shift in export markets from Europe and America to  Asia, and the remarkable increase in exports to developing  countries.    For example, he said, Taiwan had a trade surplus of  U.S.$18.7  billion in 1987, U.S.$16 billion of that with the United States.  By 1993, he said, the trade surplus had declined to U.S.$7.8  billion, of which U.S.$6.8 billion was with the United States.  He estimated that this year's trade surplus will drop to U.S.$3  billion.    Moreover, he noted, rising wages and labor costs,  land-acquisition problems, the government's financial burden,  and environmental protection disputes are making it hard for  industries to survive.    Chiang said Taiwan needs to upgrade technology and  industrial  levels, as well as produce goods of higher added value and  actively seek to join international economic organizations in  order to ensure its continued economic development.</p>

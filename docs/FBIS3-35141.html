The U.S. support  was evident in U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  warning message to Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and in another  message from Christopher to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar'.    MENA today cited a responsible source at the U.S. State  Department as saying that the U.S. secretary of state has sent  an urgent message to Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul, informing  him that Israel may carry out a large attack against south  Lebanon.</p>

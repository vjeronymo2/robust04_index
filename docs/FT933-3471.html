			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Hain urges move to radicalism LABOUR'S INTERNAL divisions will surface again today, with a pamphlet calling for the adoption of a Pounds 20bn investment programme and other radical policies, and making a vigorous attack on the party's 'modernisers'. The analysis by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath and secretary of the Tribune group of MPs, argues that to win the next election, Labour must 'celebrate socialist values'. This differs with other analyses, which have suggested that the party's defeat in last year's election came partly because it was still seen as not 'moderate' enough.</p>

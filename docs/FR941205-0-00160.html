			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 266.505 lists certain requirements that must be included in the regulatory agreement that is executed by the HFA and the project owner. Those requirements are necessary to assure that the owner will maintain the sound financial and physical condition of the project, and maintain the project as an affordable housing resource. Section 266.510 describes the responsibilities of the HFA for annual project inspections, review of an owner's compliance with the affirmative fair housing marketing plan, and analysis of the owner's annual audit and recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G_Contract Rights and Obligations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G contains provisions with regard to the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) in &sect;&sect;266.600&hyph;266.608. In accordance with section 542(c)(3), the rule provides for a ``sliding scale'' of MIP payments, with reduced amounts payable in inverse proportion to the increase in an HFA's risk apportionment. Risk apportionment percentages range from 10 to 90 percent. At the high end, an HFA assuming 90 percent of the risk would be required to pay a .05 percent MIP based upon the average outstanding principal balance (without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments) per annum. At the other end of the spectrum, an HFA assuming 10 percent of the risk would be required to pay a .45 percent MIP based upon the average outstanding principal balance per annum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart G also contains provisions on insurance endorsement and assignments. Endorsement of the original credit instrument will indicate the Commissioner's insurance of the mortgage. Section 542(c)(2)(B) of the 1992 Act provides for full mortgage insurance for loans originated by or through qualified HFAs. While this provision clearly permits qualified HFAs to underwrite loans for other HFAs or mortgage entities or to sell their loans in the secondary market, the Department discussed this option with HFA representatives with particular concern about how the HFA would maintain its risk-sharing obligation in such transactions. In view of the complexities of implementing this aspect of the statute and the desire to implement the pilot program in a timely manner, it was agreed between the HFAs and HUD that entities other than approved HFAs would not be permitted to be mortgagees originating loans to be insured under this program. The one exception was with respect to the transfer of partial interest under a participation agreement. Section 266.616 permits the transfer of up to 100 percent of the beneficial interest in a loan or a pool of loans insured under part 266, provided that, among other things, the HFA remains the mortgagee of record and is the party with whom the Commissioner deals under the contract of mortgage insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 266.620 describes the circumstances under which the contract of insurance will terminate. These are (1) payment in full of the mortgage; (2) acquisition of the mortgaged property by the HFA and notification to the Commissioner that no claim for insurance benefits will be made; (3) acquisition of the property at a foreclosure sale by a party other than the HFA; (4) notification by the HFA to the Commissioner of voluntary termination; (5) a finding of fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the HFA or its successors with respect to the contract of insurance; or (6) receipt by the Commissioner of an application for final claims settlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The latter part of subpart G describes the procedures for filing a claim upon a default, determining the amount of the claim, and payment of the claim. Section 266.630 describes the requirements for filing for a partial payment of a claim. This section is intended to avoid full insurance claim payments by providing the HFA with flexibility to deal with a nonperforming mortgage where the default is due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and the financial relief provided by the HFA is sufficient to restore the financial viability of the project. When the conditions of this section are met, an HFA may reduce the unpaid principal balance of the insured mortgage by up to 50 percent and may defer delinquent interest. The HFA must secure the mortgagor's repayment of this relief with a second mortgage, which can have deferred amortization thereby allowing the mortgagor to repay the second mortgage in increasingly larger amounts as the project's cash flow improves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

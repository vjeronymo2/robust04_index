			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / No early move on sanctions The United Nations Security Council is not planning any quick move to end its economic sanctions against Haiti, despite a promise in the agreement negotiated with the military junta last Sunday that the embargo would be 'lifted without delay in accordance with relevant UN resolutions'. A senior US official said 'there is not a sentiment in the United Nations at this point for lifting the UN sanctions,' particularly as previous Security Council resolutions say clearly the embargo is not to be lifted until ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is restored to power. But officials added that they had already begun discussions at the UN on how and when the sanctions might be lifted. It was possible, they said, that some measures such as the oil embargo and the ban on travel to and from Haiti could be lifted before Mr Aristide's return to the country. Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said that discussions on easing the embargo were 'on a somewhat different time line' because the deal negotiated with Gen Raoul Cedras on Sunday does not require him and his colleagues to step down until October 15, unless the Haitian parliament passes a general amnesty before then. An arms embargo is not expected to be lifted. Targeted sanctions freezing the US assets of Gen Cedras and a number of other prominent backers of the military regime remain in place, Mr McCurry said. Their status will be evaluated as necessary. The sanctions' main impact has been on the already impoverished Haitian people, while the military junta and its wealthy supporters have until recently been able to shake off its worst effects with weekend shopping trips to Miami. The Inter-American Development Bank said yesterday it would move swiftly to resume operations in Haiti once the country's political crisis was settled, Reuter reports.</p>

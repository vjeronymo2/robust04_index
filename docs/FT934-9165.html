			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Sri Lanka soars on strong foreign buying The Sri Lankan equity market has showed an impressive rise over the last week as foreign investors have become even more active. The market's rally began in May, coincidentally around the time of the assassination of the president, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, and as neighbouring markets, such as Pakistan, were also showing signs of coming out of the doldrums. Since then the Colombo all-share index has climbed by more than 60 per cent and, as measured by the IFC, the market has gained nearly the same amount in dollar terms over the year to date. Foreign investors dominate equity trading, accounting for between 40 and 60 per cent of daily average turnover, and renewed interest in the country has been sparked in the last week following a conference of overseas insti-tutions held on the island. According to Susan Murphy, a member of Smith New Court's emerging markets team based in London, confidence in the market was helped by the peaceful transition of political power following the president's assassination. However, she comments, the flow of funds from overseas was beginning to increase around this period in any case.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Dollar terms                      No. of         Nov 5     % Change     % Change Market               stocks          1993     over week   on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)         775.32        -5.6         +33.6 Brazil                (44)         213.52        +2.1         +70.8 Chile                 (20)         458.92        -1.4          +9.7 Colombia1              (8)         517.97        +0.5         +21.8 Mexico                (58)         765.41        -2.0         +13.2 Peru2                  (7)         110.96        -6.5         +11.0 Venezuela3             (8)         568.92        -5.8          +9.5 East Asia South Korea4         (130)         104.88        +6.2          +6.8 Philippines           (11)         239.43        +1.9         +79.3 Taiwan, China5        (76)          87.90        +4.3         +19.1 South Asia India6                (61)          90.80        +0.4          -3.1 Indonesia7            (31)         103.40        +5.8         +76.2 Malaysia              (61)         272.16        -0.8         +66.4 Pakistan8              (8)         275.49        +2.6         +37.6 Sri Lanka9             (5)         155.09        +4.5         +55.1 Thailand              (52)         370.15        +2.7         +60.7 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)         217.70        -3.1         +11.5 Jordan                 (5)         164.34        -0.7         +40.7 Portugal              (16)         110.20        +0.4         +42.9 Turkey10              (31)         174.71        +1 5        +161.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Local currency terms                      No. of         Nov 5     % Change     % Change Market               stocks          1993     over week   on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)     475,759.68        -5.6         +33.9 Brazil                (44)  53,822,938.05        +8.5      +2,480.9 Chile                 (20)         756.73        -1.5         +18.0 Colombia1              (8)         749.51        +0.2         +22.6 Mexico                (58)       1,027.13        -2.0         +13.1 Peru2                  (7)         146.59        -6.1         +46.6 Venezuela3             (8)       1,299.88        -5.2         +39.2 East Asia South Korea4         (130)         111.27        +5.9          +9.4 Philippines           (11)         334.85        +1.9        +107.1 Taiwan, China5        (76)          87.32        +3.8         +25.2 South Asia India6                (61)         100.41        +0.4          +5.2 Indonesia7            (31)         118.04        +5.8         +79.5 Malaysia              (61)         256.97        -0.8         +62.9 Pakistan8              (8)         374.08        +2.6         +61.4 Sri Lanka9             (5)         166.22        +4.5         +66.2 Thailand              (52)         372.42        +2.7         +59.7 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)         357.46        -2.4         +25.5 Jordan                 (5)         235.64        -0.7         +42.1 Portugal              (16)         131.70        +0.5         +68.9 Turkey10              (31)       1,063.81        +1.9        +296.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

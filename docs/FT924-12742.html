			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / TUC aims to keep up the pressure: Unions set u group to co-ordinate opposition THE Trades Union Congress hopes to keep up the pressure on the government by assembling the broadest possible coalition against the planned pit closures. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, hopes to meet Tory MPs and Anglican bishops, and the TUC's parliamentary lobbying effort - established to combat the next Employment Bill - will be in full swing. Yesterday a demonstration in Cheltenham against the closures attracted the support of 3,000 people including many prominent Conservatives and Socialist Workers party supporters. Mr Tony Hilder, an executive member of the rightwing Freedom Association, marched alongside Mr Quentin Tallon, chairman of the Cheltenham Trades Union Council. Mr John Monks, the deputy general secretary of the TUC, said last night: 'There is a mood similar to 1979, the feeling that a particular approach to running the economy has failed and that we need a change.' The TUC has set up a 10-strong committee to guide the campaign against pit closures and unemployment in general, and has started a fighting fund with a donation of Pounds 50,000. Some of that will probably be used for newspaper advertisements. A new issue in the campaign could be the future of British Coal's Pounds 1bn-plus pension fund surplus. TUC officials say they fear that the government may try to divert some of the surplus to cover the costs of redundancy payments. An attempt will also be made today to involve the European Commission when Mr Roger Lyons, chairman of the TUC's energy committee, meets EC energy officials to discuss whether the UK electricity generators have breached European competition policy. Meanwhile, in London, unions representing workers in the nuclear power industry are expected to express their solidarity with the miners. After a lobby of parliament and demonstrations led by the mining unions on Wednesday, the TUC is hoping that at least 100,000 people will attend a rally in Trafalgar Square the following Sunday. Civil Service union leaders are planning to write directly to all their members encouraging them to attend. Two tonnes of coal were yesterday dumped outside Mr Michael Heseltine's country home near Banbury, Oxfordhsire, by miners, blocking the drive. Police said the miners could face charges of criminal damage if the gate was damaged.</p>

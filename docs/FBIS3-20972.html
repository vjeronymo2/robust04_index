			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Energy Aggregate-Ion Beams </F> Obtained at IPN [Nuclear Physics Institute]"]    [Text] Paris--Aggregate beams consisting of three to four  high-energy electrically-charged atoms were obtained recently by  an IPN team at Orsay. These results, according to the IN2P3  (National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics of the CNRS  [National Center for Scientific Research]), "give France a  definite lead in this field."    Using a gold source and the Tandem electrostatic  accelerator,  the IPN team headed by Serge Della Negra succeeded in producing  aggregate beams consisting of three to four atoms, each carrying  one positive charge (Au[.sup]+++[/] and Au[.sup]++++[/]  aggregate ions) and having an energy of 10 million electronvolts  [MeV].    Aggregates are assemblies of weakly-bonded atoms (from just  a  few to a few hundreds) that constitute a special state of  matter, the structure and behavior are somewhat similar to those  of atomic nuclei. Their chemical reactivity and selectivity make  them useful intermediates in catalysis, optics, and electronics.  Thus, since the eighties, many laboratories throughout the world  have been studying them.    More particularly, aggregates are increasingly considered as  a replacement for single-atom ions, to bombard solids.  Increasing the projectile mass also increases the energy  deposited on the bombarded area. Bombarding small areas (of the  order of 100 square angstroms) with single-atom ions would  require currents of several mega-amperes, but it can be done  with heavy polyatomic ions (heavier than iron).    The idea of producing at the IPN aggregate beams with  energies of several MeV was formed several years ago; two years  ago, it became possible to start the project (Orion-Tandem  project) with financial support from the IN2P3, the CNRS and the  DRET (Directorate of Research and Technical Studies) of the DGA  (General Delegation for Weapons).    The method used at the IPN consists in placing a source of  metallic aggregates and its beam-directing line at the center of  the accelerator and subjecting them to a 10 megavolt potential.  The positive aggregate ions thus created and pre-accelerated to  60 kV are injected onto the accelerator axis and further  accelerated to 10 MeV per charge.    At the start, researchers faced two questions: Would the  aggregates withstand the acceleration, and collisions with the  residual gas during acceleration until they reached the  experimental site, 20 meters farther? Experiments performed last  year with carbon molecular ions (C60 and C70 fullerenes) made it  possible to answer this question in the affirmative. Apart from  that, would the electronic setup withstand the 10-15 MeV  breakdowns that may occur within the accelerator? That is the  problem that the IPN solved in November.    These experiments also enabled the researchers to observe  very important non-linear effects (coherent effects much higher  than the sum of the effects of individual constituents) and to  observe the transmission of shock waves in matter to a distance  of 0.2 micron and over. They are currently studying the  alterations of the solid after impact.    According to researchers, these results open new prospects:  "Energies of the order of one gigaelectronvolts could be reached  with other sources, multicharged molecular ions (with masses of  100,000 and 100 positive charges) for instance, and transferred  under a very small volume during a single collision and in  10[.sup]-13[/] seconds."</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> STRIKES HALT BRITISH RAILS, LIBRARIES  </P> <P> Nationwide strikes by hundreds of thousands of employees today shut down the  train system, the London subway, 37 ports and city libraries and day-care  centers.  </P> <P> The stoppages are part of a wave of union militancy confronting Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government as it tries to halt inflation  topping 8%. The rail and subway strike is the fifth joint 24-hour stoppage in  five weeks.  </P> <P> Hopes were raised Monday that the rail strike could be averted when a second  British Rail union accepted an 8.8% wage increase. However, the third and  biggest union, the National Union of Railwaymen, rejected it late Monday night,  holding out for a 10% raise for its 75,000 members.  </P></p>

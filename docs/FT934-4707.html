			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Rescue talk triggers Euro Disney share rise Shares in Euro Disney, the struggling leisure group, rose 12 per cent yesterday on speculation about the progress of negotiations over the company's emergency financial restructuring. They closed FFr4.20 higher at FFr36.45. The rise was triggered by a report in La Tribune, the French financial newspaper, that Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, had offered to inject FFr3bn (Dollars 341m) of fresh capital into the company. However, the Disney camp said the report related to a meeting in Paris three weeks ago, at which Walt Disney told Euro Disney's 60-strong banking syndicate it would be willing to participate in a rescue rights issue. Walt Disney's share of such an issue would be roughly equivalent to FFr3bn. Sources said there had been no formal contact between Walt Disney and the Euro Disney banks - which are owed FFr20.3bn and include Deutsche Bank, National Westminster and Citibank - since last month's meeting. The next stage in negotiations will be the formation of an official steering committee by the Euro Disney banks, which are presently split into two syndicates. The committee is expected to be headed by Banque Nationale de Paris or Banque Indosuez, the heads of the existing syndicates. Once the committee has been formed, it will map out a negotiating strategy for the banks against Euro Disney and Walt Disney. In the meantime, the banks plan to commission an investigative audit of Euro Disney. The audit will assess the company's present financial position and its capital requirements for the future. Euro Disney's shares, which collapsed following last month's surprise announcement of a FFr5.3bn net loss for the year ended September, have risen 18 per cent since the start of this week, when they were worth FFr30.90.</p>

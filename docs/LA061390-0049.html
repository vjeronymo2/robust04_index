			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> EGYPT GETS LATE SCORE FOR 1-1 TIE;  </P> <P> GROUP F: NETHERLANDS JOINS LIST OF TEAMS THAT HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF  EXPECTATIONS.  </P> <P> Egypt, in the World Cup tournament for the first time since 1934, continued a  tournament trend of upsets when Magdi Abdelghani converted a penalty shot with  eight minutes remaining to tie the European champion Netherlands, 1-1, Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The draw was a good result, we played very well," Eygptian Coach Mahmoud  el-Gohary said. "I had hoped that we would win for our country."  </P> <P> If not for the work of Dutch goalie Hans van Breukelen, Egypt might have won.  He made two brilliant saves, with a dive on Ahmed el Kass' left-footed drive  and with both hands on a spectacular header by Abdelghani late in the game.  </P> <P> The Netherlands struggled for almost an hour against Egypt's conservative  style. Then substitute Wim Kieft scored on a crossing feed from Dutch star  Marco van Basten at 58 minutes, to put the Dutch ahead, 1-0.  </P> <P> But Netherlands' slow defense faltered in the 82nd minute when Eygptian striker  Hossam Hassan, using his considerable speed, broke through. The Netherlands'  Ronald Koeman pulled him down in the penalty area, setting up Andel-Ghani's  penalty shot.  </P> <P> Andelghani beat van Breukelen low to the left corner to tie the game and give  Egypt its first World Cup goal in 56 years.  </P> <P> "If, with the talent we have, we cannot win a match like this, then it is a  debacle," Kieft said. "Now we have to win the next two games. Such a team can  only play well when we play badly."  </P> <P> The Dutch, looking lethargic in the muggy weather, suddenly came to life in the  58th minute when van Basten made a powerful run on the left wing. He sent in a  low cross that Frank Rijkaard missed. But Kieft was right there to flick the  ball past goalie Ahmed Shoubeir.  </P> <P> Egypt kept fighting back, led by Hassan, who had several chances to score.  </P> <P> The much-heralded Dutch trio of van Basten, Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit were  outplayed by such unknown players as Hassan, el-Kas and Gamal Abdel-Hamid as  the trend of surprises in the first round continued.  </P> <P> "We've been playing badly for two years," Gullit said. "We don't have enough  confidence. It's hard to concentrate after winning (the European title)."  </P></p>

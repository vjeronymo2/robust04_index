			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kent Chen] </F>   [Text] China plans to introduce new rules governing the  settlement of business disputes on June I [as published] in a  move to improve the efficiency and authority of the country's  arbitration mechanism.    The revision of the rules governing the China International  Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) follows an  increase in the number of disputes in recent years with the  influx of foreign investment.    Last year, CIETAC dealt with 504 cases, an increase of 88  percent over 1992. The surge in the number of disputes going to  arbitration underscores the inadequacy of the current rules  which were last amended in 1989.    "Because of the increased number of cases, CIETAC needs to  adopt clearer rules and bring its procedures into line with  international practices," said Michael Moser, a resident partner  at the Beijing office of international law firm Baker &amp;  McKenzie.    Mr Moser is one of five foreign nationals appointed by the  Chinese Government to CIETAC's panel of arbitrators.    Mr Moser said that in recent years, more foreign companies  had been involved in disputes compared with five years ago, when  most cases involved mainland and Hong Kong firms.    Moreover, the scale of the disputes being brought to CIETAC  has increased and multi-million dollar sums are not uncommon.    Five years ago, most disputes involved the sale or purchase  of goods, but increasingly they involved joint ventures.    To cope with the growing demand for arbitration, about 290  arbitrators will be appointed, a substantial increase from the  current 90. Of the new line-up about 80 will be foreigners.    Previously CIETAC's powers were ill-defined, but the new  rules will substantially expand its role, empowering it to deal  with international and foreign-related disputes and those  between foreign companies operating in China.    "When both parties in a dispute are foreign companies,  CIETAC  can accept the case under the new rule and if the dispute is  between two Chinese companies, it can also be arbitrated if the  issue in dispute is foreign-related. The old rules never made  this clear," said Mr Moser.    A second major change tightens up the CIETAC rules with  regard to conflict of interest on the part of arbitrators.  Under the old rules, either party could object if an arbitrator  had a conflict of interest in a case. However, the old rules  did not require voluntary disclosure of a conflict of interest.    The new rules make it clear that an arbitrator appointed to  handle a case must voluntarily disclose any conflict of interest  and refuse to handle the case.    "This is important to bring CIETAC up to international  standards," said Mr Moser.    A third area of change covers the power of arbitrators to  collect evidence independently. The old rules stated that  during the arbitration, the arbitrator could collect his own  evidence but was not required to show it to the parties in the  dispute.    "Many people think this is unfair. So the new rules require  that the arbitrator must show his independent evidence to the  parties and allow them to comment on that," Mr Moser said.    A fourth amendment puts a time limit on the giving of a  ruling. "Five years ago when there were not so many cases,  CIETAC arbitration was relatively speedy and most cases were  resolved within a year. Now, because of the large number of  disputes, cases can take two years or longer before a ruling is  made.    "The new rules require that the arbitrators must issue a  decision within nine months from the date the arbitration  tribunal is formed to guarantee cases are handled without  delay," said Mr Moser.</p>

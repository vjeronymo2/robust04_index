			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Greece, Alekos  Mikhailidhis and Karolos Papoulias, will meet tomorrow in Athens  to decide on the handling of the Cyprus issue in the near  future. This was stated by Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis at  Larnaca Airport upon his return from Paris, where he  participated in the conference for stability in Europe.  Mikhailidhis added that tomorrow's meeting with the Greek  foreign minister is considered necessary due to the developments  in the Cyprus issue. During the meeting, he said, we will  exchange views and information and discuss the National  Council's visit to Athens.    Mikhailidhis accused Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas of  delaying tactics on the Cyprus issue and added that, with his  stance, Denktas is trying to cause confusion in an attempt to  avoid finally being blamed for the failure to implement the  confidence-building measures. The foreign minister repeated  that the Greek Cypriot side accepts the 21 March document as the  final text, and warned that our side will not participate in any  discussion to change it.    On the sidelines of the Paris conference, the foreign  minister met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and  U.S. Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, with whom he said  he had an interesting talk.    Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also announced that Greece and  Cyprus have finalized a series of demands that will be put forth  at the European Union summit that will be held on Corfu. These  demands aim at promoting Cyprus' application to join the  European Union. Mikhailidhis discussed the whole issue with  Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos behind the  scenes at the Paris conference. Our goal on Corfu, Mikhailidhis  said, is to take another step toward setting a date for the  beginning of accession talks.</p>

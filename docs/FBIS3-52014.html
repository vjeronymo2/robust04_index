			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Foreign Affairs Celso Amorim by </F> Luiz Recena, place and date not given: "A Good Partner Need not  Be a Reflection"; introductory paragraphs in italics as  published]    [Text] In international relations, the best partner  is the country that is not a reflection of the other, stronger  partner. Having points in common does not mean a lack of  disagreements. It is along those basic lines, among others, that  Brazilian foreign policy is being consolidated once again, under  Itamar Franco's administration, in a clear, cooperative, and  independent manner.    Ambassador Celso Amorim has been in the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs since June, first as secretary general and then  as minister. He is the main architect of that consolidation--a  task involving bilateral relations, regional efforts, and  Brazil's participation in such wider forums as GATT or the UN  Security Council. Here is a look back at the year as seen by  Celso Amorim.    [Recena] Mr. Minister, what do you consider the chief events  of this year?    [Amorim] I will begin by emphasizing the idea, first brought  up by the president of the republic, of a free trade area in  South America--an idea that we are exploring bilaterally and  within Mercosur [Common Market of the South]--and I hope it will  become stronger. There are no new developments to mention, but I  hope that the idea will soon take on a more definite shape.    [Recena] What about Mercosur?    [Amorim] Well, the final evaluation will have to be made  next  year when the presidents meet in Uruguay on 17 January, but  intense negotiations have continued within Mercosur, and it is  expected that Brazil and Argentina will overcome the  difficulties that have arisen, especially as regards the Common  External Tariff. The negotiations are not easy, but they are  continuing to make progress. As I have been saying, we are  reaching the moment of truth on several points--in sensitive  areas affecting not only us--where Brazil is not the only one  with protectionist interests. All four countries have specific  interests, and this is now becoming increasingly clear. That is  why we are entering a period of intense negotiations that will  extend beyond the meeting by the presidents, but the presidents  may be able to use the progress to date to lay down clearer  parameters.    [Recena] Do you want to single out anything particular on  the  subject of Argentina?    [Amorim] Concerning Argentina, I would like to single out  the  recent meeting in Sao Paulo between the ministers of finance and  foreign affairs of both countries. Brazil was also represented  by the minister of industry and commerce. It was a meeting at  which we were able to get negotiations moving again. I also  regard as very important the visit by Minister of Foreign  Affairs Guido Di Tella to the INPE [National Institute of Space  Research] and the CIA. It was important as a demonstration of  our exclusively peaceful intentions.    [Recena] Beyond the regional realm, what was the most  important event?    [Amorim] It was undoubtedly the conclusion of the Uruguay  Round. That was the most important international event from the  standpoint of economic and even political relations, which  needed a balanced solution from that round. We are pleased that  the Uruguay Round has been completed. Obviously, it was not  ideal--it did not give us everything we wanted--but important  progress was made as regards market access: the average  reduction on the part of the developed countries was on the  order of 38 percent, and that will mean greater access for  Brazilian products. It also marks the start of a reduction in  farm subsidies, and while modest, that reduction is sizable and  will bring benefits. In addition, there is GATT's role in laying  down rules, another area in which considerable progress was  made. Establishment of the World Trade Organization was another  very important advance, since that institution will be able to  actually regulate international trade. Brazil participated  actively in those negotiations.    [Recena] What did its participation consist of?    [Amorim] There were seven years of hard work, and we made a  very big contribution. It is good for Brazil that the agreement  in question was possible. It is important to emphasize that the  Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs consistently conducted  those negotiations in an efficient manner with the cooperation  of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and Industry and  Commerce. I feel that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be  given credit for the coordination effort: the effort to conduct  those negotiations, which were the most complex negotiations to  date in the field of trade and economy.    [Recena] What were relations with the United States like in  1993?    [Amorim] I have just returned from a visit to the United  States. It was a short visit but one involving a lot of work. I  met with many officials, among them Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and the White House security adviser, Anthony Lake.  I have heard many favorable comments about that visit. I took  the opportunity it provided to present the Brazilian viewpoint  with great frankness, stressing something that was not being  sufficiently emphasized: the fact that our points of agreement  are much greater than our disagreements. But public opinion in  both countries and even some government circles focus more  strongly on the disagreements. It may be natural to do so, but  it is not right, because then the focus is on 5 percent of the  issues at most and ignores the fact that we agree on the other  95 percent.    [Recena] How did you approach that subject?    [Amorim] The message that I tried to convey, and I think it  was well received, well understood, and accepted, was this:  precisely because Brazil is a country with its own specific  characteristics and the same basic principles as those guiding  U.S. society--democracy, a market economy, and respect for human  rights--well, at the same time that we have those things in  common, we also hold different views on various subjects. And a  good partner is not one that reflects the other. A good partner  is the one that is in a position to disagree and engage in  dialogue in the search for a joint solution. I cited a few  examples of that: our profitable coordination in the Security  Council, including the time during Ambassador Ronaldo  Sardemberg's presidency, and our action at the Human Rights  Conference, at which Brazil, precisely because of its special  characteristics, played a fundamental role in ensuring the  success of that conference and managed to conclude a negotiation  that had seemed impossible of solution because of the  disagreements among the Asian, African, and Western blocs. That  message was very well received and very well understood, and  during meetings at the White House, they asked for Brazilian  suggestions regarding the hemispheric conference recently  proposed by Vice President Al Gore.    [Recena] What is the greatest difficulty in those relations?    [Amorim] The issue of industrial property, which I also  brought up during my visit. I explained that we expect to find a  satisfactory solution. Brazil has been acting constructively  while listening, of course, to the National Congress. They need  to understand that--the fact that there are diverse sectors in  Brazilian society, just as there are in U.S. society. It would  be a political mistake jeopardizing the mature partnership we  already have if some kind of unilateral measure were adopted  this coming February. I have greater hopes following the Uruguay  Round, whose agreement as approved also deals with the issue of  intellectual property.    [Recena] What is your expectation?    [Amorim] It is very optimistic. And also because our  relationship with the United States is symbolic of the  integration we want to have with the other developed countries.  I am scheduled to visit Germany and France, where I intend to  talk along that same line: about cooperation while always  respecting each country's special characteristics.    [Recena] Portugal: you were there recently. How was it?    [Amorim] It was an extremely productive visit. At the  bilateral level, we had a frank discussion of the opportunities  and problems, including the question of Brazilian members of the  liberal professions practicing in Portugal. A task force will  start dealing with that issue in January. At the start of  February, we will be visited by Minister Durao Barroso. There is  also the possibility of a bilateral presidential summit meeting  during the first half of the year. Apart from bilateral matters,  I want to mention Portugal's sincere support for the Brazilian  idea of forming a Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. I  would very much like to hold meetings by the foreign ministers  of those seven countries in Brasilia and Lisbon before this year  is over, at which time we would lay the foundations for that  community.    [Recena] In the domestic area, what subjects are of concern  to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?    [Amorim] We are assigning great importance to ratification  by  Congress of the various agreements we have in the nuclear area.  Those agreements were approved by the Chamber of Deputies in  September, and we are confident that it will be possible to get  them approved by the Senate as well before the year is over or  as soon after that as possible. This is important in order to  show the world clearly that Brazil is pursuing exclusively  peaceful objectives in its economic and technological  development, and we will then be in a better position to play an  active role as regards the supplying of advanced technologies.    [Recena] The president of Communist China was in Brazil.  What  has changed?    [Amorim] It was an extremely important visit and one that  will be repaid by our president in the coming year [1994]. We  intend to send missions to the Asian countries. Thailand's  minister of foreign affairs will visit Brazil in the near  future. We are going to open an embassy in Vietnam. We were also  visited by the president of Guyana, and I have just made a visit  to Colombia--proof in both cases that we are seeking complete  integration in the region.    [Recena] What about East Europe and Russia?    [Amorim] There was the visit by Minister Andrade Vieira, who  signed a very important protocol, and various sectors in the  government and in private enterprise are thinking of that big  market. These are visits which mobilize and bring about positive  reactions. I would also like to emphasize the decision by the  president of the republic to open an embassy in Kiev, Ukraine.    [Recena] In conclusion....    [Amorim] In conclusion, I would like to announce that next  year we are going to give a great deal of attention to making  Brazilian culture known abroad. It is through culture that we  will be able to present a good image of Brazil abroad. And a  good image of Brazilian culture has very big effects. Our  culture is very rich and attractive; it arouses the interest and  attention of other countries naturally. It is a very important  factor in promoting investments and trade. We will certainly be  able to carry out important projects in this area in the new  year.</p>

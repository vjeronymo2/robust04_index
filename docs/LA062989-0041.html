			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS 5-SCREEN THEATER IN ENCINO  </P> <P> A City Council committee Wednesday voted against a proposal to build a  five-screen movie theater complex in Encino, saying the land should be used for  retail stores.  </P> <P> The council's Planning and Environment Committee voted to eliminate the  1,500-seat theater complex and place strict conditions on the rest of the  development.  </P> <P> Councilman Marvin Braude joined Encino residents in urging the committee to  oppose the large theater complex. He said it would generate severe traffic and  parking problems that will spill onto neighborhood streets and further clog  Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> "I weighed the pros and cons and felt that this is no place for a regional  movie theater complex," Braude said. He said a retail center alone would be a  reasonable use for the land and would not hurt the community or the developer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Work a Little Harder'  </P> <P> "The developer may have to work a little harder in getting a new tenant, but  this is very prime Ventura Boulevard space," Braude said. "Overall, retail will  not be harmful."  </P> <P> The unanimous committee vote was an economic disaster for the project, said  Gail Gordon, the developer's representative. She urged the committee to  postpone its decision to give Heltzer Enterprises, the development firm, time  to prepare alternative plans that could include a smaller theater complex.  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson, the committee chairman, refused to delay the decision  but agreed to wait until mid-August to present the plan to the full City  Council.  </P> <P> Braude said a delay would give the developer time to write another plan  "providing they have something reasonable to propose."  </P> <P> The committee decision upheld a decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals, which  found that the project would create traffic problems. The development site is  on Ventura Boulevard between Gaviota and Gloria avenues.  </P> <P> In addition to rejecting the movie theaters, the committee ordered the  developer to abide by 19 tough development rules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nightclubs Prohibited  </P> <P> The conditions include prohibiting nightclubs or other late-night uses that  draw large crowds, banning "high turnover" restaurants and requiring ample  parking lots without floodlights that could disturb neighbors.  </P> <P> Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said residents were  particularly pleased with construction restrictions that prevent the builders  from allowing work crews to park their personal vehicles along residential  streets. In addition, trucks and cranes cannot block streets, and all  construction activities must be contained within the site.  </P> <P> To further minimize project effects on homeowners, the structure's air  conditioners must have mufflers, and restaurant exhaust fans should "be  constructed as to absorb grease and odors," the conditions stated.  </P></p>

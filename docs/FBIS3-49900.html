Reporters were addressed by Vuk Draskovic, president of the  Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO]; Dusan Mihajlovic, president of  New Democracy; and Vesna Pesic, president of the Citizens'  Alliance. Dragoljub Stankic has the details.    SPO President Vuk Draskovic immediately stressed Depos's  position that there was no civil, state, or national interest  more important than preventing poverty, hunger, mega-inflation,  and the criminal hoarding of wealth.    [Begin Draskovic recording] Therefore, any program that  secures the realization of these goals, in the government, the  assembly, and in the public, will have Depos's full support.  [end recording]    However, Draskovic later stressed that not every program  could count on such support, particularly not the Federal  Government's and Professor Dragoslav Avramovic's latest program.  According to Draskovic, a good program requires certain  prerequisites: lifting of the sanctions, an end to the war, the  deblocking of assets abroad, and international financial support.    Dusan Mihajlovic, president of New Democracy, stressed that  Depos would not support a Socialist government, nor would it be  a part of it. He expects the opposition to be given the post of  assembly chairman.</p>

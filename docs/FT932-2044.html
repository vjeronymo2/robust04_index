			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / People: British Airways Lord White, the 70-year-old chairman of Hanson Industries, is giving up his only major board appointment in Britain. He is retiring as a non-executive director of British Airways after the company's annual meeting on July 13. His decision not to stand for re-election is another sign of the changing face of the BA boardroom following Sir Colin Marshall's accession to the chairmanship earlier this year. Lord White was recruited to the BA board at the end of 1989 by his old friend, Lord King, who led the airline for 12 years. At the time of Lord White's appointment, BA had become embroiled in a controversial bid to win control of United Airlines at the height of the management buy-out boom on Wall Street. It was felt that the recruitment of Lord White, a renowned corporate predator, would help prevent BA from making a fool of itself by over-paying for acquisitions. However, his presence on the BA board also led to accusations that Lord King was surrounding himself with old friends. Sir Colin Marshall has already recruited two new non-execs, Detta O'Cathain and Charles Mackay and more non-exec appointments are expected as the old BA guard retire. Sir Francis Kennedy, the former diplomat who was Lord King's special adviser, is 67 and has been on the board since 1987, while Calor chairman Michael Davies has been on the board for a decade.</p>

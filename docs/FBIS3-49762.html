			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 4 January edition of the Split daily  SLOBODNA DALMAC1JA in Serbo-Croatian publishes on page 3 a map  the paper says was drafted by the Bosnian Army. The paper  reports that the map, disclosing an offensive plan of the  Bosnian Army, was obtained by Croatian Defense Council (HVO)  "intelligence circles." Based on the map, SLOBODNA DALMAC1JA  states, "it is obvious that the Muslim leadership of Sarajevo  headed by Alija Izetbegovic has decided to destroy and expel the  Croats from the Lasva Valley in central Bosnia," after which the  Muslim forces would push through the Neretva Valley to the sea  near Neum. The paper states that in order to carry out this  plan, scheduled to begin on 3 January, the Muslims have  concentrated in central Bosnia almost every corps of the Bosnian  Army. The 303d Mountain Brigade of the 3rd Corps has been tasked  with the first attack, directed against Vitez, SLOBODNA  DALMACIJA states, adding that 5,000 soldiers of the 1st Corps  from Sarajevo have already been sent toward Kiseljak, after  which attacks on other Croatian enclaves are planned.</p>

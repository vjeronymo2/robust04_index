			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 4 Mar (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, private  secretary to former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora, today  reported that police agents attempted to kidnap her in Santa  Cruz, and that by mistake they arrested and held for several  hours her niece, Luisa Rodriguez.    Seleme's niece confirmed that on 3 March she was detained by  a group of individuals, apparently policemen, who detained her  for several hours while they questioned her about her aunt.    A Bolivian radio station today reported that Susana Seleme  had been arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking.  Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want to either confirm  or deny this report, and Seleme herself denied to EFE in a  telephone conversation from her home that she had been arrested.    Susana Seleme, together with some leaders of her party, the  Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), denounced before  District Attorney Francisco Borenstein the kidnapping of her  niece by a group of six armed men, and accused the antinarcotics  police and the U.S. DEA of political harassment.    Seleme said she feels harassed by the U.S. Embassy in La Paz  over her old and excellent relations with the Cuban Government,  and especially with Fidel Castro.    Sources from the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN)  consulted by EFE in La Paz said that no orders had been issued  to carry out an operation like the one described by Seleme,  because any such procedure -- that is, an arrest -- is always  carried out within the law.    Other FELCN sources said that the role of the DEA is  restricted to logistical support and the processing of  information obtained from drug enforcement operations. The  sources said DEA agents do not participate in this kind of  operations, in compliance with bilateral agreements signed  between Bolivia and the United States.    Drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez testified before a  dangerous substances judge in La Paz that Susana Seleme  allegedly protected drug traffickers.    Dominguez said that the MIR leadership met on several  occasions with Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, allegedly the greatest  drug trafficker in Bolivia, who was arrested last January by the  FELCN, to discuss the financing of Paz Zamora's party campaign.    Susana Seleme's niece today told EFE that during the  afternoon of 3 March she left Seleme's house in Santa Cruz and  got into a "radio- taxi," which was intercepted fewer than 100  meters from where she got into it by three vehicles, from which  six armed men emerged.    "They told me: Get out, Susana Seleme. I took off my  sunglasses and told them that I was not Susana," Luisa Rodriguez  said, adding that although the men did not show their  identification cards they said they belong to the FELCN.    The men, Rodriguez said, got into the "radio-taxi," ordered  the driver not to communicate with his central radio system, and  then began to question Rodriguez.    Meanwhile, given that Luisa Rodriguez was taking a long time  to arrive at her destination, Susana Seleme called the  "radio-taxi" central, which with the aid of other taxis quickly  found Rodriguez' car, Seleme said.    Susana Seleme asked District Attorney Borenstein to  accompany  her to the place together with a police patrol, where they  arrived a little while after the men returned her identification  documents to her niece and told her that they had nothing  against her or her aunt.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 'CAN WE GO HOME AGAIN?'  </P> <P> The story of Lynwood stirred emotions throughout South Pasadena. Dennis  McDougal's nostalgic account of Lynwood was a testament to the devastation that  freeways can pose.  </P> <P> McDougal pointed out that Lynwood was not affluent like . . . Beverly Hills and  South Pasadena. Sir, our town is far from affluent. Our city operates on a  small budget. Our property values may have gone up, but our budget has not.  </P> <P> It was our old-timers who started pressuring Caltrans to come up with  alternative solutions, and it is our young people who continue. It's in their  hearts, not their pocketbooks. Like Lynwood, we are an "All Nations" city that  not only appreciates our rich 101-year history, but welcomes the diversity that  our changing demographics bring.  </P> <P> Perhaps the moral of McDougal's story should be that not all freeways are  created equal, some must never be built. People and towns are more important.  </P> <P> EVELYN PIERRO  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

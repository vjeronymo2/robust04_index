			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> FAMILY TIES: Now that Wilson Phillips (which features the daughters of Brian  Wilson and John and Michelle Phillips) has enjoyed a No. 1 single, who will be  the next second-generation show-biz popsters to make a dent in the pop charts?  Atco Records is betting on Tricia Leigh Fisher, a 21-year-old pop newcomer with  impeccable Hollywood bloodlines. The daughter of Eddie Fisher and Connie  Stevens, she has a new record due out at the end of the month, which features  such house-style dance grooves as "My Heart Holds On," "So Deep So True" and  "Trapped By Love."  </P> <P> .. . Meanwhile, Arista is showcasing a young Texas singer named Kris McKay by  putting her on L.A.'s espresso circuit. This Tuesday night she'll play (count  'em) three gigs at three different coffee houses, starting at 8:30 at the  Pikme-Up, then moving to Java and the Living Room later in the evening.  </P></p>

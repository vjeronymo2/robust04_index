			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yao Xiaomin (1202 1420 2404), Han Zhuping (7281 4376 </F> 1627): "Usher in a New Situation for Work Consultations--A  Spring Festival Gift to Compatriots on Both Sides of Taiwan  Strait"]    [Text] Plum blossoms herald the spring. On the eve of the  Chinese New Year, a traditional festival of the Chinese nation,  the fact that great progress was made and several common  consensuses were reached in the talks between the heads of the  Association for Relations Across the Straits [ARATS] and the  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] in Beijing has brought a  meaningful spring-festival gift to compatriots on the two sides  of the Taiwan Strait.    Following the Wang-Koo talks, ARATS and SEF held three  rounds  of talks on routine affairs in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei.  This time, ARATS Executive Vice President Tang Shubei, and Zou  Zhekai, vice president and secretary general, held frank and  wide-ranging consultations with Chiao Jen-ho, SEF vice chairman  and secretary general, on the work and routine affairs of the  two organizations and on related issues. During consultations,  the two sides maintained that they should avoid political issues  with pragmatic attitudes. They discussed three routine topics  which included the repatriation of personnel entering each  other's territory in violation of relevant provisions and other  related issues, and they reached a high degree of consensus.  They agreed that the fourth round of consultations on routine  affairs will be held in Beijing and unanimously agreed that in  the fourth round, they will exchange views or hold consultations  on a number of economic, scientific, and technological topics as  listed in the common agreement at the Wang- Koo talks. We can  say that with their concerted efforts this time, some  differences in previous routine affairs consultations between  ARATS and SEF have been resolved, to a considerable extent,  laying the groundwork for the routine affairs consultations next  time. Mr. Chiao Jen-ho said: "This is conducive to the ties  and cooperation between ARATS and SEF in the future and  conducive to promoting the virtuous and interactive development  of relations between the two sides of the Strait."    The talks this time lasted for five days and were very  fruitful. The experience of the talks this time and the  preceding rounds of consultations gives us these inspirations:    First, for routine affairs consultations, we should insist  on  the nongovernmental role of ARATS and SEF. Their major  functions are to handle specific routine problems arising from  contacts and exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. The  two organizations, whose roles are clearly specified in their  own articles, are officially empowered nongovernmental bodies.  Having a good understanding of this, one does not need to  attach too much political significance to the contacts and  consultations between the organizations.    One still recalls that at last year's Wang-Koo talks in  Singapore, the two sides of the Straits stressed ARATS's and  SEF's nongovernmental and economic nature, their being limited  to handling routine affairs, and their functionality. Precisely  because the two sides adhered to this pragmatic spirit, the  Wang-Koo talks were a complete success. In the wake of the  Wang-Koo talks, some people in Taiwan argued that they gave  prominence to the fact that "the two sides of the Strait are  divided and ruled separately, and are on an equal footing."  These irresponsible remarks which did not tell the truth about  the facts have made the just-begun routine affairs consultations  between ARATS and SEF more complicated and more politicized and  are, at a time when the political differences between the two  sides of the Straits have not been resolved today, nonconducive  to promoting the building up of mutual trust between ARATS and  SEF and between the two sides of the Straits, and nonconducive  to the smooth development of relations between the two sides of  the Straits.    At the consultations this time, the two sides reached a  common consensus on adhering to the nongovernmental nature of  the routine affairs consultations between ARATS and SEF and  avoiding sensitive political issues. This is objective and  pragmatic and will play a positive role in the implementation of  the various agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks and in  future consultations on routine affairs topics.    Second, keeping the linking channels between ARATS and SEF  unblocked is an important means for the two sides of the Straits  to improve understanding and strengthen mutual trust. The two  sides of the Straits have been separated for a very long time,  and their differences have deepened. The establishment of a  systemized linking and communication channel will undoubtedly  help alleviate their differences and clear up their  misunderstandings, "erecting a bridge of friendship and paving a  road to success" for the development of relations between the  two sides of the Straits.    One important achievement at the Wang-Koo talks was the  signing of an agreement on the system of ties and talks between  the two sides of the Straits. The function and obligation of  ARATS and SEF are to implement the agreement loyally. Over the  past year, ARATS has been positive and serious about  implementing the agreement. Last November, in order to strictly  implement the provision in the agreement that the secretaries  general or vice presidents of ARATS and SEF have one meeting  every six months, ARATS took the initiative to write to SEF,  inviting Mr. Chiao Jen-ho to Beijing for a meeting. Afterward,  they went through a tortuous course: Tang Shubei could not make  a trip to Taiwan for some reason on the Taiwan side, and Mr.  Chiao "had to reconsider whether or not he would have to  postpone" his trip to Beijing. Therefore, the talks this time  did not begin with ease, and the achievements made should be  cherished doubly.    Meeting with Mr. Jen-ho Chiao, Director Wang Zhaoguo said:  "Although ARATS and SEF are nongovernmental organizations, their  good or bad cooperation can often reflect the development of  relations between the two sides of the Strait. Despite the fact  that the two sides of the Strait still have political  differences, it is very important to establish a channel of  communication on issues of routine affairs." This affirms the  function and significance of keeping the linking channel  unblocked between the two organizations from a higher and wider  field of vision. Based on this, we maintain that, on the one  hand, the two sides should strictly abide by the relevant  agreements and continue to keep the linking and communication  channel, unblocked between the two organizations, and that, on  the other hand, it is of course good if the two sides can reach  agreement or consensus at each round of consultations, and if  they fail, they should not be disappointed because there is hope  and there will be achievements as long as they come into contact.    The saying runs: One makes plans in the spring. The talks  this time was the first consultations between the heads of the  two organizations following the Wang-Koo talks as well as their  first contact and consultations in 1994. The success of the  talks is a good beginning for ties and cooperation between the  two organizations and for various routine affairs consultations  between them for this year. Compatriots on the two sides of the  Straits look forward to the earliest possible implementation of  the important consensuses reached at the talks in their  consultations and relevant agreements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Italian Prime Minister Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi said here Monday [31 January] that he does not  plan to run in the upcoming general elections in Italy and that  his government would step down after the vote.    "My government was created last May to deal with a difficult  phase of transition," Ciampi said during a press conference held  after a meeting with Austrian Chancelor Franz Vranitzky. "The  decision to hold new elections (27-28 March) puts an end to this  transitional period and I have no intention of being a candidate  during the elections."    Ciampi has been running a caretaker government since the  dissolution of parliament earlier this month.    His decision not to run in the elections comes as Italy's  political parties are trying to forge alliances ahead of the  elections. Left-wing parties had been looking to Ciampi as  their possible candidate for the post of prime minister.</p>

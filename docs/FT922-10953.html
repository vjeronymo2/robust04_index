			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Compaq hit hard by price drop COMPAQ Computer's first-quarter earnings plunged as the personal computer manufacturer struggled to respond to rapidly declining prices and fierce competition. In addition, the company said it expected second and third-quarter earnings to be below those of the first quarter. Separately, Compaq announced it was to withdraw from the Ace Initiative, an industry group it co-founded with Digital Equipment and Microsoft a year ago to establish a new hardware and software standard for advanced personal computers. Compaq's first-quarter net income was Dollars 45m, or 53 cents a share, a 60 per cent decline from Dollars 114m, or Dollars 1.26, in the same period last year. Revenues were Dollars 783m, down 19 per cent from Dollars 971m in the first quarter of 1991. The stock closed down Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 23 5/8 . Compaq blamed its earnings decline on the extraordinary drop in personal computer prices recently. 'Our financial results for the remainder of the year will continue to be influenced by aggressive pricing and increased expenses due to an ambitious advertising schedule, the introduction of new products late in second and third quarters, and expansion of our distribution,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive. Compaq will launch a new range of lower priced desktop and portable personal computers in June. The company was 'unlikely to see the positive impact of our plans on earnings before fourth quarter', Mr Pfeiffer warned. Compaq's withdrawal from Ace is widely seen as the final blow in a series that has significantly weakened the group's ability to establish a new standard for personal computers based upon Mips Computer's Risc microprocessor. Explaining Compaq's decision to withdraw, Mr Pfeiffer said the company had put 'on hold' its plans to launch products based upon a 'reduced instruction set computing' (Risc) architecture this year, and instead would continue to focus on developing machines built on Intel microprocessors. Earlier this month Digital Equipment and Microsoft, two other key members of Ace, announced a new alliance focused upon Digital's new 'alpha' microprocessor. Mips Computer, which developed the Risc microprocessor, last month was acquired by Silicon Graphics, a workstation manufacturer.</p>

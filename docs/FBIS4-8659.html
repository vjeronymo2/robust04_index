			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 14 (CTK) -- The question of the  Temelin nuclear power station in south Bohemia should not  provoke controversy between Czech President Vaclav Havel and  Austrian President Thomas Klestil at the forthcoming meeting of  seven Central European presidents in the east Bohemian town of  Litomysl, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek said today.    "It is impossible for the topic of Temelin not to appear at  the meeting," Spacek told journalists. He added, however, that  it was impossible to expect that the debate on the nuclear power  plant would be conducted on "some specific level." The  discussion will probably be on how to ensure nuclear security in  Europe, Spacek said.    Klestil intends, during his meeting with Klaus on Friday [15  April], to convince the Czech president of the necessity of new  steps concerning the Temelin nuclear plant. In an interview  with Green representatives in Vienna today Klestil promised that  he would seek to table discussion on the ecological impact of  the construction and would contribute to the renewal of talks on  planning permission.</p>

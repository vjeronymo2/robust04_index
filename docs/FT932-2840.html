			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / CBI finds London businesses optimistic COMPANIES in London are more optimistic about their prospects for the next six months than their counterparts in eight other European capitals, a survey has found, Andrew Taylor writes. The Confederation of British Industry's London branch conducted the survey with business organisations in Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Rome and Valetta. Companies in London were more optimistic about prospects in every sector except construction. In banking and finance, London was the only capital 'reporting a more optimistic position compared with six months previously'.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Loose EU Is Not Necessarily to Our </F> Advantage"]    [Text] As a member of the European Union [EU], Finland  must not become subservient to the interests of any of the big  powers in the EU. Finland must not align itself with either the  British or the French ideology, but act as defender of the  interests of Europe's northeast corner. A loose EU is not  necessarily advantageous to Finland.    These were the points that SDP [Social Democratic Party]  Chairman Paavo Lipponen stressed in his speech at a seminar  organized by the Trade and Industry Delegation on Wednesday [4  May]. Lipponen pointed out that Finland has eight months to  prepare its membership policy and get ready to take full  advantage of membership. He added that Finland cannot function  for a single day in the EU without a clearly defined platform of  policy.    "Will it be the French or the British philosophy? The French  focus on finality, a clearly defined goal for a closely  integrated, federalist EU. The British prefer to advance  pragmatically and favor a loose community until this is proven  wrong.    "Finland has the same right as the present member countries  to hold on to its national interests. Good relations with  Russia are too important an asset to Finland to be given up.  The EU cannot expect Finland to take on greater risks than any  other member country. Our position has become easier due to the  fact that the integration of Russia into European cooperation is  also vital to the EU."  <H5>  The Foreign Minister Is Giving the Wrong Signals </H5>   The SPD chairman was critical about the attitude taken by  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto: "The foreign minister has  already gone against Finland's interests on two occasions, once  by hastening to declare himself a supporter of the British EU  philosophy and a second time by siding with the British view on  the minority vote issue."    Lipponen did not think it was self-evident at all that a  loose community would be to Finland's advantage. This  standpoint is based on misconceptions from the Cold War, not on  a proper analysis of what is best for Finland: "Finland would  weaken its own influence by adopting a platform of opposition to  federalism. A Community without a common will and capacity to  act is likely sooner or later to leave its smallest members in  the weakest position.    "In a loose EU, the great powers would skim the cream off  the  milk and focus on their own interests. If the new countries  adopt an antifederal platform, it will strengthen the position  of those who want to create an inner circle of `original' member  states and do business by means of coalitions."    A loose EU, according to Lipponen, may even incite Germany  to  go in its own direction.  <H5>  The EU Must Expand to the East </H5>   "Germany is very much in favor of expanding the EU to the  north and the east. This commits Finland, as a member of the  EU, to take an early stance on the issue of the EU's expansion.  The newest members are generally opposed to the next  candidates. But here, Finland's interests are the same as those  of the EU in general. The countries of East Europe must be  taken on board as members by the turn of the century. East  Europe, which is heading for chaos as a result of insecurity and  political and commercial discrimination, could become an  overpowering threat to the EU and cause the disintegration of  the whole union."    Lipponen thinks that as a member of the EU, Finland must  also  act as a staunch advocate of the interests of business and  industry. The most typical requirement in this respect concerns  heavy industry, i.e., the paper, shipbuilding, and metal sectors.    In discussing Finland's role as defender of the interests of  Europe's northeastern region, Lipponen referred to the EU's  preparatory work to develop a basic structural plan for Europe:  "It does not include a single project addressing the attachment  of the Baltic area to the Europe of the EU. The  Finland-St.Petersburg-Moscow rail and road links, the  development of the ports in the Gulf of Finland, and the Baltic  road network must be included in the Commission's project  program."  <H5>  "We Do Not Want a Eurohell" </H5>   Lipponen stressed that Europe must be developed as a social  project, not only as a design engineered by a  politico-industrial elite: "We do not want a Eurohell with a  dogmatic economic and monetary policy, set to destroy the unity  of the Community and where a political elite hands out  mafia-style subsidies to mitigate opposition," he said.    Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto believes that EU membership  will enable Finland to focus even more efficiently on the  central goal of greater stability and security in Northern  Europe. Haavisto, who also addressed the EVA [Business and  Industry Delegation] seminar, stressed the importance of  Finland's role in influencing the way the EU develops its  relations with Russia and the Baltic states and in the design of  EU's new northern dimension.    Haavisto agreed with SPD Chairman Paavo Lipponen that  Finland  must base its actions in the EU on the needs and interests of  the Finnish community: "Only the Finns themselves will take  care of Finnish issues in Brussels," Haavisto added.    Haavisto was definitely more cautious than Lipponen in  outlining Finland's role in the EU. While Lipponen believes  that expansion to include East Europe would be in Finland's  interest, Haavisto confined himself to say that expansion will  have to be examined with care as it would affect our position in  the EU's northeast corner.    Haavisto also dodged the issue of whether a loose or a close  EU would be in Finland's interest. The question must be  studied, he said, alluding to the smaller EU states, of which  many have favored federative forms of decisionmaking on the  basis that this has committed the bigger countries to a closer  cooperation.</p>

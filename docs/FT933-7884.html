			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Subic Bay finds new role as an industrial base: Jose Galang reports companies value the facilities left by US forces SUBIC, the former US naval base in the Philippines that is being transformed into an industrial zone, is slowly living up to hopes that it will become a magnet for foreign investment. Nearly nine months after the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) took over from the American forces, the facility has attracted nearly 20 projects, involving total investments of more than Dollars 307m (Pounds 207m). The authority says it has had a further 2,000 inquiries. It is not difficult to appreciate Subic's potentials. The US forces left the area in November last year with well-paved roads, a telecommunications system, an airport, power-generating plants, and water and sewerage systems. Having played a strategic role in US naval operations, Subic's natural deep-water harbour, well-maintained piers and berthing areas, could provide a transshipment centre for companies aiming for the Asia-Pacific markets. All that makes Subic ideal for enterprises that want to start up quickly. Incentives offered to investors are also among the most generous in the region: a 5 per cent tax on gross income in lieu of all national and local taxes, no controls on foreign exchange, and free flow of goods and capital within the zone as a separate customs territory. And yet just over a month ago the outlook for Subic was very bleak indeed. A June 10 executive order issued by Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, limited exemptions from import taxes and duties to raw materials and equipment being brought into Subic. Consumer goods, under the Ramos order, were to suffer the usual levies. The sudden change in policy, lamented as a violation of the spirit of Subic as a 'special economic and free port zone', caught not only the investors by surprise but also the SBMA officials. Apparently the Ramos order was drafted by his legal adviser without consulting SBMA executives. Decrying the change of rules midstream, large investors at the industrial estate threatened to withdraw. Mr Ramos eventually amended his directive and granted duty-free import of consumer goods provided the items were consumed within the zone. The Philippine Supreme Court then ruled as unconstitutional the appointment of Mr Richard Gordon as the SBMA chairman. Mr Gordon was also mayor of Olongapo City, where the Subic zone is located, and the court said individuals were barred by the charter from holding two government posts. Mr Gordon, who was in Japan selling the Subic zone to prospective investors when the Supreme Court ruling was handed down, initially chose to stay with his Olongapo constituents. However, after being urged by Mr Ramos to 'consider the bigger and broader interests of the country', he opted to stay on at SBMA. Although quickly resolved, these anxious episodes typify, analysts say, the travails of doing business in the Philippines. Sudden changes in state policy, even while a new enterprise is still groping its way around, are not new to local investors. This pattern took hold during the martial law administration in the late 1970s, with many of the policy changes proving favourable to business groups close to the government. If the Philippines is to get its economy on track for sustained growth and finally keep in step with its high-growth neighbours, analysts say, stable and even rules must apply. Subic may have awakened the 14-month-old Ramos administration to that necessity. Last week Mr Gordon finalised a Dollars 60m loan agreement with the Taiwan government for the development of a 300-hectare area within the Subic zone that will be exclusively for Taiwan industries. SBMA officials had earlier estimated that some 700 light and medium industries, all seeking to market their produce to various markets in the region, would locate operations at Subic. At the loan signing ceremonies in Taipei last week, however, officials were saying that only 30 companies had so far shown interest.</p>

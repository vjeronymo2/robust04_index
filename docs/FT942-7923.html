			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Globex highlights race for lucrative after-hours trade - Risk and reward The latest episode in the Globex saga has highlighted the strong belief among the world's leading futures exchanges that there is demand for, and money to be made in, after-hours trading. The million-dollar question is whether Globex will be able to secure a significant slice of this potentially lucrative market or find itself squeezed out by more nimble competitors. Although Globex was dealt a humiliating blow last week by Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, when it decided against joining the system because of the restrictive terms which Globex had laid down, its future brightened considerably a few days later when DTB, Frankfurt's financial futures and options exchange, said it intended to join the system. DTB is the third exchange to join Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news group, along with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Matif, the French futures exchange. 'The future of Globex has cleared up a lot,' says a spokeswoman at Matif. 'There was no clear commitment before, but now there is.' Now that the uncertainty hanging over the system has been dispelled and its configuration has been clarified, one would expect Globex to speed up DTB's entry into the system. But DTB still needs to sign a contractual agreement with Globex, which could take weeks, and then it could take up to a year for its products to be listed on the system. This lack of urgency on Globex's part could play directly into the hands of other exchanges which are considering alternative after-hours electronic trading systems. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT), which pulled out of Globex last month, expects its 'Project A' electronic trading system to start in August. Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, says the initial aim of Project A is to operate in the afternoon after the exchange's morning open-outcry session has ended and before the evening session starts. The system is scheduled to start operating through the night by the autumn. CBoT also has an agreement in principle with Bloomberg Financial Services which would give users with Bloomberg terminals access to its products. Since this is a non-exclusive pact, CBoT is free to find other potential distributors of its products. There are also indications that CBoT and Liffe, which already have a close relationship and similar business strategies, are exploring ways to work together. The chairmen of the two exchanges are due to meet later this week. Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe chief executive, does not rule out linkages of some kind between the two exchanges, such as fungible links between identical contracts. 'All these exciting projects would have been off-limits had we joined Globex,' says Mr Hodson. Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe chairman, said last week that Liffe's after-pit trading could easily be extended by two hours, thus taking it to the end of the Chicago morning trading session of 2pm Chicago time. Liffe may also extend its network overseas, following the successful installation of its screens in New York. Mr Hodson says that while these steps would not pose a problem on the technological front, they could be held up by considerations such as market supervision and the impact on the London Clearing House. 'But these hurdles are not insuperable,' he says. But the Matif spokeswoman says that the links established between three of the world's most important exchanges and their combined political will should ensure a successful future for Globex.</p>

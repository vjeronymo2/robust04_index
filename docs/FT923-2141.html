			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (6): Ever more mouths to feed - Pakistan has chronically failed to grow enough wheat for all its people AGRICULTURE remains the backbone of Pakistan's economy. But attempts to make the country self-sufficient in food grains continue to fall behind national needs, creating new requirements for wheat imports. This year alone Pakistan will import 2m tonnes of wheat, adding to the burden on budgetary resources. Agriculture employs 51 per cent of the workforce, only 9 per cent down from 60 per cent in 1964. Agriculture-related products earn up to 70 per cent of export revenues. In spite of difficulties in raising food grain production, agricultural output last year grew by 6.4 per cent and made a 26 per cent contribution to GDP. Growth was up from 3 per cent during the 1989-90 fiscal year and 5.1 per cent in 1990-91. Cotton, wheat and rice account for almost 70 per cent of overall crop output value. The remainder is sugar-cane, fruits, vegetables and other products. Cotton output grew by 35 per cent last year largely due to incentives for farmers, while wheat and rice production were virtually unchanged. Last month, the government announced new incentives for cotton growers by removing export duty. The government also plans to increase productivity in crops such as rice and wheat, by raising government-controlled grain prices for farmers as well as making arrangements to provide better quality seeds and efficient technology. Mr Majeed Malik, agriculture minister, says: 'The price of wheat as compared to the inputs is such that it is becoming less and less a profitable crop and therefore people are shifting to other areas.' Mr Malik says the government plans to set up a new framework which would allow technology to be taken to the doorsteps of the farmer, as one way to encourage the use of better techniques for improving output. Agricultural experts have argued that an important obstacle to making farmers use better techniques is that many of them are located in inaccessible areas. Mr Malik disagrees with critics who argue that low literacy rates would make it impossible to introduce high-tech methods. 'Although the rate of literacy is low, even the most uneducated farmer is very keen to absorb technology. He doesn't have to read a book, he has to be told on radio by experts,' he says. The government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif claims to have broken fresh ground in resolving important long term problems. Last year, the country's four provinces and the federal government resolved a 70 year long dispute over the distribution of water from the Indus river, one of Pakistan's main sources of water supply for agriculture. Eventually, the provinces expect to save between 10 to 13 MAF (million acre feet) of water, which was earlier flowing out to the sea in the absence of a sharing formula. In December last year, the government also announced a new package of incentives to improve crop yields. However, improving the performance of agriculture remains difficult. A continuing problem is a high population growth rate of almost 3.1 per cent. In addition, the country is still faced with the difficult issue of taxation for farm-lands. Agricultural incomes are exempt from direct taxation, partly due to resistance from a strong lobby of politically influential landlords. The resistance has received additional momentum from the argument that taxation would be unfair unless the prices for crops are set according to international market rates rather than remaining under government control. Mr Malik says the farmers have a point because of low profitability in the sector. But he also leaves the door open for generating more resources, and says that by the end of this decade new revenues may have to be generated from agriculture which may 'not necessarily be income tax in the same sense'. Privately, some senior officials concede that this is among the most difficult issues for agricultural policy makers. While the land-owners' lobby is influential, the government is also under increased pressure from local industrialists and businessmen who have demanded taxation for agriculture to give the same treatment to this sector as other areas of the economy. Eventually, a decision on this may determine the profitability in the agricultural sector. Finally, problems related to the pattern of agriculture have also constrained growth potential. According to estimates by Western development experts, Pakistan's agriculture sector has been operating close to its limits as far as quality of land and water resources are concerned. But the alternative of intensive farming to increase agricultural output requires resources which are not readily available.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Admit it, you have been thinking all week 'What we need is a music quiz with really interesting guests such as Lucie Skeaping, Reg Presley and Kate Copstick' haven't you? Well tonight your dream comes true: all three turn up for The Music Game (8.30 C4). What more could anyone ask? Fridays will never be the same again. Comedy freaks will have to tape the excellent American series Cheers, though this is of course a repeat, at 9.00 (C4) while watching the last in the present series of Rory Bremner on BBC1. When he ends at 9.30 you replay the Cheers tape which takes you through to 10.00 and the start of the topical quiz Have I Got News For You (BBC2), now established as one of the week's funniest programmes. At 10.30 when that ends you switch to C4 in time for the start of Clive Anderson Talks Back, a chat show where the guests have more chance than with Dame Edna, but the chairman takes a far more active part than, say, Michael Aspel. Joel Bennett's Survival Special (8.00 ITV) makes the case for better treatment of grizzly bears of which, it seems, there are 30,000 left in Alaska and only 1,000 in all the rest of the USA.</p>

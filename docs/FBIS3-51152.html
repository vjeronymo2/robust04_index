The  agreement, proposed by Venezuela, will allow approximately 1,500  Colombian inmates to return to their country and finish serving  there the sentences ordered by Venezuelan courts.    Eighteen months after the agreement to allow prisoners to go  to Colombia was presented, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando  Ochoa Antich and Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio  today signed the final document.    The agreement calls for the transfer of prisoners, provided  they have been sentenced by the courts. Of the 2,800 Colombian  prisoners in Venezuelan jails, only 1,500 qualify under the  agreement. Nonetheless, the agreement is voluntary, which means  that both Venezuelans and Colombians will be able to choose if  they want to be repatriated or not to their country of origin.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOT POTATO' AT THE DMV  </P> <P> RE: "Queen" Cathie Wright whose daughter, Victoria, can do no wrong. At least  this seems to be the consensus of mother, the courts and especially the  Department of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> As a retired DMV employee, that kind of record would cause immediate revocation  of the driver's license, at least for you and me.  </P> <P> And the incident of vital information missing from DMV files and court records  sounds like it was advised not to be entered as it was considered a "hot  potato."  </P> <P> I understand Judge Bruce A. Clark is tough and observes the law. Perhaps he was  advised the issue was too sensitive or "Queenie" got to him.  </P> <P> Before I retired I was advised not to write this type letter as it would put my  job and promotions in jeopardy.  </P> <P> JIM BREMER  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P> <P>  Editor's Note: Victoria Wright was sentenced to 30 days in county jail on  March 29 for breaking conditions of her probation for a previous traffic  offense.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Tecs attacked on jobless training Thousands of long-term unemployed adults with problems such as illiteracy will be denied training places because of cuts in funding, it was said yesterday. Training providers said that training and enterprise councils, which administer government training programmes in England and Wales, have been told to get providers to achieve more qualifications and jobs for unemployed adults with fewer resources. Providers have questioned why Tecs should be able to make, and keep, savings from training programmes. They also question why they should face cuts while Tecs maintain their staff levels and, in some cases, provide BMW cars for chief executives. The Tecs' budget for the main scheme for unemployed adults, Training for Work, will fall to Pounds 705m in 1994-95 from Pounds 762m in 1993-94. At the same time the Department of Employment is demanding increases in the number of those achieving jobs or qualifications - up to 40 per cent higher. Mrs Anne Weinstock, chief executive of the Rathbone Society, which trains people with special needs, said many providers were already selecting those most easy to train or to get jobs for. Many Tecs are negotiating with the employment department over their budgets for 1994-95. Mrs Pat Richards, who chairs the Tecs' funding and contracting working group, said: 'Tecs are saying these contracts will not be easy to manage and some have warned that budgets may have to be reviewed mid-year.' The concerns of providers - over Tecs making savings and maintaining staff levels - highlight the tensions inherent in the way these private companies are funded. Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's training spokesman, said it would be ridiculous to blame Tecs for having surpluses, which are needed to fund their work in economic development. But he said a future Labour government would review the funding of Tecs and might require that funds for programmes such as those catering for people with special needs be ring-fenced.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA;  </P> <P> ST. JOHN'S SCHOOL DEDICATES BUILDING  </P> <P> St. John's School, at 30382 Via con Dios, dedicated its first permanent  building Tuesday, a $1.2-million structure built entirely from donations.  </P> <P> The private, Episcopalian elementary school has housed 550 students in portable  buildings since 1988.  </P> <P> But during the past year, officials from the Episcopal Diocese, the Rancho  Santa Margarita Co. and the Hunsaker Development Co. raised the money to build  rooms for preschool, kindergarten and administration offices at the school.  </P> <P> Officials will now campaign to raise $1.5 million to build 24  first-through-eighth-grade classrooms, school spokesman Stephen Nill said,  adding that church leaders hope to have the school completed within a year.  </P> <P> St. John's School was founded by retired priest Ernest Sillers, the 80-year-old  founder of St. Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano.  </P></p>

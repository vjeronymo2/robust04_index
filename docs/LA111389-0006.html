			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATIZATION HELPS KEEP LEAKY SHIPS AFLOAT;  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY: A SIMPLE ECONOMIC BAND-AID IS BEING LABELED EITHER A TOOL TO  IMPOVERISH MINORITY WORKERS OR AN OVERTAXED SOCIETY'S WHITE KNIGHT. NEITHER IS  CORRECT.  </P> <P> Two opposing views are loudly trumpeted these days on the subject of government  agencies contracting with businesses for the delivery of public services,  popularly called "privatization."  </P> <P> One camp sees it as some sort of free-market white knight riding to the rescue  of an overtaxed and economically overextended society sorely in need of new  ways to finance public services at affordable -- if not bargain-basement --  prices.  </P> <P> The other side believes that privatization is a fiendish plot engendered by  "right-wing obsession" -- and, as such it is merely a tool to thump on women  and minorities and impoverish displaced government employees.  </P> <P> Both views are wildly off the mark, especially where local government is  concerned (contracting out is one of its long-time tools).  </P> <P> There are a number of fundamental laws of politics and government. One of the  most basic -- going back as far as the beginning of recorded history -- is that  for reasons ideological or otherwise, politicians (as opposed to rulers) never  voluntarily reduce services to their constituents, whether those constituents  speak at the ballot box or with stones in hand.  </P> <P> Another is that you get what you pay for (this often works well in economics,  too). A third is that negotiable currency is needed to pay for what you buy. In  the case of government, as in other facets of daily life, that means goods and  services -- people and the things they produce.  </P> <P> Trendy political, economic and social theories aside, nothing much has  fundamentally changed for decades regarding which public services government in  America should -- and will -- deliver, with the notable exceptions of health  care and legal aid for the poor. From national to local levels defense, public  safety, education, economic development and the like have comprised the  accepted agenda.  </P> <P> To be unaware these days that a buck just doesn't buy what it used to --  government services included -- you would have to be Rip van Winkle. Or that  the sheer number of public service programs (as opposed to the service  categories themselves) has grown enormously in recent years.  </P> <P> Which leaves local governments -- those closest to the people -- in a special  quandary: How do they pay for what by law they must provide?  </P> <P> Some, such as the city of Los Angeles, have turned temporary fees into  permanent taxes (which mostly hurts those least able to pay).  </P> <P> Others, such as Los Angeles County, can't rely on taxes. The county, the second  biggest provider of municipal services in the United States after New York  City, has virtually no taxing authority. And without special approval from  Sacramento, it can't even ask the voters to OK changes in the local tax  structure.  </P> <P> The county has to try to keep a leaky financial ship afloat in large part by  financing services through savings. Those savings can be made by improving  efficiency or -- where appropriate and feasible -- by contracting with private  companies for the delivery of public services at a lower cost than by in-house  staff, and by the contractual expectation that the services will be delivered  properly.  </P> <P> Although Los Angeles County is reportedly having problems with its  vehicle-maintenance contractor, local governments in the county have had  especially good experiences with privatization of services common to both the  public and private sectors, such as garbage collection, roadway repairs, tree  trimming and clerical help.  </P> <P> Conversely, there are certain functions that do not immediately seem to lend  themselves to privatization, such as law enforcement, industrial regulation,  basic administration and the like, although in some of these areas, a degree of  privatization has been the historic norm (a small city hiring a private  attorney as city counsel, for example).  </P> <P> Thus, privatization is not some right-wing scheme to subjugate women and  minorities or to impoverish working people. Nor is it any kind of free-market  panacea for overburdened government jurisdictions. It's just a necessary  socioeconomic Band-Aid to help keep things together for all of us, minority and  majority alike. As such, at least locally, privatization works when given the  opportunity.  </P></p>

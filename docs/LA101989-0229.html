			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> S. AFRICA TO PAY MOST OF DEBT  </P> <P> The government today agreed to repay a large chunk of its foreign debt,  disappointing anti-apartheid campaigners who had hoped to use the debt issue to  speed political reform, but heavy debt repayments will still take a toll on the  country.  </P> <P> Under a new pact with 330 international bankers, South Africa will repay about  $1.5 billion of its $20-billion short-term debt within three years. That debt  was originally scheduled to be repaid next June.  </P> <P> But South Africa will also have to make big payments on medium- and long-term  debt. Economists said this could squeeze the nation's gold and foreign exchange  reserves, which have dwindled to a level to cover only six weeks' of imports.  </P> <P> "All South Africans must realize that the country faces tough times in the next  four years," Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.  </P></p>

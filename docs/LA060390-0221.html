			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: A BIT OF ENGLAND IN BEL-AIR FOR ACTRESS SEYMOUR  </P> <P> Actress Jane Seymour and her business manager-husband, David Flynn, have sold  the house in the Beverly Hills Post Office area that they bought a year ago in  March from singer Carol Lawrence and are about to start renovating a Bel-Air  house that they purchased earlier this year.  </P> <P> "They keep buying homes to fix up and live in, but the (Carol Lawrence) house  wound up being too big for spending some weekends and other days when they're  in town," said Jana Jones of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young.  </P> <P> The Flynns' main U.S. residence is in Santa Barbara, and they also own a couple  of homes in England, including one in the Mayfair district of London, which  they just purchased.  </P> <P> "They plan to spend more time in England," Jones said. But the English-born  actress, whose credits include a starring role in the TV miniseries "War and  Remembrance," and her American husband will have a touch of England in Los  Angeles, because they expect to turn their traditional-style Bel-Air house into  a Country English home, designed by architect Gus Duffy.  </P> <P> The couple also plan to expand the Bel-Air house, which they purchased for  slightly more than $1.2 million, from 3,500 to about 6,000 square feet.  </P> <P> The Flynns turned the 6,980-square-foot French Regency they bought from  Lawrence for $2.25 million, into an 8,000-square-foot Georgian Colonial, also  designed by Duffy, with red-brick exteriors and white pillars.  </P> <P> The Georgian Colonial, which has seven bedrooms and six baths, was sold before  it was listed and landscaping was completed. "The buyers climbed over the dirt  to look at it," Jones remarked.  </P> <P> It sold, Jones said, for $6 million, a price that a broker from another Beverly  Hills firm termed "amazing for the area," despite the site's views from  downtown to the ocean. Jones credits Flynn, whom she describes as "the man with  the vision."  </P> <P> "Nobody else would touch that property because it had a gully," she said, "but  he had the foresight to buy it, fill the gully with dirt and put in a retaining  wall to create a flat place where a tennis court was built. Because he did  that, he got the price he did."  </P> <P> The buyer is Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann, Little &amp;  Co., a New York investment firm formed in 1978 to specialize in leveraged  buyouts. The home is Forstmann's first in California, other sources said.  </P> <P> Actress Victoria Principal has listed her Benedict Canyon home at $1.15  million.  </P> <P> The 3,000-square-foot house, which has three bedrooms and an office that  Principal used as a gym, is on the market through Rory Barish of June Scott  &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The gated home is where Principal and her husband, Dr. Harry Glassman, were  living last August when they bought a larger house in Beverly Hills for $2.95  million.  </P> <P> It has taken them this long to move into that home, which was built in the  1940s, because they have been doing major remodeling on it, other sources said.  </P> <P> The Benedict Canyon home, built in 1966, was Principal's main residence even  before she and Glassman were married about eight years ago, Barish said. "She  lived there for 12 years," he added.  </P> <P> Irene Bentley, widow of the founder of Bentley Laboratories in Newport Beach,  has put her Pebble Beach retreat on the market at $9.5 million. Her main  residence is on Lido Island.  </P> <P> She and her late husband, Donald James Bentley, bought the 2.67-acre Pebble  Beach property, with 515 feet of ocean frontage on the 17 Mile Drive, in 1984.  The two-story contemporary that they built there has seven bedrooms and seven  baths in about 8,000 square feet, behind 10-foot-tall iron gates.  </P> <P> "They left a couple of walls from the original house but rebuilt the rest and  just finished it when he died (in April, 1986)," said Mary Sivaslian of Marion  Buie Realty, Newport Beach, who shares the listing with Deirdre Reade of Fox  &amp; Carskadon, Carmel.  </P> <P> Bentley invented the first disposable oxygenator, used in heart surgery, before  he sold his company in 1981 to American Hospital Supply Corp. of Chicago for  $243 million. Later, Bentley Labs was sold to Baxter Labs, also of Illinois.  </P> <P> Liberace's first Palm Springs home has been leased with an option to buy, said  Larry Seaward, who put the three-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot house, with a  piano-shaped pool and a mural depicting the late entertainer and his friends,  on the market in February at $400,000.  </P> <P> "The house was built (in 1958) for (actress) Mae West, but she didn't buy it,"  Seward said. "The people who have leased it, as a vacation home, are Margo and  Rod West." He's an ABC-TV exec, and they live in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Annabelle Heiferman, who was the mayor of Beverly Hills during the mid-1980s,  and her husband, Joe, a retired costume jeweler, are now calling Fairbanks  Ranch home.  </P> <P> The Heifermans bought a New England-style house with a swimming pool and a  large, enclosed patio in the Rancho Santa Fe community for $1.6 million in  cash.  </P> <P> Fairbanks Ranch, a 2,000-acre development, is now into its second decade.  Ground was broken in 1980. "The first lot was sold to an old-line Los Angeles  family," said a spokeswoman for the project, "and the last lot was recently  sold to an international executive from overseas."  </P> <P> Lots were initially advertised for as low as $175,000; today, lot resales  average $600,000 to several million dollars.  </P> <P> John McCristy of Rancho Santa Fe Acreage &amp; Homes represented the  Heifermans, and Gary Driver Jr. of Fairbanks Ranch Realty had the listing.  </P></p>

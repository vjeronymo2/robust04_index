			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): 10 years' work but no pension On leaving the armed services in October 1945, I joined a large US company where I worked for 10 years. The pension scheme was non-contributory; as a result, no pension is being paid for the first decade of my working life. This seems unfair. The fact of the scheme being non-contributory should not of itself mean that no pension is payable - it would simply indicate that no contribution was due from you, the employee. We cannot tell from your letter why no pension is due but, for instance, it could be because the scheme provided death benefits only. (Reply by Andrew White of Gordon Leighton &amp; Co. who also provided the answer, 'Two incomes, two pensions', which appeared in Briefcase on November 19). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: No holiday for the ERM SEVERAL European central banks spent the French Bastille Day holiday intervening to support existing ERM parities, writes Stephanie Flanders. Both the French franc and Danish krone were under persistent speculative pressure yesterday, in spite of a limited cut in the German repo rate, frequent intervention by the German, French, Danish and Dutch central banks and a vow of support from France's President Mitterrand. The Danish currency began the day at the bottom of the ERM grid. Traders claimed that the Dutch and Danish governments had intervened in the market repeatedly during the day. The krone closed at DKr3.8951 against the D-Mark, only slightly above its floor of DKr3.9016. Also catching the markets' attention was the Spanish peseta, which lost more than 1.5 pesetas against the D-Mark to end at Pta78.70. Many traders thought that the krone and the peseta had diverted speculators' energies from the franc, but it was not left untouched. The French currency lost ground during the night and in morning trading on European markets, at times touching the FFr3.42 level against the D-Mark for the first time this week. Analysts were unimpressed with the 2 basis points reduction in the German repo rate, taking it as a sign that there will be no cut in official German rates at today's Bundesbank meeting. However, many market traders are still looking for a German cut, and may react aggressively if this does not transpire. Frequent small but public interventions by the Bundesbank held the franc within a FFr3.415 to FFr3.420 range. But the Bank of France also intervened, using a large commercial bank as an intermediary to purchase francs outside the country. The French unit closed in London at FFr3.417 per D-Mark, down from Tuesday's FFr3.414. In stark contrast to events on the Continent, sterling yesterday continued to make steady gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound finished at Dollars 1.5025, nearly a cent higher than the previous close of Dollars 1.4935. It showed even more strength against the ERM currencies, gaining nearly a pfennig to close at DM2.5775. In recent months, a number of dealers have claimed that DM2.58 was an important barrier. Although the pound may be experiencing some 'safe haven' gains from developments in the ERM, many in the market consider the British currency's recent strength to be long term. 'The rise in sterling is a continuation of the effect of Tuesday's output figures,' commented one London dealer. 'It is driven more by the all-round positive outlook for the economy, than any temporary ERM excitement.' The dollar weakened, with subdued US producer price figures and profit-taking between them taking the US currency down from the previous day's close of DM1.7200 to finish at DM1.7155. In New York it ended at DM1.7160.</p>

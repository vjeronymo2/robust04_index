A facility which lays off a registered nurse  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> other than a staff nurse <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  still meets the ``no layoff'' requirement if, in its attestation it attests that it will not replace the nurse with an H&hyph;1A nurse (either through promotion or otherwise) for a period of 1 year after the date of the layoff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nursing shortage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) The facility shall attest to one of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) It has a current nurse vacancy rate of 7 percent or more.

An explanatory statement does not have to be submitted for this attestation element, but supporting documentation for this attestation shall be maintained at the facility and shall be available for review in accordance with &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .350(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) It has had to eliminate or curtail the delivery of essential health care services due to a shortage of nurses, and provide brief explanatory information about the essential services eliminated or curtailed by the facility due to a nursing shortage, what documentation is available at the facility to substantiate this attestation, where this documentation is located and can be reviewed, and the applicable time period of the documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) It has been unable to effect established plans to provide needed new health care services in the community due to a shortage of nurses, and provide brief explanatory information about needed new services that have not been implemented by the facility due to a nursing shortage and which will be implemented with the availability of H&hyph;1A nurses, what documentation is available at the facility to substantiate this attestation, where this documentation is located and can be reviewed, and the applicable time period of the documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other substantial disruption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When an attesting facility finds that the indicators in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section cannot be demonstrated, or that such indicators are inappropriate to that facility, but that without the services of H&hyph;1A nurses, substantial disruption in the delivery of health care services of the facility still would occur due to a shortage or nurses, the facility shall provide an explanation of how a shortage of nurses has caused a ``substantial disruption'' in the delivery of its health care services. Such explanation shall be sufficient to provide a clear showing of ``substantial disruption'' in the delivery of specific health care services due to a shortage of nurses, and shall clearly explain why the indicators in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section cannot be met by or are inappropriate to that facility. In addition to the documentation required to be maintained by attesting facilities described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, facilities attesting under this paragraph also shall maintain and make available for inspection (as described elsewhere in this section) such additional documentation as is necessary to substantiate such claim of substantial disruption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentation of facility's nursing positions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The attesting facility shall maintain and make available for inspection (as described in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .350(b)) documentation substantiating: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The total number of nursing positions at the facility; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The number of nursing vacancies at the facility during a 12-month period ending no later than 3 months prior to submittal of the attestation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The number of nurses who left the facility during the same 12-month period; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The number of nurses hired by the facility during the same 12-month period; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The overall staffing pattern for nursing positions at the facility; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Australian fares Gone are the heady days of ultra-cheap fares on Australian domestic flights, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Efforts to 'deregulate' the nation's airline industry and encourage competition from new carriers have proved largely abortive, and the market has returned to a duopoly, with Ansett and Qantas (now incorporating Australian Airlines) as the two nationwide carriers. Average fares edged up by 6.5 per cent in the year to March, and now stand about 25 per cent below the pre-deregulation levels of 1990.</p>

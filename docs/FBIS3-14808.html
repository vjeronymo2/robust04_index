He has "a strong aversion for today's politicians", he  explained.    "I see no genuine politicians in this country; in its  leadership I see no people with whom an agreement could be  reached, who would honour their commitments. As compared with  them Machiavelli is a child. As for me, I attach particular  importance to moral standards in politics," said the former  chairman of Russia's parliament.    He intends to engage in taking an inventory of his papers,  Khasbulatov said.    "Ironically enough, I concluded two volumes of "World  Economics and International Economic Relations" by September  21st," he said. This book exposes "the entire absurdity of  economic reforms in Russia", he added.    Khabulatov believes that, had he not been released from  Lefortovo under the State Duma resolution, he would have gained  freedom anyway for a number of reasons.    "First of all, for the reason that the investigators failed  to confirm my guilt, and, secondly, because of my health," he  noted.    The tribulations of the past few months affected his health,  he said. "I experienced pains in my heart for the first time  ever, and so I'll have to take care of my health in earnest," he  said.    "During investigations it became clear that I was not  responsible for the attempts to seize the mayoralty and the TV  center. I addressed people after that, not knowing about the  bloody fighting in Ostankino," Khasbulatov said.    When asked about the possibility of returning the amnestied  men to Lefortovo, Khasbulatov said: such an attempt would "only  emphasize the stupidity of those who may seek to organize this".</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Mitterrand risks Paris split on N-weapons tests PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that France and other atomic powers should 'keep their cool' and refrain from following Beijing in breaking the recent unofficial moratorium in nuclear weapons testing. The president, in an interview with Austrian media, went beyond a bland statement issued jointly with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur which merely said France would consult with the US, Britain and Russia about possible reaction to the Chinese move. The socialist president has thus risked a split with the conservative government which is under pressure from its MPs and the defence establishment to reverse the unilateral moratorium the preceding Socialist government imposed on French testing in the South Pacific in April 1992. Mr Jacques Baumel, Gaullist vice-president of parliament's defence committee, said yesterday the Chinese move was 'a new and good reason' for France to resume necessary modernisation of its nuclear arsenal. This week Mr Balladur, who is committed to keeping the nuclear deterrent up to date, received a report from military-industrial leaders on the issue of testing. It is said to favour France resuming at least a few tests until it has improved its ability to simulate nuclear tests results by computer. The issue falls in the area of foreign and defence policy where decisions have to be shared by French presidents and prime minister even when they are of different political parties.

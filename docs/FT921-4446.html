			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Blunting Lamont's cutting edge FT-SE Index: 2,550.7 (+17.6) In theory, yesterday's consumer credit data and today's expected good news on producer prices should be ample excuse for an interest rate cut to accompany today's Budget. In practice, the chance appears remote despite signs of restiveness elsewhere in Europe. The Belgian central bank hinted yesterday that both it and the Netherlands are contemplating cutting rates below those of Germany. The latter in particular could justify such a move on the strength of both its fiscal and its inflation record. The Belgian and Dutch currencies are both stronger than the D-Mark within ERM, though neither country is likely to rush in with dramatic cuts. For the UK to join the experiment, moreover, would require France to move as well. The Franc is weaker than the D-Mark and it is still smarting after trying unsuccessfully to beat German rates last autumn. Assuming the election is to be on April 9, timing is also of the essence. In 1974 the old minimum lending rate (mlr) was cut after the election was called, but then it was set in response to an automatic formula and base rates did not follow. In 1979, mlr was cut to deter currency inflows, but parliament had not actually been dissolved. There is no reason to believe that the convention of leaving interest rates alone during the campaign has died with membership of the ERM - at least not where cuts are concerned. The same might not be true of an increase to defend the exchange rate if the market really took fright at the polls.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Arab bank returns to profit with Dollars 45m net ARAB Banking Corp (ABC), the biggest international Arab bank, has announced a turnround to net profits of Dollars 45m for 1991 from losses of Dollars 91m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Manama. Mr Abdullah Saudi, president and chief executive, said the bank, which is mainly owned by the Libyan Treasury, Kuwait's finance ministry and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, blamed the 1990 loss on the Gulf crisis. However it expected net profits of at least Dollars 100m in 1992. He said ABC had not been affected by United Nations sanctions against Libya. It was still accepting Libyan deposits and its relationship with Libyan authorities had not changed, he said. 'We have a normal relationship with Libya . . . and we are maintaining this relationship. We are operating in this country and we are receiving deposits here and this is acceptable and legal,' he said. Gulf-based bankers said last month Libya had shifted large amounts of its liquid assets from Europe to accounts in the Arab world to protect them against future economic sanctions. Mr Saudi said the bank was not on a list of Libyan-owned institutions with which US companies were banned from dealing. Nor was it likely to be placed on it in the future. ABC would maintain its policy of expansion in the Arab world and planned to open a representative office in Iran before the end of 1992, he said. Only about 15 per cent of the bank's assets are in the Middle East. The bank said Dollars 102m was allocated for 1991 loan-loss provisions, compared with Dollars 179m in 1990. Total income rose to a record Dollars 622m from Dollars 555m the previous year. Assets declined to Dollars 20.45bn from Dollars 20.55bn, while deposits climbed to Dollars 16.8bn from Dollars 16.6bn. Capital adequacy ratios exceeded international requirements of 8 per cent, standing at 10.8 per cent at the end of 1991.</p>

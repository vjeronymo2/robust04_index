			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURTS, PARENTS CALLED TOO SOFT ON DELINQUENTS  </P> <P> After three years and $735,000, the state Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem has  braved lampooning in "Doonesbury"and persistent snickering around the Capitol  to come to an old-fashioned conclusion: Spare the rod, spoil the child.  </P> <P> In a draft of its final report, to be released in January, the task force  concludes that the California juvenile justice system has contributed to low  self-esteem and a high crime rate by being too easy on delinquents.  </P> <P> While California imposes some of the nation's harshest jail sentences on  budding criminals, it is still too soft and has "neglected the offender's need  to accept responsibility for his or her choices and behavior," says the draft.  </P> <P> "When a youthful offender gets arrested for a relatively minor crime, such as  petty theft or vandalism, penalties are almost never imposed. The child is  counseled . . . or merely sent home to his or her parents," the report says.  </P> <P> "The message that the system gives this youngster is that society is not really  serious about expecting people to obey the law, and that very little, if  anything, happens when a juvenile breaks the law. . . . As a result, today's  juvenile justice system inadvertently encourages some youthful offenders to  continue criminal behavior."  </P> <P> The answer, the report says, is to get tough from the very beginning and  "attach a reasonable sanction to every criminal act, regardless of how minor."  Forcing a rookie criminal to face the consequences would make him accountable  and, thus, enhance his self-esteem, the report suggests.  </P> <P> The hard-line advice is perhaps the biggest surprise in the proposed final  report, circulated and discussed at a meeting Monday of the California Task  Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility.  </P> <P> Task force members also pointed out that their report concludes -- albeit  indirectly -- that Californians need to become more effective parents, and  suggests that classes in child-rearing be part of the public school curriculum.  </P> <P> The report culminates three years of hearings and discussions by the 25-member  panel. A number of the members are proponents of the "human potential  movement," which started work in 1987 to explore the suspected link between low  self-esteem and social ills such as substance abuse, teen-age pregnancies,  school drop-outs, gang violence and the poverty cycle.  </P> <P> The brainchild of Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), the state  effort has been ridiculed around the country as a California classic: a  touchy-feely "New Age" effort to grapple with some of society's most endemic  problems.  </P> <P> The most persistent lampooning came in a series of "Doonesbury" comic strips,  in which cartoonist Garry Trudeau chronicled the imaginary task force  appointment of actress and out-of-body traveler Barbara Ann (Boopsie)  Boopstein.  </P> <P> But Vasconcellos, who concedes his task force was first received as a "flaky"  effort, said Thursday that the laughter has died amid a wide-spread  appreciation for the state's landmark investigation into self-esteem.  </P> <P> As proof, Vasconcellos said that 46 of the state's 58 counties now have similar  self-esteem task forces; state government and citizen groups in New Mexico,  Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Washington also are establishing such panels.  </P> <P> "What's emerged that I didn't foresee is the enormous readiness of many, many  people to give this serious attention," said Vasconcellos, who emphasized that  the panel included traditional conservatives as well as members of the "human  potential movement."  </P> <P> Another task force member, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Raymond Gott,  said he was satisfied with the report's recommendation to get tough with  juvenile offenders, a view he cultivated among his colleagues by recounting the  failures of the court system.  </P> <P> "I cranked a little real world in there, didn't I?" asked Gott, head of the  Sheriff's Department's anti-gang units.  </P> <P> "Every time a kid crosses the line and violates the law, he or she should have  to pay a price," he said.  </P></p>

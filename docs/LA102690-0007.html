			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDUCTOR BERNSTEIN  </P> <P> I give Bernstein much of the credit for my lifelong appreciation of good music.  </P> <P> Many years ago, when I was very young, I watched his lectures on "Omnibus" and  thought he was just the coolest thing I'd ever seen. He convinced this  schoolgirl, on her relentless quest for hipness, that you could love classical  music without being square. I'm sure I'm joined by millions in being immensely  grateful for the wonderful gift that was Leonard Bernstein. Thanks, Lenny, and  Godspeed.  </P> <P> PATRICIA van HARTESVELDT  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK financial sector If today's CBI survey of financial sector companies is anything to go by, banks and building societies will use any further cuts in interest rates as an excuse to rebuild margins. True, spreads and commissions appear to be widening at a slower rate than during 1991, when base rates were falling. But the financial sector's determination is underlined by the fact that spreads increased at all during the third quarter, a period of static interest rates and deep recession. The intriguing question is how the banks and building societies get away with higher margins when they are also reporting demand for credit at a very low ebb. One explanation might be that borrowers prefer to accept a higher margin rather than run the risk of switching to a cheaper but unfamiliar source of funds. Fears of a credit crunch have so far proved unfounded, but it does not look as though lenders are in particularly generous mood either.</p>

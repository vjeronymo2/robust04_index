			<p>BFN     [Text] A former training ground -- situated in the  (?Krichev) Rayon -- of the 40th Russian Air Force Group has  caused big problems for the local administration. To use this  territory in the interests of the rayon, mine clearing, and land  improvement should be carried out, and the housing of the small  garrison should be repaired. The rayon executive committee  addressed the command staff of this unit and the Belarusian  Defense Ministry asking for help. However, foreign servicemen  refuse to perform this work. Therefore, the rayon executive  committee addressed the Mogilev Oblast Executive Committee to  plead with the Belarusian Government to resolve this issue on an  intergovernmental level.</p>

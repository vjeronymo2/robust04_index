			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Chung faces charges over election funds MR Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai business group, has been indicted on charges of illegal campaign funding and other alleged violations connected with his failed candidacy in last December's South Korean presidential election. The indictment could force Mr Chung to leave politics if he is convicted, and may weaken or dissolve the United People's party (UPP), the opposition group he established one year ago today. Prosecutors have conducted a highly-publicised investigation of Mr Chung's election activities in what is considered a government warning to the nation's large conglomerates against direct involvement in politics. The 77-year-old Mr Chung is the first Korean industrial leader to enter politics and challenge the government's tight control over business. The indictment is the culmination of an 18-month feud between the government and Mr Chung over his political activities. His presidential campaign is alleged to have illegally received more than Won50bn (Pounds 42.7m) from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's shipbuilding unit. The government began investigating Mr Chung shortly before the presidential election on December 19 and the allegation contributed to his poor electoral performance, in which he finished third to Mr Kim Young-sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal party. He is also charged with forcing Hyundai executives to work for the UPP and making slanderous statements against Mr Kim. He was also accused of beginning his campaign before the official period - campaigning is not permitted until 28 days before the election. Meanwhile, prosecutors are investigating allegations that HHI may have bribed government officials and bank executives. Both the UPP and the main opposition Democratic party charge that the government investigation against Mr Chung is biased, as prosecutors are ignoring complaints about alleged malpractices by the ruling party. The indictment coincides with growing dissension within the UPP caused by the party's poor showing.</p>

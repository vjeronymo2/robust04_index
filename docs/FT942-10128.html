			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Recovery found to be spreading to all regions Industrial recovery has spread to all regions, with manufacturing companies throughout the country reporting an increase in orders for the first time since early 1989. Yet the latest quarterly regional industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional consultancy, suggests that the improvement, although widespread, is not strong enough to offset all adverse local factors. A positive balance of companies in the 11 regions said orders rose in the four months to April, but returns pointed to a small decline in overall demand in northern England and Scotland in the four months to July. By contrast, the south-east and west Midlands, where companies experienced a severe recession, appeared to be in the forefront of recovery. This was a sign of the upturn becoming more firmly rooted, the survey says. Output increased in all regions except Northern Ireland in the four months to April: the first such rise in all mainland Britain for four years. Output is expected to rise everywhere except Scotland and the north during the four months to July. Mr Charles Burton, Business Strategies joint managing director, said Scotland and the north were hit by a reduction in North Sea oil investment. A boom in Scottish electronic production appeared to be ending, while industries in the north were hit by pit closures. The survey, carried out between March 25 and April 13, found that the east and west Midlands, the south-east and Wales had experienced 'appreciable' increases in demand during the past four months. The four regions, together with the north-west, East Anglia and Northern Ireland, expected continued strong order growth in the present four-month period. A positive balance of companies in all regions expected export order growth in the four months to July. Only Yorkshire and Humberside reported a net drop in export orders in the four months to April. The survey found companies in eight of the 11 regions planning to increase investment in plant and machinery in the next 12 months. Investment is still expected to fall slightly in the south-east, the biggest region, reflecting the depth of the recession. This set a low base for the recovery which so far has generated no powerful motive for investment. Manufacturing industry continued to shed jobs in most regions in the second quarter, although employment in-creased in Wales and the west Midlands compared with a year ago. The survey says that increases in demand and output are not leading to any marked increase in price pressures. CBI/BSL Regional Trends Survey, May 1994.

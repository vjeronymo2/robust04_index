			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Romanian ruling party seeks pact Romania's ruling party was yesterday in talks with the pro-reform Democrat party, after failing to meet a deadline to form a new governing coalition with the Romanian National Unity party, a hardline nationalist organisation, and other extremist parties, writes Virginia Marsh from Bucharest. The PSDR ruled out sharing power with the DP and other pro-reform opposition parties but said the talks were aimed at concluding a political pact with them. Meanwhile, more than 700,000 workers, mainly in heavy industry and mining, yesterday continued their general strike for a second day, the Alfa Cartel union said.</p>

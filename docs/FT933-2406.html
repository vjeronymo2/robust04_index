			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT and my accountant's fees Recently I have used my accountant to calculate Capital Gains Tax liability before making sales of investments, in order to avoid incurring tax. Owing to a miscalculation in one case a small liability has, in fact, been incurred. When I suggested to my accountant that his charge for this service could be offset against this liability he said that: 'Section 32(2) of the CGTA 1979 relates to professional fees relating to acquisition and disposal of assets and not the calculation for tax purposes.' It seems to me that when I sought my accountant's advice on the gains position before selling, this 'related to disposal of assets'. I should be grateful for your comment on this. Your accountant's fees, including VAT, will be deductible in calculating the chargeable gains or allowable losses to the extent that they relate to 'making any valuation or apportionment required for the purposes of the computation of the gain (or loss), including in particular . . . ascertaining market value where required', by virtue of section 38(2)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (which reenacts section 32(2)(b) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979). So, if you simply bought a parcel of shares after April 5 1982 and sold the entire holding, no part of your accountant's fee for doing the CGT calculation would be allowable. This is because he would not have had to do any apportioning or any ascertaining of market values. If you bought any shares before April 6 1982, on the other hand, his fee would be allowable to the extent that it covered the time which he spent looking up the March 31 1982 value in one of the books of prices for CGT purposes. If you sold only part of a holding, his fee would be allowable to the extent that it covered the time which he spent in apportioning the base cost between the shares sold and the remaining balance; and so on. If your accountant uses a computer service to calculate his client's CGT gains and losses, then the appropriate portion of his fee will be deductible from the figures produced by the computer (unless of course the computer program takes his prospective fees into account). The rules are quite arbitrary, as you see, like many - perhaps most - of the rules of capital gains tax: it is futile to try to discern any logical basis for Parliament's decision on which expenses should be allowable. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

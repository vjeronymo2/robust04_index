			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of the oblast </F> committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation,  prepared by Vladimir Kuzmenkin; place and date not given: "Not  Only Flag- Waving...."]    [Text] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation  has the biggest party organization in Novosibirsk Oblast in  terms of numbers. The communists managed to get two of their  representatives elected at the recent elections to the oblast  soviet--both winning in Berdsk. Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of  the oblast committee of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation, answers our questions today.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Viktor Yegorovich, how many  communists are there in Novosibirsk?    [Kuznetsov] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation  has  approximately 4,500 members. An oblast committee of the party  and rayon committees operate.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] What, in each rayon?    [Kuznetsov] In all but three rural districts, although there  are communists there, of course.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] We all remember full well what the  former CPSU oblast committee was. Is the oblast committee of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation similar?    [Kuznetsov] No, it is not at all the same thing. Our oblast  committee is made up of people elected from the rayons: 56  persons working on an unpaid basis. We hold plenums bimonthly.  There is, naturally, no administrative system such as there was,  just as there are not the opportunities for influence that the  CPSU oblast committee had.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Does the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation consider itself the successor of the CPSU? I  do not mean only in the ideological sense....    [Kuznetsov] In a property respect we undoubtedly consider  ourselves the successor of the CPSU. Although this is a question  around which there are a great many difficulties. But this is  not the most important issue, the main thing for us is  restoration of the organization. The people who have today  gathered together in the party ranks have done so not because  they will be given some position for this and not because they  can shout at demonstrations. Yes, there are people who express  themselves this way, but normal people who adhere to a balanced  position have come together in the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation. At this time, for example, we are discussing  the party program, and I can say that such documents were never  discussed so thoroughly before.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] The CPSU had immense experience in  the most diverse matters. Why do you reject it?    [Kuznetsov] This is a very complex issue. We are reaching  the  general conclusion that we cannot yet make full evaluations as  to why and in connection with what everything happened. What was  good and what was bad. It is still too early to speak of all  this with confidence. Work on comprehension of the processes is  under way, of course, research centers and scholars are at work.  But, I repeat, it is still too early to draw the final  conclusions.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Who is in the ranks of the Communist  Party today?    [Kuznetsov] Older people are preponderant, undoubtedly.  There  are few young people as yet, but there are young men in the  university, for example, who are joining us. More than 30,000  young people joined the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation nationwide in the period from last October through  this April. What is happening in the country is forcing people  to think, comprehend the situation, and make a choice.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] You are united, most likely, by a  rejection of Gorbachev and his policy?    [Kuznetsov] Well, Gorbachev is Gorbachev.... Rejection, of  course. There were big mistakes and much of what is now seen as  treachery. We have to evaluate why it happened this way. What  enabled events to develop this way, not otherwise. There were,  after all, the rules.... But the nomenklatura was victorious.  When the primary party organizations attempted to depose the  general secretary, so to speak, he held on to his position with  the aid of the bureaucratic machinery and the entire  nomenklatura system.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] What, then, there are no people from  the former nomenklatura in the Novosibirsk organization of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation?    [Kuznetsov] Why not? There are! And why not, for example,  lend an ear to Aleksandr Pavlovich Filatov, former secretary of  the oblast party committee, who left all communists thinking  good thoughts about his work in this office. He has now been  restored to membership of our party. And Vladimir Aleksandrovich  Mindolin also is a member of the Novosibirsk organization of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Do you intend to form your faction  in  the oblast soviet?    [Kuznetsov] The times now, it seems to me, are not such that  it is necessary to strictly distinguish a party faction. Reality  compels a search for a broader base. The questions that confront  us are very complex, and we need to do more than just go about  carrying a flag.... After all, if we say that it is only we who  know "what's right," and no one else, it is simply time to leave  the political arena. Society is today oriented toward many  goals, which frequently differ considerably among themselves,  and for this reason a pragmatic approach is greatly needed.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] There are, as we all know, several  communist parties here. What are their relations like?    [Kuznetsov] There will be no automatic combination--you may  be sure of this. Yes, we are for a union of communist parties,  but the decision we adopted was this: Each party with its own  rules and its own program may join the union and work in it as  if on a confederative basis. But there is no common roof nor  will there be....    As far as Novosibirsk is concerned, there are just two  serious organizations here: the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation and the Russian Communist Workers Party. The Russian  Communist Workers Party has its own image, distinct from ours,  but this does not prevent us mounting many actions together. As  far as the other parties are concerned, we jokingly call them  "two-bus parties".... You do not need to be told why, I  believe....    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Your aim is to come to power?    [Kuznetsov] This is the aim of every party. For us it is a  strategic prospect. We realize that no one party has a chance of  coming to power in today's Russia. And the goal is to create a  normal pragmatic opposition which assumes responsibility for the  search for the country's escape from the crisis. What is this  political accord about which so much is being said today?! It is  just another political show, beneath the clamor of which the  strict antipopular policy continues. And a change of course  could occur only at the demand of a broad coalition of political  forces, but not of one party.    [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] The final question. Does Gennadiy  Zyuganov want to become president?    [Kuznetsov] It is hard to say whether he does or not. But  responding to such a question at a recent party forum, Zyuganov  said that all our misfortunes are happening because a  presidential version of administration of the state has been  imposed on Russia. We have already surpassed the world in terms  of the number of presidents. We have no need of a presidential  federation of republics--it is time to switch to a normal system.</p>

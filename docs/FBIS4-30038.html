			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting of Bougainville representatives on both  sides of the secessionist uprising has called on the Papua New  Guinea [PNG] Government to agree to a resumption of talks as  early as next week. The call on talks for preparations for a  peace conference comes after a meeting of Bougainvillians in  Solomon Islands capital, Honiara, on Tuesday.    The Bougainvillians issued a joint statement asking the PNG  Government to urgently consider calling a cease-fire so that  senior leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA]  could attend the meeting. The statement said the terms of the  cease-fire could be negotiated. The statement said a lasting  peace and amicable solution to the Bougainville conflict could  only be solved by the people of the island themselves working  together with all sides involved.    A scheduled meeting earlier this week to discuss a peace  conference fell through because senior BRA leaders said that  they could not attend.</p>

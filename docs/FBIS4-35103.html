			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The metaphor about  the "milk and the cow" was thoroughly explained today by  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if  Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet -- it wants to take concrete  steps on the sea issue with Chile -- it must also get several  outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of  the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay-Parana waterway  and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay.    "Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though  problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all  fields -- cultural, political, and economic -- in all fields  related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific  and outlets through the waterway," said President Sanchez at a  news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of  his tour of the United States and Colombia.    The controversial statement made by President Sanchez de  Lozada after meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei  prompted a wave of protests for an allegedly antipatriotic  policy on the sea outlet issue.    This policy was denied today by President Sanchez de Lozada,  who said that the talk with President Frei was from any point of  view very positive, because the sea outlet issue will be debated  during the Rio Group summit next September.    "We want to see concrete things, concrete steps to improve  the Bolivian situation," said Sanchez de Lozada, who pointed out  the work being carried out by Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori, whom, he said, was carrying out "concrete" work  allowing greater binational contacts, one proof of which is the  highway linking the port of Ilo with the Bolivian border.    The explanation given by President Sanchez de Lozada on the  metaphor he used after meeting with President Frei was mainly  related to the fact that Bolivia has to use other "outlets" to  the Pacific and Atlantic, and these would be the port of Ilo in  Peru and the Paraguay-Parana waterway, because Bolivia is  entering a stage of economic and productive expansion for which  it is necessary to seek ports for exports.    Sanchez de Lozada said: "Even if Bolivia gets a sovereign  sea outlet -- and this is our great goal and struggle, which  will not change in this government or in any other -- we must  also find other ports that will not be Bolivian, but Chilean,  Peruvian, and on the waterway of the River Plate Basin. In its  projection abroad Bolivia must show that by negotiating with our  neighbors we can get benefits without having direct ownership of  those ports and their installations."    In this regard, President Sanchez de Lozada said there is a  feeling of solidarity in the neighboring countries (Peru,  Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) which makes him believe that  Chile will also enter a new stage of relations for mutual  benefit.    Therefore, said Sanchez de Lozada, it is hoped that for the  September meeting the Bolivian and Chilean Foreign Ministries  will prepare a work agenda that will consider the issues  dividing the two countries under a new spirit of friendly  relations.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: Retail sales catch a bad case of anaemia - Wall Street THE LOUD, wooshing sound echoing around the canyons of Wall Street yesterday was thousands of dealers and investors exhaling at the same time. They had been holding their collective breath all week, fearing that a strong producer prices index number on Friday would prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates as a precautionary measure against inflation. Low interest rates have sustained stock and bond markets - and Wall Street's profits - for two years, so any reversal in rates would represent an extremely unwelcome start to summer. Yet, when the PPI was published, those fears proved unfounded. Wholesale prices did not budge during May and the 'core' PPI, which excludes the volatile components of food and energy prices, rose only 0.2 per cent, no more than analysts had expected. The relief was palpable. Bond prices rallied and the Dow Jones index surged at the opening bell, rising 25 points in the first 30 minutes before dropping back later. Analysts did not have to look far for an explanation for May's flat inflation numbers. Also released yesterday were the May retail sales figures  -and they were disappointingly weak. Sales rose only 0.1 per cent last month and were unchanged, excluding the car sales figures. Although the April sales numbers were revised upward slightly, analysts were still surprised by the anaemic May data, which suggested that consumer demand remains subdued despite the fact that the economy is into its second year of recovery. What inflation, sales (and even the recent employment) figures point to is a low-growth, low-inflation economic recovery - exactly what the less excitable of Wall Street's economists have been forecasting for the better part of a year. Dealers were not the only ones sweating over the inflation numbers. The White House this week kept up its pressure on the Fed not to make any hasty moves on monetary policy. On Wednesday, President Clinton met Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to repeat the administration's view that the Budget deficit and the lack of economic growth, not inflation, are the central problems facing the country. Just to make sure the Fed got the message, commerce secretary Ron Brown said yesterday that the May producer prices figures were 'solid evidence that higher interest rates are unnecessary, given the current state of the economy.' While such comments were aimed as much at the financial markets as they were at the Fed, Greenspan is unlikely to take such a sanguine view of the inflationary picture. That picture is not yet developed fully, at least for the month of May, because the consumer price index is not due to be released until next week. If the Fed is to alter the emphasis of its monetary policy (which, in April, was shifted towards a possible tightening after worryingly strong inflation numbers were released), then it will come after the CPI surfaces. This helps to explain why the stock markets' reaction to the positive PPI data was, ultimately, so restrained. After an initial burst, share prices fell back from their highs yesterday morning and by midday were languishing, with only mildly impressive gains. The relatively disappointing performance of stocks at the end of the week was also a reflection of renewed concerns about the economic outlook - concerns that were heightened by an unexpected profits warning from Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3M), a Dow stock that is viewed widely as one of the best economic barometers in the market. On Thursday, shares in 3M - an industrial conglomerate which makes products that range from recording tape and office supplies to medical products and chemicals - plunged 8.6 per cent after the company said second-quarter earnings would fall short of market expectations. It blamed the slowdown in the economy. The sharp slide in 3M dragged down the Dow as well - the entire 20-point drop was attributable to 3M's decline. Another market leader warning about its profits outlook this week was Apple Computer, one of the biggest stocks traded on the electronic Nasdaq market. On Wednesday, Apple said its earnings in the second half of this year would be less than those for the same stage of 1992. Unlike 3M, however, Apple's sales are not struggling. The computer giant is suffering from the fierce price war among personal computer manufacturers, which is shrinking its profit margins. Price wars, of course, are usually the result of too many sellers chasing too few buyers. In other words, the weakness of consumer demand and the economy is hurting Apple, just as it is 3M.  ----------------------------- Monday     3522.13 - 13.01 Tuesday    3510.54 - 21.59 Wednesday  3511.93 + 01.39 Thursday   3491.72 - 20.21 Friday     3505.01 + 13.29  -----------------------------</p>

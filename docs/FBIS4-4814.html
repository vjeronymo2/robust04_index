			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia made a speech at the banquet  arranged by President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall today.    Norodom Sihanouk said he had the highest honour of visiting  again the DPRK in auspicious April greeting the birthday of  President Kim Il-song.    He further said:    Having been seriously ill and hospitalised between early  October 1993 and late February 1994, after my election as King  of Cambodia in September 1993 by the beloved people of Cambodia,  I am extremely happy and profoundly moved and honored to have  returned today beside Your Excellency who accord me the supreme  honour by considering me forever your close anti-imperialist  comrade-in-arms and your own brother. This is my greatest  happiness.    The forthcoming April 15 will be a very glorious historic  day  marking the 82nd birthday of Your Excellency, that the nation  and patriotic people of Korea within and without it will  celebrate with the greatest fervour and the greatest enthusiasm.    With our brothers and sisters of Korea, the Cambodian people  and all the other anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist,  anti-neocolonialist, anti-dominationist and anti-expansionist  progressive peoples aspiring after justice and freedom are full  of joy and pride to celebrate your august birthday and render a  vibrant hommage to Your Excellency the Great Leader who are the  greatest hero in Korea's history of thousands of years, the  great and immortal father of the chuche idea and the greatest  champion of the just cause of the Third World peoples fighting  against the injustice and menace from certain big powers and  against underdevelopment and for progress, freedom,  independence, territorial integrity, non-alignment and peace in  mutual respect and equality between all countries, big and small.    Your Excellency Generalissimo President Kim Il-song are and  will be the irreplaceable champion of this just cause.    We sincerely hope that Your Excellency will live more than a  hundred years for the greatest happiness of the nation and  valiant people of Korea and for that of us all and all peoples  who are indefectibly attached to Your Excellency the Great  Leader and who are united with the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea, the unique symbol of the independence of Korea.    Thanks to the wise leadership of His Excellency President  Kim  Il-song and His Excellency Marshal Kim Chong-il, the DPRK has  turned into a veritable paradise on Earth for the greatest  happiness and prosperity of the Korean people and a great  military power, modern and invincible, Norodom Sihanouk noted,  and continued:    Your formidable military power fully supports and will  support the cause of peace in your geographical region and the  rest of the whole world.    At present, certain foreign powers threatening peace in this  region and world peace are posing unjust threat to the DPRK.    As king and head of state of Cambodia, I have the honour of  expressing my full and invariable support to Your Excellency  the Great Leader and to the DPRK not only in the important  process of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  but also in the present dramatic situation in which the DPRK has  the absolute reason to defend with greatest fortitude its right  to be "the sole master of its own home" and of expressing my  total rejection to all foreign interference in the internal  affairs of the DPRK whose military policy is and will be purely  defensive.    Between 1955 and 1969, the Kingdom of Cambodia worked to  firmly defend its legitimate frontiers and its complete  independence and repulse all the attempts of interference in its  internal affairs on the part of certain foreign powers.    They did not allow its uncompromising spirit of independence  and this led to the coup d'etat of Lon Nol on March 18, 1970 and  the ensuing great war (1970-1975).    Today the danger of war is grave in the region in which the  DPRK is situated and consequently in East Asia and Far East,  nay, in all our Asia.    In this regard, the DPRK has committed no fault. It only  defended uncompromisingly its sacred right to complete  independence in its own territory and the pancha shila of  bandung and the five principles of peaceful coexistence,  including non-interference in other countries' internal affairs.    Your Excellency the Great Leader revered and beloved by the  Korean people have declared that the DPRK will not attack or  invade anyone.    The DPRK has the right to defend itself from the attack or  aggression of another country or administration.    The fidelity of the DPRK to peace and the five principles of  peaceful coexistence and the 10-point programme of Korean  reunification is indisputable and should be appreciated for its  just high courage by the United Nations organisation and others.    Cambodia and I stand and will always stand for this peace  and  the five principles and 10-point programme.    We Cambodian people will invariably solidarize with Your  Excellency the Great Leader and the glorious DPRK.</p>

Yuliy Vorontsov said on Wednesday [9  March] at a Security Council meeting on the situation in  Abkhazia.    Vorontsov noted that "the Russian Federation confirms its  most serious concern over the continuation of the Abkhazian  conflict.    "Outstanding important issues of a political settlement as  well as humanitarian problems, above all a return of several  hundred thousands of refugees and displaced persons to their  homes, create a real threat of a new bloodshed on a large scale.    "To prevent such a tragedy, the international community  should take energetic steps to give resolute support for the  peace process. We regard it very important for the Security  Concil to respond positively to repeated requests by the  Georgian leadership and the Abkhazian side on the immediate  start of a full-scale peace-keeping operation in the zone of the  Abkhazian conflict."    Vorontsov noted further that the Russian Federation  "attaches  much importance to progress in the negotiating process,  including the achieved understanding on a full-scale settlement  based on the unconditional respect for Georgia's territorial  integrity as well as ensurance of statehood and rights for  Abkhazia's multinational people".    "The Russian Government is firmly convinced that it is  necessary to deploy immediately a peace-keeping force in the  zone of the Abkhazian conflict to stimulate the peace process  and to lend it a successful and, eventually, irreversible  character.    "It is obvious that the final settlement of Abkhazia's  political status is impossible while over 50 percent of its  population is outside the republic and active stepts are being  made to change Abkhazia's ethnic composition.    "The Russian Federation fully shares the Georgian  Government's position that only the deployment of peace keepers  in the conflict zone can effectively ensure a ceasefire,  guarantee a safe and mass return of refugees and displaced  persons to Abkhazia and implementation by the sides of earliers  understnadings, including that on disengagement of Georgian and  Abkhazian Armed Forces, as well as disarmement and withdrawal of  all armed groups which arrived to participate in the conflict  from abroad.    "The Russian Federation favours proposals on immediate  deployment of peace keepers in the zone of the Abkhazian  conflict. Loss of time works against a settlement of the  conflict. The international community should prevent a new  bloodshed," Vorontsov stressed.</p>

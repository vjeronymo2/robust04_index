			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Germans hit lottery jackpot Lotto fever, which has gripped millions of Germans and their foreign neighbours and caused them to talk of nothing else in recent weeks, subsided yesterday with news that three groups of Lotto players would share a record jackpot of DM42m (Pounds 17.3m). After trying for 11 weeks to crack the burgeoning jackpot, the three so-called Lotto associations crossed the six correct numbers and had a lottery slip with the magical seventh number which has so far eluded millions of players. Germany's popular newspapers enjoy treating their readers to in-depth studies of the new millionaires, but it was unclear if they would be able to do so today because their identities remained a mystery. About 3,000 people have become millionaires playing the weekly Lotto. Until yesterday, the highest payout had been DM16.5m, shared by two housewives in 1992.</p>

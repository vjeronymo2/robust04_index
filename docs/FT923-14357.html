			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rates firm again RATES in the sterling cash markets continued to firm yesterday as the Bank of England forecast another large shortage which dealers found difficult to remove. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn in the morning, which was later revised upwards to Pounds 1.6bn. But dealers were slow to offer bills to the Bank throughout the day and the authorities had to provide late assistance of around Pounds 510m. Dealers explained the stickiness of the market by lingering hopes that the authorities might signal a cut in base rates. On Friday, the Bank shaved the rates at which it deals in longer dated bills. But the expectation that this would be the precursor to a rate cut was dashed again yesterday. The Bank failed to deal in longer dated bands, purchasing bills in Bands 1 and 2 at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent and repurchase agreements (repos) at 9 15/16 per cent. Dealers said that the Bank's reduction in the supply of Treasury Bills had also caused difficulties. 'The Bank has been issuing more gilts recently,' said one trader, 'and as a result they do not need to cover their funding by issuing more Treasury bills.' This gives dealers a smaller range of monetary instruments with which to operate. Cash rates ended firmer on the day, with the overnight rate rising to a peak of 11 per cent. 1-month money again closed at 10 1/16 per cent, but 3-month money, a key indicator of the market's view on rates, finished at 10 1/32 per cent from a previous close of 9 15/16 per cent. One-year money ended up, at 9 7/8 per cent, from a previous close of 9 13/16 per cent. The firming of longer-dated rates was also due to sterling's poor performance on the foreign exchanges, as the pound dropped  1/2 a pfennig to DM2.8850. Sterling futures responded in bearish fashion to the currency's decline. The September contract finished at 90.19 from a previous close of 90.25, and the December contract finished at 90.46 from a previous close of 90.50. In its morning operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 150m, and later Pounds 591m, in a 'repo' for resale on 27, 28 and 29 July. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 166m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 79m of Band 2 bank bills.</p>

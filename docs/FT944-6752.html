			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (1): Better technologies reap big rewards - Anxiety over global warming is now the strongest impetus for saving energy. But fear of oil scarcities is a more durable argument Not long ago, the impetus for energy efficiency came from traditional concerns: the high cost of energy, the need to conserve finite resources, and a desire by countries to reduce their dependence on imports for national security reasons. Today, all those concerns have weakened. Despite a recent blip, the price of oil is at its lowest point in real terms since the early 1970s. World reserves of oil and gas have been boosted by large finds in places as far apart as Colombia, Vietnam and the Shetland Isles. The lowering of East-West tensions and the decline in Opec's power have reduced worries about import reliance. But in their place, there is a new worry. As Mr David Nemtzow of America's Alliance to Save Energy puts it: 'The politics have changed. Now, it is overwhelmingly driven by the environment.' Specifically, the worry is over global warming, and the threat to the climate posed by growing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. More than 100 countries are signatories to the 1992 Rio convention which requires countries to try and bring CO emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But while this has given a fresh impetus to energy saving, it has yet to prove particularly strong. The global improvement in energy efficiency which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s has flattened out in the last few years. This should improve this year because the world economic recovery will bring on stream efficient new plant, and people will buy new cars and appliances which need less energy. But on the whole, progress is disappointing. The threat of global warming is not as potent as the fear of oil running out. Individuals who care deeply about the environment have been slow to insulate their homes or drive smaller cars. And businesses  - apart from those where energy is a major cost - tend to treat energy saving as secondary. At a recent conference in India, Mr Michael Jefferson, deputy secretary general of the World Energy Council (WEC), said: 'There is little evidence that either energy consumers or most energy policy-makers recognise the importance of raising energy efficiency and conserving energy in terms of effective action, or that this situation will change in the near future.' The fact is that governments have been reluctant to pass draconian laws to enforce greater energy efficiency. Most of them have preferred to set up 'partnerships' with energy users in which the main role is played by publicity, persuasion and a few tightly focused - and tightly financed - projects to promote energy saving technologies and information. 'We want to avoid excessive command and control,' says Mrs Christine Ervin, the US assistant secretary of state for energy efficiency who oversees a broad range of initiatives designed to encourage electric utilities, appliance manufacturers, car makers and businesses to produce more with less. The low cost of energy in most countries is one of the greatest stumbling blocks to the elimination of waste. Mr Andrew Brown of the energy efficiency division of the EU Commission in Brussels, (which has several information and technology programmes of its own) says: 'The challenge we face is detaching energy efficiency from prices,' and that will probably have to be done by persuading people that environmental damage is a 'cost' which everyone will ultimately have to bear. But until that detachment comes about, the raising of energy prices through taxation is still seen as one way of driving home the message. Several European countries including the UK have recently introduced forms of energy tax. But even here, achievements have been mixed. President Clinton failed to gain acceptance for his BTU tax last year, and the EU's proposed carbon tax has yet to leave the drawing board. But there are other methods. One is technology. The energy efficiency industry has made great strides in producing new methods and products: refrigerators which consume 30 per cent less electricity, boilers with high energy conversion capabilities, sophisticated thermostats and switches, demand side controls. The modernisation of the highly inefficient economies of East Europe, and construction of new power plants in China should also help the global picture. Alongside these developments, there is the rapid growth of consultancies and energy contract managers who make a living by cutting other people's energy costs. Mr Robert Skinner, director of the office of policy analysis at the International Energy Agency in Paris, believes that much of the change will be driven by technology. 'Traditional policies are almost irrelevant to what's going on,' he says. 'Technology is moving at such a pace that governments which take the old-style approach will get left behind.' However, one weakness of technology is that much of it still requires subsidy: for example 'renewable' technologies such as wind power or bio-mass combustion, or some of the more exotic gadgetry. Others, such as combined heat and power where the heat from electricity generation is used for industrial or residential purposes, encounter institutional obstacles, even though their efficiency is high. Mr Ton van der Does, chairman of Cogen Europe, the CHP trade group, believes that Europe's tradition of large, state-owned power stations stands in the way of CHP schemes which, by their nature, are local and entrepreneurial. 'The industry is still shaped by the old structures,' he says. 'The trend towards energy efficiency is not going as fast as everyone would like. But there is a change of mentality, specially with regard to co-generation, and that is important.' A further element in the debate is competition. In many countries, the absence of free pricing of energy or of free access for new suppliers is a major obstacle to efficiency. Although many countries are now following the UK in privatising their electricity industries, this process has a long way to go. But, as the UK has discovered, it can be a double-edged sword: greater competition also means cheaper energy, and that works against greater energy efficiency. In the medium term, the drive for energy efficiency will be dictated - barring an unexpected leap in energy prices - by the strength of countries' commitment to the Rio convention. It is still too early to say whether the CO reduction targets will be met. But over the coming months, signatories will be preparing for the March 1995 conference in Berlin where they will review progress and take the first steps towards setting further targets for beyond 2000. Mr Michael Grubb, who heads the energy and environmental programme of London's Royal Institute of International Affairs, says that 'much of the steam has gone out of it' because the public and the media have turned their attention elsewhere. This makes him doubtful that solid progress will be achieved in Berlin. On the other hand, 'no country can backtrack now', he says. Moreover, the latest scientific evidence tends to reinforce the view that the global warming threat is real, so the pressure for action will remain.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in  Japanese at 0207 GMT on 30 January, in its regularly-scheduled  "Sunday Project" program, which begins at 0100 GMT, announces in  a two-minute report the results of a nationwide telephone poll  conducted earlier during the program.    Announcer Kayoko Miyata says that responses were obtained  from 929 eligible voters. The number of respondents to each  question is not given, however. All polling figures are as  heard.    In the wake of the Diet's approval of the political reform  bills, an unidentified poller earlier asked pollees several  questions on their reactions toward the enactment of the bills,  as well as their views on economic trends. In response to the  first question, which asks whether the respondents support the  Diet's approval of the political reform bills, 72.2 percent of  pollees say "yes," 14.4 percent say "no," and 13.3 percent say  they "do not know." On the same question, 68.6 percent of  pollees who are supporters of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan say "yes," 17.1 percent say "no," and 14.3 percent say  they "do not know."    When the pollees are asked if they have become more  confident  about the nation's politics after observing the process of the  debates on political reform, the largest group, 33.5 percent,  says that their attitude toward politics "remains unchanged"  even after the reform bills have been enacted. Moreover, 33.4  percent say that their confidence in politics has been "damaged"  through the process of debates. Only 17.9 percent say that they  "became more confident about politics," while 8.9 percent say  they "have no interest in politics," and 4.3 percent say they  "do not know."    On a question which asks how the enactment of the bills is  affecting the stagnant economy, 66 percent say that this "cannot  boost the economy," and 26 percent say that it "might bring  about some signs of an economic recovery." Only 3.7 percent say  that this will "boost the economy," and 4 percent give other  responses or the "do not know" answer.    Miyata next says that 76.9 percent of those polled expressed  support for the Hosokawa cabinet. The report then ends.</p>

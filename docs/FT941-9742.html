			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Upper CGT limit on sale of a chattel Will you please tell me what is the current upper limit for exemption from CGT on the sale of a chattel with a life of more than 50 years? Does the exemption figure apply to the sale price at auction, or the net figure received after auctioneer charges such as commission, insurance etc? Section 262(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'Subject to this section, a gain accruing on a disposal of an asset which is tangible movable property shall not be a chargeable gain if the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal does not exceed Pounds 6,000.' So, the answer is that the limit is a sale price of Pounds 6,000 (not net proceeds of Pounds 6,000). Ask your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet to capital gains tax, CGT14. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

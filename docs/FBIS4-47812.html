			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The executive committee of the High Council of  the Republic-Transitional Parliament today presented a report to  the plenary session on the various candidacies for premiership.  Seven out of 14 candidacies were retained for being in line  with the spirit of Article 78 of the transitional Constitution.  This report will be discussed on 4 May but in the meantime  parliamentary procedures will be put in place. Ekofo Isausu has  the details:    [Isausu] [passage omitted] The seven candidates retained are  the following: Peye Yejeme, Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda,  Kengo-wa-Dondo, Lunda Bululu, Malumba Mbangula, Etienne  Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, and Mulumba Lukoji. They are considered  as candidates of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and  Allies. Candidates whose applications were rejected are:  Faustin Birindwa, (Jembi Kalubiyi Manchanga), (Kanga Fubiye),  (Gudu Mbangana), and Arthur Zaidi Ngoma.    No applications fully complied with the laid down conditions  because the negotiations that should have been held inside and  outside the various groups did not take place. However, the  committee said it accepted the seven candidacies because they  are in line with Article 78 of the transitional Constitution and  in line with its preconditions and can therefore be submitted to  the head of state for the appointment of a prime minister.

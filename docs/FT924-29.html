			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Cerus to bail out banking subsidiary CERUS, the French investment company linked to Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the troubled Italian industrialist, has been forced to bail out Banque Dumenil Leble, its banking arm, as part of a FFr430m (Dollars 96.5m) rescue package. This is the latest in a series of gloomy announcements from the French banking industry, which has been badly hit by the the economic slowdown. Dumenil has been in trouble for some time. It has suffered, like other French banks, from the problems of the property sector. It has also been affected by internal problems which resulted in the closure of its Swiss operation. Cerus, which recently reported a first-half loss of FFr377m, has already been forced to provide extra capital for Dumenil. The bank lost FFr492m in the first half after making provisions of FFr540m for its property losses and the Swiss closure. However Dumenil now needs additional capital of FFr430m to avoid breaching its banking ratios. Cerus, which directly holds 25.6 per cent of Dumenil and holds the rest through Societe Financiere de Geneve - a Swiss-based bank it controls - is providing FFr221m. The rest is coming from Societe Financiere de Geneve. The news of Dumenil's refinancing follows the announcement this week that this year's losses from Olivetti, the Italian electronics group chaired by Mr de Benedetti, would be worse than expected at between L300bn and L350bn. The reorganisation of the Lagardere family interests was finalised yesterday when shareholders of MMB, the French family's master company, approved plans to change the share structure and to change the name to the Lagardere group. The changes were triggered when Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman, announced plans to merge Matra, the defence electronics concern, with the Hachette media group.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Gardening: Bothered by badgers? Here's a hint - Robin Lane Fox welcomes a new book of green-fingered tips from top people KEEN GARDENERS are nature's insider dealers: they are extremely keen on tips and will act on private information so long as it is not in the public handbooks. Whenever I have given a lecture on gardening, the audience has been most intrigued by the advice which questioners give one another without any help from me. They know how to turn squirrels into a stew; they know why liquid fertiliser is improved by adding soapy detergent; they usually kill their dandelions by filling them up with salt. I often wonder where these great reservoirs of information have been stored up and how they circulate. We now have the ultimate book for insider gardening: Superhints, compiled by Lady Wardington and published by Michael Joseph at Pounds 8.99. It is the sequel to her best-selling book on Superhints for Householders and as before, all royalties will go to charity. Superhints for Gardeners (from the great and green-fingered) deserves a wide public, although I admit to having contributed a re-cycled tip myself. Some of the Superhints will satisfy your curiosity. You can discover how Princess Michael of Kent copes with annoying wasps, or what Michael Heseltine really thinks about the possibilities of a recovery from near-death. I will treasure some of the practical wisdom. It ranges from a buyer who will pay for the clippings from yew hedges and use them in cancer research to a remedy from the experienced Paul Miles which is said to 'deal with' honey fungus. He tells us to apply one pint of creosote, stirred (but not shaken) in two gallons of water. This mixture should be sprayed on to the ground, not the leaves of affected plants: that will stop the fungus although it will also brown the grass for a while. Paul Miles ought to know and his chief advice answers one of the most frequent queries in the FT postbag. It is amazing what famous people will work out for themselves. Prue Leith takes time off from cooking to cut the legs of old tights into strips with which she ties up her roses: they are 'much gentler than wire and cheaper than rose ties.' I am not sure that I agree with the BBC presenter who tells us that 'large lemonade bottles full of water' will discourage visiting cats if put in their favourite places. But I do agree with the contributor who tells us to 'hoe when you do not need to hoe, and then you never need to hoe.' The most efficient weeding is carried out on apparently bare soil. Why are tips so irresistible? Sometimes we feel smug because we all know them anyway: Rabbi Lionel Blue feels that he has to tell us to grow basil because it is good in sauce for spaghetti. Sometimes, superhints are seductive because they are wonderfully cheap. I can see the logic in making plant-supports out of old metal coat-hangers twisted into squares and hooked on to a cane. Sometimes, one superhinter trumps another. One tells us to spend winter evenings on the job of making tubes out of newspaper in order to sow the seeds of sweet peas inside them and allow the roots to spread without damage. Another has an easier tip: use up the lavatory roll and then take out the central core and sow the seeds inside it. You can then transplant the seedlings into the garden without damaging the tap-roots. Seeds for the loo roll include parsley. It should be sown on Good Friday, according to one tipper, and the seed should be mixed into a cup of hot water, according to a head gardener, in order to soften it. Above all, it is fun to find how much is still unknown to dictionaries and authors from the Royal Horticultural Society. When I try to grow eremurus, the tall Foxtail Lily, I often find that the centre of the plant rots away in wet weather. Gardening books have no suggestion, but Lady Salisbury tells us to put an old tile under the crown of the plant and to spread the roots outwards on either side to stop the damp settling under the centre. She has also planted more yew hedging than most of us do in a lifetime; she rightly tells us to ignore contrary advice and never to cut the top of a yew hedge until it has reached the height which we want. It is quite untrue that that this treatment will cause it to go bad at the bottom. You see the range of hints on offer. How sweet it is, said Lucretius, the Latin poet, to watch the troubles of others on the high seas from the safety of the shore: it is sweeter, in our caring society, to read experts' long rigmaroles about the treatment of toadstools in lawns when the answer is simply to dose them with Epsom Salts. It is even sweeter to discover how other people deal with uninvited animals. Forget those Green platitudes about 'nature's fellow-citizens': keen gardeners see off moles by putting mothballs or musical birthday cards down the mole-run: (they are said to be deterred by the repeated tune of 'Happy Birthday'). My brother, I discover, puts holly-leaves round pea-seeds to deter mice which try to dig them up. I never knew that he was so prickly and now wonder what he puts down against a brother who sometimes tries to dig up bits of his better plants after a tour of his large garden. The ultimate tip? It comes from Annabel Allhusen, a garden designer. I have had a lady badger in my garden all year, but if she becomes troublesome, I now discover that I should invite as many men as possible to a dinner party, fill them up with wine and turn them put into the garden so that they will 'mark territory' around boundaries where badgers enter. Some of you might prefer a superhint to deal with male guests who relieve themselves on your lawn in the twilight. Not so Miss Allhusen: 'After heavy rain, you have a lovely excuse for another party.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The French Foreign Ministry has expressed its  outrage at the announcement of another massacre in Rwanda -- 170  people, including many children, were kidnapped and killed in  Kigali.    It is urgent that, during the OAU summit in Tunis, the  countries in the area do their utmost in order to persuade the  belligerents in Rwanda to put an immediate end to the fighting,  the Foreign Ministry said. It has also called on the reinforced  UN mission to be deployed as soon as possible in order to  intervene between the two sides.</p>

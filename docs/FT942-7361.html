			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Australian investment falls 5% Investment by Australian companies fell more than 5 per cent between the December and March quarters of 1993/4, a decline which casts further doubts over the optimistic assumptions on which the federal government has based its 1994-95 budget calculations. According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, real private capital expenditure on equipment, plant and machinery dipped from ADollars 4.195bn to ADollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2bn to Pounds 1.88bn), while spending on buildings fell from ADollars 2.027bn to ADollars 1.984bn. The corresponding figures for the March quarter of 1993 were ADollars 4.144bn and ADollars 1.876bn respectively. The figures are significant because the federal government is banking on a substantial upturn in business investment to help boost economic growth to about 4.5 per cent in 1994-95 fiscal year. It needs growth of this order to generate extra tax revenues, to fund a number of welfare-related schemes, most notably, an ambitious jobs programme designed to address Australia's double-digit unemployment rate. In his budget speech earlier this month, Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, forecast a 14.5 per cent increase in business investment during 1994-95, after a predicted rise of 1 per cent in the current year. This figure was in line with some private-sector expectations, but was at the upper end of the forecasting range. The government's projections immediately encountered scepticism from some employer groups, which felt Australian companies were still seeking efficiency gains rather than new capacity, and suggested that profit improvements among small and medium-sized businesses are lagging those in large, quoted corporations. Yesterday, Mr Willis defended the government's projections, saying overall expectations for the year were unchanged, and that he expected the 'realisation ratio' (the ratio of actual investment to expected investment) to increase. But analysts, who had been expecting a modest investment pick-up in the March quarter, or a stable position at the least, were surprised by the data. 'The fall in plant and equipment expenditure in the March quarter is unexpected, puzzling and disappointing,' Mr Chris Caton, chief economist for Bankers Trust Australia, commented. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the nation's largest employer group, is to lodge a formal complaint with the International Labour Organisation over new federal legislation on industrial relations next week. The ACCI claims the law, passed at the end of last year and highly unpopular among employers, breaches fundamental principles of collective bargaining and does not allow companies to bargain freely with employees without being impeded by compulsory arbitration and centralised awards.</p>

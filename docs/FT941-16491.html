			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Grounded after a bumpy flight: Stephen Wolf, stepping down as chairman of United Airlines, speaks to Paul Betts Mr Stephen Wolf is paying the ultimate price to secure the future of his company United Airlines, the largest US carrier. To win up to Dollars 5bn of wage and productivity concessions from the company's 80,000 employees to compete against the new breed of low-cost US domestic airlines, Mr Wolf has agreed to step down as chairman and chief executive in June. The airline's president, Mr John Pope, and its legal counsel, Mr Larry Nagin, are also leaving. Mr Wolf conceded that his decision to go was not only unusual but unprecedented. 'I am a little melancholy about leaving, but I am also happy because I think the employee buy-out of the airline and the wage and benefit concessions they are making is the best alternative for the company, its employees and its shareholders,' he said during a visit to London last week. Just before Christmas, the United board accepted an offer by its workers to take a majority stake of between 53 per cent and 63 per cent in the airline. If the buy-out, the biggest in US corporate history, is completed as expected by June, Mr Wolf, once reported to be the highest-paid executive in America, will probably walk away an even richer man than he already is. His three-year contract will be honoured. His last published salary was Dollars 575,000 in 1992 and he also holds considerable stock options and shares. Mr Wolf said he would not be receiving an additional golden handshake and that he would have preferred to continue earning his salary by actively running the airline during the next three years. 'But the pilots and machinist unions wanted me to leave and constitute a new board as a condition for the buy-out and wage concessions and I will do that,' he said. Ironically, Mr Wolf will leave United a much stronger airline than when he was brought in to revive the sleeping giant of US aviation at the end of 1987. Although he never won the hearts of the union leaders, he has succeeded in transforming United, once focused on the US domestic market, into a powerful global carrier with probably the most extensive network in the world and Dollars 2bn of cash reserves. In the 1980s, United, known in the US airline industry as the '900lb Gorilla' because of its size, lost its way as well as its number one position in the industry to American after a crippling strike by its pilots. The company dropped its strategy of a global integrated travel group by divesting itself of its Hertz rent-a-car business, and its Westin and Hilton International Hotel activities. 'We returned the company to its core airline business, modernised what was one of the oldest fleets in the industry and put into place what I believe is the best route structure of any airline in the world,' Mr Wolf said. 'We also made some improvements in our costs but our labour contracts inherited from the days before deregulation simply could not work in a low cost airline environment.' United's unit costs are much lower than those of its big European competitors. 'British Airways' costs are about 35 per cent higher than ours, Lufthansa's about 90 per cent more and Air France 100 per cent plus higher,' said Mr Wolf. But the cost base was still much too high to compete against the new low-cost carriers in the US domestic market. Faced, in addition, with the worst postwar recession in the air transport industry Mr Wolf slashed United's long-term capital spending programme by Dollars 5.5bn this year on top of an earlier cut of Dollars 3.6bn in 1992. 'At the end of 1992 we also took one significant run against operating costs by laying off 2,800 people, but it was not enough and we went to the union leaders to try to make a significant adjustment to our overall labour costs,' he explained. United had three options. 'The first was the status quo: do nothing until the market picks up. But it was no longer just a cyclical problem, it was a structural one. US consumers were telling us they wanted low fares as well as safe airlines. So the status quo was no option,' Mr Wolf said. The second was to co-operate with the unions to achieve a dramatic change in working practices and wage and benefit costs. The third, he explained, was to forge ahead irrespective of the unions with a sweeping restructuring programme including the setting up of separate low-cost airline subsidiaries within the company, contracting out service and aircraft maintenance operations, selling assets and laying off thousands of workers. 'That last option would have been very difficult and confrontational: we would have faced a labour conflict to the nth degree,' he said. From the day he took over at United, Mr Wolf has had to wrestle with particularly hostile labour relations, especially from his pilots. His appointment was welcomed by Wall Street because of his reputation as an expert in rescuing troubled airlines. After learning the airline industry ropes in 15 years at American, he spent short stints as head of marketing at Pan Am and president at Continental. Then, in less than three years as head of Republic, he turned the Minnesota loss-making airline to profit and paved the way for a merger with Northwest. He moved on to Tiger International where he pushed its Flying Tiger air cargo business to record profits before it was merged with Federal Express. But if United's motto has long been 'Fly the Friendly Skies', Mr Wolf found few friends in the airline. Since the 1985 strike, the airline's pilots have sought to take control of the company and put their man in the top slot. Mr Wolf's salary when he joined - he was reported to have earned Dollars 6m in his first year largely as a result of compensation for stock options he left behind at Tiger International - won him even fewer friends among the airline's employees. But he has persevered in his strategy to return United to the number one position in the US industry. Mr Wolf said he would continue working aggressively to try to complete his strategic plan before stepping down in June. He has just announced further expansion in Pacific services including a substantial increase in flights to China: the company is about to open a huge new maintenance base at Indianapolis: he is continuing lobbying hard to win approval from the UK government to fly from London to the airline's main hub of Chicago: he is in the thick of negotiations with the German and US government authorities to get a marketing alliance with Germany's Lufthansa off the ground. 'When I hand over the ignition keys to my successor United will be a superbly engineered company,' he claimed in an ironic reference to Mr Gerry Greenwald, a former vice-chairman of the Chrysler motor company widely tipped as the unions preferred candidate to head the airline. Mr Wolf said he had made no plans for the future. He hinted he might consider a job outside the industry, but others expect he is likely to be approached by United competitors. His biggest consolation is that he believes he is setting a new trend in the US airline industry. 'Our big US competitors will also have to react and I can see them all, American, Delta, USAir eventually taking the same employee participation road. That is the price of survival,' Mr Wolf said, donning his Stetson hat and riding out, a tall lonesome figure, in the western sunset.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED AIRLINES: THE WOLF LEGACY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             1987           1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aircraft Fleet                             382            545 Average age (years)                         13.8            9.6 Countries served                            13             33 System ASMs** (bn)                         101.3          150.4 Domestic ASM (bn)                           86.2           96.6 International ASMs (bn)                     15.1           53.8 % international capacity                    15             36 Average daily passengers               150,685        190,879 Total employees                         62,032         81,512 Operating revenue (Dollars)               8.36bn           12.9bn Net earnings (Dollars)                     335m            15m*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * Jan-Sept ** Available seat miles.

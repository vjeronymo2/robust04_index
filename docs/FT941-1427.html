			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Operators to pay landfill charges The cost of monitoring and inspecting licensed landfill rubbish dumps will be transfered from the taxpayer to waste management companies from May, Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, announced yesterday. The new rules are part of the government's much-postponed waste management licensing regulation, which comes into force on May 1. Mr Atkins said the change was 'an important extension of the 'polluter pays' principle'.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY SAYS HEALTH BENEFITS ARE KEY ISSUE IN STRIKES;  </P> <P> LABOR: DISPUTES OVER MEDICAL COVERAGE MOTIVATED 78% OF STRIKERS IN 1989, THE  REPORT FINDS.  </P> <P> The percentage of strikers who walked off the job over health benefits more  than quadrupled during the late 1980s as soaring medical costs led to a  breakdown in labor-management relations, a union report said Monday.  </P> <P> A study by the 925,000-member Service Employees Union found that disputes over  health coverage motivated 78% of the strikers in 1989. In 1986, health benefits  were a prime factor for only 18% of the strikers whose motivations could be  determined.  </P> <P> In 1989 alone, strikes over health coverage cost the economy $1.1 billion in  lost wages, said the study, which was based on statistics from the Labor  Department and the private Bureau of National Affairs.  </P> <P> The study concluded that "both sides are losing" in the battle over health  benefits and called for united action on health-care reform.  </P> <P> "Rapidly rising health-care costs in the 1980s have fueled an escalating  breakdown in labor-management relations," it said.  </P> <P> "Looking ahead to the 1990s, continued double-digit health care cost inflation  threatens our country with escalating labor unrest and the eventual destruction  of employer-provided health insurance as the major vehicle for providing health  coverage."  </P> <P> Much of the increase in benefits-related strikes in 1989 can be attributed to  the walkout by more than 150,000 workers against the regional telephone  companies, said John Howley, senior policy analyst with the service workers.  </P> <P> The phone workers represented about a third of the 432,600 strikers during the  first 10 months of 1989, the period for which statistics were available, he  said. There were 506,200 strikers in all of 1986.  </P> <P> The study examined strikes involving more than 1,000 workers each. Using news  reports and interviews with strikers, it determined causes for walkouts  involving 79% of strikers in 1986 and 97% of strikers in 1989. Only strikes for  which causes were determined were included in the report.  </P> <P> The study said labor and management negotiated health benefits for 40 years  without serious disputes. But recently, it said, employers "in desperation"  have tried to shift rising health costs to workers, fueling unrest.  </P> <P> The report said workers covered by plans with cost sharing paid 6.6% of their  after-tax earnings for health premiums in 1988. It predicted that if current  trends continue, the figure would rise to 27% by 1998.  </P> <P> Sharon Canner, National Assn. of Manufacturers assistant vice president of  industrial relations, said employers agree that reforms are necessary to  control health-care costs and stave off future strike activity.  </P> <P> "You just can't indefinitely expand employee share. Particularly at lower  income, there are people who just can't bear the freight," she said. "We have  had a lot of conversations with labor. I think we agree on what the problems  are. We differ on the solutions."  </P></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / NZ to keep to tough policies MS RUTH Richardson, New Zealand finance minister, said yesterday her election-year budget next week would stick to economic policies that have led the country out of economic crisis but made the government deeply unpopular, Reuter reports from Wellington. She said in an interview that the July 1 budget - five months before a general election - would display fiscal responsibility to maintain New Zealand's economic recovery. Ms Richardson said she expected the deficit to swing into surplus before the turn of the century.</p>

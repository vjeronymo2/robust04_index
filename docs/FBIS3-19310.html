The agreements replace the treaty with the  dissolved CSFR. They are oriented toward the EU agreements with  Poland and Hungary and envisage a further opening up of the  market, as the FRG Economics Ministry announced. In contrast to  the old agreement with the CSFR, the new agreements permit an  immediate unilateral cancellation of the treaties in case of  severe violations of the principles of democracy and of human or  minority rights.</p>

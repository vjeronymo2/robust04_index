			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Israeli kidnap puts peace in jeopardy Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation was facing its gravest test last night over the kidnapping by Hamas extremists of an Israeli soldier. Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, made clear that he was holding Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, personally responsible for the fate of 19-year-old Nachshon Waxman. The soldier was kidnapped close to Ben-Gurion airport outside Tel Aviv on Sunday, and is believed by Israel to be held in the Palestinian autonomous area of the Gaza Strip. Responsibility has been claimed by the military wing of Hamas. Announcing on Tuesday that they were holding Mr Waxman, the kidnappers have said they will kill him tomorrow unless Israel releases dozens of Palestinian prisoners, including the Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. The crisis marks a moment of truth in the Israel-Palestinian autonomy process, with Hamas clearly seeking to derail the peace accords, undermine Mr Arafat's authority in the occupied territories, and provoke greater opposition inside Israel to the moderate Rabin government. Adamantly opposed to any accommodation with Israel, Hamas already appears to have achieved some of its objectives. Israel has suspended negotiations in Cairo with the PLO on the next stages of the autonomy process, and fuelled further discontent among Gaza's Palestinian labour force by clamping a closure order on the Strip that prevents workers travelling to Israel. Mr Rabin spoke several times by telephone to Mr Arafat yesterday, urging a search, and telling him that he regarded the crisis as a 'true test' of relations. A PLO official, who asked not be named, said Palestinian security forces were due to begin arresting Hamas activists last night in an effort to discover the whereabouts of the soldier. 'The Supreme Security Council of the Palestinian Authority has taken a decision to continue investigations and searching for the captive soldier. . . More extreme measures also will be taken whereby a wave of arrests of Hamas activists will start. . . until the Palestinian (self-rule) Authority arrives at the truth as to how he was kidnapped and where he is,' the official said. Israeli ministers said that, were the kidnapping to end in Mr Waxman's death, there could be serious consequences for the future of the autonomy process. 'If the autonomous areas turn into a shelter for murders,' said Mr Amnon Rubinstein, education minister, 'Israel cannot be expected to expand those areas'. Interviewed on Israeli television last night, Sheikh Yassin urged the kidnappers not to kill Mr Waxman. 'It would serve no purpose,' he said. 'Our religion requires us to keep him alive and treat him well.' Mr Arafat condemned the kidnapping and held a rare meeting with Hamas leaders. Several of his spokesmen issued statements denying the soldier was being held in Gaza. This denial was echoed by Hamas. 'We strongly deny the kidnapped soldier is in the autonomous areas,' said a telephone caller speaking on behalf of Hamas' military. Yesterday, the kidnappers released a video showing Mr Waxman, who holds dual US-Israeli citizenship, and who was conscripted six months ago, pleading for his freedom. Looking dazed but controlled, he urged the government to meet his captors' demands. The Hamas militants also took credit for a shooting spree in central Jerusalem on Sunday, during which two people were killed and more than a dozen injured before the gunmen were themselves slain. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, head of the PLO delegation to the suspended autonomy talks in Cairo, said last night that it was 'unfair' of Israel to have broken off the negotiations. Israeli officials made clear that the talks had been postponed rather than called off.</p>

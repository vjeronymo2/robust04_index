			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on regional reaction to the GATT ruling on restrictions  imposed on Latin American banana exports by the EC monitored  through 20 January. Source is cited in parentheses following  each item.  <H5>  COSTA RICA </H5>   Costa Rica today applauded the GATT ruling through Economy  Minister Roberto Rojas who described the GATT ruling as a "great  triumph for the region" He also voiced hopes that the ruling  "will convince the EC to modify the import regime imposed since  1 July" on Latin American bananas. Rojas added that Costa Rica  has been in the vanguard in the struggle against restrictions to  the banana market and will continue "to struggle." He, however,  admitted that this struggle will be "as difficult as the one  waged so far." The minister pointed out that he will work with  his trading partners within GATT to achieve this goal. (Hamburg  DPA in Spanish 2046 GMT 18 Jan 94)    The representatives of the National Chamber of Agriculture  and Agro-Industry have termed the GATT ruling as important and  historic. Executive Director Jose Carlos Barquero said this  confirms it is possible to resort to this mechanism to settle  international trade problems without undue influence from the  political weight of the countries involved. He added that  "because of this ruling, minority groups will have an  appropriate base to face conflicts that affect them and involve  powerful nations." (San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 20  Jan 94)  <H5>  ECUADOR </H5>   Diego Paredes, Jose Vicente Maldonado, and Mariano Gonzalez,  the Ecuadoran ministers of foreign affairs; industry, commerce,  integration and fisheries; and agriculture, respectively, during  a news conference urged Latin American banana-exporting nations  to "rebuild their damaged regional union in order to conduct  negotiations as a bloc against the banana export quota system  that has been in effect since July in the European Union (EU)."  Latin America has been divided over a EU proposal to increase  Latin American imports from 2.0 million to 2.1 million tons in  1994 in exchange for the region's withdrawal of its complaint to  GATT on the EU quota system. Colombia and Costa Rica, with the  support of Nicaragua and Venezuela negotiated the withdrawal of  the complaint in exchange for a more favorable distribution of  the European quotas, but the opposition of Ecuador, Guatemala,  Panama, and Honduras prevailed in the end because on 18 January  the GATT rejected the EU restrictions on banana imports to favor  banana producers in Europe and its former colonies.    Jose Riofrio, head of the Ecuadoran National Banana Program,  characterized the EU proposal as a "scandalous bribe" and  described the Costa Rican and Colombian Governments as  "disloyal." Agriculture Minister Gonzalez announced that the  Union of Banana Exporting Countries, UPEB, will hold a meeting  on 24 January in Guatemala to "examine the GATT panel's  conclusions," which he described as "positive for Latin  America." (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0722 GMT 19 Jan 94)    Ecuadoran banana producers today accused the government of  tolerating injustices because the country is not a member of  GATT and other countries are representing its interests in the  negotiations that are under way to counteract European  protectionism. Ecuadoran Banana producers have proposed a  change of foreign policy aimed at fostering rapprochement with  the EU and to end the problem of foreign representation.  Nicolas Castro, a leader for the producers, criticized the EU  for its continued assignment of quotas despite the GATT  rejection of its protectionist policies. Segundo Wong,  representative of one of Ecuador's largest banana exporting  companies, said the country "should intensify negotiations with  the EU and exhaust every alternative for an agreement." Wong  added that Ecuador should "aggressively" seek new markets  worldwide, including European banana producing countries like  France, Spain, and Portugal. The Ecuadoran Government on 18  January rejected the EU banana trade plan. (Mexico City NOTIMEX  in Spanish 0148 GMT 19 Jan 94)  <H5>  GUATEMALA </H5>   Guatemalan Deputy Foreign Minister Salvador Cohen warned  today that the EU might disregard the GATT decision against its  Latin American banana import quota system, which violates free  trade. Cohen reiterated that Guatemala, the only Central  American member of GATT, is pleased with the decision, but he  admitted that "many GATT panel decisions have been disregarded."  Meanwhile, Guatemalan Deputy Economy Minister Guillermo  Rodriguez said that "Guatemala will not accept any measure that  restricts free trade." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2119 GMT  19 Jan 94)    The Guatemalan Foreign trade Ministry has announced that the  GATT on 18 January "flatly and categorically condemned the  banana import system implemented by the European countries since  July 1993." The ministry added that the system is  discriminatory and cannot be safeguarded by the Lome Convention,  adding that the GATT decision constitutes a "huge success"  because it is very difficult for a small country like Guatemala  to fight against a group of developed countries. (Guatemala City  PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 19 Jan 94 p 8)  <H5>  HONDURAS </H5>   Honduran Economy Minister Carlos Chain described the GATT  decision against the EU restrictions on Latin American bananas  as a "success for all the countries in the region." He added  that "the struggle will be difficult but the region will be in a  better position to negotiate." Chain said: "Now the Europeans  will have to approach us for negotiations and we will be in an  excellent position." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0146 GMT  19 Jan 94)    President Callejas said the GATT decision to condemn the EU  banana import system constitutes a victory for Latin American  unity. He added that the Honduran people are quite flattered by  the decision because "its represents a promising situation for  the nation's banana industry." Callejas regretted the loss of  banana plantations to floods and hurricanes last year, but said  the GATT decision creates hope for the banana industry.  (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 10)  <H5>  NICARAGUA </H5>   Nicaragua has expressed satisfaction over the GATT decision  against the EU banana import system. Foreign Trade Director  Oscar Aleman said "Nicaragua will struggle for the GATT council  to adopt the panel decisions, which constitute a very important  step toward the solution of the trade conflict." (Paris AFP in  Spanish 2352 19 Jan 94)  <H5>  PANAMA </H5>   UPEB Director Enrique Betancur has confirmed that on 24  January this organization will hold a meeting in Guatemala to  decide on a common position against European "injustices" in the  area of banana imports. The meeting will seek to design a  strategy for Latin American banana exporters in light of the  GATT decision in favor of their complaint against the EU.  (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1703 GMT 19 Jan 94)    Latin American banana-producing countries are celebrating  the  GATT decision in favor of the complaint they filed against the  EU. Colombian Foreign Minister Nohemi Sanin, who was on an  official trip to Panama when the news came, declined to comment  before talking with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. However,  Panamanian President Guillermo Endara expressed great  satisfaction, adding: "I knew we were right but I did not expect  such a categorical decision."

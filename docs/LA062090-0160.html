			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TEXAS TECH CONSIDERS LEAGUES  </P> <P> A Texas Tech official said the school is considering its options, which include  leaving the Southwest Conference for the Big Eight or Western Athletic  Conference, now that Arkansas has indicated that it may join the Southeastern  Conference.  </P> <P> Another option, said Robert Sweazy, Tech's faculty representative to the SWC,  "would be remaining with the remaining members and adding a couple of  institutions."  </P> <P> Arkansas announced Tuesday that it will listen to an offer to join the SEC, and  both Texas and Texas A&amp;M have been courted by the league. Without Arkansas,  Texas and Texas A&amp;M, the SWC would be left with only Baylor, Houston, Rice,  Southern Methodist, Texas Christian and Texas Tech.  </P></p>

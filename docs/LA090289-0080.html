			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEEKING CAR SEEN NEAR SCENE OF MENENDEZ KILLINGS  </P> <P> Police are investigating whether a vehicle observed near the Beverly Hills home  of slain entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife was the same as one  seen near the spot where a San Fernando Valley pornography dealer was murdered  last month, The Times learned Friday.  </P> <P> In a separate development, an informed source said detectives are interested in  talking to actor Sylvester Stallone as they explore a variety of leads in the  slayings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Suspect  </P> <P> Stallone is not a suspect, the source said. The actor is a director of Carolco  Pictures Inc., a film company that owns almost half the stock in the company of  which Menendez was chief executive, Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a  video and music distributor.  </P> <P> Menendez, 45, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were shot to death Aug. 20 in the  library of their residence on North Elm Drive. Law enforcement sources have  said that the couple apparently were slain by two men firing 12-gauge shotguns  at close range.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills police have declined to discuss their investigation.  </P> <P> But informed law enforcement sources outside the department said a "white  hatchback" automobile was seen near their home about the time of the slayings.  It was not known if law enforcement officers know the make and year of the  vehicle or its license plate number.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Observed at Scene  </P> <P> A "white hatchback" was also observed in Northridge on Aug. 1 near the street  where Theodore Snyder, 47, a producer of X-rated videos, was shot to death.  </P> <P> Court affidavits show that Snyder's company, Video Cassette Recordings Inc.,  did business with and owed money to a firm allegedly controlled by Martin  Taccetta, a man linked by federal prosecutors to the Lucchese crime family.  </P> <P> Snyder's homicide is under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department,  which has not commented on the progress of its inquiry.  </P> <P> The investigation by Beverly Hills detectives has taken off in a number of  directions, apparently reflecting the complexity of the case and the large  number of transactions in which Menendez's firm was involved.  </P> <P> In this framework, detectives want to talk to Stallone in their search for  information about some of these business associations. Stallone, a  knowledgeable source said, has not yet been contacted.  </P> <P> Stallone is the star of the macho Rambo movies, which have been huge financial  successes for the West Hollywood-based Carolco. Carolco owns 49% of Live  Entertainment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formed in Merger  </P> <P> Live Entertainment was formed earlier this year with the merger of  International Video Entertainment, a video distributor, and Lieberman  Enterprises, a Minneapolis-based music and video company.  </P> <P> Menendez was also a director and executive vice president of Carolco, where  Stallone is a member of the board of directors.  </P> <P> Additionally, Stallone had about a 10% interest in International Video  Entertainment until it was merged with the Lieberman firm in 1988.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Live Entertainment announced that it had retained the New York law  firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison to conduct an internal  inquiry into the Menendez slaying.  </P> <P> The law firm is the same one that represented New York record executive Morris  Levy, who was convicted in May, 1988, of conspiring to extort payments from a  record wholesaler.  </P> <P> Levy, according to law enforcement officials and court records, has been a  business associate of Vincent (The Chin) Gigante, said by federal authorities  to be the boss of the Genovese crime family. Levy has denied any association  with organized crime.  </P> <P> Last January, Live Entertainment purchased Strawberries Records, Tapes and CDS,  a New England retail chain, from Levy.  </P> <P> "Given Mr. Levy's previous history, the due diligence process for the purchase  of Strawberries was unusually careful and exhaustive," Live Entertainment said  in its statement on the selection of the Paul, Weiss firm.  </P> <P> Richard Borisoff, an attorney for Paul, Weiss, said Friday that the firm no  longer represents Levy.  </P> <P> Carolco's chief executive, Peter M. Hoffman, who with the loss of Menendez has  become acting chairman of Live Entertainment, said in a telephone interview  that "we were, of course, aware that (Paul, Weiss) represented Morris Levy. We  don't consider it a conflict because that representation has been terminated."  </P></p>

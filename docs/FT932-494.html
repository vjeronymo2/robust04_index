			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Sweden snubbed over Bosnia post UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali has offended Sweden, perhaps the world organisation's most loyal supporter, by replacing the Swedish commander of peacekeeping forces in Bosnia with a French officer, without consulting Stockholm. The nomination of General Jean Cot to succeed Lt General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, which will take effect on July 1, was confirmed by the Security Council in an exchange of letters made public yesterday. But Mr Peter Osvald, Sweden's UN delegate, complained that Mr Boutros Ghali made his decision without bothering to advise in advance either the Swedish government or Gen Wahlgren, who has a distinguished career in UN peacekeeping. It appears the secretary general also neglected to inform the troop-contributing countries other than France, with whom he arranged the transfer of command during a visit to Paris last week. Gen Wahlgren had been commander only since March. The Swedish parliament only recently approved the dispatch of 1,000 troops to Bosnia. It was not known whether they would be for general peacekeeping duty or deployment in Moslem 'safe areas' that are badly in need of United Nations forces. In any event, the change of command could delay their arrival. French Lt Gen Philipe Morillon, who became something of a hero for defying the Serbs to escort humanitarian aid to the beleaguered Moslems, is also being replaced. His successor has not yet been named. The possibility that UN peacekeeping operations might be terminated in the absence of an early political settlement has been raised in a report to the Security Council. In recommending that the UN force mandate be extended for only three months, to September 30, Mr Boutros Ghali emphasised that if the parties involved in the conflict failed to demonstrate a commitment to a settlement, it would not be worthwhile to use the UN's limited resources to maintain the operation.</p>

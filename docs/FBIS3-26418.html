			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Wenzong (0491 2429 1350), Foreign Affairs College </F> International Law Research Institute professor: "Chris Patten's  Long-Standing Scheme `To Expand Democracy in Hong Kong'--Chris  Patten's `Constitutional Reform Proposal' as Viewed From the  `Countdown to 1997' Report"]    [Text] Chris Patten has put forward his "constitutional  reform proposal" on the pretext of "expanding democracy in Hong  Kong." This has given people the wrong impression, as if only he  wants to develop "democracy" in Hong Kong. He even asked:  "What is wrong with expanding democracy?" and "Why is China  opposed to it?" In fact, he feigns ignorance. As everyone  knows, over the past 150 years the British Empire has not  allowed Hong Kong people to enjoy democracy. Why is it so  interested in "democracy" now? There must be more to this than  meets the eye.  <H3>  I. From Margaret Thatcher's Original Concept to Chris  Patten's "Constitutional Reform Proposal" </H3>   As far back as the early 1980's, the then British Prime  Minister Mrs. Thatcher had a concept, which was: "We should  develop Hong Kong's democratic structure. Our objective is to  allow Hong Kong to become independent or practice self-rule  within a short period of time.... This makes it necessary to  set up in Hong Kong a government with more distinctive Chinese  characteristics in which Britain will increasingly become  subordinate. We also should possibly consider a referendum as  an acceptable system there" (see Margaret Thatcher's memoirs  "The Downing Street Years"). This passage clearly shows that  Britain has long wanted to turn Hong Kong into an independent or  semi-independent political entity to continue the British rule  there in a disguised form after 1997. However, given the firm  stand of the Chinese Government and people that all sovereignty  over Hong Kong must be recovered in 1997, she had to retreat and  eventually agree to sign the "Sino-British Joint Declaration on  the Question of Hong Kong" and other relevant agreements. The  joint declaration explicitly stipulates: "The Chinese  Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997." "The Government  of the United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to  the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997." At the joint declaration  signing ceremony, Mrs. Thatcher also solemnly announced: "I  pledge that the British Government will do its best to make the  agreement a success." The signing and ratification of the  "Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong"  has delivered the whole territory of Hong Kong from British  colonial rule and set it down permanently as China's territory  in terms of law. After the Hong Kong Basic Law was promulgated,  the British Foreign Office issued a statement of confirmation,  calling it an "important milestone." Subsequently, on many  occasions, the British side has also pledged to cause Hong  Kong's constitutional development to converge with the Basic Law.    However, with the approach of 1997 and unwilling to withdraw  from the historical stage, the British Government has suddenly  made a U-turn in its stand toward the question of Hong Kong and,  through the new Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, dished out the  "three violations" "constitutional reform proposal." The "three  violations" refers to violation of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the relevant agreements and understandings reached  between China and Britain, and the principle agreed upon by both  parties of the convergence of Hong Kong's political system and  the Basic Law.    It should be pointed out that before Chris Patten took up  his  post as Hong Kong governor in July 1992, a "Mission to Hong Kong  By the International Jurists Commission" headed by William  Goodhart of Britain, engaged in extensive activities in Hong  Kong in June 1991. After returning to Britain, the delegation  wrote a 100,000-word report entitled "Countdown to 1997--Report  of a Mission to Hong Kong" (hereinafter the "Report").  Reviewing the British Hong Kong policy from politics, law, and  other aspects, the "Report" launched an all-out attack on the  Basic Law and, in conclusion, put forward 45 "conclusions and  suggestions." Whoever leafs through the "Report," especially  its "conclusions and suggestions," can see that Britain has  never given up the aforesaid original concept of Mrs. Thatcher.  That is the fundamental reason why the Chinese and British  Governments have failed to reach any agreement despite 17 rounds  of talks, held between 22 April and 27 November 1993, on the  question of the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements in Hong  Kong.  <H3>  II. "Countdown to 1997" Provides a "Reform Prototype" for  Patten's "Constitutional Reform" </H3>   To better understand the contents and objectives of Patten's  "constitutional reform proposal," it is necessary to examine it  in tandem with the "Report."    First of all, the "Report" reviews the greatest error in the  British Hong Kong policy, holding that "before holding talks on  and before signing the joint declaration," the British  Government should have held a `referendum' in Hong Kong, and  that it also "gave open, customary, indolent, and tacit consent"  to the Basic Law (see "Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 5 and p  115 of the original report). On this count, the authors say  with great sympathy: "Given the current situation, it is no  longer practical to exercise the right to self-determination  effectively." ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 7). What,  then, is to be done? The authors suggest that, first, we  "should replace the 18 appointed Legislative Councillors whose  terms of office end at the end of 1993 with directly elected  councillors from 18 geographical constituencies" ("Conclusions  and Suggestions" No. 15) and "implement an overall geographical  constituency electoral system in the 1995 Legislative Council  [Legco] elections" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 13). In so  doing, the authors have completely abolished the functions of  functional constituencies and the Election Committee in the 1994  and 1995 elections as agreed by both parties, deliberately  violated the provision of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] that the SAR's first Legco should be  composed proportionately of councillors elected by functional  groups, those elected through the Election Committee, and those  directly elected in geographical constituencies, and violated  the commitment repeatedly made by Britain that the Hong Kong  constitutional development should converge with the Basic Law.  This is absolutely identical with what Patten is doing now.    What is particularly interesting is that the "Report"  authors had long expected that in doing so there would probably  be no "through train." But the "Report" categorically states:  "The benefit of the `through train' to Hong Kong is not the  most important one and should not be taken as a reason for  giving up comprehensive democratic elections in 1995"  ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 16). You may well see how  harmonious they are with each other. Readers are likely to ask:  Since there is no `through train,' what is the point of the  British Hong Kong authorities insisting on such an election as  suggested in the "Report"? In fact, there is great  significance. Mrs. Thatcher has laid bare the secret with her  aforesaid remarks. In truth, they want to make Britain  "subordinate" in the remaining 2 to 3 years and produce a Legco  fully elected by Hong Kong compatriots to pursue a series of  "reforms" in opposition to the Basic Law and thus create chaos  and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and peaceful  transition. In doing so they can fish in troubled waters and  even stage a comeback someday.    We can have a complete understanding of this point if we  look  at the series of "suggestions" listed in the "Report." First,  the "Report" directs the spearhead of its attack at the  relationship between the central people's government and the  future Hong Kong SAR. It is opposed to the provision in the  Basic Law that the chief executive is to be appointed by the  central people's government, calling for a "chief executive  directly elected by the masses" or "making a choice between a  directly elected chief executive and a directly elected  government" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 17); says that  "the chief executive should be responsible to the SAR  legislature" rather than "responsible to the PRC" ("Conclusions  and Suggestions" No. 18); and calls for "restricting the  provision that the courts of Hong Kong shall have no  jurisdiction over acts of state such as defense and foreign  affairs" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 19) as laid down in  Article 19 of the Basic Law. It also negates the role of the  Basic Law as the future SAR's constitution, claiming that the  power of interpretation of whether the clauses of the Basic Law  are applicable to the SAR and whether Hong Kong laws contravene  the Basic Law "should be shifted from the National People's  Congress [NPC] Standing Committee to the Hong Kong courts"  ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 20). They have made a clean  breast of their intentions in those few points. We should like  to ask: If the chief executive is neither appointed by, nor  responsible to, the central people's government but is only  responsible to the Hong Kong legislature; if the right of  adjudication and the right of interpretation of such things as  whether the laws formulated by the Hong Kong legislature  contravene the Basic Law and whether the clauses of the Basic  Law are applicable to the SAR are not vested in the NPC Standing  Committee but in Hong Kong courts, will not Hong Kong turn into  a political entity completely independent of the central  people's government? What is there in common with Hong Kong as  an SAR of the PRC? Will not the provision in the "Sino-British  Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong" that the "PRC  has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  with effect from 1 July 1997" come to naught?    Although Chris Patten still dares not make such suggestions,  he has spread the news that "before and after 1997  administrative work should be responsible to the legislature."  What a phrase "before and after 1997" is! This is by no means  a slip of the tongue. If the Hong Kong executive organ is  responsible only to the Hong Kong legislature after 1997, will  this not coincide with the aforesaid suggestion in the "Report"?  <H3>  III. Let's See What Actions Chris Patten Will Take in the  Next 2 to 3 Years? </H3>   In addition to making "suggestions" about the 1994 and 1995  elections and the relationship between the future chief  executive and legislature and the central people's government,  which are totally out of keeping with the Basic Law, the  "Report" also sets a keynote for the "reforms" Patten should  accomplish in the next 2 to 3 years.    People know that even though Hong Kong compatriots have  acquired "British Dependent Territories Citizens" [BDTC] status  in the past, it is very difficult for them to secure British  nationality and the right of abode in Britain. Contrary to  previous practice, the "Report" authors now suggest that as  regards all BDTCs in Hong Kong: "No matter what practical  difficulties it has, Britain has in principle the obligation to  let them enjoy the right of abode in Britain proper or an  acceptable third country" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 9).  Why do they make such a suggestion? Because it was stipulated  in the "British Memorandum on the 1984 Sino-British Joint  Declaration" that all persons who are BDTCs before 30 June 1997  "will cease to be BDTCs with effect from 1 July 1997" "without  conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom." It is  also stipulated in the Chinese Memorandum that "under the  Nationality Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots,  whether they are holders of `BDTC' Passports' or not, are  Chinese nationals." Obviously, the "Report" authors hold that  such a practice will considerably reduce Britain's influence in  Hong Kong after 1997. Originally, China and Britain had reached  initial agreement on the nationality and right of abode of BDTCs  and this has been overthrown by the "Report" authors.    The "Report" suggests: "The Hong Kong BDTCs of non-Chinese  origin who have no right of abode outside Hong Kong should be  immediately granted British nationality and right of abode in  Britain" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 10); the Hong Kong  BDTCs of Chinese origin, including those who applied for  naturalized BDTC after the signing of the joint declaration on  19 December 1984, should be given right of abode ("Conclusions  and Suggestions" No. 11); and that the deadline for going  through such a procedure may be extended to six years after the  transition of Hong Kong sovereignty in 1997 and can be further  extended if necessary ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 12).  Very obviously, in making such suggestions, the "Report"  authors want to rope in large numbers of Hong Kong people,  encouraging them to have a free hand in acting according to  Britain's will before and after 1997. If they should finally  find it really impossible to muddle along they need not worry as  they have a place of retreat in Britain.    In addition, the "Report" also takes "human rights" as an  important weapon against the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong by the PRC. The "Report" especially stresses the  importance of the British Parliament formulating the  "Regulations for Implementing the Bill of Rights" and placing  them above the Basic Law. It claims that they should not be  rescinded or restricted even after 1997 ("Conclusions and  Suggestions" No. 34) and that, if all or some of the current  statutes contravene the regulations, they should be rescinded or  amended ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 33). Obviously, the  "Report" authors seem to forget that the British Hong Kong  Government's rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997 and  that the legal basis for maintaining their power after that date  will disappear. By that time, "the system, policies, and laws  practiced after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR will be  based on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR" (Resolution from  the Third Session of the Seventh NPC); "the law previously in  force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity,  ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary law shall be  maintained, except for any that contravene this law and subject  to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR"  (Article 8 of the Basic Law). We should like to ask, is there  any reason to place the regulations formulated by the British  Parliament above the Basic Law and extend their validity beyond  1997 without subjecting them to examination? The "Report"  authors also suggest that, before 1997, it is necessary to  "spare no effort in implementing" the regulations ("Conclusions  and Suggestions" No. 35); "set up a powerful Human Rights  Commission" in Hong Kong ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 37);  and that "Britain should accept the jurisdiction of the  `Optional Protocol on the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights' on behalf of Hong Kong" ("Conclusions and  Suggestions" No. 42). It even suggests that "the International  Jurists Commission or the International Federation of Human  Rights Organizations should speedily set up an independent body  to supervise progress in Hong Kong's human rights situation"  ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 41) and so on. Obviously,  using "human rights" to interfere in another country's internal  affairs is a special weapon of hegemonists in recent years and  the "Report" authors do not forget to use it either. Hong Kong  compatriots should rest assured that, in line with the Basic  Law, all Hong Kong compatriots will enjoy much fuller human and  civil rights than they have done during the rule by the British  Empire. Naturally, if a small number of people who, with  ulterior motives, take advantage of human rights to engage in  sabotage activities in a vain attempt to pull Hong Kong onto the  path of independence and separation, this will be impermissible  under the Basic Law and will not be tolerated by the future Hong  Kong SAR. As everybody knows, as far back as 1982 when starting  talks with Britain on the future of Hong Kong, the Chinese  Government explicitly stated: After resuming sovereignty over  Hong Kong, China will pursue the principles and policies of "one  country, two systems, `Hong Kong people running Hong Kong,' and  "a high degree of self-autonomy." After 1997, Hong Kong will  practice immeasurably better democracy than that under British  rule. Over the past 100 years and more, the governor has always  arrogated all authority to himself and there has been absolutely  no democracy to speak of in Hong Kong.    As stated above, the "Report," which is entitled  "Countdown,"  helps people, to a certain extent, understand Britain's current  and future policies toward Hong Kong, as well as Patten's  "constitutional reform proposal." People will wait and see how  Patten acts next.  <H5>  IV. Concluding Remarks </H5>   Hong Kong bears witness to the history of colonial  aggression  in which the Western colonialists were the first to open China's  gate and the last to leave China. The fact that the Chinese  nation has suffered humiliation and oppression at the hands of  Western powers over the past 150 years has something to do with  this. The day to thoroughly cleanse all remnants of colonialism  in China will finally arrive soon. At this historical juncture,  as the elite of Hong Kong society, Legco members who assume  heavy historical responsibility, should first stand out and  boycott Patten's "constitutional reform proposal" so that all  his plans will come to naught. Only in this way can they have a  clear conscience toward their forefathers and future  generations. All Hong Kong compatriots loving the motherland  should fight in unity and make persistent efforts to boycott all  "separate elections" Chris Patten may launch. Let Patten and  his like "count down" because their countdown can only result in  "zero," while before us is a more thriving and prosperous Hong  Kong and a more thriving and prosperous great motherland. With  hands and hearts linked together, let us usher in the arrival of  the great historical date of 1 July 1997!</p>

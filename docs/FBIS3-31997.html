			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mattos] </F>   [Excerpts] The new security and seclusion system  implemented at the Miguel Castro Castro prison, which lodges  around 500 subversives, has began showing positive results.  Shining Path followers who support surrender have separated  from their radical "commanders" and now want peace. And those  who have repented demand that the law benefiting them be  regulated.    Colonel PNP [Peruvian National Police] Gabino Cajahuanca  Parra, director of the Miguel Castro Castro Special Regime  Prison, said: "Everything seems to indicate that Shining Path  inmates are involved in something that can be described as  withdrawal."    The work of the intelligence service to get Shining Path  followers to support Abimael Guzman Reinoso's call to lay down  their arms, and the rigorous isolation surrounding indicted and  condemned subversives, has apparently affected Shining Path  morale.    It is not a coincidence that in the past few weeks many  Shining Path "commanders" imprisoned in the Castro Castro prison  have began distancing themselves from their most radical cadres.    "That is a fact that no one here denies," a subversive  inmate  said.    It is known that 35 subversives have repented at the Castro  Castro prison so far. But their numbers could increase if the  government issues regulations for reducing the sentences of  "repenting" Shining Path followers.    LA REPUBLICA talked with one "repenting" Shining Path  follower whose secret code is A1AA0043. He said that inside the  prison "many Shining Path followers want to repent, but the lack  of definition of their legal status makes them remain silent."    The case of this Shining Path inmate -- number A1AA0043 --  who was leader of a teachers union before being recruited by the  Shining Path, could be useful for the government in speeding up  the approval of the regulations in question.    "I have been under the protection of the Repentance Law for  the past four months, and so far no one has helped me. I have  more information on Shining Path leaders, but why should I give  it away if I am still here?" the repenting subversive said. The  information he gave to the police permitted the capture of three  important political and military PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist  Party -- Shining Path] "commanders."    A1AA0043 is supported only by the direction of a penal  institution that has decided to isolate him from the rest of the  Shining Path following. His case shows the rigidity of a prison  system that has began to yield positive results.    A1AA0043 emphatically said that "many of those imprisoned  here have started to realize what Shining Path really is here in  jail."    "The situation is such thanks to Col. Cajahuanca Parra, who  has reestablished discipline and has taken control away from the  old Shining Path leadership," A1AA0043 said.    Other reports heard by LA REPUBLICA before support this  assertion.    Another one who repented said: "In the past, the Shining  Path commanders made us work for them. Now their power has been  taken away by the isolation into which they have been forced,  and this has brought us great peace." He added: "Their abuse  made us understand that we were nothing to the commanders."    The same source, who pretended to be the "supervisor" of a  wing in the penitentiary which is also called Canto Grande,  revealed that in the past the "commanders" had physically abused  the inmates by beating and raping them if they did not support  Shining Path.    Now everything seems to have changed in the prison. [passage  omitted]    Now nothing looks like the old courtyards where the Shining  Path members had their murals, rabbit hutches, pigeon lofts,  plants, and cubbyholes where they hid their weapons, and where  they competed with the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]  with bright colors and subversive slogans.    That is now gone. Everything has been covered by concrete  and heavy paint.    One of the supervisors said: "The only time there is noise  here is in the morning, when groups of inmates come down to the  first floor to fill their containers with water. As far as  their hygiene is concerned, they clean themselves in the showers  in the courtyards and when they come out into the open."  [passage omitted]    Policemen permanently watch all activities in each cell, in  each floor, in each wing. This is controlled strictly by  Colonel Cajahuanca Parra, who visits the wings every day.    This officer, a hardliner, is identified by his personnel  and  the inmates as the one responsible for the changes made.    "We want to thank the director for the treatment we get. It  is true there is extreme security, but I have been here for the  last four and a half years, and I can assure you that life here  was worth nothing," said Victor Manuel Miranda, delegate of wing  5B, where the 148 inmates sentenced for drug trafficking are  kept.    He added: "Now, however, we are calm. There are no longer  drugs, liquor, police corruption, and killings." [passage  omitted]    The discipline and strict security measures are so extensive  that there have been no escapes from the penitentiary. [passage  omitted]    Under the same discipline, the inmates sentenced to life in  prison, who number around 50, and the 35 who have repented are  kept under special protection.    We also entered the wing of those who have repented and  those  who are kept isolated, which includes former Congressman Yehude  Simon Munaro, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for  terrorism.    Munaro said: "I was isolated because the subversives accuse  me of being a pacifist, and the government of being subversive."  He added: "The documents for my defense will be submitted to  the United Nations in the next few days." [passage omitted]    Only time will tell if the new antisubversive penitentiary  policy will contribute to the pacification of the country. In  any case, the first step and the hardest was already taken by  the director of the Miguel Castro Castro penitentiary.</p>

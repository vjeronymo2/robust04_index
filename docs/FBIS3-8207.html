They were to start preparing the airport for the reception  of  humanitarian aid flights following a weekend agreement by  besieging Serbs to allow two air corridors into Tuzla.    Some 100 Swedish troops backed by armoured vehicles,  including six Danish-crewed Leopard tanks, entered the base at  1:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) to replace the last elements of the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian army.    Earlier half-a-dozen Moslem trucks had left the airport  carrying troops, documents and other equipment.    The 2,400 metre (3,000 yard) runways, which can take heavy  transport aircraft, are within range of Serb artillery, but the  airport has not been shelled since last week.</p>

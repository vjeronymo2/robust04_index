			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "Between the </F> Past and the Future"]    [Text] In the period after November 1989, we did not draw  once and for all a thick line under the past (so that we could  forget it), but we decided intentionally to remove the main  instigators of the communist regime from all public positions  and, moreover, to redress the aftermath of the most serious  property and nonproperty-related injustices committed by this  regime. We accommodated the majority view among the Czech  public, and that was the right thing to do. However, I would  like to say that, from the very beginning, we were aware of the  difficulties and problems this decision would bring on a  practical level and of the kind of genie that was being released  from the bottle. I think we have done more in this issue than  any other postcommunist country. Despite this, it seems to me  that the current dissatisfaction of some people (and mainly its  disproportionate representation in the media) with the alleged  slowness, inconsistency, and small scale of the rehabilitations  and restitutions is increasing directly proportionately to the  extent of the rehabilitations carried out and with the amount of  property already returned, and this is the reason for my  contemplation.    I do not want to deal at all with the economic aspect of the  issue. This has already been discussed enough in our country,  and it is not the main issue, although it is certainly not a  negligible one. The issue involves something far broader and  far more general--that is, what the past in fact means for the  life of the state and the nation or, rather, the extent to which  it is possible to rectify it or take it back.    Many people in our country view the communist regime as a  kind of weight that descended on all of us from the outside in  1948. Therefore, it also seems to them that, when we managed to  haul this weight off ourselves, we were once again in the early  evening of 24 February 1948, and, if not entirely, we must  strive with all our might and as fast as possible to be there.  This is only half the truth, however, and it may even be less.    In actuality, the communist era meant a profound structural  transformation throughout the whole of Czech society, not only  on the ideological level but also on the everyday one. Society  stratified thanks to the previous democratic regime into a  multitude of local, regional, social, ethnic, and mainly  enormously multifarious special-interest groups that differed  from each other not only in the extent of their wealth and  political influence but also in their sundry life styles;  communism forcibly cemented them together in false unity,  dreariness, and injustice. The objective of communist ideology  was the collectivization of society, whose end result, however,  was its considerable atomization. This severed the thousands of  fine threads that wove us together. This was one of the most  profound social transformations that our country has gone  through in its thousand-year history; moreover, it was amplified  by the fact that the conditions that evolved lasted for two  whole generations.    It was not, however, external intervention. A not  insignificant part of our society, whether consciously or  unconsciously, was involved in organizing this transformation  and in carrying it out. The gradual sobering up, which set in as  a result of the public disclosure of the Stalinist terror and of  the subsequent collapse of communist ideology itself, could not,  even in 1968, be fully implemented politically because of the  nature of the already stabilized regime. This was accompanied,  into the bargain, by further mistakes and further illusions.  Let us admit finally that communism was not a natural disaster  but was more like a serious and prolonged illness against which  we did not have enough antitoxins.    It follows on from this that, among other things, each of us  who went through this process, albeit quite involuntarily, is  marked by it, no matter what he tells himself. The spasmodic  disputes and polemics whipped up by the sudden and unexpectedly  obtained freedom are convincing proof of this, and the current  restitution mania is part of it.    It is naive to think that we will simply replicate our  future  from our more illustrious past. On the one hand, we are  somewhere else, and, on the other, we do not know what our more  illustrious past is, this paradise lost to which we want to  return. Are these the years immediately before 1948, years noted  for their diverse violations of human and civil rights, their  crippled political spectrum and mass nationalization? Or is  this the interwar Czech Republic, more than half a century  remote from us? Or is it perhaps even the imperial and royal  monarchy?    Without a doubt, we must follow up on our positive  historical traditions. At the same time, the current  fundamental framework for a free society as it has evolved in  Europe is also decisive for us. However, these are just  auxiliary bearings. We have to create our future ourselves; we  cannot replicate it. It will be new, it will be ours, and it  will be different from what we know of our past or of that of  our neighbors. The road toward it is untraveled. It is a road  "on which one gets dusty," a bumpy road, and a road with sharp  bends and steep slopes. A concept for a return to "the time  before" is impossible. The river of time will not flow  backwards, even if we were to pass hundreds of laws and  government decrees for this purpose.    From time to time it is also said "give back what was  stolen." This, at first glance attractive moral imperative is,  upon closer inspection, terribly ungenerous and terribly  improvident. Among other things, the one who stole is not the  one who gives back. The individual also harmed by communism is,  in the overwhelming majority of cases, the one who gives back.  Each of us who trots out this demand should realize what it  means in practice. Quite unnecessary disputes will erupt, and  are already erupting, and these could become a barrier  separating us from each other and dividing us all from our  neighbors. The passionate debates about returning property to  an aristocrat or the property claims of the Sudeten Germans are  classic examples of this. Moreover, I do not believe that the  major injustices of communism were property-related injustices  or that we should orient ourselves in this direction.    Only the future will tell whether we made the right decision  when we chose our "Czech" solution to rectify the wrongdoing  committed by the communist regime. However, the present is  already sending us clear and comprehensible signals that it is  necessary to bring an end to more and more restitution claims.  We will not settle scores with the past any better by their  continuous augmentation.</p>

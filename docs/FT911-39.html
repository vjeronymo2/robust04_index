			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK consumer credit growth at six-year low BRITISH consumers have been holding back from new borrowing to finance household goods and other durables although interest rates have fallen and retail sales rose sharply in March. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the amounts outstanding on credit agreements with consumers increased by less in the first quarter of this year than in any quarter since statistics were first gathered in the mid-1980s. The total amount borrowed from finance houses, building societies and on bank credit cards to purchase consumer goods increased by Pounds 280m to Pounds 30.03bn in the three months to the end of March. This was the lowest quarterly increase in this 'narrow' measure of consumer credit business since records began in 1985. It compares with a quarterly average rise of Pounds 758m last year. A broader measure of outstanding consumer credit, which also includes credit granted in the form of loans by banks on personal accounts and by insurance companies and retailers, rose by Pounds 840m to Pounds 51.47bn in the same period. This compares with rises of Pounds 1.03bn and Pounds 1.26bn in the two previous quarters and is the lowest figure since records began in 1987. The announcement of the figures, which suggest that recessionary conditions in the UK are continuing, coincided with the publication of slightly revised retail sales figures for March, showing a strong volume increase of 3.6 per cent over February. The figures show a strong 12.9 per cent surge in the volume of household goods sales in the month, confirming that the Budget increase in value added tax to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent had triggered the retail sales jump. Household goods are frequently bought on credit but the monthly figures for narrow credit business showed only a relatively modest increase of Pounds 122m in the amount outstanding in March after increases of Pounds 98m and Pounds 60m in February and January respectively. Although the March credit figure was in line with City expectations and had little impact in financial markets, the difference between the strong growth in retail sales in March and the subdued appetite of consumers for credit caused some puzzlement among analysts. Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the figures probably pointed to a recent rise in real incomes as inflation fell. Consumers had been able to accumulate surplus funds in their bank accounts and were able to beat the Budget increase in VAT without increasing their indebtedness, he said.</p>

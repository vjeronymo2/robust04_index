			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / VW seeks savings equal to 30% cut in jobs VOLKSWAGEN will have to shed 30 per cent of its employees in Germany if management plans for pay cuts and a four-day week are not accepted, the workforce was warned yesterday. VW, mainstay marque of the loss-making automotive group, which will have 103,000 workers by the end of this year, will need only 72,000 in 1995, Mr Peter Hartz, labour director, told a press conference. Limits on state aid for short-time working, and the high cost of early retirement schemes, meant that Germany's traditional 'painless' workforce reduction methods were no longer practicable or affordable. Mr Klaus Volkert, chairman of the works council and the employees' leading representative, said: 'Because of this the board is working on plans which will involve mass redundancies if we do not find other solutions.' The possibility of 18,000 job cuts next year and a further 12,000 in 1995 was far worse than had been expected, he claimed. While Mr Volkert appeared surprised, the VDA automotive industry association warned only recently that the sector would have to shed a further 200,000 jobs in the next few years. In common with the rest of German industry, vehicle makers are striving to regain competitiveness mainly by reducing labour costs. While other manufacturers are cutting workforce numbers they are also applying new methods, including widespread cuts in bonuses and benefits. VW has been forced to seek new solutions to its overmanning by an agreement with its largest shareholder, the government of Lower Saxony, to maintain the workforce at 100,000. It is also ill-equipped to bear the costs of redundancies. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, who confidently forecast a break-even result earlier this year, is now facing a group loss of some DM1.7bn (Pounds 690m) according to recent independent estimates. Provisions for 18,000 redundancies in 1994 would take the 1993 deficit to more than DM3bn, observers suggest. If applied across the board, Mr Hartz's plan could reduce VW's annual labour bill by more than DM2.5bn. Although Mr Volkert accepted that 'burden sharing' in the interests of workforce solidarity was preferable to sackings, he warned that the negotiations would not be easy. Formal talks are due to start shortly and the management hopes to introduce the new working practices at the start of next year. Mr Volkert said management's hopes for a 20 per cent pay cut in line with the planned reduction in the working week from 36 to 28.8 hours would not be possible for all employee groups. He also indicated that the German workforce would demand sacrifices and capacity cuts elsewhere in the group, which includes Audi, the quality car division, Skoda in the Czech Republic and Seat in Spain. Seat has recently been told that one of its three factories is to be closed and 40 per cent of the 23,000 workforce is to go. Mr Volkert said the unions will also demand details on the effects of changes introduced by production director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. These include switching parts manufacture to cheaper outside suppliers. Mr Lopez is also mainly responsible for an efficiency drive, which VW expects will improve productivity in German factories by between 11 per cent and 15 per cent next year, further increasing the pressure for job cuts.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would establish a rental payment schedule for various communication uses for which fair market rental is required. However, with the concurrence of the BLM State Director, the authorized officer may reduce or waive the rental when it is determined that the rental will cause undue hardship on the holder/applicant and that it is in the public interest to waive the rental payment. Current right-of-way rental waiver policy is not affected by this proposed schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed schedule reflects rental values for BLM-authorized communication uses. The BLM right-of-way authorization is similar to a private lease for communication purposes. The authorization is for 30 years or the life of the project, and contains provisions regarding renewal, termination, assignment, and liability. Other provisions may include subleasing and bonding. New applicants for use of public lands are subject to application and processing fees associated with complying with environmental requirements. New and existing users may be subject to reimbursement of reasonable costs associated with agency monitoring of use. Therefore, the proposed schedule reflects a reasonable estimate of the fair market rental value for communication uses on public lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impacts on industry and users paying rental vary. Television and radio broadcasters in large markets, or users whose rent has not been adjusted for 5, 10, or more years, may experience a significant increase. However, there are several situations where rental payments will decline. The best estimate is that total revenues from BLM-authorized communication uses will be approximately the same. However, costs associated with individual billing and preparing and updating appraisals will be significantly reduced. Although rental increases may be significant in some cases, they will be phased in over a 5-year period. In addition, the current regulations include a provision (43 CFR 2803.1&hyph;2(b)(2)(iv)) allowing partial waiver or deferral of rental by the authorized officer based on a claim of hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the provision for rounding of right-of-way rental payments would be removed in the proposed rule. This would simplify the calculation of rental payments by BLM and their payment by right-of-way holders. The rounding provision has unnecessarily complicated the calculation of rental fees, and increased billing errors, with little or no benefit to the customer. The rounding provision and its removal are revenue neutral. Revenues would be neither enhanced nor diminished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Communication Uses Covered by Proposed Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed schedule is applicable to the communication uses described below. The proposed rental schedule is not applicable to holders of facilities authorized under terms of a right-of-way grant to public telecommunications service operators providing public television or radio broadcast service. However, such holders would be responsible for paying a percentage of the gross sublease rent received from tenants in the facility that do not qualify as nonprofit entities. The term ``primary use'' is the predominant use of the facility by the holder authorized under terms of the right-of-way authorization. The term ``facility'' is defined as the building, tower, and other related incidental improvements authorized under terms of the right-of-way authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Television Broadcast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This category includes right-of-way holders that operate facilities authorized by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) that primarily broadcast UHF and VHF audio and video signals for general public reception. The schedule is applicable to primary transmitters that principally serve a community (city, cities, metro area, or county) reached by the transmitter. Principal communities covered do not include outlying areas served by translators. This category does not include stations licensed by the FCC as a Low Power Television (LPTV) or rebroadcast devices such as translators, or transmitting devices such as microwave relays serving broadcast translators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> FM Radio Broadcast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC licensed facilities primarily used to broadcast frequency modulation (FM) audio signals for general public reception. The schedule is applicable to primary transmitters that principally serve communities reached by the primary transmitter. Principal communities covered do not include areas reached by broadcast translators. This category is not applicable to stations licensed by the FCC as low power FM radio, and does not include rebroadcast devices such as translators, boosters or AM synchronous transmitters or microwave relays serving broadcast translators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rebroadcast Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC licensed facilities primarily used to rebroadcast a signal from its point of origin. This category includes translators and low power television, low power FM radio, and microwave relays. Microwave as used in conjunction with LPTV and broadcast translators are included in this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

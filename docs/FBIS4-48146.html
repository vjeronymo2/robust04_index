			<p>BFN     [Text] The honorable minister of information and  broadcasting, Mr. Mpho Malie, today reassured the business  community, both local and from outside the country, that the  democratic Government of Lesotho is committed to a free conduct  of business and investment ventures in the country.    In a statement on the present situation following the strike  action by the police force, the minister addressed the business  community in particular. He said he did so with great sadness  that Lesotho once again experienced the present state of  instability, when neighboring South Africa was taking part in  the democratic process through which Lesotho had passed. Mr.  Malie said the Government of Lesotho will make every effort to  ensure an environment conducive to a free business and  investment climate in the country.    He said the Lesotho Government abhorred in the strongest  terms the destruction of property and unwarranted intimidation  that some business persons had endured without the usual  protection they received from the police. The minister said the  senseless damage and plundering of business properties which  took place in the last few days had resulted in the loss of  invaluable jobs for the people of Lesotho.    Mr. Malie appealed to all the communities in the country to  continue with the spirit of cooperation in the best interests of  peace, stability, and the maintenance of law and order  throughout the country.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Major defiant at NUT test boycott THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers yesterday extinguished any lingering chance that meaningful national curriculum tests would take place this year when members voted overwhelmingly for a boycott. The NUT is the third union to boycott this summer's tests, and voted to do so by the largest majority - 96 per cent of those who voted were in favour. Turnout was 69.9 per cent, meaning that 67.3 per cent of eligible members voted for a boycott. Previously the NASUWT union voted by 88 per cent to boycott, on a turnout of 57 per cent. The ATL union had a vote of 82.7 per cent in favour on a turnout of 56.8 per cent. However Mr John Patten, education secretary, could take solace from the growing evidence of a split between the teachers' unions over next year's tests. Mr Patten announced on Tuesday that these would be substantially slimmed down. At Westminster Mr John Major, the prime minister, was defiant, rejecting fresh Labour demands to call off this year's tests. Mr Major, clashing with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, on the subject for the third time in three weeks, said the result of yesterday's ballot made him 'very sad'. He questioned the motive behind the union's decision, saying people would ask whether the NUT 'really do support the principle of regular testing in our schools or whether there is another agenda that concerns them'. Mr Smith said Mr Major's determination to press ahead was 'a sign of weakness, not strength'. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the boycott would start immediately, and added: 'The level of response by union members destroys for ever accusations that the union was voicing the views only of militant, politically motivated teachers.' He criticised Mr Patten's statement on Tuesday, saying: 'Our reaction to this announcement was not one of delight. We will still be arguing about this even though there might be some reductions to workload for some teachers.' He also claimed Mr Patten's announcement had put a 'question mark' over the independence of the review of the curriculum being carried out by Sir Ron Dearing. This contradicts the reaction of Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, who said: 'Teachers would be ill-advised not to respond in a generally positive way to the dramatic and revolutionary concessions the government made. As soon as the changes for next year are introduced then the boycott by its very nature should lapse.'</p>

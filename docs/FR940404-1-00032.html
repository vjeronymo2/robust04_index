			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to the EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the CAA provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See also section 110(l) of the CAA. Also, the EPA must determine whether a submittal is complete and, therefore, warrants further EPA review and action. See section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565. The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 51, appendix V (1993), as amended by 56 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt of the submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After providing adequate notice, the TACB public hearings were held on July 2, 1992, and September 9, 1992, to entertain public comment on certain elements of the complete CO implementation plan. Following the public hearing, these elements were adopted by the State on September 18, 1992, and submitted to the EPA as a proposed revision to the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria referenced above. A letter dated January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. CO Emission Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c)(3) of the CAA requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The TACB, the TNRCC effective September 1, 1993, included the requisite El Paso inventory in the CO SIP. The base year for the inventory was 1990, using a three month CO season of November 1990 through January 1991. Stationary point sources, stationary area sources, on-road mobile sources, and nonroad mobile sources of CO were included in the inventory. Stationary sources with emissions greater than 100 tons per year within a 25-mile buffer of the nonattainment area were also included in the inventory. The following list presents a summary of the CO peak season daily emissions estimates in tons per day (t/d) by source category: Point Sources, nine t/d; Area Sources, three t/d; Mobile On-Road Sources, 291 t/d; Mobile Nonroad Sources, 67 t/d; Total Sources, 370 t/d. Available guidance for preparing emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992). Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of base year emission inventory submittals in order to determine approval or disapproval under section 182(a)(1). See 57 FR 13565&hyph;66, April 16, 1992. The EPA is proposing to grant approval of the El Paso CO base year emission inventory submitted to the EPA based on Level I, II, and III review findings. The following paragraphs outline the review procedures performed on the inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Level I and II review process is used to determine that all components of the base year inventory are present. The review also evaluates the level of supporting documentation provided by the State, and assesses whether the emissions were developed according to current EPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

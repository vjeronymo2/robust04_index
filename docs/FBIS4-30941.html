			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 2 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led Bosnian  Government refused to attend a new round of peace talks set to  begin Thursday after Bosnian Serbs failed to honor pledges to  withdraw their forces from the town of Gorazde, diplomats said.  The Bosnian Presidency said Thursday that it would not send any  representatives to the meeting "for the moment" but could  "eventually" attend talks on Friday, the diplomats said.    The government had demanded that the Serbs withdraw all  armed  men from around the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde before the  talks went ahead. But earlier Thursday a UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo said that contrary to a written  pledge by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, some 150 armed  Serb policemen were still inside a UN-imposed three-kilometre  (two-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde. "Nothing has changed  in Gorazde," regarding the Serb forces withdrawal, UNPROFOR  spokesman Major Rob Annink said.    The withdrawal of the 150 Serbs from the exclusion zone on  the east bank of the River Drina had been the main condition of  the Bosnian Government of President Alija Izetbegovic for  attending the peace talks.    Under threat of NATO air strikes, Bosnian Serbs ended a  weeks-long offensive against Gorazde earlier this year and  pulled their heavy weapons back from the exclusion zone, but  refused to withdraw the policemen from what they said was a  Serb-inhabited section of the town. Karadzic, in a letter sent  to UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi on Wednesday promised that  "as of today there will be no armed Serb personnel" in the  three-kilometre zone.    Akashi said in a statement Wednesday that Karadzic's letter  could provide "a sufficient basis for the opening of the meeting  in Geneva" but the talks "could not take place unless all  Bosnian Serb soliders, militia and armed civilians were  redeployed outside the zone."    Akashi was expected here from Zagreb later Thursday to chair  the talks, which were also to be attended by mediators Thorvald  Stoltenberg of the United Nations and Lord Owen of the European  Union and the special U.S. and Russian envoys Charles Redman and  Vitaliy Churkin. The Serbs were to be represented by Karadzic  and Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic.    Diplomatic sources said the international community and the  United Nations have been applying strong pressure on the  belligerents to return to the negotiating table with hopes of  reaching tangible results, first on a ceasefire and then on an  administrative division of Bosnia along ethnic lines, within  eight weeks. But a Croatian diplomat said Wednesday that it  might not be in the best interests of the newly formed  Moslem-Croat federation "to settle for a comprehensive cessation  of hostilities."    "Previous agreements have all been violated by the Serbs,"  the diplomat said. "A new one, if implemented, would freeze the  military situation on the ground, thus benefitting the Serbs."  He said the belligerents would then be forced to deal with a  contact group trying to settle the conflict at all costs, "even  if it rewards Serb aggression."    The contact group -- the European Union, Russia and the  United States -- tried in vain last week to get the warring  factions to agree to a four-month truce and to accept a plan  that would give 51 percent of territory to the Moslem-Croat  federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. The Croats and Moslems  are demanding 58 percent of the territory. The Serbs currently  control about 70 percent.    A French Foreign Ministry spokesman meanwhile said in Paris  that representatives of the contact group would meet again with  the warring Bosnian parties Saturday and Sunday in Geneva. The  meeting had been scheduled for next week but was moved up for  "practical reasons" related to Thursday and Friday's planned  Geneva discussions, spokesman Richard Duque said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "A.V.": "Major Framework Accord in Sight for </F> France Telecom in Vietnam"]    [Text] France Telecom reportedly is about to sign a  framework cooperation accord with the Vietnamese postal and  telecommunications authorities involving the installation of  300,000 to 500,000 telephone lines within a three-year period.  The accord represents an investment of approximately 3-5  billion French francs. It will be announced during Industry  Minister Gerard Longuet's visit to Vietnam, and it will be  initialed by France Telecom President Marcel Roulet and his  Vietnamese counterpart in Hanoi in late February.    For the moment, the French telecommunications operator has  restricted itself to acknowledging that "the ministry has  prepared a memorandum of cooperation." The legal aspects of the  agreement remain to be defined. This accord would move France  from fourth to second place among foreign investors in the SRV,  following Taiwan ($1.5 billion in capital investments), but  ahead of Hong Kong and South Korea. There are four legal  formulas for foreign investments in Vietnam: a simple  cooperation contract; a 100-percent subsidiary; a joint venture  with minimum foreign participation of 30 percent; and the BOT  (Build Operate Transfer), which stipulates the transfer of the  foreign partner's operations to the Vietnamese state after a  specified period of time. The Vietnamese partner favors the  last formula, whereas France Telecom prefers a joint venture.</p>

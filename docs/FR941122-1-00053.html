			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. The Commission seeks comment on whether a fixed-radius protected service area (e.g., 30 kilometers which approximates the 40 dBu signal strength contour of an SMR station operating with maximum facilities) should be established for incumbent SMR systems so that such systems may construct new base stations within the existing station's 40 dBu signal strength contour. The Commission asks commenters to include a technical analysis of this proposal and any alternative proposals that permit greater flexibility for locally licensed SMR systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. The Commission has previously concluded that the co-channel interference protection obligations of SMR MTA licensees with respect to other MTA licensees would be similar to those imposed in the cellular and PCS services where licensees are required to comply with interference protection criteria between Commission-defined service areas only at service area borders. Thus, the Commission tentatively concludes that wide-area SMR licensees in the 800 MHz band should not be allowed to exceed a signal level of 22 dBuV/m at their service area boundaries (unless they negotiate a different signal strength limit with all potentially affected adjacent licensees). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. In addition, the Commission proposed to apply out-of-band emission rules only to the ``outer'' channels included in a MTA license and to spectrum adjacent to interior channels used by incumbents. The proposed 800 MHz SMR emission mask rule is that for any frequency outside an MTA licensee's frequency block, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 plus 10 log  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation. The Further Notice seeks comment on this proposal including a request for technical analysis of the proposal and discussion of any alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Commission previously established a uniform 12-month period for constructing a standard base station in all CMRS services licensed on a channel-by-channel basis. The Further Notice proposed to no longer grant extended construction periods on non-MTA channels under &sect;90.629 of the Commission's rules. The Commission seeks comment on whether strict enforcement of this construction period will be an adequate protection against spectrum warehousing on frequencies occupied by local SMR systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Commission tentatively concludes that MTA licensees should have five years to construct their systems. Because some existing wide-area SMR licensees have already been granted extended implementation periods of up to five years, the Commission requests comment on how existing licensees with extended implementation periods should be treated. It also asks commenters to address what is a reasonable timeframe for completing such systems given the technologies presently available in the SMR market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. The Commission proposes that MTA-based 800 MHz SMR licensees be required to provide coverage to one-third of the MTA population within three years of initial license grant and to two-thirds of the population by the end of their five-year construction period. The Commission further proposed that an MTA licensee must satisfy these requirements regardless of the extent of the presence of incumbents within its MTA block. The Commission also seeks comment on whether a specific definition of what constitutes coverage should be adopted for this service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should single channel coverage be sufficient or should a mult-channel coverage requirement be imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. The Commission also tentatively concludes that an MTA licensee's failure to meet the coverage requirements imposed either at the third or fifth years of its construction period should result in forfeiture of the license. This penalty for failure to comply with coverage requirements is consistent with the penalties provided in the Commission's broadband PCS rules and would allow the spectrum to be made available to other qualified applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. The Commission tentatively concludes that the eligibility rules for the General Category channels and Industrial/Land Transportation and Business Category Channels (collectively, ``Pool Channels'') should be revised to prohibit SMR and non-SMR applicants from applying for the same channels in the future. The Commission seeks comment, however, on how the spectrum should be allocated to address the relative demand for SMR and non-SMR services. One alternative would be to eliminate SMR eligibility for all future licensing on General Category and Pool Channels. Another alternative would be to prohibit future inter-category sharing by SMR applicants on Pool Channels, but to designate a portion of the General Category for SMR-only licensing while the remaining channels would be available only to non-SMR licensees. A third alternative would be to designate the entire General Category for future licensing exclusively to SMR applicants. In light of the proposed restriction on future SMR use of Pool Channels, and possibly, General Category channels that are designated for non-SMR use, the Commission also tentatively concludes that other Part 90 services should be restricted from future eligibility for licenses on SMR Category channels. The Further Notice seeks comment on this proposal, including whether incumbent SMRs on the General Category or Pool Channels should be allowed to apply for new authorizations on these channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. The Commission proposes that both existing licensees and new applicants should be eligible for MTA licenses as well as for local licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band. It requests comment on this proposal, including whether there is any need to restrict eligibility for MTA licenses to incumbent licensees (or to restrict eligibility based on other criteria) if competitive bidding procedures are used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

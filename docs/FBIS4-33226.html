			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Central Reserve Bank [BCR] President  German Suarez reported that "to prevent the nominal exchange  rate from dropping, $700 million has been bought from the black  market so far this year, $300 million of which was for the  executive branch, while the remaining $400 million was for the  BCR."    He added that the $400 million purchased by the BCR almost  doubles the amount that was purchased last year, and that this  means that the bank is always striving to improve the exchange  rate parity, in order to avoid causing big losses to the export  sector.    Suarez noted that international reserves stand at  approximately $4.6 billion, and that this amount includes the  income of currency from the sale of Peruvian Telephone Company  and National Telecommunications Enterprise. "If we exclude this  operation, reserves stand at $3.2 billion," he said.    During a brief explanation to the Budget Committee, which  summoned Suarez and Economy Minister Jorge Camet to explain the  targets that the Letter of Intent registered for their sector,  the BCR president said the exchange rate lag stood at  approximately 15 percent.    He said that if the inflow of foreign capital for investment  grows, the exchange rate lag could also grow. "Colombia and  Argentina are experiencing the same foreign capital growth, and  their exchange rate lag stands at 16 and 40 percent,  respectively," he said.  <H5>  Legal Bank Reserves </H5>   Concerning legal bank reserves, Suarez said additional  reserves covering foreign currency deposits will not be reduced  until confidence in the national currency improves. "Dollar  deposits still account for 70 percent of bank deposits," he said.    Concerning expectations over an exchange rate increase,  Camet  said the budget provided for an overestimated exchange rate of  2.7 new soles to the dollar for the end of the year. "The wisest  figure was given by the BCR calculation, which indicated 2.43  new soles to the dollar at the end of the year," he emphasized.    Economic analysts have said that the purchase of foreign  currency by the BCR will have a slight effect this month because  enterprises will need dollars in May to meet time-in-service  compensation (CTS) requirements. As is known, most employees  have chosen this type of dollar deposit.</p>

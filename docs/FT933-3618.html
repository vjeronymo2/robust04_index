			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: A slice of Saturday night - Theatre A Slice of Saturday Night by the Heather Brothers has joined the long list of musical shows now running in London's West End and may well stay for some time. The best non-sung line comes at the end when Dennis Waterman, playing the ageing club-owner, bouncer and performer, Eric 'Rubber Legs' De Vene, says of his establishment: 'It's one of life's big finishing schools.' Certainly that's the way it seems. People in the 1990s look back at the 1960s just as people who grew up in the 1950s looked back at the 1920s: nostalgia for a romanticised age. Slice does not quite repeat the old songs. It consists of a series of derivatives, some of them mildly satirical. It also has just the touch of a clever plot: an unattractive youth, played with the utmost professionalism by Peter Heppelthwaite, wagers that he can make Frigid Bridget (Judith Ellis) before the night is out. He doesn't. The young pop star, Sonia, sings and plays the 17-year-old Sue with huge assurance. On the first night an audience of all ages was delighted, especially in the second act. It is during the interval that the show takes off. The Heather Brothers already have Lust, the musical of The Country Wife, running at the Haymarket. Tomorrow comes the revival of one of the biggest 1960s musicals of all: Hair at the Old Vic. Strand Theatre, London (071) 240 0300</p>

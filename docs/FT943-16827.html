			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Societies hope for more home loans freedom Greater freedom for building societies in how they fund their mortgage lending business has been signalled by the issue of draft guidance on securitisation. The provisional guidance from the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, does not advocate the financing technique, but by setting a framework for how it could be done it should remove the constraints caused by regulatory uncertainty. It sees securitisation as particularly relevant for large societies which want a new way of accessing wholesale funds. This might arise where a society had almost reached the 40 per cent ceiling on the amount it could raise on the wholesale markets, or where its ability to win mortgage business outstripped its ability to attract retail savings. The technique allows mortgage lenders to take loans off their balance sheet, so removing the risk of default, and freeing up capital. The assets are placed in a special-purpose vehicle which raises money by selling the debt securities to investors. Interest on these 'mortgage-backed' securities is funded by the loan repayments. The system has been widely used in the US for more than 10 years but only relatively recently in the UK. The guidance brings greater flexibility to the commission's attitude to the treatment of the membership rights of borrowers whose mortgages are securitised, in a way that could make this more attractive to a society's board. But it also emphasises the need for societies to be clear and fair in how they explain any such moves to those borrowers whose mortgages would be affected. Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest society, has led interest in securitisation in the sector. Nationwide and Skipton have also carried out work on the funding technique. The draft guidance reflects other recent developments by addressing the increasing interest from societies in buying mortgage books from other lenders. It says that any society planning to make a significant purchase should consult the commission first. The guidance for societies on securitisation is now closer to that issued by the Bank of England. Both Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank have securitised mortgages and loans in the past year or so. In February Abbey National acquired the capability to securitise future mortgages when it bought the Pounds 900m UK residential mortgage book of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.</p>

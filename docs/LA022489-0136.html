			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CYANIDE KILLED SCHOOL TRUSTEE, CORONER FINDS  </P> <P> Capistrano school trustee Jan Overton died 13 months ago of cyanide poisoning,  officials confirmed Thursday. They declined to discuss how the poison might  have gotten into her body.  </P> <P> Overton, 46, collapsed at her Dana Point home Jan. 24, 1988, as she prepared to  leave for a family outing. Paramedics temporarily revived Overton after she  collapsed, but she was declared dead at San Clemente General Hospital.  </P> <P> Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Robert Rivas said Thursday that  cyanide poisoning caused Overton's death, but he declined to discuss the  investigation or how long officials have known about the cause of death.  </P> <P> "An investigation is continuing," he said.  </P> <P> Overton was on the seven-mem ber Capistrano Unified School District Board of  Trustees from November, 1976, until her death, said Jackie Cerra, a district  spokesman. She was also president of the Orange County School Boards Assn. in  1985-86.  </P> <P> Overton had been suffering from an unknown illness, according to friends and  family members.  </P> <P> Her husband, Richard, said his wife was taking at least 13 types of medicine at  the time of her death. He declined to say what she was being treated for but  said "she had a number of complaints."  </P> <P> "It's still hard to realize Janet is gone," he said. "Now this comes along.  It's really just impossible to believe it."  </P> <P> He declined to speculate on how his wife died.  </P> <P> Dr. Bernard Huss, Overton's doctor, would not discuss her treatment but said he  is surprised by the coroner's office report.  </P> <P> "I'll be darned," Huss said. "I guess it would make you wonder."  </P> <P> He said he is not aware of any medication he prescribed for Overton that might  have contained cyanide.  </P> <P> Huss declined to give specifics about Overton's treatment, except to say that  she had lost some weight in the months before she died.  </P> <P> News of the coroner's report shocked Overton's neighbors.  </P> <P> One neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said Overton was a "very  friendly" woman.  </P> <P> "It really bothers me," he said. "It's so strange. We're just wondering what  happened. She was a fine woman."  </P> <P> Another neighbor said Overton appeared to be healthy despite her weight loss.  </P> <P> "She was as healthy as a horse," the neighbor said. "I watched her build a  wooden fence in the yard. Now it (the death) makes sense."  </P></p>

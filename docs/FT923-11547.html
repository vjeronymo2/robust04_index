			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Greasing the wheels of industry Money may make the world go round, but it is grease that helps machine bearings turn. Conventional low-friction enhancers like graphite have long been used as lubricants, but they form layers of uncontrolled thickness and provide only temporary protection. Instead, an innovative lubricating grease called Micro Mu2 changes the surface structure of metal by bonding a low-friction film just one molecule thick on to it. The film permanently reduces wear in metal bearings and enables them to run at higher loads, speeds and temperatures. The result is longer machine life, reduced maintenance costs, higher productivity and lower energy consumption. Micro Mu2, developed by James Walker, the Surrey-based lubrication specialist, comprises a hydrocarbon surface modifier carried in a multi-purpose lithium-complex synthetic grease Independent tests show that it reduces friction by 35 per cent over conventional lithium grease.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiel (DPA) -- Next year German soldiers will go to  Russia for joint military exercises. In return, in 1996 Russian  units are to train together with the Bundeswehr in western  Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian Democratic  Union, said at the 100th Kiel Week on Saturday [18 June].    "Europe is growing together best when people meet," Ruehe  said. This also applies to the armed forces. Today Central  Europe has the opportunity to become the anchor of stability for  the entire continent. For this purpose, cooperation with Russia  must be intensified. "Security and peace in Europe can be  achieved only together with and not against Russia." At the  same time, the minister announced that he will raise the number  of reservists to such an extent that 100,000 of them can  participate in exercises every year.</p>

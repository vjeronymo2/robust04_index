			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Dairy trade in dual attack on Milk Marque The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processing companies, is to complain to the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission about the shake-up of the UK dairy market which begins tomorrow. The market will undergo its biggest change for 61 years when the Milk Marketing Board, the statutory buyer of milk, is abolished and farmers become free to sell to any purchaser. But the new arrangements, which take effect after six years of debate about reform, could run into an early challenge from the competition authorities. The Dairy Trade Federation will complain to the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission on the grounds that a regulated public monopoly is being replaced by an unregulated private one. The complaint is directed at Milk Marque, the voluntary farmers' co-operative set up by the board to act as a milk broker with the board's chief executive, Mr Andrew Dare, as its head. Milk Marque has secured 66 per cent of supplies in England and Wales - deregulation is taking place simultaneously in Scotland and is due next April in Northern Ireland. The rest of the Pounds 3.3bn market is fragmented between about 40 dairy companies or small groups of farmer-processors buying direct from farms. The dairy companies say this gives Milk Marque the power to push prices up sharply. This, they say, is unreasonable since production is constrained by European milk quotas that prevent British farmers from making more than 85 per cent of the domestic market's needs. The immediate beneficiaries will be farmers, who will enjoy a price rise of 2p a litre next month. But liberalisation could anger both dairy companies and consumers. Mr Mark Lynch, food manufacturing analyst with brokers SG Warburg, expects the supermarket price of a pint of milk to rise by about 1p - less than the 2p-3p suggested by processors, but still contrary to assurances in June by Mrs Gillian Shephard, then agriculture minister, that consumers would benefit from the new market. He predicts that cheese, butter and yoghurt prices will also rise but says dairy companies will be unable fully to recover their increased costs. Some big groups such as Unigate have issued profits warnings. Flotation of the board's processing arm, Dairy Crest, which was meant to provide the working capital for Milk Marque, has been postponed indefinitely. Dairy Crest has also announced the closure of two factories with the total loss of 260 jobs because of the cost of milk. Mr Roger Davenport, managing director of The Cheese Company, the UK's biggest independent cheese manufacturer, says capacity is already being shed as cheese manufacturers feel the squeeze. 'If this is allowed to go too far it would be a tragedy not only for the country but also for the farmer.' Nevertheless the dairy trade is not assured of success in its challenge to the organisation's dominance. It could prove politically embarrassing for Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to refer Milk Marque to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission since it would imply criticism of the government's approval of the new arrangements.</p>

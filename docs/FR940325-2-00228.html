			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scheduling Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Area exercise scheduling process is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The NSCC, comprised of representatives of the Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS, will meet in January of each year to develop a proposed Area exercise schedule for the upcoming three year period. (For example, when the NSCC meets in 1995, the three years considered will be 1996, 1997 and 1998.) The information included in the proposed schedule will be the exercise Area, the exercise quarter, whether the exercise is industry-led or government-led, and the types of industry that will lead the exercise (vessel, marine transportation-related (mtr) facility, non marine transportation-related facility, offshore facility or pipeline). Once developed, the proposed schedule will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in February of each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The NSCC will solicit input on this proposed schedule for each three year period. The NSCC is specifically looking for input from On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs), Coast Guard Districts and EPA Regional Offices, the Regional Response Teams, the states and the industry plan holders regarding the Area scheduled to be exercised, the time frame for each exercise, the mix of the industry types selected for participation, and any federal, state or local government or industry operational issues affecting the schedule. The NSCC is also looking for industry plan holders to lead the Area exercises or participate in the government-led Area exercises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. When reviewing the proposed schedule, issues to be considered at the local Area level include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Can the Area sponsor an exercise in the quarter listed? Do Area activities already scheduled preclude an exercise from being held in this time frame? What specific dates would be appropriate for the exercise? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Is the industry type to be exercised in accordance with the proposed schedule appropriate for the Area? For instance, if needed for the exercise planned, is there a pipeline or offshore platform operating in the Area? Has one specific type of industry dominated Area exercises in the past? For example, have many or most of the Area exercises in the past focused on vessels? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Should the Area receive credit for response to a major pollution incident? Was the response to this incident evaluated in accordance with the PREP guidelines? (Only responses to major pollution incidents that have been evaluated using the criteria for an Area exercise, as outlined in the PREP guidelines, will be considered for credit as an Area exercise.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Issues to be considered at the district and regional level include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Does the mix of industry types proposed for involvement in the exercises fairly represent the district or region? Are all industry types adequately covered? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

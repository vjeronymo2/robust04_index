			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / EU ministers support Paye for OECD post EU ministers lined up behind Mr Jean-Claude Paye to stay on as secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development writes Lionel Barber. But the US administration has already signalled that it does not want Mr Paye, a Frenchman, to serve another term. It is standing by Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister. EU support for Mr Paye is linked to a feeling that France has lost out in the recent nominations for top international jobs - a fact underlined by the impending departure after 10 years of Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Support for Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, as a candidate for the vacant post of secretary-general of the Nato alliance appeared to strengthen over the weekend. But Mr Hans Van den Broek, the EU commissioner for external political affairs, is keeping his hat in the ring. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, was approached last month, but indicated that he wanted to remain in his present post.</p>

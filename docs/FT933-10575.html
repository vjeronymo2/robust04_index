			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sumitomo rejects copper squeeze speculation MR YASUO Hamanaka, the senior manager responsible for Sumitomo Corporation's copper trading operations, has been described by many London Metal Exchange traders as the single most powerful man in the copper market. So it is not surprising that his name has been mentioned most frequently in discussions about the 'squeeze' threatening to create turmoil on the LME's market in September and October. One trader said yesterday that Sumitomo had reached a position 'where if it were October today, it would control all the LME stocks'. There have been other widespread suggestions that the copper market is being manipulated to boost the price even though stocks in LME warehouses are at a 15-year peak. The LME board has voiced its concern by twice giving warnings that it has the authority to take any action necessary to maintain an orderly market. Mr Hamanaka, however, denied that Sumitomo - or any other organisation  - was attempting to manipulate copper prices upwards. 'It would be impossible to do so when demand (for the metal) is so fundamentally weak,' he said. Sumitomo is one of the world's leading traders of physical copper, as distinct from the 'paper' variety on futures exchanges. It handles 500,000 tonnes a year for clients, mainly in Asia and the Far East but increasingly in Europe too. Like many other Japanese corporations, Sumitomo is forbidden to speculate in commodities markets. Nevertheless, it does hedge its copper market dealings by trading futures and options along with buying copper for immediate delivery. In this way it exerts a tremendous influence on the market. Mr Hamanaka suggested the acute supply tightness that had developed on the LME market between September and October was highly technical and could be traced to the steep fall in copper prices in May, from which 'there had to be some reaction'. He added that the backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery) for September to three months could not be justified. It was unlikely to become unusually large and would probably range between Dollars 10 and Dollars 30 a tonne. (During a similar squeeze in 1991, when the LME still quoted copper in sterling, the LME board took the unprecedented step of limiting the backwardation to Pounds 25 a tonne a day after it threatened to go above Pounds 100). 'Demand (for copper) in Europe is weak. The US is recovering but is not booming. The Asian market is steady but only average,' Mr Hamanaka pointed out. Mainland China would probably consume 800,000 tonnes of copper this year, compared with domestic production of about 500,000 tonnes, and Sumitomo estimated that 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of the metal was shipped from Europe to China in July. 'I hear the Chinese will continue to take more copper to stockpile.'</p>

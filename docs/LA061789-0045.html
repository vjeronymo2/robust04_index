			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OBJECTIONS TO BURBANK AIRPORT POLL  </P> <P> Our club consists of 856 members. Most of the members live in the East Valley  with their families. We object to the jet noise from the heavy air traffic at  the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport.  </P> <P> We believe that your survey of 710 people, mostly from the three cities that  own the airport, is erroneous and misleading. Not one of our members was  polled. And we are 856 individuals plus our spouses and children and  grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  </P> <P> We are the so-called "silent majority," with no political clout over the  Burbank Airport Authority. Your article of May 28 is absolutely incorrect to  assume that only a very small percentage of people oppose a new airport  terminal. We all do oppose the expansion. We all are annoyed by the hellish jet  noise.  </P> <P> REUBEN ISRAEL  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P>  Israel is a member of the Mid-Valley Senior Center in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson pays Pounds 55m for French shopping complex Hammerson, the property company which sold its Australian portfolio last month for Pounds 250m, has started to reinvest the proceeds by acquiring a shopping centre near Paris. The company is paying Unibail, the French property group FFr459m (Pounds 55m) for the Espace St Quentin centre in the new town of St Quentin en Yvelines, 20km south-west of Paris. The centre includes 117 units amounting to 206,000 sq ft of retail space. At the purchase price, the initial yield is 8.3 per cent. Hammerson sold its Australian assets on an exit yield of 5.3 per cent. Espace St Quentin was opened in 1987 and is 99.5 per cent let to tenants including Benetton, Etam and Naf Naf. Annual net rental income is about FFr40m, with rents linked to the level of construction prices and turnover achieved by each store. Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive, said: 'We believe there will be opportunities to add value to this property by active management.' Hammerson already owns eight French properties, but the acquisition marks its first shopping centre investment. As in the UK, France now operates a planning regime which discourages out-of-town shopping centres in favour of town centre developments. Mr Spinney said that Hammerson was looking for further acquisitions in France. 'We are continuing to look at retail properties and will consider buying offices but only in prime Paris locations with good specifications,' he said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Article by Yevgeniy Timofeyev: "New All-Russian Classifier: </F> Russia Changing Over to World Accounting Standards"]    [Text] The lack of correspondence between the Russian  statistical and accounting systems and world standards is giving  rise to many difficulties in mutual relations with Western  partners. Noncorrelation in the definitions of principle  concepts is leading to a situation whereby the partners are  speaking seemingly different languages. Moreover, the existing  classifiers for the most part no longer meet even intra-Russian  requirements. The changeover of the Russian accounting system to  a language which is understood throughout the world has become  the primary task of the latest development of the Center for  Economic Market Conditions under the Russian Government and the  Center for Economic Classifications, the "All-Russian Classifier  of Types of Economic Activity, Products, and Services" (OKDP).  Its electronic version (12 Mb) went to the main federal economic  departments yesterday.    [Begin boxed material]  <H5>  Basic Problems Resolved on the Basis of the All-Russian </H5> Classifier of Types of Economic Activity, Products, and Services    --Organization of "horizontal ties" in the production sphere  and the sphere of services between producers and consumers of  products and services.    --Provision of strict and precise functioning of the system  of taxation, investments, and crediting;    --Creation of regional and interregional information systems  of economic management;    --Creation of systems for cataloging products;    --Creation of a system of state registers of enterprises  with  correlation by types of economic activity implemented, products  produced, or services provided;    --Formulation of a system of "electronic marketing" of  products and services;    --Realization of a set of accounting functions within the  framework of the system of state statistics.    [End boxed material]    At the present time there are three basic economic  classifiers in effect in Russia: the OKONKh--the All-Union  Classifier of Sectors of the National Economy; the OKP--the  All-Russian Classifier of Industrial and Agricultural Products,  and the OKSP--the All-Union Classifier of Building Products.    The development of a new classifier is the first serious  result of work within the framework of the State Program for  Changeover to the System of Accounting and Statistics Accepted  in World Practice, which was ratified by the Russian parliament  in 1992. It is noteworthy that the principle adopted for the  OKDP is not the experience "of a number of countries with  consideration of Russian specifics" (up to this time the  consideration of these specifics has, as a rule, not brought  anything good), but rather the internationally accepted  classifiers. The organization of the classification groupings of  the OKDP is based on the International Standard Industrial  Classification of All Economic Activities and the Central  Products Classification, which have been ratified by the UN  Statistical Commission.    The operational introduction of a new universal classifier  will entail an entire series of significant changes. The state  system of registers of enterprises will be changed, and  comprehensive data bases will be created based on it.  Specialists point out that the information gathered in these  data bases will have very significant commercial value--it will  make it possible to locate business partners more cheaply and  accurately. It will also be of considerable importance for  taxation. For example, the absolute majority of benefits  provided by Russian tax legislation is associated with the type  of activity engaged in by the payer of one tax or another. Only  with the aid of a classifier is it possible to determine  precisely whether or not the payer is entitled to this benefit.    The OKDP is being introduced by Goskomstat [RF State  Committee on Statistics] into statistical practice as of 1 July  1994 (Gosstandard [RF State Committee on Standardization,  Metrology, and Certification] has already sanctioned its  introduction as of 1 January of this year). It is presumed that  at first the OKDP will operate in parallel with the classifier  of industrial and building products. After the development and  introduction of a second version of the OKDP (proposed date--1  January 1996), the entire set of current classifiers (except for  the TN VED [commodity nomenclature list for foreign economic  activity], which is associated with the OKDP by a conversion  table) will be repealed. This moment may be called the final  unification of world and Russian statistical standards.</p>

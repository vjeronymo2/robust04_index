			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC TRIES THE BITTER TASTE OF LEAK SOUP  </P> <P> A comment about your articles on the disclosure of Bryant Gumbel's private memo  criticizing his NBC colleagues:  </P> <P> Since I retired, I've watched NBC's "Today," which makes oldsters feel a bit  important by showing photos of some who have lived past 90 or 100. Bless  Willard Scott's heart -- he's sure to say of a picture, "Isn't she beautiful?"  But, I have noticed, the rude Bryant Gumbel has a sneer on his face throughout  this.  </P> <P> We oldsters should be fussed over: We have retirement salaries to spend and  plenty of time to shop.  </P> <P> DOLORES Z. CASCALES  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

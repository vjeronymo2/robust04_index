			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray Pounds 1.5m buy SANDERSON Murray &amp; Elder, the north-of-England motor distributor, is to buy a Pounds 1.47m site in Manchester to house its two Ford dealerships in the city, and sell its small Lancaster Rover dealership. SME said yesterday the sale of the Lancaster dealership, was 'in line with SME's strategy of concentrating on building a group of larger volume dealerships'. It was bought as part of the package of three dealerships acquired from Avis in 1990, when entrepreneur Tony Bramall returned to the motor trade and took SME out of textiles. SME said in September that its Manchester dealerships, bought for Pounds 2m in 1991, had not performed well in the six months to June 30, contributing to a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 765,000 to Pounds 633,000, in spite of higher turnover of Pounds 51.1m (Pounds 27.5m). Ms Del Barratt, of house brokers Albert E Sharp, said the Manchester sites were poorly located and equipped, and the move would enable SME to reduce overheads and improve the truck and car dealerships' performance. She forecast 1992 profits of Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.55m), rising to Pounds 1.75m this year. SME said the deal was conditional on the group achieving the Pounds 900,000 sale of its Rover dealership to Coltread.</p>

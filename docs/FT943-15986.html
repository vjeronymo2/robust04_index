			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures closed well ahead of the day's lows after a firm Wall Street steadied a nervous London market awaiting news on US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening level of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 was at 2,984, below expectations, and it seemed to set the tone for the next few hours. With little in the way of UK economic data on which to focus, dealers once again chose to focus on the decline in the European bond markets which sent the contract drifting lower. A US investment bank was said to have been one of the big sellers during the morning, as were several other US houses, as the market waited for news from the US. Having fallen to a low of 2,935 after lunch, the upward direction of US bonds and the firm opening on Wall Street which followed helped to steady nerves in London, leading to a bounce in the contract. It ended at 2,959, down 28 from its previous close, at a discount to cash and around 9 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of 5 points. Volume was low at 14,101. Turnover in traded options improved from Monday's poor levels to reach 24,819. Most of the activity was in index options, the FT-SE 100 seeing 10,534 lots dealt and the Euro FT-SE 4,724. Lasmo was the most active stock option with a total of 2,566 trades.</p>

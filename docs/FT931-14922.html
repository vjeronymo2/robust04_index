			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation There is not much point any more in carping about whether the Rank Organisation was wise to buy Mecca in 1990. The purchase left the company saddled with a large debt burden at just the wrong time in the cycle. Even critics of the original purchase must admit that the company has managed to live with high gearing reasonably well. Capital spending has been maintained at a level high enough to keep ahead of its competitors. Thanks admittedly to Pounds 151m worth of disposals, it recorded a positive cash flow of Pounds 59m last year before currency translation changes. Now that conditions in the US are starting to improve, Rank thus seems on the road to recovery. The danger for the equity market is in over-estimating the speed at which it will travel. The Pounds 15m loss in video distribution will surely narrow further in 1993 and it is scarcely conceivable that Butlins will have as bad a year as 1992, but Rank itself is rightly cautious about the return of UK consumer confidence and the outlook for Rank Xerox is poor. Rank seems set for a year of only modest profit growth. Further hotel disposals may make a small dent in its debt and the signs are Rank may realise quite attractive prices. But, barring a sale of its film and television interests, gearing will still be undesirably high a year from now. That means dividend growth may be slow to resume. Rank may yet be tempted to launch a rights issue once serious recovery gets under way. Small wonder the vultures are hovering over the film interests even though Rank categorically maintains they are not for sale. It might make more strategic sense for Rank to exit from its joint venture with Xerox. But if a serious offer did emerge for the film interests, shareholders would be right to demand it not be rejected out of hand.</p>

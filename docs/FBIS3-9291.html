High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), carrying 112 tonnes of  flour, on Monday unhindered and safely crossed Bosnian Serb  territory on its way for Moslem-held Tuzla, eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb military  sources.    Owing to the efforts of the Bosnian Serbs, the relief aid  ground routes towards Tuzla and other Moslem-, i.e. Croat-held  towns in Bosnia, have so far remained safe and open.    Bosnian Serb military sources once again rejected claims by  the international community that the opening of the Tuzla  airport is "necessary" out of humanitarian reasons, and  expressed doubt that other reasons and intentions lie behind the  action.    The Bosnian Serbs, fearing that the Moslems could use the  airport to illegally acquire arms under the guise of  humanitarian aid, have made its opening conditional that the  airport is monitored by Russian peacekeepers and that Serb  observers control the cargo checks.</p>

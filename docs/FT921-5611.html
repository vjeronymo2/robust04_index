			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government defeat on inspectors - Education Bill THE GOVERNMENT may be forced to abandon efforts to hand responsibility for the inspection of schools over to school governors after being 'ambushed' by Labour peers last night. In the surprise result of a vote on the Education (Schools) Bill, the Lords decided by 95 to 67, a majority of 28, to amend legislation intended to allow parents to choose school inspectors. A second government defeat pushed through Labour's alternative proposal to pass control from local education authorities to the national schools inspectorate. The vote represents a serious embarrassment to the government, which has repeatedly trumpeted the controversial changes as a cornerstone of its policy to shake up education by devolving powers to parents. Commenting later, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, said: 'We will have to decide what to do. 'If the Bill is of a form consistent with the Parent's Charter we will take it through the Commons. If it is not, we will try to amend it.' Labour has been widely expected to make political capital from attacking the concept of 'privatised' inspections as a triumph of political dogma over common sense. Nonetheless, the government's defeat is an unwelcome reminder to its business managers of the Conservatives' vulnerability to surprise attack. While the Opposition may support other clauses, there are now doubts as to whether there will be time to reverse last night's defeat if an April 9 election is called. Before the vote, Baroness Blatch for the government warned the peers that the amendment sought to 'tear the heart out of the bill'. Afterwards, Mr Jack Straw. Labour's education spokesman, said: 'The bill was a piece of wreckage before this defeat and now it is well on the way to being sunk.' Government ministers must now decide whether to attempt to reverse the defeat next week, to accept the changes, or to abandon the inspection elements in the bill.</p>

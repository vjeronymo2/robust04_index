			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 CITED IN RAIDS AGAINST ILLEGAL KEEPING OF FERRETS  </P> <P> After an 11-month undercover investigation, state game wardens cracked down on  ferret fanciers over the last week, raiding homes in Los Angeles, Orange and  San Bernardino counties and issuing citations against seven people accused of  illegally keeping 36 of the weasel-like animals as pets.  </P> <P> Officials of the State Department of Fish and Game said those cited in the  raids, including three in Los Angeles County, would be charged with violations  of state laws that prohibit the possession, transportation and importation of  ferrets. Officials also seized six desert tortoises, three polecats and a  raccoon.  </P> <P> Curt Taucher, a department spokesman, said the raids were carried out between  last Thursday and Monday night.  </P> <P> He said the investigation began in April after agents saw a newspaper ad  featuring ferrets for sale and a state undercover agent bought one, then  continued making contact with underground breeders of the animals.  </P> <P> Ferrets, also known as "European polecats," are in the weasel and raccoon  family. State officials estimate that there are 250,000 to 500,000 being kept  illegally in California and say they sell for as much as $5,000.  </P> <P> Although owners say the animals make good pets, state laws forbid the breeding  and sale of ferrets because they pose a hazard to children and wildlife,  Taucher said. Ferrets carry a strain of rabies that cannot be eliminated by any  known vaccine.  </P> <P> Patricia Richards, a Yucaipa woman who heads the Southern California Ferret  Assn., was one of those cited by state game wardens, who also raided homes in  Los Angeles, Lawndale and Sherman Oaks. Richards, who lost 22 ferrets, accused  state agents of a setup.  </P> <P> Taucher said that although Richards has "every right to advocate legalizing  ferrets," she is not free to own them.  </P> <P> Each violation she and the others face carries a maximum penalty of six months  imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.  </P></p>

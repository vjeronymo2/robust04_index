			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / People: Moving upstairs in the Lever household Lever Brothers, the UK detergents business of Anglo-Dutch consumer products company Unilever, has a new chief executive, Andrew Seth, who arrives from Lever Europe in Brussels. He had been a general manager in charge of household cleaning products for the past two years, and earlier held a series of positions with Lever elsewhere in Europe as well as America. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he had been marketing director of Lever Brothers in the UK. Seth, 55, replaces Roy Brown, who at 45 has moved up to the Unilever main board as a regional director with responsibility for Africa and the Middle East. Clearly on the Unilever fast-track, Brown has moved speedily through the ranks. He had been chief executive of Lever Brothers for less than 18 months, where one of his principal tasks had been to oversee the implementation of the UK end of the new Lever Europe strategy - the drive to make the European detergent businesses work together more effectively. Also during Brown's time there, Lever introduced concentrated liquid detergent to the UK market. Among a range of many previous posts within the group, he has been technical director of Bird's Eye Walls and chairman of Plant Breeding International. His overseas experience comes partly from a period in the mid 1980s when he was chairman of Unilever's plantations activities.</p>

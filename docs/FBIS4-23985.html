			<p>BFN     [Text] The Liberian Peace Council [LPC] is again appealing  to the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group],  to be deployed in areas under the LPC's control. The LPC  secretary general, Octavius Walker, said the LPC has  persistently called on ECOMOG to deploy in Rivercess, Sinoe,  Grand Gedeh, and other areas. He said ECOMOG has refused to do  so because ECOMOG wants the LPC to declare unilateral cease-fire  (?even though) it is not a party to the Cotonou Accord. But Mr.  Walker told LINA [LIBERIA NEWS AGENCY] on Saturday [18 June]  that he does not understand why ECOMOG cannot take advantage of  their offer when the peacekeepers responded to a similar offer  in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, at a time there was fighting in the  Bomi area. Mr. Walker said since there is no fighting in  Rivercess, Sinoe, Upper Grand Gedeh, and Grand Bassa Counties,  ECOMOG should test the willingness of the LPC to cooperate in  the peace process by deploying peacekeepers in those areas.    Meanwhile, the ECOMOG High Command has insisted on the  cessation of hostilities as a precondition for deployment.</p>

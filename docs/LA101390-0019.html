			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOAL-LINE STAND SAVES FULLERTON  </P> <P> Fullerton High School, saved by a fourth-quarter goal-line stand, defeated La  Habra Friday night, 15-12, in a Freeway League game at La Habra High.  </P> <P> Leading, 15-12, with 9 minutes 3 seconds remaining in the game, Fullerton  linebacker D.C. Olsen sliced through the La Habra offensive line and tackled  Jason Johnson a yard short of the end zone.  </P> <P> La Habra had a first and goal at the four-yard line, but gained only three  yards on four plays.  </P> <P> It was crucial defensive series, because it allowed Fullerton (5-1 overall, 1-0  in league play) to hang on and defeat the Highlanders (4-2, 0-1).  </P> <P> The Fullerton defense established itself early by causing Johnson to fumble on  each of La Habra's first two series of the game, but the Indians' big defensive  plays came in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Olsen, a 6-foot 1-inch, 220-pound linebacker, had 11 solo tackles and six  assisted tackles. And two other key plays by Olsen, who also plays fullback,  were critical to Fullerton's victory.  </P> <P> He scored the go-ahead touchdown for the Indians in the third quarter on a  one-yard run.  </P> <P> Later, in the fourth quarter, Olsen took a pitch in the Fullerton end zone and  punted 40 yards on third down, giving the Indians some breathing room and  setting up another defensive stand.  </P> <P> This time, Johnson gained eight yards on first down but was stopped on two  successive running plays, the second one after gaining one yard on  fourth-and-two. Fullerton then moved from its 31 to the La Habra five before  giving the ball up.  </P> <P> It was a frustrating night for Johnson, a junior tailback who entered the game  as Orange County's second-leading rusher, averaging 165 yards a game.  </P> <P> Johnson gained 131 yards in 29 carries and scored the Highlanders' first  touchdown, but except for his efforts, La Habra's offense was anemic -- the  rest of the offense gained 40 yards total.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, Geoff Grenier, a 6-2, 225-pound running back, broke  through the La Habra defensive front and managed to outrun the secondary for a  45-yard touchdown. Grenier led Fullerton rushers with 95 yards in eight  carries.  </P></p>

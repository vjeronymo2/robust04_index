			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A draft guideline, set by the ruling coalition  parties, for the fiscal 1994 budget, came to light on 31  January. In response to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  GATT, the draft guideline cites projects for upgrading the  current agricultural foundation to protect Japanese farmers as  the centerpiece of the budget for fiscal 1994. The draft  guideline also calls for the need to strengthen the management  foundation for small-and medium-sized enterprises and take  measures for economic recovery, revitalize land transactions,  and construct houses. The draft guideline does not touch on the  purchase of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft  and the construction of new bullet-train railroads for which a  coordination of views is continuing within the ruling coalition  parties. What is noteworthy in the draft guideline is that it  calls for reforming the current tender system and drawing up a  basic plan for environment, thus revealing that the ruling  coalition parties, which came to power following a change of  government, intend to compile their first budget their own way.    The ruling coalition parties plan to ask the Policy  Secretary  Council to further discuss details of the draft guideline and to  formally adopt it as a "guideline for the compilation of the  budget for fiscal 1994" on 8 February after obtaining an  endorsement at a meeting of representatives from the ruling  coalition parties.    The draft guideline explicitly points out the need to  aggressively promote the upgrading of the agricultural  foundation in line with the "new agricultural policy," saying,  "In 1994, it is necessary to take as many emergency measures as  possible for agriculture." The draft guideline calls for  creating a new loan system to extend long-term loans to be used  for the management and operation of farming and for introducing  a new formula to promote the effective utilization of farm lands  for would-be farmers.    The centerpiece of stimulus measures in the draft guideline  is the revitalization of land and housing transactions. To that  end, the draft guideline calls for: 1) adopting a "public  housing lease system for special loans" to promote the payment  in advance for the lease of corporation-built housing; 2)  creating a new system like the Town-Building Loan System by the  Housing Loan Corporation; and 3) expanding the public  announcement places of land prices. In this way, the draft  guideline gives consideration to the fairness of land and  housing transactions to prevent a recurrence of the bubble  economy.    As for the defense budget, the draft guideline says:  "Efforts  should be made to build an efficient and moderate defense power  under the Medium-Term Defense Buildup Plan which has been  revised so as to curb defense budget spending." Regarding the  AWACS whose purchase is facing vehement opposition from the  ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan, the draft guideline  avoids mentioning it. As for a plan to review the plans to  construct new bullet-train railroads which has become a future  task for the meeting of representatives from the ruling  coalition parties and ministries and agencies involved to  coordinate their views, the draft guideline hints at the  possibility of increasing the planned three railroads and five  rail blocks, saying, "It is necessary to continue the promotion  of preparations for the construction of new bullet-train  railroads." The draft guideline, however, does not specifically  indicate the names of areas where the railroads will be  constructed and the question of securing necessary financial  resources. As for the administrative reform, deregulation,  decentralization that Prime Minister Hosokawa has publicly  promised the people, the draft guideline calls for an early  implementation of decentralization and the streamlining of  subsidies from the national treasury to local autonomous  governments.</p>

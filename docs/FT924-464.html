			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Serbia 'ready to hit back at UN': Yugoslav army chief warns against intervention in Bosnia THE Yugoslav army yesterday threw down the gauntlet to the outside world, warning that its forces may retaliate in the event of foreign military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina. General Zivota Panic, army chief-of-staff, said the army could not stand aside 'if the biological survival of the Serbian people in Bosnia is brought into question'. His remarks, in an interview due to be published today in Borba, the Belgrade daily, came as the United Nations Security Council was considering a a resolution authorising the use of force to police a no-fly zone over Bosnia imposed in October. Gen Panic said: 'Although any foreign military intervention on the territory of the former Yugoslavia would be completely illogical and would risk spreading the flames of war throughout the European continent and beyond, the Yugoslav army has been on alert for a long time. It is prepared to respond with force to eventual aggression.' His statement appeared to indicate a radical policy change in the top ranks of the army. The Yugoslav army has so far maintained that it is only responsible for defending the borders of the rump Yugoslav federation, consisting solely of Serbia and Montenegro. But General Panic yesterday made clear that despite the formal withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Bosnia in May, it plans to intervene to defend Serbs outside of Yugoslavia in case of foreign military attack. A western diplomat said yesterday: 'If Panic's statement means that Serbia and Montenegro intend to become directly involved in a confrontation with the Security Council, this will have profound effects for the Serbian people.' Nato yesterday sent the UN a list of military options for enforcing the no-fly zone, ranging from combat fighter patrols to deter Serbian aircraft from taking off to bombing Serbian airstrips. The Nato allies remain at odds, however, on what degree of force to use to ensure Serbia's compliance with the no-fly zone, and diplomats in the US are not optimistic that they will be able to agree on a UN resolution authorising enforcement before the end of the week. While the US wants to give Serbia a 15-day deadline to comply with the ban on flights over Bosnia, and to back up this ultimatum if necessary with attacks on Serbian airfields, France and the UK, who have troops at risk in Bosnia, want a substantial delay and a limited use of force. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, reiterated that UN forces on the ground in Bosnia would not be safe in the event of western intervention. He said troops belonging to Nato countries which have called for intervention should be replaced. Mr Karadzic said he had written to US president-elect Bill Clinton, saying enforcement of the no-fly zone was unnecessary as there had been no combat flights.

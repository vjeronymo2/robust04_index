			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM BROWN'S TALE OF SEX, FOOTBALL, SEX, LIFE AND SEX  </P> <P> Jim Brown walks like something's hurting him. Maybe it's the pointy-toed black  snakeskin cowboy boots. Maybe it's an old football injury. Or could one of his  numerous girlfriends have delivered a well-placed kick?  </P> <P> "I just walk funny," he said.  </P> <P> He always gets out of cars slowly, so as not to pull anything.  </P> <P> Is it possible the man is showing a few signs of age? It doesn't look as though  Father Time has exactly stomped on him with cleats, but there are a few  telltale shadows of life evident on the former Playgirl centerfold, who, after  all, is 52. (He said. Biographical listings give his birth date as Feb. 17,  1936.) The chest hairs peeking over the black tank top are flecked with gray,  and the top of his forehead is now farther from his eyebrows than it was in  either his football hero or acting days. Is he getting a tad overripe?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fruit and Meat  </P> <P> Brown is fond of grocery metaphors when it comes to women, whom he is very fond  of if they fit into a certain type. "I prefer girls who are young," he says in  "Out of Bounds," his hot-off-the-press memoir. "When I eat a peach, I don't  want it overripe. I want that peach when it's peaking."  </P> <P> Or to put it another way, "If I wake up in the morning, I hunger for crab, then  I don't want steak." Steak being a woman who is older, say over 25.  </P> <P> And, the book continues, he wants a woman who's small. "I don't mean mousy  small. I mean tight. Petite. Delicate. No excess. When I get into the bedroom,  I don't want to see anything that's big like me." Not that he looks only for  vacuous one-night stands -- at least not any more.  </P> <P> Brown said he understands why some people might find his attitude about women,  as portrayed in this book, offensive; that people, especially females, might  blanch at his constant references to "chasing girls" like a hunter after game,  picking up whole coveys of them and passing them out among his friends,  swapping them, sharing them and then moving on to the next day's quarry. Or the  endless parties/orgies, as he is happy to call them -- at which the primary  decorations are naked women and the only rule is No Locked Doors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just My Sexuality'  </P> <P> He admits in the book to following a double standard, to having a Main  Girlfriend that you take out in public, as opposed to the women who were called  freaks, the ones who arrived at Cleveland Browns parties, where "we'd all bring  two or three girls. . . . Those pretty girls from Cleveland were allowed to  express themselves freely and creatively."  </P> <P> He knows, but he laughs. True, the laugh is a little tight, perhaps  embarrassed, but basically, he said in an interview, he just is the way he is.  "It's just my sexuality. Everybody likes something."  </P> <P> Remember, sex sells.  </P> <P> And by that standard, Brown's book should be a best-seller. The first half is  mostly about his career in football, which he left in 1965 at his peak after  nine great seasons as a fullback. The second half is about sex, and various  movie stars he's known, and sex, and business, and politics, and sex. And about  some of the legal troubles he's had involving various accusations of assaults  on women, none of which he has been convicted of.  </P> <P> He writes about not having affairs with co-stars Raquel Welch, Stella Stevens  and Jacqueline Bisset; how he introduced Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to menage a trois;  how his good buddy Muhammad Ali was having as many as five women a night in his  early years while declaring himself celibate; and how he almost became part of  Ali's management team before the fighter bucked the draft as a conscientious  objector.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confusing, and Frank  </P> <P> Actually, "Out of Bounds" is not a book in the traditional sense, because it  was not written so much as talked. Brown and a collaborator, Steve Delsohn,  then edited the tapes down to book length. The result is a sort of extended  locker room monologue -- profane, outrageous, one-sided and occasionally  thought-provoking.  </P> <P> It is full of unexplained references and confusing allusions, but it also  contains some frank character assessments and self-appraisal. It is Jim Brown's  take on Jim Brown, his version of the way things were, his platform. He wrote  it because he was not happy with his first book, "Off My Chest," also written  with a collaborator.  </P> <P> "It reflects my life honestly," he said. "It might shock you but if you read  the whole book you might see I have a very individual point of view."  </P> <P> His point of view, as reflected in the book and an interview, seems to be that  of a combination radical black militant, sexual libertine and traditional  Republican capitalist.  </P> <P> On the one hand, he spoke recently at Huey Newton's funeral; has been friends  with Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan; and has always, even as a  young football player in the 1960s, been an out-front activist.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Against Dependence  </P> <P> On the other hand, he is against government programs that increase dependence  and thinks the only way blacks will alleviate the "symptoms" -- substance  abuse, black-on-black crime, poverty -- is to solve the problem of economic  impotence.  </P> <P> And guess what. He had an affair with Gloria Steinem! Or so he says in the  book.  </P> <P> Of course that was back in 1968, and the only reason he wrote about it was in  connection with the Eva Bohn-Chin affair. She was the woman, half-German,  half-Jamaican, whom he met in London while filming "The Dirty Dozen" and whom  police later said he threw off a balcony in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> What really happened, Brown says in the book, is that Bohn-Chin was jealous  over his fling with Steinem, whom he met while she was doing a magazine profile  of him while he was filming in Arizona. Bohn-Chin left his apartment -- with  Brown's car -- and went to stay with a girlfriend. He talked Bohn-Chin into  returning home; they planned a playful evening with three other women.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, while Bohn-Chin was on the phone with this girlfriend, Brown  started getting jealous. And they started fighting. And the neighbors called  the police. While Brown was trying to persuade the police, at one point with  his forearm, that it was just a minor domestic dispute, Eva Bohn-Chin "kind of  freaked" and tried to vamoose over a rear balcony, but fell and rolled under  it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Never Charged  </P> <P> The police, meanwhile, handcuffed Brown and took him to the station, and  despite the lack of any allegations from Bohn-Chin, threatened to charge him  with attempted murder. The police leaked the incident to the press but didn't  charge him with striking her. "And the toughest thing I did to Eva was slap  her."  </P> <P> And he knows that was wrong. "I have also slapped other women," he wrote. "And  I never should have, and I never should have slapped Eva, no matter how crazy  we were at the time. I don't think any man should slap a woman. In a perfect  world, I don't think any man should slap anyone. . . . I don't start fights,  but sometimes I don't walk away from them. It hasn't happened in a long time,  but it's happened, and I regret those times. I should have been more in control  of myself, stronger, more adult."  </P> <P> He knows how to defuse potentially explosive situations better now, he said,  and for this knowledge he credits Vital Issues, a self-improvement program for  which he is executive director. The program now operates in 18 California  prisons, he said, helping people in a "practical, holistic way." He gives an  example:  </P> <P> "Recently I ordered some food delivered to my house. I gave the guy a $100  bill. He comes back at me with this 'I don't have change' thing, you know, with  a real attitude. So I could see that this could easily develop into a bad  scene. Instead I said, 'OK, you have three options: You can go find change. You  can take a personal check. Or you can take the food back.'  </P> <P> "So he thinks about it. Then he said, 'Can I use your phone?' And he came back  and took a check. . . . The main thing is to avoid the negative at all costs.  That's the monkey. The next is to find the bottom line, the 'it.' The fact is  not personal. The third thing is to evaluate the options and pick the best. In  that situation, the negative could have led us in all kinds of directions. . .  . Now I keep my goals in mind."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Set of Goals  </P> <P> Those goals now include a low-budget film company, Ocean Productions, and the  knowledge that more negative press is not good for business. Ocean Productions  is about to release its first film -- intended primarily for overseas  distribution -- a $300,000 action adventure starring Brenda Vaccaro and Frank  Stallone (Sylvester's brother).  </P> <P> At the same time, Brown believes that he is a special target of the police, and  that the FBI and the CIA have followed his activities because of his  associations with black militants. While he admits to having done some bad  things, "none of the stuff they charged me with I did." He thinks his activism  was the primary reason his acting career derailed as well.  </P> <P> Brown was almost a film company president once before, and that was with  Richard Pryor, who was once his friend.  </P> <P> He writes movingly of how he urged Pryor, subtly, to stop using drugs (Brown  says he has never touched cocaine, heroin or LSD, although he has on occasion  used marijuana in the bedroom). When Pryor set himself on fire, it was Brown he  called for, and it was Brown who spent weeks by his side in the hospital, who  was given his power of attorney, who helped him to the bathroom and with his  physical therapy.  </P> <P> Brown also screened visitors (a great one, he writes, was Marlon Brando, who  arranged for a cable hookup so that the three could watch a closed-circuit  fight one night). He screened out most of Pryor's family because to him all  they seemed to be interested in was money, and they didn't like that.  Ultimately they sneaked into the hospital before Brown arrived and convinced  Pryor -- or so he said to Brown -- that Brown should butt out. He was abruptly  sent away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Hurt in Stride  </P> <P> Brown said he took that hurt in stride, trying to be considerate of the  pressures Pryor was under.  </P> <P> A few years later, he and Pryor agreed to start a film production company, part  of Brown's campaign to get successful black artists to plow some of their money  back into black communities. Plans were well under way, staff hired, when Brown  once again was abruptly dismissed.  </P> <P> For reasons he is unclear about, but probably have something to do with  editing, Brown decided not to include this last episode in the book. But it  undoubtedly fuels his scathing assessment of Pryor in the book as a man "who  can't love anyone."  </P> <P> "I knew a lot about Richard's tricks when I was dealing with him. I knew what  the drugs and the idolatry were doing to him, I saw how he treated people. And  yet he fooled me. He's the only person who has ever fooled me about emotions."  All that remains of their friendship is the bit in Pryor's rap about his use of  drugs when he pays a kind of comic's homage to Brown by making him a Jiminy  Cricket figure beckoning him away from "the pipe."  </P> <P> "That's how he thanked me," said Brown. "He never said it to my face."  </P></p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Energy Saving Trust seeks Pounds 2bn The Energy Saving Trust, the government-created body to promote energy efficiency, needs to raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet government targets, according to its business plan, published today. The 50-page plan, which will be sent to ministers this morning, will draw attention to the government's growing embarrassment over the trust's lack of finance. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has given it a central role in the UK's strategy for meeting international targets on global warming. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, repeated yesterday that she would not allow the costs of the trust's projects to be passed on to gas customers without new legislation. It would be 'tantamount to taxation', she has said. Her position, which conflicts with that of her predecessor Sir James McKinnon, has stalled the trust's plans for subsidising home improvements. Mr Eoin Lees, chief executive of the trust, said that 'virtually none' of the main projects could proceed without Ofgas changing its position. The parliamentary select committee on the environment has strongly criticised the stance since Ms Spottiswoode took charge in November. It has called her and Sir James to clarify the basis for the change on May 25. The business plan says an important casualty of the stalemate is Homes 2000, a proposed scheme to subsidise home improvements such as insulation for lofts and external walls, and energy-efficient lights and boilers. The project, which would pay up to half of the costs of these projects, would need Pounds 8m next year and Pounds 120m by 2000. The trust intends Homes 2000 to deliver half of its target of cutting annual emissions of carbon dioxide - a gas implicated in global warming - by 2.5m tonnes a year. The plan also points to a further source of political controversy. Households which do not benefit from the schemes could see annual fuel bills rise by nearly 2 per cent on top of inflation by 1998, it estimates. It emphasises, however, that most of the projects will pay for themselves through energy savings within five years, and that as the schemes become widespread, average household bills should fall.</p>

In accordance with a survey conducted  by the Brasilia-based Brazilian Institute of Political Studies  (IBEP), 83.2 percent of Brazilian congressmen described as "very  important" the role of foreign capital in bringing about the  resumption of economic growth. Furthermore, 89.9 percent of  deputies support free association between Brazilian and foreign  companies, and 92.9 percent of them consider the technology  brought in by foreign companies to be good for the country.    The IBEP survey polled all 503 deputies and 81 senators.  Regarding legal and tax aspects, the survey shows that most  congressmen want equal treatment for both national and foreign  companies. A total of 49.6 percent of all the congressmen  surveyed believe it to be inadvisable to establish a legal  discrimination between companies because of the origin of their  capital, while 41.6 percent believe such companies should be  treated differently. Only 27.2 percent approve of a different  tax regime for companies of foreign and Brazilian capital, while  67.2 percent of them disapprove of such discrimination.    This trend may be construed as a shift in the average  opinion  of congressmen. Deputy Augusto Carvalho of the PPS [People's  Socialist Party] -- the former Brazilian Communist Party -- in  Brasilia is an example of this change. He said: "I changed.  The left changed. Congress changed." He added: "We are not  against foreign capital, which will create companies and bring  technology to the country." In his opinion, Brazilian companies  cannot be considered to be sacred. He said: "We are not going  to act as protective shields to bad local businessmen in the  name of a so-called national industry."    The survey also shows that Congress is questioning the  monopoly prevailing in the area of telecommunications. To 48  percent of congressmen, the installation of telecommunications  infrastructural facilities (telephone lines and exchanges)  should be jointly undertaken by the state and by private  companies. Only 33.6 percent believe this endeavor should be  exclusively entrusted to Brazilian companies.</p>

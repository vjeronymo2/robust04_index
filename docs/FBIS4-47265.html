During production, the off  gases from the oxidation stage are cycloned and vented to the  atmosphere. These gases contain harmful organic substances in  both the vapor and dispersed phases. The vapor phase consists  mainly of durol and its oxidation products, while the dispersed  phase contains organic dust particles (2.1 microns, average  size) and consists of pyromellitic acid dianhydride (74-80  percent), 4,5- methylphthalic (12-14 percent), trimethyl,  formyltrimellitic, and 4-methylphthalic, acid anhydrides and  other substances. The dispersed phase is a pyrophoric substance  which causes combustion and explosions in places where the dust  accumulates. One of the least energy consuming methods for  purging the off gases of organic matter is thermocatalysis. In  the present work a three- stage scheme for treating the off  gases is examined. The gases are passed sequentially through a  blender-separator, a plate catalytic reactor, and a fluidized  bed reactor (iron-chromium oxide catalyst). Design  characteristics for the equipment and the results of industrial  testing are presented. The off gases were 50 to 100 percent  purged of pyromellitic acid dianhydride and other pollutants,  depending on the operating conditions. Figures 3; references 5  (Russian).</p>

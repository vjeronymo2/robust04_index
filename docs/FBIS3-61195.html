			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Kostina, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F> correspondent: "Access to the Persian Gulf Will Give Kazakhstan  a Way To Reach the World Market"]    [Text] The Iranian Embassy in Almaty held a press  conference on the eve of a visit by Iranian President Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani to the Republic of Kazakhstan. Iran's  ambassador told journalists about his view of the role of the  press as a means of rapprochement and mutual understanding,  saying its functions are "to reflect reality as it is, on the  basis of truth." Complaining that previous reports about Iran  very often have not corresponded to reality, the ambassador gave  the media representatives a brief history of his country and a  report on the state of its economy. Devoting particular  attention to oil as an export item, Rasul Eslami denied the  claim that all profits from oil exports are being used to  purchase weapons. He also analyzed and criticized the former  Iranian regime and discussed the Iran-Iraq war and the state's  path of development since the Islamic revolution. As for Iran's  policy in regard to Kazakhstan and the other former Soviet  republics, he said that that policy is to help those states  along the path of independent development.    The visit to Kazakhstan by Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani (who during his 10-day trip will also visit  Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan) is a  reciprocal visit after last year's trip to Iran by President  Nursultan Nazarbayev. The delegation includes minister of  foreign affairs Ali Akbar Velayati, minister of economics and  finance Morteza Mohammad-khan, minister of roads and transport  Akbar Torkan, and other ministers. Iran's delegation of  representatives will include approximately 100 individuals,  among them public officials, members of the government, bankers,  industrialists and businessmen. Mr. Rafsanjani will be  accompanied on the trip by his wife and daughter (incidentally,  Miss Rafsanjani is chairman of the Iranian Women's Association).    During the visit there are plans for visits to Almaty and  Karaganda, as well as discussion and signing of a number of  documents in the areas of economics, politics, cultural  cooperation and education. In the opinion of Rasul Eslami all  this will serve to reinforce and expand the agreements reached  during Nursultan Nazarbayev's trip to Iran. No specific economic  cooperation projects were mentioned. However, the ambassador did  invite everyone to a special exhibit by the Islamic Republic of  Iran that is currently in Almaty and which should provide a  complete picture of the capabilities of Iran's heavy and light  industry and of 80 different companies.    The ambassador promised to open Iran's borders to  Kazakhstan's products so they can reach the world market. The  same will be true of oil and gas when they reach the Persian  Gulf.    In short, the ambassador is convinced that by reaching the  Persian Gulf Kazakhstan will be able to gain access to the world  market. An enticing prospect. As is the two sides' stake in it.</p>

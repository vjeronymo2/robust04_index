			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Firmer commodity markets predicted COMMODITY PRICES could stage a slight recovery next year from recent depressed levels, but the upturn would be led by increasing demand and supply constraints rather than fears about inflation, said Mr Ravi Bulchandani, senior international economist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. 'There won't be a huge increase in prices, but at last there are more positive signs in the markets,' said Mr Bulchandani speaking at Goldman's commodity conference in London yesterday. Goldman's production cost benchmark, which reflects the break-even cash cost (operating cost, excluding amortisation of capital outlays) of producing commodities, shows now that, overall, sales prices are 8 per cent below the cost of production. This means that most commodity production is not profitable at current prices. The producers' loss is greatest in base metals such as aluminium and nickel, and agriculturals such as cotton and sugar. Prices for aluminium are 19.9 per cent and for nickel 23.7 per cent below the average costs of producing them. For cotton and sugar the gap is 29 per cent and 20.1 per cent respectively. Mr Bulchandani pointed out that prices as low as those experienced in recent years would usually have caused large capacity cuts. That had not happened in many commodities, particularly base metals where governments were often involved in running plant. But at the same time, low prices made it virtually impossible to get bank finance for increasing capacity. For example, Goldman's production cost benchmark puts the cost of producing aluminium at Dollars 1,400 a tonne while current prices are around the Dollars 1,100-a-tonne level and it would be difficult to get banks to invest at prices much below Dollars 1,600 a tonne. Increasing demand for many basic commodities especially from non-OECD countries could underpin prices in coming months. At the same time, the relative cheapness of the US dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities more attractive in terms of other currencies: this could, in turn, result in greater demand. The situation in Russia will also have a big effect on commodity prices over the next year. A return to economic stability over the long-term would be beneficial for prices as consumption would increase along with production of commodities such as oil. However, Mr Bulchandani pointed out that the current chaotic situation in Russia would depress prices as individual producers would be exporting all they could to earn hard currency. Mr Bulchandani stressed that he did not expect any explosive rally for many of these commodities, but the current trends might prevent prices from falling further in the short term and lead to some recovery in the longer term. Goldman's price forecasts for most commodities see prices remaining flat for the next three months and showing some pick-up in six months to a year.</p>

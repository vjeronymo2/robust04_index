			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES;  </P> <P> MARADONA ADMITS USING HAND TO KNOCK BALL AWAY FROM GOAL LINE  </P> <P> Argentine captain Diego Maradona admitted today he used his hand to knock the  ball away from the goal line in Argentina's 2-0 World Cup victory over the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Twelve hours after the Wednesday night game, he told Argentine journalists he  reacted on instinct during the first-half scramble.  </P> <P> "I saw the ball coming at me very fast, and I instinctively put my hand in  front of it," he said.  </P> <P> At a postgame news conference, the 29-year-old attacker said he was not sure  what happened on the play.  </P> <P> Soviet Coach Valery Lobanovsky called the play crucial and said referee Erik  Fredriksson of Sweden should lose his job for missing it.  </P> <P> Maradona said the play happened so fast that it was difficult for the referee  to see.  </P> <P> One of the world's most gifted players with his feet and his head, Maradona has  a history of using his hands.  </P> <P> In the 1986 World Cup, he scored with his left hand against England in a 2-1  quarterfinal victory. Afterward, Maradona said it was "the hand of God" that  caused the goal, and the phrase became synonymous with the incident.  </P></p>

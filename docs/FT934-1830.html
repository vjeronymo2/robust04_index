			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / US delegation defends Pakistan legislation Members of a US congressional delegation to Pakistan yesterday defended legislation blocking economic and military aid for three years, and said fears of an 'Islamic bomb' had added to Washington's concerns over nuclear proliferation, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. 'I think there's going to be a major effort in the armed services committee and the foreign relations committee to deal with this problem of non-proliferation,' said Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota, who sponsored an amendment leading to the suspension of aid to Pakistan because of fears Islamabad had acquired the capability to produce nuclear weapons.</p>

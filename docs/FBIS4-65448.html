			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Seidlitz commentary: "Beijing Does Not Let Itself Be </F> Dictated To"]    [Text] The United States has maneuvered itself into a dead  end in its policy toward China. Having come under the pressure  of the large corporations, President Clinton feels forced to  renew the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause before 3 June. The  White House is now desperately looking for a face-saving  formula, because last year Clinton made the renewal of the MFN  dependent on a generally improved situation of human rights in  China and Tibet.  <H5>  The Situation of the Dissidents Has Not Changed </H5>   Not only in the WASHINGTON POST can Clinton read that the  actual situation in China has not changed. The usual cynical  game is being played with the dissidents. Political dissidents,  people who think differently, and intellectuals who are too bold  are subjected to the arbitrary actions of the Chinese security  organs. Recently adopted new laws, which can be interpreted in  various ways, give the police a wide leeway for action. Some  leading dissidents have been arrested or deported.    With a view to the fifth anniversary of the bloody clearing  out of Tiananmen Square by the military, CPC General Secretary  Jiang Zemin said that the development has shown that the actions  taken on 4 June 1989 were right. This is to be understood as a  warning to the dissident scene. The government is trying to  tighten the screws again. Stricter control of the media and the  film industry has been put into motion. Newscasts such as the  BBC World News, which are very popular in China, have been  switched off. Journalists, particularly from Hong Kong, have  been sufficiently intimidated by deportations and trials.    The obvious impatience with which U.S. companies are pushing  into the Chinese market, which is now opening up, brings  problems of argumentation for the U.S. Administration in  Washington. In an analysis, which has been leaked, Winston  Lord, who was U.S. ambassador to Beijing until 1989 and is now a  high-ranking State Department official, confirmed the mistakes  of the policy of coupling the MFN clause to human rights, even  though it was Lord, deeply disappointed and personally affected  after 1989, who had advised Clinton to pursue this policy.    The Chinese are watching the confusing game of the Americans  with some amusement. It is not the government in Beijing but  the Administration in Washington that is under self-inflicted  pressure, in particular since for some time ordering a different  treatment of state companies and joint ventures in granting  trade preferences was even considered in the U.S. capital. Such  a policy cannot be implemented in administrative terms at all  and is pointless, because it has been proved that working  conditions in joint-venture factories of businessmen from  Guangzhou and Taiwan in southern China are often much worse than  those in state companies, where things are inefficient but at  least relatively socially acceptable.    For Clinton the policy toward China is only one aspect of a  policy without contours toward Asia. At the summit in Seattle  in November 1993 he had classified the importance of the  Asia-Pacific region as being greater than that of relations with  Europe. In the meantime he has ended up in a clinch with the  Japanese; a war of words is under way with Singapore; Indonesia  has forbidden U.S. interference in trade union issues; and  Malaysia is keeping its cool distance. The people in Washington  are now learning that dealing with the old partners in Europe is  easier than with Japanese, Chinese, and other Asians.  <H5>  Honesty in Washington Would Be Refreshing </H5>   Under pressure from Congressional and Senate circles,  Clinton  is now in the unpleasant situation of having to slap China's  fingers without annoying the U.S. business world. One out of  seven planes produced by Boeing are nowadays sold to China.  U.S. banks and securities companies are smelling big business,  and many products in U.S. shopping centers would become more  expensive if the customs preferences were abolished. In view of  this helpless situation, honesty would be refreshing.  Washington should admit that quite definite economic interests  are determining its policy toward China.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (5): Complex structure of controls - Environmental pressures in Europe Drax's flue gas desulphurisation plant, while much the most ambitious in Europe, is something of a late-comer in the context of moves to curb air pollution in the region. Over the past 20 years, a complex structure of emission controls has evolved at both supra-national and national levels. These have been successful in bringing about marked reductions in emissions in countries such as Germany, for example, where fears of acid rain were strongest. In other countries, such as the UK, progress has been slower because governments have been sensitive to the enormous costs of power station clean-up, particularly when it entails 'end of pipe' solutions. The quest for alternative means of reducing pollution has also intensified. Serious attempts to clean up the atmosphere at an international level began in the 1970s when fears of the threat posed by acid rain prompted negotiations in the UN's Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva. This led to the 1985 Sulphur Protocol which committed signatories to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide to 70 per cent of 1980 levels by 1993. In 1988, a similar protocol committed signatories to cut nitrous oxide emissions by 30 per cent by 1995-98. In 1988, the European Union adopted the Large Combustion Plants Directive which aimed to take the protocol a stage further. This called for reductions of sulphur dioxide from existing plants of 25, 43 and 70 per cent by 1993, 1995 and 2003 respectively from 1980 levels. But it gave special dispensation to countries with heavily reliance on large coal-fired power stations, with targets of 20, 40 and 60 per cent respectively. The directive also set a timetable for cuts in nitrous oxide. The other aim of the directive was to set tough emission limits for new plants - limits which are now in force. These measures, plus others taken at the national level, have already produced sharp reductions in emissions. Germany, with characteristic thoroughness, has gone furthest. Following a 1983 ordinance, it has attached clean-up equipment to all plants in the former West Germany. This has led to cuts of 90 per cent in sulphur emissions, and 75 per cent in nitrous oxide. But the cost of this has been huge. The total programme amounted to DM22bn, plus DM5bn of annual operating costs. This adds about 3 pfennigs to the cost of a kWh, according to estimates by VDEW, the electricity industry trade association. Work has now started on the clean up of some 10,000MW of coal-fired capacity in the former East Germany, with a completion target date of 1996, again at a cost of billions of DM. The experience of the first phase of clean-up is now having its effect as European countries address the next stage. Now that the first set of target dates for the sulphur protocol reductions has been reached, moves are afoot to tighten the rules still further. Last year, negotiations began on a second sulphur protocol which aims to bring about further reductions by the year 2000. The EU will also be updating the Large Combustion Plants Directive this year, but although there is some concern in the power generation industry that this might lead to even tighter targets, officials say that the new LCPD is likely to fit in with the new protocol. Unlike the first protocol, the second does not aim for blanket reductions in emissions. The hope is to get a more flexible system which takes account of the localities where environmental damage is being caused, and the ability of those localities to cope with the pollution - an approach known as critical load analysis which is supposed to give a clearer idea of where the priorities lie. Some countries, for example, are being asked to cut sulphur by 90 per cent, others by only 50 per cent, although environmentalists complain that even this is not sufficient because the effects of acid deposition are cumulative, and even small amounts make a difference. The new protocol is also likely to permit greater flexibility as to how the results are actually achieved so as to bring a degree of cost effectiveness into the equation. Although the principle of Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) is the traditional method, some signatories, such as the UK, want the protocol to leave room for alternative means. This has produced a debate about the merits of different pollution reduction methods. One of these is economic instruments, including tradeable pollution permits which have been launched in the US but have yet to make an appearance in Europe, although countries such as the UK have been studying them closely. Another method is to encourage use of cleaner energy sources. France, with its strong development of nuclear power, has achieved most by this means: its power stations emissions are among the lowest in Europe on a per capita basis. Britain also hopes to make a lot of headway towards its targets by switching from coal to gas - a process which is already well under way although at considerable political cost, given last year's uproar over closures of coalmines. But this is a route down which Germany is clearly not prepared to go: it has been unable to agree a shift from coal to nuclear power, and has no other viable fuels to fall back on. It will therefore have to take the costliest route of pursuing its retrofit programme. Even so, the EU Commission expects the consumption of gas by Europe's power stations to increase sixfold by the year 2020. However, there are also other means, such as introducing greater energy efficiency, or new clean technology for burning coal. The efficiency option has recently been undermined by the fall in oil prices, and by the failure of EU countries to agree some kind of energy tax, such as a carbon tax, which might push the cost of electricity up to levels which encourage greater savings. However the proposal has the support of a number of EU members and is likely to remain on the negotiating table. Individual countries are also jacking up fuel taxes, which is having the same effect.  --------------------------------------------------- EMISSIONS OF SO (000s of tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------                  1980     1990     % change  --------------------------------------------------- Canada            768      677          -12 USA             15860    14360         -9.5 Japan             347      192*         -45 Austria            90       16          -82 Denmark           218      119          -45 France           1222      313          -74 Germany**        1879      322          -83 UK               3007     2722         -9.5  --------------------------------------------------- *1989 **West only  --------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD.  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

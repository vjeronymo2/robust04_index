			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Brown Shipley to raise Pounds 43m in disposal BROWN SHIPLEY, the merchant banking group, is to sell two of its subsidiaries. The group, which posted pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.34m in the year to March 31, 1991, confirmed yesterday that overall losses for the year ending March 31, 1992 would be 'substantial'. It will earn some Pounds 33m from the sale of its profitable insurance broking arm to Holmwoods Group, a company formed by the arm's senior management. The sale of Brown Shipley's offshore company to Standard Bank Investment Corporation of South Africa (SBIC) will net a further Pounds 10.25m. Holmwoods, which has been advised by J O Hambro Magan, is to pay Pounds 30m in cash plus two deeply discounted loan notes with aggregate nominal value of Pounds 3m and final redemption dates in 1997 and 1998. CINVen, manager of Pounds 600m of pension funds for British Coal, British Rail and Barclays Bank Pension Funds, will provide 70 per cent of the equity backing for the venture. Senior debt behind the deal has been underwritten by the Bank of Scotland. Holmwoods specialises in providing insurances for private schools and colleges in the UK and the US, where it trades as AWG Dewar. Its other activities include marine, corporate and personal insurance broking. The insurance broking subsidiary was a profitable part of the Brown Shipley group. Unaudited profits in the year to March 31, 1992 amounted to Pounds 3.5m, including exceptional items of Pounds 340,000, when shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 5.1m. SBIC's payment for the offshore company is subject to an adjustment based on the net assets of the offshore group, which specialises in banking, stockbroking, investment management and fiduciary services, primarily from its base in Jersey. Discussions are also taking place with Woodchester Investments about the terms of the sale of Lease Management Services, Brown Shipley's leasing subsidiary. A memorandum of understanding has been exchanged. Brown Shipley said its 'accounts for the full year ending March 31, 1992 would include sharply increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts, resulting in a substantial overall loss. Against this background the directors will not be recommending a final dividend.' Observer, Page 19</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Timber accord faces green pressures NEGOTIATIONS ON a new tropical timber accord to replace the 1983 United Nations agreement begin next week in Geneva amid strong pressure from environmental groups for tougher rules on forest conservation. The 51 members of the International Tropical Timber Agreement - who account for virtually all the Dollars 7.5bn world tropical timber trade  - will also discuss a controversial demand from producing countries that non-tropical timber be included in the successor accord. This idea has already been rejected by consumer nations. Producers will in addition be pressing rich nations to share the burden of tropical forest conservation by increasing financial assistance and facilitating technology transfer. The four-day meeting, which ends on April 16, is not expected to resolve the main differences between the two sides. The UN Conference on Trade and Development has already scheduled a further negotiating session in Geneva for June 21-25. The 1983 tropical timber accord, which came into force in 1985, is due to expire at the end of March 1994. Its 23 producing members, the biggest being Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, represent about 89 per cent of the world's tropical forests and about the same proportion of world exports of tropical timber by volume. Japan and the European Community are by far the biggest importers among the 28 consumer members, which account for about 80 per cent of tropical timber imports. The 1983 agreement aims to ensure that the economic use of tropical timber is balanced with conservation efforts and environmental needs. But environmentalists complain that the International Tropical Timber Organisation, which administers the pact, has failed to stop large-scale forest destruction and degradation. For their part, producers say the ITTO has been of little help in promoting sustainable forest development. Initially, the main function of the Yokohama-based organisation was seen as promoting research and development projects related to forest management, exploitation and economic and market information. By the end of last year, the ITTO's council had approved 179 projects worth Dollars 150m. But in the past two to three years, the ITTO has paid more attention to environmental issues. Its 1990 action plan includes giving priority to arresting the decline and degradation of tropical forests, and in 1991 members committed themselves to ensuring that by the year 2000 all tropical timber exports will come from sustainably managed forests. The ITTO has also issued guidelines on sustainable forest management and the conservation of biological diversity in tropical forests.</p>

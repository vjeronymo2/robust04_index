			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Earth Summit comes down to money: The environment is secondary issue as western countries defend their wallets THE EARTH Summit starts in Rio de Janeiro today amid signs that the toughest negotiations will be about money, rather than the environment. As delegations from 178 countries and a press corps of 7,000 assembled, the organisers and developing countries issued passionate pleas for generosity by the rich to help the world clean up the environment. But the industrialised countries embark on the two-week conference with a tight hold on their wallets. Mr Maurice Strong, the conference secretary-general, said: 'Finance is the key issue - a tough issue. Not many nations, even the rich, are feeling rich and generous. But we need a reorientation of our priorities. 'We're talking not just about more foreign aid. The best environmental investment that can be made is in the third world. No one expects this commitment to come all at once. But we want the important first steps.' Money lies at the heart of all the most important documents on the Rio negotiating table: two treaties to clean up the atmosphere and protect living species, and a 450-page action programme. Mr Joe Wheeler, the UN official overseeing the financial negotiations, said: 'They will be very difficult. They will go on late into the night. A lot is at stake.' But the industrial countries are making clear that there will be few if any pledges of money in Rio, though they recognise that many of the demands for money are genuine and that rich countries have a responsibility to finance sustainable growth in the developing world. Late on Monday, Germany convened a meeting of officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations to try to co-ordinate their positions. Yesterday the G7 extended these contacts to other Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development countries in advance of formal negotiations. Dr Ansgar Vogel, director general of the German Environment Ministry, said it was 'a question of morality' that industrial countries should help third world countries. 'Industrial countries have to give a clear signal that they consider themselves in a position of responsibility.' Other G7 countries took a more cautious line. Many of them fear that whatever sums they mention will be criticised as inadequate, and will anyway fall far short of the Dollars 125bn (Pounds 69bn) a year which the summit organisers say is needed.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Herring Baker holds decline to 10% First half pre-tax profit at Herring Baker Harris Group, the chartered surveyor, declined 10 per cent to Pounds 1.63m. Margins declined from 26 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Nick Owen, chairman, said they were unlikely to be restored to the levels of more than 25 per cent enjoyed in the last three years until there was some measurable upturn in both the agency and investment markets. 'That may well still be 12 months away.' The half way profit - to July 31 - included a full contribution from Baker Harris Saunders and compares with Pounds 1.81m last time. Turnover expanded to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 6.57m). Earnings per share were 6.24p (9.74p) and the interim dividend is held at 3.25p on the increased capital.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Investor revolt in sleepy Canada  -Companies are now listening to shareholders ANNUAL meetings of Canadian companies, even the biggest and most troubled ones, are invariably sleepy affairs. Shareholders ask few, if any, questions. With the exception of a handful of church groups, murmurings of dissent tend to come from grumpy individuals rather than assertive institutional investors. The most satisfying part of a meeting is often the lunch that follows. Such low-key politeness suits the style of Canada's notoriously clubby business establishment. 'It's a different system here (from the US),' says Mr Robert Sillcox, head of investments at the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (Omers), the country's second-biggest pension fund. 'We tend to do things more quietly and behind closed doors.' There is, however, unmistakable evidence that Canadian companies are listening more closely these days to the corporate governance concerns of minority shareholders. In the past month or two alone, activist shareholders have made some significant headway. A torrent of criticism surrounding Royal Bank's pending purchase of the operations of troubled Royal Trust has led to the trust's independent directors launching their own review of the deal. BCE, the country's biggest conglomerate, and Canadian Pacific, the transport and resources group, both agreed prior to their recent annual meetings to a change in rules to allow secret voting. Earlier, Donohue, a Quebec forest products company, bowed to pressure from outside shareholders by watering down a share-swap plan which entrenches the control of its largest shareholder through multiple-vote shares. Donohue also agreed to appoint independent directors to its board. Mutual Life took the unusual step for a Canadian insurance company of disclosing solvency ratios in the latest annual report. Trizec, North America's biggest listed property developer, has promised to boost the number of independent directors on its board, while TransCanada PipeLines will soon separate the duties of chairman and chief executive. Pressure for improved corporate governance is coming from several directions. The financial problems of some of Canada's best-known companies have made many investors restive. A portfolio manager at one large investment management firm singles out the empire controlled by Messrs Peter and Edward Bronfman, which has frequently been criticised for poor disclosure and for discrimination against minority shareholders. In particular, the unexpectedly steep slide in fortunes of Royal Trust, a Bronfman-controlled company, has raised questions about directors' responsibilities and the adequacy of public disclosure. Despite the low-key way business is done in Canada, the activism of US institutional investors has not gone unnoticed north of the border. Mr William Mackenzie, partner at Allenvest Group, a Toronto securities firm specialising in representing disgruntled minority shareholders, says more and more clients are taking part in proxy votes aimed at improving corporate governance. Omers, which has significant stakes in about 50 of the companies which make up Toronto's TSE300 index, this year became the first Canadian institution to publish a detailed list of proxy voting guidelines. The 36-page document spells out Omers' policy on such topical corporate governnance issues as executive stock option plans, leveraged buy-outs, unequal voting shares and environmental practices. Another trend encouraging greater accountability is the loosening grip of family owners and foreign multinationals, long a hallmark of corporate Canada. Several foreign companies, including British Petroleum, Lasmo and RTZ, have sold their former Canadian subsidiaries to a wide spread of institutional and retail investors. The financial troubles of the Bronfman and Reichmann empires have also brought wide ownership to what were formerly tightly-controlled companies, such as MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry group, and John Labatt, the brewer. Allenvest lists 18 companies to lose a controlling shareholder recently. The firm is urging the new owners of these companies to become more active in appointing directors, opposing 'poison pills' designed to entrench existing management, and scrutinising executive compensation. Without such scrutiny, widely-owned companies run a risk which has become apparent in the financial-services sector. No single investor is allowed to own more than 10 per cent of a domestic bank. The result, in the words of Mr David Atkins, a partner of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Toronto, is that management is king. With shareholders wielding little real power, prime responsibility for the governance of financial institutions has passed to government regulators, who have laid down some of the strictest rules anywhere. For instance, audit committees comprised of external directors are now compulsory. All federally-regulated insurance companies must attach actuarial certificates of loss reserves and actuarial liabilities to their financial statements. Mr Atkins predicts increased pressure from regulators for wider disclosure, and for greater accountability by directors and auditors. Managers of financial institutions are 'in a defensive, rather than an assertive mode', he says. 'A lot of Canadian management feels that they've had these things imposed on them.' But improvements in Canadian corporate governance are likely to evolve much more slowly than in the US. Furthermore, many institutional investors still sense they have more to lose than to gain by flexing their muscles over corporate governnance. Mr Bob Bertram, senior vice-president for investment at the Ontario Teachers pension fund, mentions the potential consequences of a decision not to invest in companies with non-voting shares. 'When you take a stand on principle, you're going to eliminate an awful lot of investment opportunities,' he says</p>

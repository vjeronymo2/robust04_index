			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up SOUTH AFRICA South Africa is to be included in the IFC's global index of emerging markets in the next few months, with a weighting of 13 per cent. Justine Roberts of SG Warburg said that a 13 per cent weighting implied considerable inflows of foreign money. With estimates of holdings by foreign investors in emerging markets globally put between Dollars 50bn to Dollars 160bn, the potential inflows to South Africa could be anything from Dollars 6.5bn to Dollars 21bn, he added. Even including last year's Dollars 650m of purchases, the implication is that most emerging markets funds are seriously underweight (in South Africa) and many have no exposure at all'. The IFC said that the Czech Republic will be added to the list by the end of the year. FUND LAUNCH A new open-ended fund for investment in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is being launched by Regent Pacific, the Hong Kong-based financial services group. One of the features of the fund, said Mr Charles Lunsford, will be the ability to switch assets quickly from country to country. The initial launch values the fund at some Dollars 30m. Mr Lunsford, in London last week, said that the countries included all had increasing political stability, had begun to make the shift from state to private enterprise and companies there had some of the cheapest p/e's with the Asian region, together with forecasts of good earnings growth. SEOUL Foreign investment in South Korea during the first five months of the year rose by 60 per cent to Dollars 648m, the country's finance ministry said. New foreign investment amounted to Dollars 436m, up from Dollars 125m, while fresh injection of investment into existing projects was Dollars 212m, down from Dollars 282m. A ministry official said relaxing investment restrictions and a recovering economy were big reasons for the increase. Emerging markets coverage appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

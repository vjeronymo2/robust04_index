			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Furniture trade bodies to merge THREE furniture trade organisations are to merge on January 1 into British Furniture Manufacturers. The new body will be an amalgam of three autonomous companies: BFM Exhibitions, an exhibition organiser; BFM Exports, which provides advice and assistance to exporters; and BFM Federation, a loose grouping of four regional trade associations. Mr Adrian Hill, chief executive of the new organisation, said its priorities would be to take a lead on furniture safety and the use of rare tropical timbers.</p>

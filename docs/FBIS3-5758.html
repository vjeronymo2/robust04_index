Yi noted, in a meeting with journalists, that holding the  third round of high-level talks and suspending "Team Spirit,"  the annual South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, had been  decided on condition that South and North Korea exchange special  envoys.    Last month, Pyongyang told Washington it would allow  unrestricted IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to  seven declared facilities and accept Seoul's proposal to hold  working-level talks on exchanging presidential envoys.    In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit  and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month.    "Given the North Korean attitude we saw at the working-level  contacts until yesterday, I doubt if North Korea really intends  to exchange special envoys with the South. Inter-Korean  contacts, if they are only for show (to others), are  meaningless," Yi said.    Yi avoided making any decisive remarks on whether Team  Spirit  would be held.    "I cannot affirm that because it is a subtle military  problem. I think we'll have to watch the progress of the  inter-Korean working- level contacts, expecting that Pyongyang's  attitude will change at the sixth contact slated for Saturday  [12 March]."    He said now is not the time to comment on whether  international sanctions may be imposed on North Korea if the  special envoy exchange is not realized.    On reports that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspectors had found a damaged seal at the North Korean nuclear  facilities, Yi said he was briefed on the results of the IAEA  inspection.    "But that is a problem for the IAEA to cope with, anyway,"  he  said.</p>

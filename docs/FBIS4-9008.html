			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- Arriving on an official  visit here last night, today Germany's Vice Chancellor and  Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel had talks with  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They considered  bilateral relations and a range of international problems. Mr.  Kinkel familiarized Mr. Daskalov with the European Union's  efforts to put an end to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  They also discussed the situation in Russia and  Bulgarian-Russian relations.    "I had the opportunity to emphasize the importance we attach  to Bulgaria and our willingness to help it solve its problems,  ensuing mainly from the disintegration of the ex-Soviet market  and the Yugo-embargo, "Mr. Kinkel told the media later. The  sides discussed Bulgaria's foreign debt, a problem which Mr.  Kinkel believes has been recently settled. Mr. Kinkel and Mr.  Daskalov made a review of Bulgaria's relations with a number of  international organizations, such as the European Union, the  Western European Union, the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade organization, NATO, and the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development, and its desire to get integrated  with them. "Bulgaria can rely on Germany's support in this  respect," Minister Kinkel stressed. "Klaus Kinkel's message is  that Germany has supported Bulgaria and always will but,  naturally, to become more attractive we should accelerate the  reform," the Bulgarian foreign minister said after the meeting.    "Our bilateral relations are not purely bilateral because  they are maintained through the European Union in part," Foreign  Minister Stanislav Daskalov said.    At the talks with his German counterpart, Minister Daskalov  raised the visa problem. Bulgaria expects that Germany will  relax its visa regulations. However, the Bulgarian foreign  minister told the media that this was a delicate issue and  resolving it would take time.    The Bulgarian side raised the question of considering the  possibilities for more active German investments in Bulgaria.  It requested assistance for the promotion of relations with the  organization which would succeed Cocom [Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls] and for the allocation of more  funds to Bulgaria within the framework of the Operation PHARE  [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]  Programme. Asked what the German side insisted on, Minister  Daskalov said that it requested "to continue reforms in Bulgaria  despite the difficulties and pursue a foreign policy that will  create no problems."    "Bulgaria's debt to the former German Democratic Republic  has  not been discussed," Minister Daskalov said in reply to a  reporter's question. "Experts will continue, on a bilateral  basis, the talks opened in 1991 and I hope that we will be able  to find some compromising solution to the problem," Mr. Daskalov  said. Bulgaria is indebted to the former GDR, but the German  side has unilaterally cancelled a number of transactions  concluded with this country. Describing the dispute as quite  serious, he said that both Bulgaria and Germany should show  flexibility.</p>

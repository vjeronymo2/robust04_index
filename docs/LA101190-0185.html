			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> 3 FIREFIGHTERS TO BE HIRED  </P> <P> Despite the recommendation of the recent municipal audit, the City Council last  week sided with Fire Chief Bart Carroll and unanimously approved the hiring of  three firefighters.  </P> <P> The three positions had been in the 1990-91 budget, but the audit by Hughes,  Heiss &amp; Associates urged that a battalion chief or captain be hired instead  to bolster administration and training.  </P> <P> Carroll argued that the firefighters were a higher priority because the  department has been short-handed in its response to structure fires.  </P> <P> Other audit recommendations that have been implemented:  </P> <P> * Police have increased hours of coverage by parking control officers and have  started talks with San Marino on a joint dispatch center and with Pasadena on a  possible jail-use contract.  </P> <P> * The Planning Department will hire an additional associate planner and  increase zoning enforcement by the building inspector.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are revising the title of &sect;405.535 to add the words  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``and suppliers.'' It will read, ``Special rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonparticipating physicians and suppliers furnishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammography services.'' We are also making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical changes in this section to cross-refer the reader  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the fee schedule for physicians' services. Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are setting forth in &sect;405.535 requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting charge if the screening mammography services are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished by a nonparticipating physician or supplier who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not accept assignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conditions for Coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 354 of the PHS Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding coverage conditions for diagnostic and screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography, we are amending 42 CFR by revising &sect;410.34(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to specify definitions of the terms (1) ``diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography,'' (2) ``screening mammography,'' (3) ``supplier of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic mammography,'' (4) ``supplier of screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography,'' (5) ``certificate,'' (6) ``provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate,'' and (7) ``meets the certification requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 354 of the Public Health Services (PHS) Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;410.34, we are redesignating paragraph (b) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d). We are adding a heading to paragraph (d),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Limitations on coverage of screening mammography services.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In newly redesignated paragraph (d)(1) of &sect;410.34, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying that the current requirement that a mammogram  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``must,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> at a minimum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [emphasis added], be a four-view  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial lateral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oblique view of each breast)'' is the minimum requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that must be met, except in the case of a woman who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having a postmastectomy screening, when we will allow a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-view exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lateral oblique view) of the remaining breast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are adding a new paragraph (b) to &sect;410.34 to set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth conditions for coverage of diagnostic mammography,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which essentially cross-reference the same FDA certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that suppliers of screening mammography must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet on October 1, 1994. Medicare Part B pays for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic mammography services if the diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography services are ordered by a doctor of medicine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> osteopathy and if they are furnished by a supplier of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic mammography services that meets the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of section 354 of the PHS Act, as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21 CFR part 900 (``Mammography''), subpart B (``Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards and Certification'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also adding a new paragraph (c) to &sect;410.34 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth the conditions for payment of screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography. Medicare Part B pays for screening mammography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services only if they are furnished by a supplier of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammography services that meets the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of section 354 of the PHS Act, as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21 CFR part 900, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are revising &sect;411.15 (``Particular services excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from coverage'') to replace the cross reference to subpart B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of part 494 (which is being removed and reserved) with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the certification requirements in section 354  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the PHS Act, as set forth in 21 CFR part 900, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current &sect;413.123(b) states that payment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals for screening mammography services performed on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outpatient basis is determined in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;405.534(c). We are changing this to refer to &sect;405.534(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to correct an error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Information Collection Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the enactment of the MQSA and its implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by FDA, we are requesting cancellation of the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection requirements approved under OMB control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number 0938&hyph;0608 for Medicare coverage of screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammograms, effective October 1, 1994. The latter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information collection document was previously required as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the enactment of section 4163 of OBRA '90.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementing section 4163 of OBRA '90, we published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final regulations on December 31, 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (55 FR 53510), including certain minimum safety and accuracy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards set forth in 42 CFR subpart B, which suppliers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammography services had to meet in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate under Medicare, effective January 1, 1991. With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enactment of the MQSA, however, all mammography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities in the United States, except for VA facilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be required, effective October 1, 1994, to have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate issued by FDA regardless of their source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment. Therefore, under its delegation of authority from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services, FDA will replace HCFA on October 1, 1994, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agency responsible for surveying and certifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers of screening mammography services in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the new MQSA standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Delay in the Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we generally provide for final rules not to be effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until 30 days after the date of publication unless we find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good cause to waive the delay. As a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the MQSA by FDA, we are conforming the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions for Medicare coverage of screening mammography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services to the applicable FDA certification requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 21, 1993 (58  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565), that all Medicare suppliers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services must meet effective October 1, 1994. We view the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes made by this rule as merely interpretative. The APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not require that there be a delayed effective date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an interpretative rule. Accordingly, this rule will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective October 1, 1994, the effective date of the FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on mammography services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

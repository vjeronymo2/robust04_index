She will take the nation into her  confidence on national issues and inform it of the steps the  government is taking on behalf of Kashmir. The prime minister's  speech will be broadcast on TV and radio at 1430 GMT. Talking  to newsmen in Islamabad last evening, the prime minister stated  categorically that the government will fully support the strike  called by the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee on 5  February to protest the atrocities against the Kashmiris in the  occupied territory. She said that the strike call will be  considered an appeal by all the parties because the appeal has  been made by the Kashmir Committee, which is comprised of both  ruling and opposition members of parliament. She said that her  government has decided to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN  human rights organization so as to secure world support for the  early implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan has never refused to  hold talks with India for a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir  issue. However, she added, that talks cannot be held in a  situation in which Kashmiris are being oppressed and supressed  by Indian forces. She asked how the talks can be held in a  situation in which arrested Kashmiri leaders have not been  released and the siege of the Hazratbal shrine is still  continuing.    The prime minister said that 600,000 Indian forces are  deployed in occupied Kashmir, which means one soldier is  deployed for every four Kashmiris. Such a situation cannot be  helpful for a purposeful dialogue. She said that the Indian  Government should take steps to reduce atrocities in occupied  Kashmir.    Noting the seriousness of the Kashmir problem, Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said that the issue is linked to future global peace.  Political stability in the region also depends on the cessation  of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. She urged the  United Nations and other world bodies to consider the Kashmir  issue as a human rights issue. The prime minister said that it  would be unjust if the UN resolutions were not implemented. The  prime minister said that Pakistan has always supported the UN  resolutions, including those on Kuwait, Somalia, and Bosnia.  Pakistan hopes that other countries will support it on the  Kashmir issue.    Sheikh Rafiq Ahmad, Pakistan People's Party [PPP] secretary  general, has said that his party has decided to launch a massive  campaign to apprise the people of the importance of the rights  of Kashmiris and the government's policies. In a statement in  Lahore yesterday, he said that the PPP will hold seminars and  rallies to focus light on the present situation in occupied  Kashmir and to draw international attention to the Kashmiri  brethren. He said that the government has a clear and concrete  policy on Kashmir.</p>

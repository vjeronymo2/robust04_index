			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA;  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FOR YOUTH OF CHINA, IT'S A LITTLE LIKE WOODSTOCK  </P> <P> For the youth of China, the past month's events in Tian An Men Square are  certain to assume a mythic status exceeding even that of the famed Woodstock  music festival for Americans who came of age in the 1960s.  </P> <P> Music has been secondary to politics in what will be known as the great 1989  democracy rallies of Tian An Men Square. But two songs have played important  roles in protests that appear on the verge of toppling Premier Li Peng from  office: China's national anthem and the revolutionary socialist hymn, "The  Internationale." Both songs call for oppressed people to rise up in revolt, and  the students sing them with gusto.  </P> <P> Softer tunes have been heard as well. One day, to entertain the crowd a  guitarist stood and played atop a bus parked at the square. At night, people  huddled in small groups and sang.  </P> <P> There has also been time for some romance during those long days and nights at  the square.  </P> <P> A few days ago, a couple decided that they wanted to get married, and they and  their friends put together an impromptu wedding ceremony.  </P> <P> In place of ribbons, red strips of cloth were knotted and pinned to the blouse  of the bride and shirt of the groom, who stood in the midst of their friends  for the brief event.  </P> <P> Someone wrote up a wedding certificate -- lacking legal force but surely issued  with love -- and it was presented to the happy couple as the students around  them cheered.  </P> <P> Motorbikes are relatively rare on China's streets, but they do exist. During  weeks filled with high political drama and extraordinary street scenes, one of  the most gripping sights has been the Flying Tiger Team, consisting of about  500 young owners of motorbikes and light motorcycles and, in many cases, their  girlfriends.  </P> <P> Two helmeted riders per bike, with those in the lead carrying streaming  banners, the Flying Tiger Team has raced through the streets of Beijing in  search of excitement.  </P> <P> "Block the army trucks!" screamed the riders as they roared toward the city's  outskirts one recent night to help blockade the advancing People's Liberation  Army.  </P> <P> The Flying Tigers are themselves a symbol of the new, uneven prosperity that  senior leader Deng Xiaoping -- himself a major target of the protests -- has  brought to China with market-oriented reforms over the past decade.  </P> <P> Motorbikes, in addition to being in short supply, are too expensive for most  Chinese. It is primarily the class of prosperous private entrepreneurs who can  afford them.  </P> <P> "It's a little strange that they've been some of our strongest supporters,"  said one student as he watched the Flying Tigers roar off into the darkness.  "Students often complain about unfair distribution of money. The Flying Tiger  Team, in some sense, represents all that."  </P> <P> But he added that the students have welcomed the bikers' support.  </P> <P> "We can all benefit from democracy," he said.  </P> <P> One of the fascinating, and in a sense tragic, aspects of the current  demonstrations is how so many people have turned against a leader, the  84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, who has done so much for them.  </P> <P> Deng has freed China from the irrationality and severe political controls of  the Maoist era and set it on the path of economic reform and growing  prosperity. But today's protesting youth, and many of their elders, now view  him as an aging emperor, unable to understand China's current needs and  clinging to power past his time.  </P> <P> "Xiaoping, the People of Sichuan Welcome You Home," declared a hand-scrawled  cardboard poster held by a man standing along the parade route during a recent  demonstration.  </P> <P> With some pride, the protester displayed the opposite side of the sign.  </P> <P> "Long Live the Respected Xiaoping. Long Live! Long Live!" it declared.  </P> <P> Asked by several passers-by whether the two sides of his sign did not conflict,  the man explained: "We want him to go back to Sichuan and pass good days, have  an idle, very peaceful and quiet life, and live for a long time."  </P> <P> A poster carried in another march captured the feelings of the vast majority of  protesters:  </P> <P> "Deng Xiaoping -- Thank You. Goodby."  </P></p>

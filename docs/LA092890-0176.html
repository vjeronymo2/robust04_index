			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: NO LONGER MERELY AN AFTERTHOUGHT, ACCESSORIES ARE FASHION FOCAL POINT;  </P> <P> JEWELRY, BELTS, HATS AND SCARVES CAN PUT AN INDIVIDUAL STAMP ON A LOOK AND CAN  MAXIMIZE THE VERSATILITY OF AN OUTFIT.  </P> <P> When June Cleaver wore pearls, she chose a small, tasteful strand that would  not interfere with her housework.  </P> <P> Those were different times, before "accessorize" had become a common household  verb.  </P> <P> Today women have turned to bigger, bolder baubles to adorn their outfits. If  they're going to wear pearls, they're likely to wear ones the size of golf  balls.  </P> <P> No longer fashion's afterthought, accessories have become the focal point of  one's attire.  </P> <P> "They're very important," says Mary Jane Borden, owner of A La Mode Fashions in  Irvine. "They can make an outfit look 100 times better."  </P> <P> With a beaded belt, felt hat or pin, one can change a garment's entire look.  </P> <P> "You can take a basic black dress you wore to a funeral that morning, change  from pearls into rhinestones, and wear it to a formal wedding that night,"  Borden says.  </P> <P> She's only half-kidding.  </P> <P> Baubles and bangles have become so prominent, they've taken over entire stores.  Brea Mall has three boutiques devoted primarily to accessories -- Xtras,  Etcetera and the Icing, the first in a chain of upscale accessory stores in  Southern California.  </P> <P> "Women are definitely spending more money on accessories and buying more  extravagant things," says Carol Suda, regional manager for the Icing.  </P> <P> This fall they're buying long "shoulder duster" earrings with dangling coins  and beads, necklaces with huge "pearls" made of spun cotton and wide-cuff  bracelets made of gleaming silver or gold.  </P> <P> "Giant jewels are real popular," Suda says. "They're even wearing crystals for  daytime now, when they never would have before." Earrings made from clusters of  crystals have proven especially popular.  </P> <P> Women are attracted to all that glitters. Most have abandoned scarves with  small paisley prints for large chiffon squares shot through with metallic  thread.  </P> <P> A purple suede belt becomes the centerpiece of any outfit when lined with gold  studs and bearing a clasp encrusted with beads and rhinestones, available for  $89. Even an ordinary baseball cap looks glamorous when made of  rhinestone-studded black velvet and doused with beads on its front flap. The  velvet cap also costs a bit more than a standard Angels' cap -- $50 at the  Icing.  </P> <P> Women don't care that their glitz is artificial -- most of the big shield-style  earrings are obvious fakes, handcrafted out of paper, resin, plastic or clay.  One pair features shredded ribbons formed into miniature pompons for $28.  </P> <P> "Big earrings show the gypsy in all women," Suda says.  </P> <P> Accessories have grown in size and stature because they allow women to express  themselves, no easy feat in an age of mass-produced, cookie-cutter clothes.  </P> <P> "Women need to make a statement about themselves," Suda says. "Clothing has  gotten a little boring, so women are using accessories to show their  personality."  </P> <P> That explains the current rage for ring watches, the hottest novelty item at  the Icing. Suda stocks rings with small watch faces embedded in huge crystals.  </P> <P> "Customers are looking for something different," she says. "It's a conversation  piece."  </P> <P> While Borden's shop carries fashions for big women, she stocks so much fun  jewelry that her "skinny girls" are her best accessory customers.  </P> <P> Her hottest-selling accessory of the moment: bubble bottles.  </P> <P> Bubble bottles look like perfume bottles worn on a cord around the neck, but  the wearer can untwist the cap and pull out an "itty-bitty bubble wand and blow  itty-bitty bubbles," Borden says. They're selling at accessory counters  everywhere, from Target to Nordstrom.  </P> <P> Borden's customers have also been snapping up big plastic whistles, painted  gold and covered with fake jewels.  </P> <P> "If your husband's across the room at a party, you can whistle for him," Borden  says.  </P> <P> At Etcetera, one can find everything from a timeless Chanel-style chain with  faux pearls and gems to a '60s-style "thong necklace" -- a leather or silk cord  with a large medallion, cross, crystal or tassel for decoration.  </P> <P> At a recent fashion show, Etcetera took five basic black dresses from Ann  Taylor and gave each a different look -- from ethnic with long strands of  colored beads to evening with a gold metallic hair bow and gold jewelry.  </P> <P> "Clothing is getting so expensive and women want value for their dollar," says  Robin Roberts, co-manager of Etcetera in Brea Mall.  </P> <P> "We can take a basic black dinner dress and make it look new with earrings and  a necklace. For a little money, you can have more versatility."  </P> <P> Some women have trouble coordinating jewelry with an outfit.  </P> <P> "Many tend to buy accessories without having the outfit with them," Borden  says. "That's a mistake. There could be 100 different shades of blue. It's  better to do the outfit when you buy it."  </P> <P> She suggests shopping for accessories with the outfit in tow and soliciting  second opinions from employees.  </P> <P> "Women bring me clothes and ask me to accessorize them," Borden says.  </P> <P> Customers should consider the shape of their face, length of their hair and  their build when buying accessories, Suda says. Someone with a round face  probably should stay away from round earrings, she says, and big earrings don't  belong on a small person.  </P> <P> "But there are no rules," Suda says. "Try things that you've never worn before.  It makes it more fun."  </P></p>

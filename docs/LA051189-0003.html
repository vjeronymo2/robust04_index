			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> No blackouts have occurred in Temple City in recent days, indicating perhaps  that the Attack of the Electrical Wire-Munching Ants may have come to an end.  </P> <P> But Temple City, known more for such sedate events as an annual Camellia  Festival, is still reeling from the publicity over the hungry critters that  knocked out some intersection traffic signals.  </P> <P> "I can't believe this made nationwide news," said Public Works Director Chris  Peterson. "A lot of other cities around here have had worse problems with them  (the ants). "  </P> <P> Peterson said he's even heard from callers from as far away as Utah and Alabama  who have ant cures. (Public Works has its own ant poison recipe.)  </P> <P> Nor did the San Gabriel Valley consider it a public relations coup when  syndicated broadcaster Paul Harvey commented that millions of Temple City ants  were enjoying "a power lunch."  </P> <P> Jack Paar, the former Tonight Show host, related in his autobiography that he  was approached by the late Duchess of Windsor at a cocktail party in the 1950s.  </P> <P> "Can you tell me," she asked Paar, "is the Roller Derby fixed?"  </P> <P> Paar didn't reveal his answer, but the Duchess' interest illustrated the  popularity of the team-roller skating spectacle, which was one of the first  network television hits for ABC.  </P> <P> A spin-off of indoor bicycle racing dating back to 1935, the sport -- as it is  called by some -- enjoyed its heyday in Los Angeles in the 1960s with announcer  Dick ("Whoaaa Nellie!") Lane exclaiming over the high jinks of such  unforgettable performers as Psycho Ronnie Rains, Shirley Hardman and Little  Ralphie Vallidares.  </P> <P> But more recently, while wrestling was enjoying a big revival, Roller Derby  took an elbow to the neck, ratings-wise.  </P> <P> Now, Roller Games -- as it's known for legal reasons -- is attempting a  comeback. The sport's promoters held a tryout for a projected television show  that drew 250 candidates to the Moonlight Roller Skating Rink in Glendale on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The winners will be distributed among six new teams named, the Thunderbirds,  the Violators, Hot Flash, the Rockers, the Maniacs, and the club that figures  to lead the league in villains -- the Attitudes.  </P> <P> Kraco, a Sherman Oaks-based automotive electronics firm, announced this week  that it's conducting its second annual search for the driver who logs the most  miles round-trip daily between home and work. The weary soul will win a variety  of prizes.  </P> <P> Last year, believe it or not, a non-Southern Californian ranked No. 1 -- Rod  Conklin, who slogged 408 miles between his digs in Darien, Conn., and his job  in Boston. Conklin, perhaps to save his sanity, has switched to a shorter  commute.  </P> <P> Kraco could have been a bit more sensitive in timing its announcement. After  all, this is Bike to Work Week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: GRAPHIC ART AND A JAZZY TRUMPET  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Art Museum opens Friday with an exhibit titled "Chasing the  Line" by Claire Falkenstein. For Falkenstein, a major California artist best  known for her metal works, this exhibit is like no other she has done before.  </P> <P> "This will be the first time I have had an exhibition with graphics playing the  dominant part of the display," she said.  </P> <P> Falkenstein, 81, is best known for her metal sculptural webs, suggestive of  molecular structure and biological growth patterns. But it is her drawings, she  said, that are responsible for her success.  </P> <P> "I'm only existing as an artist because of trial and errors that come about  through drawings.  </P> <P> "Everything is connected. It's a natural progression working from paper and  moving through to sculpture," she said.  </P> <P> Those interested in meeting Falkenstein can do so during an opening 7 p.m.  reception Friday. Falkenstein will present a slide show and lecture on her  work. A documentary by Jay Carmichael, featuring the artist, will follow.  </P> <P> "Chasing the Line" will continue through Dec. 24. The museum is at 191 Wilbur  Road, Thousand Oaks. Call 499-4355.  </P></p>

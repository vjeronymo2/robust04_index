			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (14): Paper aeroplanes are looking dated  -Computers and teamwork cut development costs It is no surprise that spending by aerospace companies on computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering software is such an important part of their capital investment, as it addresses key issues for the industry's future - 'time to market' and global competitiveness. The trend towards 'paperless aircraft' and more efficient links with component suppliers is being driven by a need to reduce product development times through concurrent or simultaneous engineering. This requires a much greater sense of teamwork among different functions, and between suppliers and customers, supported by computers. Behind all this is the relentless drive to cut development costs. According to Dataquest, the US-based market research concern, worldwide spending on Cad/Cam/Cae and GIS (Geographical Information Systems) software by the aerospace/missiles/and space vehicles sector was Dollars 422.1m in 1992, accounting for 8.5 per cent of the total spent by industry. The relevance of such software can be seen in programmes at all the main airframe manufacturers, civil or military. At McDonnell Douglas, which is one of the largest users of EDS Unigraphics software, the most modern fighter aircraft in the world, the F/A 18-E/F, is being designed using all the collaborative elements offered by a process called Electronic Product Development. Unigraphics says that Northrop in California, GE Aircraft Engines in Cincinnati and McDonnell Douglas in St Louis are able to work as one team, sharing data, reviewing designs and programme plans on-line, while building a 3D model that can be verified and tested on screen, then manufactured in the knowledge that parts will fit. Expensive physical mock-ups are therefore eliminated. Unigraphics says its target now is to allow airframe and engine manufacturers to handle a digital model of up to 10,000 components effectively. Where a 'real' part is needed, the aerospace industry has taken quickly to the concept of 'rapid prototyping'. A process known as stereolithography is used to create a full-scale part, normally made out of plastic resin, from a three-dimension Cad file. This saves weeks or even months on the traditional pattern-making process. At the other end of the line, with the customers in the airline industry, there are programmes such as Intergraph's Veramis (Vehicle Repair and Maintenance Information System), used by KLM and Virgin Atlantic Airways. This enables complete aircraft and aircraft sections to be visualised as intelligent three-dimensional computer images, and is said to be up to five times faster than manual repair registration systems. A report about to be published by Dataquest* analyses some of the trends influencing the purchase of Cad/Cam/Cae software, and the extent to which the aerospace industry has moved towards paperless design and production. Among them are: The need to interchange information with suppliers and subcontractors. The capital cost and scale of operation involved with the design and manufacture of a complete new aircraft is prohibitive, it says, resulting in relatively few large organisations supplying a few customers using a high percentage of subcontracted parts. 'Changes to an aircraft design at any stage can ripple through the supply chain, causing many changes in the lower levels,' says Dataquest. 'Minor changes at lower levels can cause major problems with designs at higher levels. It is vital that information flow, even if restricted, is accurate.' Methods for information interchange. Low-level subcontractors providing sub-assemblies to a rigid specification provide electronic information to their customers, usually on magnetic media. High-level companies require certification of design and sign-offs for designs. At present, these must usually be in paper format, forming legal documentation, backed up with electronic data. The problems of security and the need for legal acceptance of designs are the key reasons for the continued use of paper-based information transfer. Electronic interchange is typically used for prototypes, working designs and intermittent information. Importance of Cad for the design activity. The use of Cad/Cam/Cae tools is widespread, with high percentages of products being developed using them. The ability to model assemblies, interactive parts, and to test parts functionally are invaluable. Many systems can provide the specialist features and functions required by aerospace manufacturers. Decision process to purchase new systems. The nature of aerospace developments has forced the development of customised systems, which must support many projects that may all be at different stages of their life cycle, and may be undertaken on an international basis. So in many aerospace companies, the purchase of design tools is part of a global IT strategy. Another significant factor, says Dataquest, is the increasing importance of international consortia and joint development agreements, such as Airbus. 'These approaches force commonality in the purchase of compatible systems that ripple through the supply chain, influencing the effectiveness and requirements for integrated product development.' * 1994 Focus Report.

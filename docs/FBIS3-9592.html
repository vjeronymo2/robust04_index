			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A two-day session of the main committee  of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] opened in Sarajevo. In  addition to the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency,  Alija Izetbegovic, the session is being attended by  representatives of the highest state bodies and political,  religious, and military life of the city and the state.    In a report on the work of the SDA so far, Party Chairman  Mirsad Ceman gave a brief summary of the activity of the SDA,  one of the rare organizations which was prepared for the  aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and which contributed  fully -- in political, military, and all other spheres -- to the  defense of our homeland and the Bosniak Muslim nation whose  political interests it represents. The SDA has fully responded  to the historic challenge and it therefore represents a strong  political basis and a guarantee for the survival and freedom of  the Bosniak Muslims.    Speaking about Bosnia, President Izetbegovic said that good  and evil, reason and madness came into conflict here.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I have noticed over the past  two years of this war that the world has slowly divided into  those who are for and those who are against Bosnia. There are  almost no more neutral people. They have either been for or  against Bosnia, and no one has remained uninvolved.    When you analyze that division, you can see that everything  that was good, thank God, sided with us. I have noticed this  speaking, for example, about governments in a country. Their  sleek politicians placed themselves on the other side, but the  free-thinking people in that country -- [word indistinct] all  those idealists, romantics, poets, artists -- they were all on  our side. The whole of the Muslim world was on our side, but  that is a special case. Everything good in the Western world  sided with us. [end recording]    [Unidentified correspondent] Bosnia will be a country of law  and order, Izetbegovic went on to say. At the same time, it  will be governed in such a way that a genocide against Bosniak  Muslims will never again occur. Despite the fact that they have  lost most people for Bosnia's freedom, they will not give up the  struggle to recover the captured territories.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Our people currently living in  Germany or Croatia must be able to return to their villages near  Zvornik. There is no negotiating there. There is no  negotiating there. [applause] That is a practical, everyday,  political reason. There is also a moral reason. Could we  possibly give them [Serbs] those territories as a reward for  (?their job) of having killed us -- please keep it as a reward.  We will not allow that. [end recording]    [Correspondent] As part of the second item of the agenda,  which has not started yet, following a report by Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic on the recently signed agreement with the  Croats, seven more reports will be submitted: on the functioning  of state bodies, foreign policy, information, refugees, army,  veterans' issues, and economic reconstruction of the country.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA investigative service </F> (preparation and documents--Yakhya Akiyev): "Why Did Ilyumzhinov  Raise the White Flag a Second Time? Almost a Criminal `Sorting  Out' in the Kremlin"]    [Text] In the 18 March issue of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA, "Now It Is Clear Why Ilyumzhinov Relinquished the Post  of President," we published a "report" of Minister of Internal  Affairs V. Yerin which discusses the "shady" origin of funds of  President of Kalmykia Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was noted in the  editorial commentary that the shady origin of Ilyumzhinov's  funds and his open disposition to engage in ventures in the  reformation of Kalmykia absolutely did not interest either  President Yeltsin, his circle, or the MVD-FCS [Ministry of  Internal Affairs-Federal Counterintelligence Service] as long as  Ilyumzhinov was considered one of them and a politically loyal  leader of the republic. Today, we are continuing publication of  the documents. On the one hand, those that throw light on the  commercial activity of the president of Kalmykia, and on the  other hand, those that demonstrate the mechanism for bringing  Kremlin pressure to bear on the "formerly best, now fallen out  of favor" marksman.    So, Document No. 1    This is a note by P. Filippov, manager of the  Analytical Center of the Administration of the President of the  Russian Federation. We are publishing the note in abridged form,  and an exact copy of B.N. Yeltsin's endorsement on the first  page of the document.    To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin  <H5>  Analytical Note </H5>   The socioeconomic and political situation in the Republic of  Kalmykia--Khalmg Tangch.    Kalmykia is one of the most backward republics of the  Russian  Federation... The standard of living of the population is one of  the lowest in Russia (the average wage in the republic in July  of this year was 57 percent of the average Russian wage, and the  housing fund is the worst in the Russian Federation).    The political situation is stable. Until very recently, the  president of the republic enjoyed popular support. Numerous  populist steps (the invitation to Dalai Lama XIV to take up  permanent residence in the republic and to Ye. Gaydar regarding  the post of premier) enable the president to maintain a high  rating.    Unfavorable trends:    1. Concentration of power in the hands of the president.  After disbanding the former Supreme Soviet, K. Ilyumzhinov  formed a controllable parliament of 25 persons that could be  dissolved in accordance with the constitution of the republic.  After abolishing the soviets at all levels, the president  introduced the institution of his own representatives in the  localities. For all practical purposes, there is no opposition.    2. There is single control of the president over the economy  of the republic. A big businessman with funds of an unclear  origin, K. Ilyumzhinov even earlier controlled the economy of  Kalmykia through the San corporation, the Steppe bank, regional  departments of the Revival fund (of which he was president), and  others. The plan of reorganization of Kalmykia into a single  corporation is being put into effect by the president: A  republic investment-industrial company has been created with a  charter fund of $1 billion for the conduct of oil and gas  extraction and securities operations.    3. Lack of detailed work on ambitious projects. Despite the  announced reduction in the organs of state authority,  expenditures on their maintenance increased in the refined  budget for 1993 up to 4.6 percent against 1.9 percent in the  initial variant.(...)    Given the lack of progress in the socioeconomic sphere, K.  Ilyumzhinov chose the path of seeking rapid results in the  sphere of foreign policy: activation of contacts with the  diaspora, mediation in the Ossetia-Ingush conflict (...), an  active position in the Federation Council and in the events of  3-4 October of this year.    The most probable outcome of K. Ilyumzhinov's unsuccessful  debut on the Moscow scene is the final switch to the opposition  camp.    What is to be done, in the opinion of analysts?    1. Considering the full dependence of the republic on  federal  subsidies (in 1993, the share of subsidies in the income part  was 86 percent, against 72 percent in the initial estimate), it  is recommended:    --not to assume any kind of long-term obligations for  granting subsidies and credits from the federal budget,  benefits, and export licenses; build all financial-economic  relations with the republic on a short-term basis;    --not to fix the extent of financial resources allocated  from  the federal budget in each succeeding interval;    --create a mechanism (possibly a negotiating one) that makes  it possible to effectively correct assistance to the republic,  depending on existing circumstances;    2. Distance ourselves from the personality of the president,  temporarily reducing official contacts to a minimum; conduct all  contacts with K. Ilyumzhinov exclusively as with the president  of Kalmykia.    3. Introduce clarity in the origin of the personal funds and  capital controlled by K. Ilyumzhinov (...)    [Signed] P. Filippov, director of the center    Thus, remaining distant from Ilyumzhinov, publishing  compromising material, and making the financing of Kalmykia  dependent on Ilyumzhinov's behavior--this is only a small  arsenal of means of political pressure on a "component of the  Federation."    Further, B.N. Yeltsin affixes his endorsement: "To V.S.  Chernomyrdin. Very seriously. I request that you draw  conclusions. Yeltsin. 18 November 1993."    V.S. Chernomyrdin circulates the note to the Cabinet of  Ministers. Especially emphasizing instructions to V. Yerin. V.  Yerin, understanding everything, sends a letter to the Ministry  of Economics with an enumeration of K. Ilyumzhinov's  machinations, which have been known for a long time, but which  are being kept quiet for the time being.    The machine has been cranked up. Chebotarev, deputy  chief of the Main Administration for Organizational Crimes,  dispatches a paper to First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank  Kulikov. We quote in an abridgement (numerous firms have been  omitted through which Ilyumzhinov put state money "to  work").  <H5>  On Designating Inspections </H5>   In September and November 1992 the Government of the Russian  Federation, by petition of the Ministry of Economics and the  Rostekstil concern, allocated a special favorable credit in the  sum of R14 billion to the Steppe commercial bank of the Republic  of Kalmykia... The date of payment of the credit was set for 26  April 1993. The Steppe association, instead of using the money  specially for the purchase of wool, sold R9.4 billion to various  commercial structures in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg,  and Nizhnyy Tagil at an interest rate of 80 percent and higher.    The sale of credits was conducted by the Steppe association  under the pretext of contracts concluded with commercial  structures on joint activity.    In April 1993 the Steppe KB [commercial bank], after  presenting documents that the credit resources received were  being used as designated, albeit slowly, in connection with  objective difficulties, submitted a petition to the Central Bank  of the Russian Federation for an extension of the date for  return of the credit until December 1993. The petition was  supported by the National Bank of Kalmykia and the joint-stock  company Rostekstil. As a result, the date for returning the  credit was extended to 1 December 1993, even though wool for  monetary resources in the sum of R9.4 billion allocated to the  Steppe association has not even now arrived at enterprises of  the Rostekstil concern. (...)    On 18 December 1992 the Steppe association, with payment  authorization No. 8, transferred R914 million to the joint-stock  company TIM according to a contract for joint activity in wool  purchasing. The TIM joint-stock company used the received  monetary resources to purchase citrus fruit in Spain and sell it  in CIS countries. On the instructions of the association, part  of the monetary resources of $250,716 in currency was  transferred by the TIM joint-stock company in May 1993 to Warsaw  to the People's Bank of Poland, account No. 62828, and the rest  of the monetary resources, after the sale of the citrus fruit,  was returned with interest to the Steppe association. (...)    (...) On 25 December 1992 the Steppe association, on the  basis of the contract on joint activity, transferred R1 billion  for the purchase of wool to the joint-stock company Aquarius  Systems Interface. After converting the given sum to $2,328,605,  the joint-stock company Aquarius Systems Interface, according to  a contract for the purchase of canned products, transferred the  aforementioned sum to Warsaw to the People's Bank of Poland,  account No. 628288. According to the contract, the Steppe  association was supposed to receive the products. However, there  are no documents in the Aquarius Systems Interface joint-stock  company that confirm the receipt of products by the Steppe  association.    Moreover, there are data at the present time indicating that  about R2 billion were converted to $2.9 million and transferred  to foreign banks through other commercial structures.    Thus, the acquired credit was not used for what it was  designated: Examinations conducted earlier were not objective,  which made it possible for the aforementioned structures to  extend the credit contract to 1 December 1993.    In connection with the aforementioned, I request an  examination of the issue of cessation of the prolongation of  credit, the imposition of penalty fines for nonfulfillment of  obligations to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and a  decision on the possibility of designating and conducting a bank  inspection for verification of the grounds for the receipt of  credit, its extension, and the further movement of these  resources.    [Signed] First Deputy Chief G.F. Chebotarev    We do not know how the "sorting out" ended. K.  Ilyumzhinov, who is passionately striving for the independence  of Kalmykia, calling it "the second Kuwait," unexpectedly for  everyone, suddenly, abrogated the republic's constitution,  stripped himself of the title of president, took the modest  title of governor, and returned the entire "gulped" sovereignty.    And no criminal case is being brought with respect to  Ilyumzhinov.    It is interesting: If Ilyumzhinov had not gone with a  white flag to Rutskoy, would he remain president, or not? And  what would his questionable financial operations be called?  Perhaps, "an ability to manage economically and live in a new  way?" And some analytical note most likely would say that  "despite the dubious origin of funds (...) Ilyumzhinov's high  degree of loyalty to the existing authorities should be taken  into account..."</p>

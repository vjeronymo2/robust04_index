Trias submitted  571 signatures, but 241 were determined to be invalid.  </P> <P> A third candidate, Howard Obata, was also disqualified. Obata, a postal clerk  who is relatively unknown in the district, submitted 657 signatures, but 284  were invalid, the clerk's office said.  </P> <P> In addition to Woo, three candidates qualified for the ballot: Berndt  Lohr-Schmidt, an attorney who has opposed Woo's efforts to impose restrictions  on hillside building; Venus De Milo, a computer consultant who ran  unsuccessfully for mayor and county supervisor, and Zahrina Machadah, a  business consultant from Beachwood Canyon.  </P></p>

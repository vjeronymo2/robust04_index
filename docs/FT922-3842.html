			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan's chip makers get down to brass tacks - The American industry sees changing attitudes THE US semiconductor industry could not have hoped for a more positive outcome from last week's semiconductor talks in Japan. After more than 10 years' efforts to beat down the door to the Japanese semiconductor market, the US industry has now obtained a public pledge from its Japanese counterparts on measures to speed purchase of foreign semiconductors. The new pledges could be a turning point. Before the talks, the Japanese had said they were already doing everything possible to boost purchases of foreign-made chips. Yet now the 10 biggest buyers have agreed to release to US companies for the first time detailed semiconductor purchase plans normally protected as commercial secrets. The change is not simply a result of the Japanese side opening its eyes after seeing the stagnation of foreign chip sales in Japan for the past two years. Rather, the Japanese now face a US industry with strong political backing in Washington and the all-important support of the US computer industry, raising the real possibility that trade sanctions may be imposed if the market share of foreign companies does not rise significantly from the 14.4 per cent recorded at the end of 1991. The US and Japan agreed last year that this share should rise to 20 per cent by the end of this year. The Japanese say the 20 per cent was not a promise or pledge, but anger is growing in Washington that no progress has been made toward reaching the target. An inter-agency study of the agreement's implementation, under Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, is due for publication in August, when the US election campaign will be moving into high gear. The Japanese need to show quickly that the agreement was more than an empty pledge. 'I believe Japanese companies are concerned that sanctions are right behind (if nothing happens),' said Mr James Norling, president of Motorola's semiconductor group and vice-chairman of the US Semiconductor Industry Association. Beyond the threat of government action, big Japanese groups have more reason than ever to co-operate and boost US chip sales in Japan, since the balance of commercial power between the Japanese and US semiconductor industries has shifted. Mr Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic, said: 'The big guys who can pull this off are the ones to benefit if trade relations improve, and lose most if trade friction heats up.' In past years, Mr Corrigan and Mr Norling say, the Japanese industry was in a stronger position. Japanese companies gave a terrible thrashing to the US industry as they strove to achieve complete domination over the market for dynamic random access memory chips, a key memory device used in all personal computers and a whole range of electronic devices. But after driving several US companies out of the field, Japan's victory has proved pyrrhic. A rapid rise in output of high-capacity memory chips in Korea and Taiwan has helped to drive down world prices to a point where Japanese companies are unable to make returns on their investment. In recent weeks, Japan's big chip producers have reported steep declines in profits as a result. Also, the US hold on the products such as microprocessors has grown tighter. Mr Corrigan says: 'The good parts of the business are extremely intellectual property intensive.' This where the US companies excel. But growing US industry confidence is tempered by a degree of scepticism toward the latest Japanese pledge to increase chip imports. A huge surge would have to occur in Japanese orders for foreign semiconductors over the next two months to have an effect on trade data before the US inter-agency review is completed. No guarantee can be made that US chip sales in Japan will rise, but clearly, the big Japanese purchasers are determined to break the deadlock. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan is to tell its 62 members to increase purchases of US chips faster than for Japanese chips as the market enters its expected recovery phase later this year. Under the industry agreement forged in Tokyo, the Semiconductor Industry Association of the US will publish a monthly index of Japanese orders, providing a more timely indicator of the market share trend than the quarterly market share figure put out by the US and Japan. This will enhance the ability of the US industry and government to respond. The Japanese industry efforts are being welcomed as a positive development by US industry executives. But concern still exists that the 'emergency measures' may be short-lived and serve only to delay a US government decision on retaliatory sanctions until after the November election. Another flaw is that the new measures do not involve smaller Japanese chip purchasers. The US side is now counting on the biggest 10 companies, who account for 50 per cent of the market, to do more than their share. Most of these companies already buy over 20 per cent of their chips from foreign companies; they may now have to push this higher to stop the trade row growing. Mr Shinichi Itoh, vice-president at NEC, the Japanese electronics company, said access to the market would also be improved for European makers, but nothing specific was on offer. Mr Corrigan poured scorn on European complaints that the US was getting preferential access. 'Enthusiasm of the European companies to penetrate the Japanese market does not seem high.' European companies could not complain while protected by a 14 per cent tariff barrier.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK MURDERS  </P> <P> My soul, mind and heart go out to Betty Broderick. I have been in her position  as far as the kind of betrayal she has endured by her husband, the courts,  judges, lawyers, her own family and cronies of her husband.  </P> <P> No one knows or understands this kind of situation until they have been through  it. I am totally 100% in Betty Broderick's corner.  </P> <P> SUSANNA HAHN  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

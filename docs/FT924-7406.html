			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Warning on bogus safety advice BOGUS health and safety consultants are exploiting ignorance among employers about European Community legislation due to be implemented on January 1, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday, David Goodhart writes. The need for training courses and consultancies is being oversold, the executive said. 'Many of the claims being made about what the legislation says and what firms must do are bogus, aimed at getting businessmen to buy advice and then undertake unnecessary measures, usually involving further services or products.' One company claims its training courses have the approval of a 'European Health and Safety Commission'. There is no such body. Other companies are basing their advertising loosely on real changes but then exaggerating them. One company points out that after January 1 companies will be required to make assessments of possible risks to employees. But it implies incorrectly that all employees will have to be tested for exposure to radon, the radioactive gas, which is not the case.</p>

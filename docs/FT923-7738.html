			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Motoring: Toyota Corolla arrives in British showrooms THE SEVENTH generation Toyota Corolla, the world's best-selling car, arrived in British showrooms last week. There is more than a hint of Toyota's top luxury saloon, the Lexus LS400, about its curvy styling - and the resemblance goes more than skin deep. One reason why the sepulchral silence of the Lexus shook European executive class car-makers was the use of steel/bitumen 'sandwich' panels in critical parts of its vehicle structure. They stifle noise and vibration at source. The Corollas have them, too, together with gold-plated electrical connectors for aerospace reliability standards; occupant-protecting side impact beams in the doors; and a body shell made almost 90 per cent from galvanised anti-rust steel. All Corollas have fuel-injected, 16-valve, 1.3 or 1.6 litre engines with catalytic converters. Power-assisted steering, central locking, four-speaker radio/cassette players and 60/40 folding rear seats are standard equipment. Prices of the new and larger models are little higher than before. They start at Pounds 9,456 for the 1.3 XLi three-door and rise to Pounds 13,210 for the 1.6 Executive. Automatic transmission instead of a five-speed gearbox is a modestly priced (Pounds 605) extra on most models. A two-litre diesel engine option and a high-performance 1.8 litre Corolla GTi will be offered early next year. There are three-door and five-door liftback, four-door saloon and estate car Corollas, all claimed by Toyota to be class leaders for quietness and refinement. Pictured above left is the 1.3 GLi saloon, which costs Pounds 10,910. Like all Toyotas, the new Corollas come with a three-year or 60,000 mile (96,600 km) warranty.</p>

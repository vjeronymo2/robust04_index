			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Safety net under a steep drop: Exports may be a buffer between carmakers and the worst of the recession A SHARP improvement in the competitiveness of the UK car industry, reflected in a tripling of exports since the late 1980s, may shield manufacturers from the worst effects of the decline in the industry. In spite of record spending on advertising and other promotional carrots to lure buyers into showrooms, there is a growing sense of unease among carmakers and dealers that the traditional August surge in sales will be weaker than previously hoped. August has assumed enormous importance as it typically accounts for nearly 25 per cent of annual sales because of the introduction on August 1 each year of the new prefix letter - 'K' this year. But while August will grab most of the headlines, manufacturers and dealers have begun looking to September's sales with no less anxiety. They believe that month's figures, free from the hype surrounding August, will more accurately reflect whether slight improvements in sales experienced in April, May and last month - of 9.1 per cent, 1.4 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively - represent a faint but sustainable recovery. The growing worry is that the relentless flow of gloomy statistics about the economy over the past few weeks is damaging the confidence of both private and business buyers so much that the car market could slip back into recession for the rest of the year. Sales have plummeted during the recession by a third from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.59m last year. In spite of the recent slight upturn, sales for the first half of this year were down a further 4 per cent. Mr Reg Heath, chief executive of the Inchcape-owned TKM group - which controls more than 100 car dealerships - says there is now a real danger that any real recovery will not get under way before 1993. Mr Michael Hollingsworth, an economist with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, finds it hard to see how the industry could avoid cutting production and imposing short-time working this year under those circumstances. Without the export programmes, widespread shutdowns would definitely be unavoidable. But even though some principal continental European markets are now coming off the boil, and total exports are likely to decline again this year, the manufacturers at least would no longer face potential disaster. So far, Ford and Peugeot-Talbot have been the only manufacturers to signal cuts after workers return from their summer break next month. And the exports safety-net spread beneath the industry was emphasised again yesterday with an announcement by Ford of an expanded exports programme at its Halewood plant on Merseyside, just a few days after announcing that it would cut output at the plant for a month because of the downturn in UK sales. Instead, Escort and Orion models built at Halewood - already exported to France and Italy - are to go on sale to German buyers as well from the autumn. As a result, production cuts at Halewood will last for only two weeks. The transformation in the UK industry's export performance over the past three years has been considerable. In 1988 the industry shipped just over 200,000 cars overseas, mainly to continental Europe. By 1990 this had doubled and last year saw a further sharp rise to 605,000, much higher than in any year since 1973. Last year Ford became the UK's biggest motor industry exporter, with shipments of 186,000 cars and commercial vehicles. Rover Group's exports totalled 209,000; Peugeot Talbot's 60,000; General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary, launching a substantial exports programme for the first time since the 1970s, shipped 104,000 cars. As a result, production slipped only 4.53 per cent below the 1990 level, to 1.23m. Output in the first six months of this year, at 686,763, was also only 1.1 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. However, Mr Hollingsworth believes that export markets will weaken further this year and that total UK exports could drop to around 500,000. In order even to match 1991's total market, August sales will need to reach 400,000 - against 370,000 last year - and be followed by increases of 4 per cent on a year-on-year basis for each subsequent month through to December. The industry is putting a brave public face on its prospects. But privately fears are being voiced that next month's sales may be no better than the previous August's, even though the industry is unofficially estimated to be spending a record Pounds 50m on advertising during July alone to generate buyer interest. Last year, according to statistical group Market Expenditure Analysis, it spent Pounds 42m. In the private-buyer market, worries about job security and the collapse of the housing market are seen as important factors. This reluctance - rather than inability - to spend, which is reflected in high personal-savings ratios, is being intensified, some dealer groups suggest, by a belief among private buyers that still bigger bargains may be had by delaying purchases. The attitudes of business car buyers are reflected by the large leasing groups, which buy a broad spread of cars essentially chosen by their client companies. They offer manufacturers little comfort. After the Conservative victory in the general election, new orders started flowing through the leasing companies at a rate some 40 per cent to 50 per cent higher than last autumn. But the spree lasted just eight weeks, as business confidence began collapsing. 'June 1 was like the tap being turned off,' recalls Mr Ian Mosley, chief executive of Swan National Leasing and Rental. 'Everything just stopped.'</p>

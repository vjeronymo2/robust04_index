			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ringing out the old Sir, Mrs Florence Gilkes did indeed see a button A and B payphone on the island of Soay on August 1 (Letters, September 1). However, BT's large investment programme caught up with the kiosk on August 22, when the old mechanism was replaced by a modern unit. Papa Stour 224 in the Shetland Isles was similarly updated on August 25, thus assuring it of its place in telecommunications history as the UK's last working public button A and B payphone. Alan Bjorkvoll, BT payphone manager Scotland, Caledonian House, 19A Canning Street, Edinburgh EH3 8TA</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Plotting the course of US economic growth these days demands a good understanding of the effects of natural disasters. First there was last summer's flooding in the mid-West, now an earthquake in southern California and an arctic blast that last week froze much of the East. To what extent are these events holding back - or in some cases stimulating - economic activity? Fourth-quarter GDP figures, to be released on Friday, will provide an indication of just how robust economic growth was in the final months of 1993. The previous quarter was up 2.9 per cent from a year before - restrained to some degree by the floods, but still a healthy bounce back from the sharp slowdown in the first half of last year. That surge continued into the last three months of the year, aided in part by the one-off effects of a post-flood catch up in activity. Expectations for fourth -quarter growth have been hastily revised upwards in recent days, from the 4.8 per cent level which had been the market's previous view. Now, estimates range from 5 to 6 per cent, reflecting strong consumer spending growth and an upturn in residential construction. That the fourth quarter figure would be strong has been long expected: whether the bond market has fully priced in such a rise is another thing.</p>

The clause's objective would be to lay down stipulations  prohibiting forced labour and the employment of minors to be  contained in the international regulations that govern world  trade.    "In a world in which commercial exchange takes on a global  dimension and markets no longer have frontiers, commercial  activity could prove a forceful means of promoting social  innovation and improving conditions for the weaker sections of  society in the poorer countries," the European Parliament  declared in defence of its request.</p>

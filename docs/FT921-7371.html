			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Wit, wisdom and musings on mortality - Screen WE ALL feared that attending the Berlin Film Festival after the Wall came down would be like watching a tennis match without a net. No more clearly structured ideological cut and thrust in this most political of movie events. But festival director Moritz de Hadeln is a master at replacing one cold war with another. When the Soviet Bloc drops out as a public enemy, he finds a substitute in the international Press. This year we film critics - what have we done wrong?  - have had to bus or taxi daily to the remote snowbound 'Kongresshalle': a large ugly building shaped like a hat where we spend all day watching films far from the other guests who watch theirs in the comfortable, centrally located Zoo-Palast. The good news - we needed some  - is that the films have distracted us from the venue. They are better than at any filmfestspiele I can remember. De Hadeln has a prodigious record of luring Hollywood to Berlin, maintained this year with Woody Allen, Paul Schrader, Lawrence Kasdan and Martin Scorsese among the US directors represented. Meanwhile Eric Rohmer, Istvan Szabo and Gillian Armstrong fly their films in from other climes, and around the main competition cluster quality sideshows like the Panorama and Young Film-Makers Forum. Show-stealers to date are Woody Allen's Shadows And Fog, Rohmer's A Winter's Tale and two films from Finland's Kaurismaki brothers. Allen's black-and-white comedy is 85 minutes of spoof German Expressionism set in a Europe where nothing has changed since Fritz Lang's M. A murderer is at large in a fog-shrouded town; Woody Allen plays 'Herr Kleinmann', a small worried member of the citizens' posse; and Mia Farrow is the girl he falls for after she has escaped from her circus lover (John Malkovich) and spent a night in an all-star brothel (Jodie Foster, Lili Tomlin, Kathy Bates). Allen's brain is one of the great if unpredictable organs of the 20th century. We are glad to report that Alice doesn't live there any more, that last winsome aberration is succeeded by this gloriously witty tale of love and death. Shadows And Fog benefits not just from Allen's own presence, here at full comic throttle, but from strength-in-depth acting and an exquisitely patterned plot. More on its imminent UK opening. In A Winter's Tale French winemaster Eric Rohmer removes the corks from three garrulous souls - pretty Felicie (Charlotte Very) and the two lovers she must choose between - and watches as they chatter away sans cesse. Rohmer's characters are human champagne bottles. They scintillate long after being opened as we onlookers wonder: Will Felicie choose middle-aged Max or pale intellectual Loic? Or will she wait for her long-lost holiday lover Charles to whom, five years ago, she foolishly gave the wrong home address? Plato, Pascal and other pensive matters are woven into the sun-fresh naturalism of style. Rohmer and Allen were in the main event. Mika Kaurismaki's Zombie And The Ghost Train arrived at a remote platform called the Young Film-Makers Forum. But Finland is now becoming the world export capital for downbeat movie humour. Mika, hitherto the producer brother of Aki (The Match Factory Girl), calls his portrait of an alcoholic young rock guitarist semi-attached to the group 'Harry and the Mulefukkers' (sic) a tragicomedy. Never has that schizophrenic definition seemed apter. Even at its funniest - the hero's adventures in the army, his ill-starred love life - the film has a sense of melancholy paralysis. Even at its gloomiest it presses a tongue slyly into its cheek. Mika's brother Aki brought his own two-tone movie to Berlin. His new film La Vie De Boheme is a deadpan comedy with musings on mortality. Shot in French in black-and-white, the film turns Henri Murger's Parisian stories (source for Puccini's opera) into a modern-dress spoof on artistic attitudinising. For 90 minutes we could be watching Tony Hancock's The Rebel re-envisioned by Samuel Beckett. Then the fine-tuned dialogue and deadpan-festive cameos (Samuel Fuller, Jean-Pierre Leaud, Louis Malle) give way to something more sombre: a dying Mimi and a tragic pay-off not quite so persuasive as brother Mika's. When we wander into well-known cities in modern cinema, we no longer have any idea whom we will meet. After finding Woody Allen in Expressionist Europe and Sam Fuller in modern Paris, in the British competition entry Utz we find Dutch director George Sluizer (The Vanishing) directing an Anglo-Irish-German cast (Armin Mueller-Stahl, Brenda Fricker, Paul Scofield) in an adaptation of Bruce Chatwin's novella. Exhilaratingly it works. Exhilaratingly too in a festival obsessed with mortality (it must be the fin de siecle factor), the tale of a Czech porcelain collector (Mueller-Stahl) hoping to take his treasures beyond the grave has a comical-tragical richness and a feeling for the crepuscular beauties of Prague. Sadly the BBC, who co-funded the film, threaten to deny it a UK theatrical release. They should be protested to immediately. Britain makes few enough good films without our throwing them away on the small screen with no large-screen exposure first. Not all has been magic and mastery at Berlin. An ill-informed festivalgoer could have sat through 48 hours of rubbish in the first week if not pointed in better directions by kindly colleagues. He could have endured Kei Kumai's turgid Luminous Moss, a Japanese film about man eating man that gives cannibalism a bad name; or Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes, a do-it-by-numbers rape thriller; or Jan Troell's Il Capitano, about two Swedish youngsters who go on a murder spree but not before boring us first with their life stories. Then there were the high-hopes entries that crashed on take-off. In Gillian Armstrong's The Last Days Of Chez Nous a group of ageing, charmless Australian hippies play musical beds. In Hungary's Sweet Emma, Dear Bobe film-maker Istvan Szabo takes a serious subject - his country's fears and disillusionments after liberation - and sketches it in coarse, caricatural strokes. And in David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch the Canadian director of The Fly and Dead Ringers converts the famed William Burroughs opus into - well, into what? A sort of droned reverie, filmed in a studio-built North Africa prowled by monotone voice-overs and the odd engaging monster. There is always, in extremis, Hollywood. What better subject for Berlin's annual retrospective than Hal Roach, the 100-year-old silent comedy producer who introduced Stan Laurel to Oliver Hardy? Mr Roach was in Berlin himself, a sprightly, smiling centenarian. And in the competition Schrader's Light Sleeper, Scorsese's Cape Fear and Barry Levinson's Oscar-nominated Bugsy promise to enliven the final days. So does Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon, of which I have had a sneak preview. This is the best film in years from the maker of Body Heat and The Big Chill: a giant flirtatious soap opera about interconnecting lives in Los Angeles. The varied cast - led by Steve Martin, Kevin Kline, and Danny Glover - show us what happens when Lotusland is attacked by human pest life. Muggings, gang warfare, sexual assault. You thought they were obtainable mainly in New York; you can now find them wholesale in LA Kasdan's film is serious, funny, painful, cautionary and enlightening: much like the 45th Berlin Film Festival.</p>

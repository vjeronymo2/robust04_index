			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova under the "New Order of the </F> Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations" rubric: "They Want To  Eat the Apple of Discord at Smolenskaya Square"]    [Text] Yesterday, the MFER [Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations] of Russia issued an order on restoring the  Main Administration for Investment Cooperation within the  organization of the ministry. Simultaneously, the MFER submitted  to the Government of Russia a draft of the decree "On Making  Amendments and Additions to the Regulations on the MFER in  Conjunction With the Subordination of the Russian Agency for  International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) to the MFER  and the Establishment of the Federal State Office `Russian  Center for International and Cultural Cooperation.'" The RAMSIR  has long been an apple of discord between its former and current  masters. The MFER decree and the draft decree of the government  should codify the role of the ministry as the overseer in  investment issues.    The MFER of Russia intends to assume "regulatory functions  in  the area of attracting foreign investment to the Russian  Federation" because, as the text of the draft decree reveals,  the ministry considers itself a legal successor of the RAMSIR,  "insofar as this Agency has operated to perform the above  envisioned functions." Along with the functions of the RAMSIR,  the MFER should also take over 75 of its employees. However,  regardless of the decisions to be made by the RAMSIR personnel,  the MFER is already recruiting cadres for its new main  directorate. It is proposed that the RAMSIR itself be  transformed into the Russian Center for International and  Cultural Cooperation (that is to say, some kind of an analog of  the Council of Societies for Friendship With Foreign Countries).  It will now be charged with carrying out the edict of the  president "On Russian Scientific and Cultural Centers Abroad."  It is planned to appoint Valentina Tereshkova, the former  chairman of the SSOD [Union of Soviet Friendship Societies], to  head the new department.    In addition to the already mentioned documents, the MFER  simultaneously submitted to the government two others. It is  proposed that the system of centralized exports be modified. The  MFER proposal calls for transmitting state quotas to individual  exporters through the tender committee of the ministry. Besides,  the MFER insists on canceling export duties on all goods. Both  drafts fit very well within the policy of liberalizing foreign  economic relations which the MFER is now pursuing.    [Boxed item begins]  <H5>  From Order No. 109 of the MFER of Russia </H5>   1. The Main Directorate for Investment Cooperation shall be  restored.    2. The Main Control and Finance Directorate shall prepare  position and wage fund assignments for the newly created  directorate.    3. The Facilities Directorate shall provide the necessary  official premises and create conditions for the regular  operation of the newly created main directorate.    [End of boxed item]</p>

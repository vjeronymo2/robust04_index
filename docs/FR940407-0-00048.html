This temporary regulation, as before, amends the speed limits on connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. The normal speed limits in this area are determined in large part by concerns about wake damage. However, lesser wakes are created by nondisplacement power vessels and it appears that the speed limits may unnecessarily impede their passage. The temporary regulation allows nondisplacement power vessels, less than 100 gross tons, to exceed the normal speed limits subject to certain restrictions. Generally, the minor changes in this version of the temporary regulation (in comparison to the previous version of the temporary regulation) place more restrictions on the use of the higher speeds by the operators of the nondisplacement vessels in order to better ensure safe, effectively regulated operations. The purpose of this temporary regulation, as before, is to test the feasibility and safety of the operation of nondisplacement vessels in the connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. During this period of continued trial, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District invites further public comment on this regulation or future versions thereof for the purpose of either amendments to this temporary regulation or for the purpose of considering a permanent change to the standing regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 1, 1994 and terminates at 12 midnight on November 30, 1994.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- "The report that the  Albanian authorities have tried forcibly to resettle members of  the Serb and Montenegrin minorities, residents of Vraka and  Podgoricani, from the villages of Stari Boric and Mladi Boric,  in which they have always lived, has caused great concern among  the Yugoslav public. According to available information, the  Albanian authorities tried to confiscate by force their houses  and land, and move them to different locations," reads a  statement by the Federal Foreign Ministry, which was forwarded  to TANJUG today.    ``What is particularly worrying is that the Albanian police  used force and wounded several people, including women and  children. All this has caused serious concern among members of  the Serb and Montenegrin minorities and the Gorans [Slav ethnic  minority], because this is yet further confirmation of the  increasing pressure and the unwillingness on the part of the  Albanian authorities to grant and respect the national  minorities' inalienable right to their territory.    ``The Federal Foreign Ministry notes with concern the fact  that Albania is forcibly resettling members of the Serb and  Montenegrin minorities under the pretext of a new administrative  division of state territory, and is planning to settle Albanians  from the areas of Dukadjin and Malesija to farms belonging to  the Serbs, Montenegrins and Gorans. This is a calculated policy  aimed at breaking up the territorial integrity of the ethnic  Serbs, Montenegrins and Gorans in Albania, especially in the  territory near the Yugoslav-Albanian border, and exerting  increased physical and psychological pressure in order to speed  up their systematic assimilation.    ``By such action the Albanian authorities are violating  basic  human and civil rights, the right to physical integrity, the  freedom to choose the place of abode and the inviolability of  private property, which is in contravention of its obligations  assumed as a member of the United Nations and the CSCE.    ``The Federal Foreign Ministry calls on the Albanian  authorities to stop exerting pressure on members of the Serb and  Montenegrin national minorities and the Gorans, and to abandon  its plan forcibly to resettle the residents of Vraka and  Podgoricani. The Federal Foreign Ministry expects Albania to  respect all rights of members of the Serb and Montenegrin  minorities in line with relevant CSCE documents,'' the statement  says in conclusion.</p>

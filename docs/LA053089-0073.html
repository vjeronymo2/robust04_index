Swinger took the field through  the opening six furlongs in 1:11 1/5. Craig Perret started moving Awe Inspiring  on the backstretch, drawing even with leaders Faultless Ensign and Halo Hansom  with a four-wide move on the stretch turn and then drew away at the eighth  pole.  </P> <P> The victory was the fifth in seven starts this year for Awe Inspiring and  earned $300,000 for Phipps. The colt paid $2.60, $2.40 and $2.10. Halo Hansom  paid $12.20 and $2.10 and Faultless Ensign returned $2.10.  </P> <P> Proper Reality, staying on the rail through the stretch, won the $589,000  Metropolitan Mile in a three-horse photo finish at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> Proper Reality held off the favored entry of Seeking the Gold and Dancing Spree  to win $353,400. Seeking the Gold finished a nose behind Proper Reality and a  nose ahead of Dancing Spree.  </P> <P> Proper Reality covered the mile on the fast track in 1:34 and returned $10.80,  $3.80 and $3.40. Seeking the Gold, owned by Phipps, paid $2.40 and $2.10.  </P> <P> "He's a nice horse, a good sprinter," said Robert Holthus, trainer of Proper  Reality. "He ran into a little traffic at the head of the stretch, but when he  finally did get through, he just came right on."  </P> <P> Holthus said Proper Reality, who finished second in his last start at the  Pimlico Special, will leave Tuesday to run in the Hawthorne Gold Cup.  </P></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Senior Tories join ranks of the doubters Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the forces. But several ex-colonial duties (Belize, Bermuda, Hong Kong) are soon to disappear, and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind means the geographical extension, the fourth place in the global pecking order will not last long. Some Tories say they are not convinced by Mr Rifkind's claim to appreciate the value of breadth. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, says the government fails to see the advantages of deploying troops overseas. 'I am extremely angry about our withdrawal from Belize,' he said yesterday, claiming that the UK was losing an important area of influence. Sir Jerry Wiggin, Tory MP for Weston-super-Mare, said the quality of British servicemen was enhanced by the wide range of locations in which they operate. 'I would like to see our servicemen train in every climate and zone to which they might be deployed,' he said. Mingled with an attachment to the legacy of empire that is tinged with sentiment, there is a more substantial point. Yesterday's document repeatedly suggests that the quality of Britain's armed forces is one of its principal assets in the international market-place. To borrow a phrase coined by Mr Douglas Hurd, a high-performance army is one of the things that enables Britain to 'punch above its weight' in world affairs. As Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out, this is a new argument for the defence establishment as it takes on the Treasury. It is a strong argument: the selection of Britain to train South Africa's new defence forces, and the prominence of British forces in Bosnia are two recent examples of the prestige the UK has earned through the pursuit of military excellence. If defence chiefs can convince Whitehall that they represent one of Britain's comparative advantages in the world, the UK can still play a role far beyond its shores long after all its colonial business is finished.

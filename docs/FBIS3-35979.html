			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Baturin and Sergey Gryzunov: "Broom Dance </F> As Performed by Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] Belgrade -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived on  vacation in independent Slovenia, where he waltzed with a broom  and did a Cossack dance. His bodyguard swam after hotel  property that had been thrown in a lake, while the Yugoslav  businessmen organizing and paying for the trip by the deputy's  team smashed glasses at supper in classic Russian style.    The Slovene Internal Affairs Ministry ordered him to leave  the republic, probably in response to the statement that not  "every small place can call itself a state" (Slovenia is a small  country even by European standards).    Zhirinovskiy went from Slovenia to Belgrade, managing en  route, in Budapest, not only to explain to flabbergasted  Hungarians that they had no prospects, that no one wanted their  "Ikarusz" buses and apples because they had plenty of their own,  but also to indicate a way out of the situation. According to  the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader, it is to  galvanize the ideas of CEMA and the Warsaw Pact and create a  zone of East European cooperation.    In the capital of Serbia and Yugoslavia the visitor was  greeted with tumultuous applause in a hall which was packed with  many more admirers than journalists invited to the press  conference. Zhirinovskiy said that he had told Chernomyrdin that  he would not rest as long as Kozyrev was a minister: "My task  is to remove him from the Russian government."    Belgrade's next guest or, to be more precise, the guest of  the local orthodox neocommunists, will be Gennadiy Zyuganov, in  Febrary.    "I come here as a victor, as chairman of the party that  gained three times as many votes as those who are are now  governing Russia," Zhirinovskiy said. "I want to warn the  Western countries' governments that to bomb any cities in Bosnia  will be to declare war on Russia.... Let them not forget that  there are still Russian forces in Europe and they could remain  there for a long time."    This is exactly what the conflict participants are seeking  to  achieve in the Balkans -- to involve the powerful of this world  in the bloody internecine strife. The Serbs are trying to  involve the Russians, the Muslims are trying to involve the  Islamic world, and the Croats are trying to involve the West.    Zhirinovskiy said he was against East European states  joining  NATO: "If they want to clean the boots of the Germans, British,  and French, let them join." Russia will not do so. And as soon  as it has a new president, his party will create a Union of  Slavic States.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's words meet with a warm response in  the hearts of a section of Yugoslav society. After all, he is  promising the victims of sanctions and war what they want: The  lifting of sanctions and victory both over economic problems and  on the battlefield. When Zhirinovskiy finally wins, Russia will  defend its Orthodox brothers.    There are others who think differently. Like, for example,  the BORBA newspaper commentator voicing the opinion of the  Serbian democratic opposition: "We should be more concerned  about the support for Zhirinovskiy than about Kozyrev's refusal  to adopt a `pro-Serbian stance'.... Serbia and Yugoslavia are  certainly in a very difficult situation. But it is equally  difficult to imagine that anyone would vote for the destruction  of Russia and the whole world for the sake of our salvation."</p>

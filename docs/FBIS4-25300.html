			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia withdrew the last  three of its warships from Latvia today in accordance with a  plan for troops withdrawal from the Baltic country.    The INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported that the three warships of  the Russian Baltic Fleet left Liepaja Port of Latvia for  Baltiysk Port in Russia.    Only a dozen Navy workers stayed behind to deal with  remaining financial issues, INTERFAX said.    Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said at a ceremony to  mark the departure that Latvia and Russia are now embarking on a  road of normal good-neighborly relations.    He said this can be proved by the Russian Navy's withdrawal  today and Russia's granting of Latvia the most-favored-nation  trade status, which has already taken effect.    In the wake of the Navy's pullout, the other services of the  Russian Armed Forces will also complete their withdrawal by  August 31.</p>

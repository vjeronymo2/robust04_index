			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments responding to the notice were received,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a public hearing was held on April 5, 1993. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of all written and oral comments regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed amendments, those amendments are adopted as revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by this Treasury decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Changes Made by the Final Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations generally describe an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative error and omission and include illustrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples. Commentators have requested that the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations include an ``accounting error'' as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative error or omission. The Service and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury Department are concerned that the term ``accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> error'' is too vague. However, in order to address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators' concerns, the final regulations clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an administrative error or omission includes an error in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tracking the housing credit dollar amount an Agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated (or that remains to be allocated) in a calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. For example, assume an Agency, believing that it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100 of credit remaining in its credit ceiling for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current calendar year, allocates $100 to a project and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees to allocate an additional $30 from the next calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year's credit ceiling. Later, in the current calendar year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency discovers that it failed to include in its credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ceiling for the current calendar year $50 of credits that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were returned in the current calendar year. The error in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tracking the $50 of credits that were returned is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative error or omission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator asked for clarification of the correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure an Agency should use when correcting a document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the Secretary's prior approval. Under the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, a document that corrects a document containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an error or omission that has not yet been filed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Internal Revenue Service should be filed as the original.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a document containing an error has already been filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Internal Revenue Service, the Agency should refile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a copy of the document containing the error that prominently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and clearly notes the correction. The Agency should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate at the top of the document(s) that the correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is being made under &sect;1.42&hyph;13 of the Income Tax Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations require that an Agency obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prior approval of the Secretary to correct an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative error or omission if (1) the correction is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not made before the close of the calendar year of the error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or omission, and (2) the correction is a numerical change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the housing credit dollar amount allocated for the building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or project. One commentator suggested that an Agency should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have until February 28, the date by which an Agency must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file its Form 8610, to correct an administrative error or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> omission that changes the housing credit dollar amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated to a building or project without obtaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's prior approval. Another commentator made a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar suggestion solely for credits returned in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year in which they were allocated. These suggestions have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been adopted. Section 42(h)(1) requires that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation for a certain calendar year be made by the close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that calendar year. Consistent with that approach, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations do not permit an Agency to make a post-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation without the Secretary's prior approval. Of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course, for a correction of an administrative error or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> omission that an Agency cannot correct on its own, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, may seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary's prior approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12866. It also has been determined that section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on its impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

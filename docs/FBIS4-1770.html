			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, March 26 (XINHUA) -- China's largest  coal-producing province, Shanxi, has been converting more of its  coal into electricity as a measure to help combat coal  transportation bottlenecks and acute energy shortages in other  parts of the country.    In 1993 the northwest China province shipped more than 224  million tons of coal, or 72 percent of its total output, to 26  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions as well as 12  cities.    The amount of electricity that Shanxi transmitted last year  to other parts of the country was some 10.785 billion kwh, or  26.46 percent of its total electricity production. The figure  was 10.33 percent more than in 1992.    Shanxi's coal output accounts for more than one fourth of  the  national total. It ships some 300 million tons of coal every  year, about three-fourths of the national total transported out  from coal-producing provinces and regions.    During an inspection tour to China's largest industrial city  of Shanghai, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that the city's  economy to a large extent relies on coal resources from Shanxi.  So do many other fast-developing but energy-short provinces and  cities, the vice-premier added.    However, Shanxi itself suffers from the low state-set prices  for coal and coal-related products, and it remains one of  China's backwater regions.    As one of China's most important powerhouses, Shanxi has in  recent years stepped up the pace of building more coal-based  power plants, in a bid to tap its coal resources and better  serve the country's economic boom.    Included in Shanxi's energy development blueprint is the  construction and upgrading of some ten electrical plants, which  will transmit electricity to neighboring provinces and regions  as far as east China's Jiangsu Province and the country's most  dynamic province, Guangdong in the south.    Under the plan, Shanxi will be capable of generating some  100  billion kwh a year by the end of this decade. The amount of  electricity it sends out will also jump from the present 10  billion kwh to 43 billion kwh annually by then.    Experts said transmitting electricity instead of coal to the  outside has considerably reduced the burden on railway  transportation and has turned low-quality coal and coal  byproducts into high-value-added electricity.    Shanxi's endeavors to turn coal into electricity have caught  the attention of the country's energy-importing regions and has  gained support from them.    Consumers of Shanxi coal and electricity, such as Beijing  and  Tianjin municipalities, and Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and  Guangdong Provinces, have funded Shanxi's fledgling power plants.    Meanwhile, companies from 13 countries and regions,  including  the United States, Germany, Britain, the Republic of Korea,  Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have signed with Shanxi 15  investment contracts and letters of intent for co-operation.    One of the big joint ventures is the Hepo electrical power  plant, a co-operative project between Shanxi and two U.S.  companies, involving more than 110 million U.S. dollars in total  investment.    Last year Shanxi pumped more than 1.94 billion U.S. dollars  into its power industry, a move that has helped raise its total  installed electricity generating capacity to 8.4 million kw.    Currently the construction of a group of electrical power  plants is well under way, and a power-transmission network is  also taking shape in Shanxi.    Officials said that another 6.1 million kw of installed  generating capacity is expected to be added to the province's  power network, making the electricity industry the  second-largest mainstay industry in Shanxi after coal.</p>

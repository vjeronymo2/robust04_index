			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Carlton to issue Dollars 200m of perpetual debt in US CARLTON Communications, the UK television company, is to issue Dollars 200m of perpetual debt in the US, making it the first foreign non-financial company to tap a market usually the preserve of banks. Carlton said the deal will hedge its balance sheet by securing long-term finance for its US investments in a form that is similar to equity but tax deductible and does not involve diluting share-holders. The deal, which is being led by Merrill Lynch, involves the issue of fixed-rate subordinated paper called Exchangeable Capital Securities, which can be converted at the option of the company into preference shares. Mr Bernard Cragg, Carlton's finance director, said the issue would be carried on the company's balance sheet as debt, although it does not have to be repaid and is free of covenant restrictions. The deal is expected to offer a yield some 200 basis points above long-dated Treasury bonds, slightly higher than that on a similar issue by Barclays Bank. Merrill Lynch is expected to sell the issue to its retail clients who have been seeking to improve the return on their investments as yields in the bond market have fal-len. Mr Cragg said Carlton, which has no net debt, had been able to exploit the opportunity because its American Depositary Receipt programme meant it could meet Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements and had already received an unpublicised single-A rating from leading rating agencies. Carlton could borrow at much cheaper interest rates in the floating rate eurodollar market, but said a perpetual subordinated issue cost only 60-80 basis points more than a conventional long-term bond. The company believed the issue was good value at current long-term rates. 'To the extent that people feel that interest rates are going up, we feel it's a bargain,' Carlton said.</p>

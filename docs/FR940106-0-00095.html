Groups of structures which form a campus or separate buildings across the street from one another are a single facility. However, separate buildings or areas which are not physically connected or in immediate proximity are a single health care facility if they are in reasonable geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. An example is an entity which manages a nursing home and a hospital in the same area and which regularly shifts or rotates the nurses between the two. Non-contiguous sites, even within the same geographic area, which do not share the same nursing staff and operational purposes are not a single facility. For example, hospitals which are located on opposite sides of a municipality, but which are managed or owned by a single entity, are separate facilities if they do not regularly share nursing staff and operational purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Geographic area <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the area within normal commuting distance of the place (address) of the intended worksite. If the geographic area does not include a sufficient number of facilities to make a prevailing wage determination, the term ``geographic area'' shall be expanded (by the State employment service, unless directed not to do so by the Director) with respect to the attesting facility to include a sufficient number of facilities to permit a prevailing wage determination to be made. If the place of the intended worksite is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), any place within the MSA may be deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Governor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the chief elected official of a State or the Governor's designee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H&hyph;1A nurse <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any nonimmigrant alien admitted to the United States to perform services as a nurse under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the component of the Department of Justice which makes the determination under the Act on whether to grant visa petitions to petitioners seeking the admission of nonimmigrant nurses under H&hyph;1A visas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Layoff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any involuntary separation of one or more staff nurses without cause/prejudice. If a staff nurse is separated from one specialized activity and is offered retraining and retention at the same facility in another activity involving direct patient care at the same wage and status, but refuses such training and retention, such separation shall not constitute a layoff. The layoff provision applies to staff nurses only, not to other health occupations. If the position occupied by the staff nurse is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement definition of ``layoff'' (if any) shall apply to that position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lockout <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a labor dispute involving a work stoppage, wherein an employer withholds work from its employees in order to gain a concession from them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nurse <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a person who is or will be authorized by a State Board of Nursing to engage in registered nursing practice in a State or U.S. territory or possession at a facility which provides health care services. A staff nurse means a nurse who provides nursing care directly to patients. In order to qualify under this definition of ``nurse'' the alien shall: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice nursing in the country where the alien obtained nursing education, or have received nursing education in the United States or Canada; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Have passed the examination given by the Commission on Graduates for Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS), or have obtained a full and unrestricted (permanent) license to practice as a registered nurse in the state of intended employment, or have obtained a full and unrestricted (permanent) license in any state or territory of the United States and received temporary authorization to practice as a registered nurse in the state of intended employment; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Be fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to practice as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States, and be authorized under such laws to be employed by the employer. For purposes of this paragraph, the temporary or interim licensing may be obtained immediately after the alien enters the United States and registers to take the first available examination for permanent licensure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Charges have a big impact on returns - Research reveals that, over the long term, you actually pay more in commission if you opt for a series of single premium payments, rather than a regular-premium plan / How to buy it? MOST INVESTORS automatically take a hard look at a provider's performance record before parting with their cash, but it is now widely recognised that life office management charges and commission paid to advisers also have a significant impact on the overall return. Unfortunately, with most personal pension plans it is not easy to work out what you are being charged. Much will depend on the way you pay for your advice and the choice of premium arrangement. Advisers come in various guises, but the majority still work on a commission basis whereby they are remunerated by the provider on the sale of a product. The amount of the commission will depend on the product type, the investment term, the level of contribution, and whether this is paid on a regular basis or as a single premium. Commission rates have gone up by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent since 1989 when the Maximum Commissions Agreement (MCA) was abandoned. The MCA was an agreement between providers to set a maximum ceiling for commission to independent advisers, to encourage them to select products on merit rather than on remuneration. Since the MCA's demise in 1989, many life offices have also abandoned the 10-year limit on renewal commission and now pay this throughout the entire term. Renewal commission is relatively modest compared with initial commission, but nevertheless adds to your total costs. Regular premiums - whether monthly or annual - make good sense, because they establish a savings discipline for those with regular earnings. However, once agreed, the premium level must be adhered to, otherwise you might face penalties. Single premiums suit the self-employed or those with erratic earnings who do not want to lock into a regular payment commitment. One of the common mistakes investors make is to assume that it is always 'cheaper' to pay single premiums, since these contributions attract a commission rate of 5.2 per cent. But it is important to remember that this deduction is made on every premium, whereas the commission costs of regular plans only appear higher because the bulk of the payment for the entire term is paid up-front and therefore has a dramatic affect on your early contributions. The commission on a regular-premium plan, whether monthly or annual, is usually paid to the adviser as a lump sum when the sale is made. The provider then recoups this amount from your premiums during an 'initial' period of up to 27 months on long-term pension plans. Typically, this can account for 60 per cent or more of premiums paid during this period; which is why, if you terminate your plan early, the pot is virtually empty. However, after the initial period, ongoing costs should be very modest. Research by Professional Life reveals that, over the long term, you will actually pay more in commission if you opt for a series of single premium payments. Take, for example, a Pounds 100 per month or Pounds 1,200 a year regular-premium plan, and compare it with a series of single premiums of Pounds 1,200 a year. All result in a total investment of Pounds 48,000 after 40 years. For the regular-premium method, the total commission after 40 years is Pounds 2,010, whereas the single-premium route pays total commission of Pounds 2,496 after this period. As a percentage of your total investment, the single-premium commission works out at 5.2 per cent, while the regular-premium commission works out at approximately 4.2 per cent. So, if you intend to stick with a personal pension plan, don't automatically assume it is better value to go the single-premium route. However, what you have to remember about the regular-premium plan is that, for any given term, you actually pay most of the total commission during the 'initial period', so your initial deductions are very high. Jim Roberts, general manager at Professional Life, suggested that investors should make their decisions in two separate stages: 'First, you need to decide how you want to invest. For example, do you need the discipline of regular premiums, or would a series of single premiums suit you better? Only when you have made that decision should you consider how you are going to pay for the advice and look at how to achieve the best value.' For the average investor, Mr Roberts reckons regular monthly premium arrangements are the safer approach. He explained: 'The important benefit of regular plans is what's known as 'pound cost averaging'. Since your premiums continue to be invested when unit prices are low, you benefit from the cheaper costs, and this helps offset the higher price of units when the stock market is booming. Single-premium payments must be timed carefully, to avoid the common mistake of only investing when the stock market is doing well.' Once you have decided the frequency with which you want to pay your premiums, you can look at the various ways of paying for your advice. Each method has its drawbacks and should be discussed in full with your adviser. Fee-based advice is growing in popularity, because it separates the giving of advice from the sale of a product. However, fees usually attract a VAT charge, while commission does not. Also, since commission is deducted from your premiums, it benefits from the tax relief awarded to all contributions to approved pension plans. Clearly there is no tax relief on fees. A minority of providers, like Professional Life, allow the adviser and client to determine a fee and then deduct this in the form of commission to avoid the VAT and tax-relief problems. Some advisers are prepared to rebate part of the commission paid by the provider. However, these payments can cause tax problems, and many advisers recommend that their client reinvests the commission they have agreed to forego, to avoid this complication. Of course, the commission to the adviser is only one of your costs when you sign up for a personal pension. Life office charges can be considerable, and unfortunately in most cases are virtually impossible to assess. Clive Grimley, senior manager at actuaries and fee based advisers Gissings, said: 'There is a whole range of charges to take into account. For example, the bid/offer spread which knocks about 5 per cent off your fund. Then there are 'initial', or 'capital', units, which account for the first few years' premiums and on which higher charges are levied throughout the term of the policy. On top of that, there are annual management charges, policy charges, membership charges, fund management charges . . . the list goes on and on.' So what can the consumer do to avoid the worst excesses of the system? The most important point is to get expert advice, to help you select a policy that is good value as well as flexible when it comes to early retirement without penalty, for example. Above all, however you plan to pay for your advice, make sure your adviser is truly independent and has enough expertise to conduct research on all the top providers. The adviser should be conversant with each provider's charging structure and should be able to strike up a deal to offset some of the charges and, where appropriate, to reinvest commission or arrange non-commission terms.</p>

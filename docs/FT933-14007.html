			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions cool on Smith deal for Labour reforms LEADING trade unions yester-day gave a frosty reception to the deal Mr John Smith has proposed for reforming Labour's union links, highlighting the difficulties he still faces in avoiding a row at September's party conference. Although Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU transport union, and Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, were careful not to deliberately re-fuel their confrontation with the Labour leader, it was clear that they were unhappy with a deal Mr Smith reached on Wednesday. Mr Edmonds is under pressure particularly from 'moderniser' Labour MPs to compromise, because of the damaging impact of the confrontation on Labour's image. He faced angry protests at a meeting of Labour MPs on Wednesday night. One said the level of personal bitterness had been 'extraordinary'. Mr Smith has expressed delight at proposals drawn up by Labour's internal union links committee on reforming leadership elections, the selection of parliamentary candidates, and on the 'block vote' at Labour conferences. Yesterday Mr Smith predicted a 'gathering of support' around the plans which will be discussed by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee on Monday. Labour officials and MPs were hopeful that enough union votes would swing behind the Labour leader to avoid a potentially damaging conference defeat. Among Mr Smith's main union opponents, there was a recognition that he had compromised a little, particularly on the election of future party leaders where 'individual' union members would continue to have a vote in a reformed electoral college. But there was bitterness at what was seen as an attempt by Mr Smith to bounce unions into accepting a deal. Mr Morris said reports of an agreement with the unions were 'not true' and that for union links with Labour to be 'properly maintained' there had to be 'a genuine opportunity for the voice of trade unions to be collectively expressed in all important decisions, including the selection of parliamentary candidates'. He added: 'It is our view that the proposals emanating from the working group fall well short of this principle.' The GMB is not opposed to all parts of Mr Smith's reforms, but it objects particularly to his proposal that unions should pay a membership fee, in addition to the political levy, in order to become 'registered' union members entitled to vote when constituency parties select candidates. There is scope for compromise over the summer, however, because the GMB backs the idea of a register of Labour-supporting union members. A deal could be struck on Mr Smith's definition of a 'register' and on the extra fee that union members would have to pay.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. CKB-Malaysia is a subsidiary of CKB. Until recently, CKB provided custody services for Investment Companies holding Malaysian securities in its branches in Malaysia. A recently adopted Malaysian law requires banking institutions operating in Malaysia to be locally incorporated. To comply with this legislation, CKB transferred substantially all of the assets, liabilities, and personnel of its Malaysian branches to CKB-Malaysia. CKB-Malaysia is regulated as a banking institution under Malaysian law by Bank Negara Malaysia, the Central Bank of Malaysia. As of June 1, 1994, the shareholders' equity of CKB-Malaysia was approximately U.S. $100 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Legal Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 17(f) requires every registered management investment company to place and maintain its securities and similar investments in the custody of certain enumerated entities, including ``banks'' having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $500,000. Section 2(a)(5) defines ``bank'' to include (i) A banking institution organized under the laws of the United States, (ii) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, and (iii) any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any state or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is supervised and examined by state or federal authority having supervision over banks, and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Rule 17f&hyph;5 provides that an Investment Company may place and maintain in the care of an ``eligible foreign custodian'' the Investment Company's foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents in amounts reasonably necessary to effect the Investment Company's foreign securities transactions. The term ``eligible foreign custodian'' is defined in rule 17f&hyph;5(c)(2) to include a foreign bank that is regulated as such by the government (or an agency thereof) of the country where the bank is organized and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200,000,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. CKB meets the requirements for Eligible Foreign Custodian since it has shareholders' equity well in excess of U.S. $200,000,000, is organized and existing under the laws of a country other than the United States (Singapore) and is regulated as a bank under the laws of Singapore. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. CKB-Malaysia also satisfies the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 insofar as it is a banking institution incorporated or organized under the laws of a country other than the United States and is regulated as such by that country's government or an agency thereof. CKB-Malaysia, with shareholder's equity of approximately $100 million, however, does not meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement of rule 17f&hyph;5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. CKB seeks an order under section 6(c) exempting (i) CKB, (ii) any Investment Company and (iii) any custodian for such Investment Company from the provisions of section 17(f) of the Act to permit the deposit and custody of Foreign Securities (as defined below), cash, and cash equivalents in Malaysia with CKB-Malaysia. ``Foreign Securities'' includes (i) Securities issued and sold primarily outside the United States by a foreign government, a national of any foreign country, or a corporation or other organization incorporated or organized under the laws of any foreign country and (ii) securities issued or guaranteed by the government of the United States or by any state or any political subdivision thereof or by any agency thereof or by any entity organized under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof which have been issued and sold primarily outside the United States. Foreign Securities, cash, and cash equivalents are defined collectively as ``Assets.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. CKB represents that CKB-Malaysia is well-qualified to provide custodial services for Investment Company Assets. As the successor to the business of CKB's Malaysia branches, CKB-Malaysia subsumed the personnel and functions of those branches. CKB represents that, under the foreign custody arrangements proposed above, the protection afforded the assets of Investment Companies held by CKB-Malaysia would not be diminished from the protection afforded by rule 17f&hyph;5 if the assets were held in the direct custody of CKB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CKB agrees that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The foreign custody arrangements proposed with respect to CKB-Malaysia will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 in all respects other than with regard to the shareholders' equity of CKB-Malaysia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Assets held in custody for U.S. management investment companies or their custodians will be maintained in CBK-Malaysia only in accordance with an agreement (``Delegation Agreement'') required to remain in effect at all times during which CKB-Malaysia fails to satisfy all the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 pursuant to which CKB would undertake to provide specified custodial or subcustodial services and delegate to CKB-Malaysia such of CKB's duties and obligations as would be necessary to permit CKB-Malaysia to hold in custody in Malaysia Assets of U.S. investment companies. The Delegation Agreement among CKB, CKB-Malaysia, and a U.S. investment company or its custodian would further provide that CKB's delegation of duties to CKB-Malaysia would not relieve CKB of any responsibility to a U.S. investment company for which CKB serves as custodian or to a custodian for which CKB serves as a subcustodian for any loss due to such delegation, except such loss as may result from political risk (e.g., exchange control restrictions, confiscation, expropriation, nationalization, insurrection, civil strife, or armed hostilities) or other risks of loss (excluding bankruptcy or insolvency of CKB-Malaysia) for which neither CKB nor CKB-Malaysia would be liable under rule 17f&hyph;5 (e.g., despite the exercise of reasonable care, acts of God, and the like). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. CKB currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders' equity requirement set forth in rule 17f&hyph;5(c)(2)(i). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 10 Jun (PL) -- Mexican and Cuban sources  have affirmed that Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's  agenda during his visit to Cuba on 13 June will be intense and  multifaceted, with an emphasis on political issues.    Salinas will arrive in this capital on Monday, 1100 local  time, where he will devote most of his time to an interview with  Cuban President Fidel Castro. With Castro, he will engage in an  overall analysis of the bilateral political, economic, cultural,  and trade relations, a high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry  official indicated.    Jorge Bolanos, deputy foreign relations minister, emphasized  in an interview with PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' presence in  Cuba represents the continuation of relations that historically  have been maintained at a high level. Bolanos, who counts on a  30-year diplomatic career, also highlighted the independent  nature of Mexico's foreign policy and the priority Cuba puts in  these relations.    Bolanos disclosed that the preparatory mission of Mexican  officials, led by General Director of Protocol Ricardo Ampudia,  has concluded its meeting with the local Foreign Ministry,  during which they agreed that the visit should concentrate on  the official conversations of both high-level delegations.    He highlighted the importance of Salinas' presence in Cuba  at  a time when the United States is attempting to reinforce the  economic blockade, considering this a sign of political  willingness on the part of Mexican authorities to reaffirm their  relations with the Island and to continue developing these in  the future.    Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello Macias gave a  similar  opinion, emphasizing that the conversations at the highest  levels between both nations will be intense and multifaceted.  New ideas and initiatives will emerge from this dialogue to  continue the momentum of bilateral ties, Tello told PRENSA  LATINA.    Another important aspect of the dialogue between the  presidents of Cuba and Mexico will be the exchange of points of  view on the Ibero-American summit to be held on 14-15 June in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Mexico was the only Latin  American nation that decided to maintain its relations with Cuba  in 1962 when the OAS ruled, under Washington's pressure, to have  its member nations break ties with the Island.</p>

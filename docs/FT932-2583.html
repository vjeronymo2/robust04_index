			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Foreign chip share falls in Japan THE foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market declined slightly in the first quarter to 19.6 per cent, down from an all-time high of 20.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, according to data released yesterday by the US and Japanese governments. Foreign market share is the primary measure used by the US to determine Japan's compliance with a 1991 bilateral trade agreement in which Japan 'recognised the expectations' of the US semiconductor industry that foreign market share should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of 1992. US government and semiconductor industry officials said that they would continue to press Japan for improvements in market access, using market share as the 'measureable indicator' of progress. Despite the decline in market share, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, welcomed the first quarter figure as a demonstration that the fourth quarter 1992 jump in market share from 15.9 per cent to 20.2 per cent 'was not just a one quarter aberration.' Mr Kantor repeated his view that 'it is reasonable to expect that foreign market share will average 20 per cent over the next four quarters of 1993, at a minimum'. US semiconductor industry officials expressed some disappointment, however, in the first quarter market share drop. 'Any decline in foreign market share is cause for concern,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a US industry trade group. 'It is clear that there is still considerable work to be done by government and industry to achieve the steady progress required by the semiconductor agreement,' Mr Procassini added. In Tokyo, however, the Electronics Industry Association of Japan, rejected the US view of market share goals. 'We will keep working to fulfil the purpose (of the semiconductor agreement),' said Mr Hidehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of Toshiba and vice chairman of the EIAJ's committee of users of foreign semiconductors. But he said the EIAJ 'could not accept' the US demand for an average 20 per cent foreign market share throughout 1993. 'Fluctuations in foreign market share figures should not sway sentiments toward satisfaction or disappointment,' said Mr Yoshida. He noted that market share data was influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions in Japan, exchange rates and the supply capabilities of foreign semiconductor manufacturers.</p>

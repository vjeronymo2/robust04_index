The minister added that she believes there is great  confusion  with respect to that issue which needs to be clarified. There  was an initiative that entailed several trips to Europe and  North and South America by various government representatives to  explain the progress made in Guatemala with respect to human  rights and the peace negotiations.    According to the minister, these trips, which were  mistakenly  called a "diplomatic offensive," did not materialize due to  several reasons. First of all, the human rights issue will be  the object of an in-depth analysis during the 50th Ordinary  Session of the UN Human Rights Commission currently taking place  in Geneva, which will be attended by an official government  delegation. What better way than for the Guatemala delegation  to take advantage of that opportunity to discuss the issue along  with the other delegations and expand more on what has already  been covered by our ambassadors at the respective foreign  ministries.    Second, the cost of a huge tour such as the one that had  been  organized represented too high an expense for the Guatemalan  Government. In addition, it meant duplicating efforts by our  delegation in Geneva as well as our embassies in the different  nations.    Having taken this into consideration, it was decided to  specifically undertake trips aimed at presenting the new peace  negotiation framework that resulted from the last meeting in  Mexico City. Of course, plans for these new trips are much more  modest than the previous ones. In most cases, the "delegation"  will be made up of one member of the peace delegation, except in  one case where two members of the peace delegation will  participate. In every case they will be accompanied by our  ambassadors accredited in each capital. As can be seen, the new  official tour has been reduced to the strictly necessary, and  the cost has also been cut dramatically.    Finally, the minister indicated that using the term  "offensive" together with the description of "diplomatic" is not  the most appropriate since an offensive seeks to attack, or  assault. Diplomatic task consist of exactly the opposite: to  convince and explain. The two terms do not go well together.  <H5>  Will Not Establish "Priorities" </H5>   With respect to publications indicating that priority status  will be given to diplomatic relations, Foreign Minister Ruiz  Vielman stated: "In modern international relations it is not  only inappropriate but also very difficult to classify  countries. On a bilateral level a country may not be of much  importance. However, at a multilateral level that same country  can acquire much importance, thus grading could be ill-suited."    According to the minister, where Guatemala does establish a  priority order is with respect to issues included in the  international agenda. The intensity and extent of the current  international context imposes an agenda which must be met in an  orderly manner in order to concentrate on those issues more  relevant to our political, economic, social, and cultural  development. Issues such as the Central American integration  process and the new regional and sub-regional integration  framework; the expansion of markets for our products and  commercial negotiations; Guatemala's projection within the  multilateral system with the objective of taking advantage of  political, economic, and cooperation opportunities that are  opening as a result of group or block negotiations; and taking  utmost advantage of existent sources of international  cooperation; among others constitute priority issues included in  the Foreign Ministry work agenda.  <H5>  Human Rights </H5>   With regard to the State Department's report on the human  rights situation in Guatemala in 1993, Minister Ruiz said that  in general the government hopes the international community will  recognize the advances made in the Guatemalan sociopolitical  process, including the human rights issue.    She stressed that the Guatemalan Government cannot and will  not ignore the problem by expecting the structure of violence  that continued for decades to disappear spontaneously overnight.  In fact, she added, the Guatemalan Government recognizes that  there are still some problems that must be resolved in order to  guarantee full respect for the Guatemalan people's human,  political, social, economic, and cultural rights. At the same  time, however, it feels that the efforts conducted by Guatemalan  society as a whole, and particularly by the government headed by  President de Leon, to protect those rights should also be  recognized.    Minister Ruiz finally said: "The Guatemalan situation is the  result of a transition process we are currently experiencing, in  which the former authoritarian and arbitrary structures are  being replaced by new democratic regulations in accordance with  the state of law we are building. It is not exclusively a  political matter, as it involves social and cultural aspects.  In reviewing the situation, we must take into consideration  general trends -- which in the case of human rights are positive  -- and the political decisions made on the subject. There is no  doubt about the final objective of the process. Within the  framework of democracy, we must guarantee total respect for the  human rights of all Guatemalans, without any discrimination.  What we need from the international community is their support  to consolidate the new democratic structures we are determined  to build.</p>

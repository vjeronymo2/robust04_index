			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Exxon guilty of oil spill recklessness: Company may face up to Dollars 15bn damages Exxon was found guilty yesterday of recklessness over the worst US oil spill, at Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989. The decision, in a federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, exposed it to punitive damages of up to Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn). The jury also found against Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which ran aground shortly after leaving the port of Valdez. The verdict yesterday wiped 4 per cent off Exxon's share price, cutting the market value of the biggest US company by more than Dollars 3bn. Its shares closed at Dollars 59 5/8 , down Dollars 2 5/8 on the day. During the trial, which began six weeks ago, it was claimed Mr Hazelwood was drunk on the evening of the disaster and that Exxon had known for a long time of his drinking problem. Mr Hazelwood testified he had been treated for alcohol abuse in 1985, and Exxon, while aware of this, had allowed him to return to sea without monitoring. At the time of the accident, he had gone below deck, leaving a third mate in command on the bridge. He denied being drunk, but admitted he had been drinking shortly before the ship left Valdez. The recklessness verdict opens the way for a further phase of the trial this summer. The same jury will consider the scale of punitive damages to be paid by the company. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who include 10,000 fishermen and local land-owners, have asked punitive damages to be set at Dollars 15bn, ten times the scale of the damages they are claiming. Exxon said it would argue in court it should not be forced to pay punitive damages. Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon chairman, said the company believed 'the evidence presented in the next phases of the trial, showing what Exxon has already spent and done, will convincingly demonstrate that no award of punitive damages should be made.' At an earlier stage in the legal proceedings, the trial judge rejected an application by Exxon it should not have to disclose its financial wealth to the jury before they decided on the scale of any damages. Hearings to assess these are expected in about a month. Before then, the jury will consider claims for actual damages against the company. The Valdez disaster has already cost Exxon about Dollars 3.5bn. It paid Dollars 1.1bn to settle federal and state charges, more than Dollars 2bn to cleanse the contaminated coastline and Dollars 300m to settle civil claims voluntarily.</p>

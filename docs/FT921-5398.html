			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / BTR drops plan to create global engineering business BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, has dropped plans to create a global electrical engineering business in the wake of its victory last November in the Pounds 1.5bn takeover of Hawker Siddeley. BTR's plan to form such a business, with worldwide annual sales of Pounds 750m, surfaced during the closing stages of the fiercely contested bid battle. At the time, Hawker executives derided the plan's logic. In their first interview since capturing Hawker, BTR executives said senior Hawker managers had persuaded them not to merge the company's electric motors, transformers, switchgear and railway signalling businesses. The proposal had also been met by City scepticism during the bid. Mr Robert Faircloth, BTR's new chief operating officer who is supervising the integration of Hawker, said: 'We took poetic licence to change our mind on some of these things.' He now believes that large electric motors, transformers and switchgears form a coherent business. Signalling and other railway electrical equipment will stay in the rail business, because of the shared customer base. BTR says that rail is one area where it feels it will be necessary to form a 'strategic alliance' with another big group to survive in the competitive world market. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, angrily denied a recent report that he was still considering selling Hawker's rail equipment division to Siemens, the German electrical group. Hawker had reached an advanced stage in talks regarding the sale of its rail business to Siemens. As part of its defence, Hawker unveiled plans to sell 60 per cent of its business and focus on three core operations - aerospace, electric motors and batteries. Mr Jackson said BTR was not discussing with anyone the disposal of any Hawker assets, adding: 'The damage this sort of report has done to morale inside the company is considerable.' Mr Faircloth said he still had an open mind as to whether any business would be sold. Mr Jackson suggested that BTR might end up retaining more than the 80 per cent of Hawker as mooted during the takeover. BTR achieved much of its success in the 1980s through rigorous profit planning and has moved quickly to inform Hawker companies of its profits record and expectations. Mr Faircloth said many of Hawker's businesses were still losing money and would need to shed many jobs, a process which had already started. He declined to give specific figures before BTR's annual results next Wednesday. Mr Faircloth paid tribute to the positive attitude of Hawker staff following the takeover. But, he said: 'The message had to go across that a large organisation with great turnover, but generating no profit, is a meaningless situation as far as BTR goes.'</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> REACTION TO WETLANDS AGREEMENT EXPECTED  </P> <P> A delegation of preservationists, developers and local officials hope to get  their first hint next week of whether federal regulators are likely to go along  with a compromise to end 15 years of fighting over the Bolsa Chica wetlands.  </P> <P> The coalition reached a broad agreement last May for restoring 1,000 acres of  coastal saltwater marsh near Huntington Beach and, at the same time, permitting  construction of thousands of homes along the environmentally sensitive  coastline. The plan must be approved by the Environmental Protection Agency,  which has generally prohibited development in wetlands areas.  </P> <P> While allowing residential development on about 80 acres of wetland, the  proposal would provide Orange County with one of the largest restored wetland  preserves in the state. Environmentalists say the preserve, along the Pacific  Coast Highway south of Warner Avenue, would be a critical nesting and breeding  area for birds from as far away as Alaska and South America.  </P> <P> "We have agreed to the plan because we have seen the overall benefits," said  Adrianne Morrison, executive director of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an  environmental group that has fought to preserve the wetlands. "We have all  compromised. This is the best offer. . . . I think the (Environmental  Protection) agency has its rules but they certainly have the ability to be  flexible."  </P> <P> Morrison is among eight leaders in the Bolsa Chica compromise who have  scheduled a series of meetings Tuesday in Washington with federal regulators,  White House staffers and members of the California congressional delegation.  </P> <P> Formal federal approval for the compromise is a lengthy process not expected to  be completed before the end of next year. But the local coalition hopes to find  out next week whether regulators at the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA are  likely to look favorably on the plan. Under the proposal, Signal Landmark  Corp., the principal landowner and developer, would make significant  concessions to environmentalists. Signal, which bought the property in 1970,  had planned a huge waterfront residential community with a 1,400-slip marina,  restaurants, hotels and a channel to the ocean deep enough for boats to  navigate.  </P> <P> The current proposal eliminates the channel, the marina and all commercial  development. It also reduces the residential construction, setting aside 51  acres for a park.  </P> <P> Proponents point out that the proposal would establish 1,000 acres of wetlands,  more than the 927 acres the EPA has said must be maintained. An additional 105  acres would be protected from development as environmentally sensitive or  open-space, buffer areas.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping it will help us get some idea of how they feel about this plan. I'm  saying hoping," said Darlene Shelley, Signal vice president for governmental  relations.  </P> <P> The plan must also be approved by state and local agencies, including the  Orange County Board of Supervisors and the California Coastal Commission. The  coalition is still working out details, but members said they hope to present a  formal proposal to the board by early next year.  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriet M. Wieder, who helped put together the coalition, is a key  advocate of the plan.  </P> <P> "We believe our efforts will be a role model for the rest of the country,"  Wieder said.  </P> <P> "At the end of next year we want to see it off and going. I can't be any more  definitive than that right now. We're just starting to crawl." ROSE ELLEN  O'CONNOR  </P></p>

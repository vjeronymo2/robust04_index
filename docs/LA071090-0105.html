			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: DEAR GENA AND BEN: WE LOVED YOU IN 'LOVE LETTERS'  </P> <P> There is nothing like an authentic phenomenon to pep up the idea of  theatergoing, and A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters" is an authentic,  no-question-about-it phenomenon and hit. It reaches its 100th performance this  week at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills, with Michael Tucker and Jill  Eikenberry as the latest in a long procession of couples who have read Gurney's  mail.  </P> <P> Last week it was Gena Rowlands and her old comrade-in-craft from her late  husband John Cassavetes' films, Ben Gazzara, playing Melissa and Andy. Their  performances concluded Sunday night. Rowlands, who has Academy Award  nominations under her belt for "A Woman Under the Influence" and "Gloria" and  almost every other acting honor you can think of, foreign and domestic, had  done the Gurney play once before, a single offering aboard a cruise ship.  </P> <P> After Friday night's sold-out performance, Gazzara said, "I read the text for  the first time last Sunday night on the plane flying back from Rome so I could  do it with this great lady." Gazzara has an arm's-long list of stage and screen  credits from "End as a Man" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" to "A Letter to Three  Wives" and Cassavetes' "Husbands." He was mastering the character of Matt while  performing him, and his portrayal at week's end was strong and sure.  </P> <P> The staged reading is not unprecedented. You think of Paul Gregory's touring  productions of Stephen Vincent Benet's "John Brown's Body" and Shaw's "Don Juan  in Hell" with Charles Laughton and other stars. Two-character plays are not  unprecedented either, and "Two for the Seesaw" shines in memory.  </P> <P> But the novelty of a fast-rotating cast is unprecedented, so far as I know, and  the sight of two actors reading from three-ring notebooks at an inlaid  refectory table on an otherwise bare stage will look unprecedented.  </P> <P> For the actor and actress, the nature of the play is a real and testing  challenge. They are denied the use of body language, which is like playing  quarterback with your ankles lashed together or trying to zip up a zipper with  one hand. The acting has to be all voice and eyes -- and the uses of silence.  </P> <P> Gurney's silences -- the letters not answered -- are as eloquent as anything  this side of Harold Pinter. "Love Letters," as must by now be known by everyone  who cares about the stage at all, follows the relationship of Andrew Makepeace  Ladd III and Melissa Gardner from grade school through the next half-century of  their lives: their lives apart, rather more than together, so that we hear  their letters, which are childish, petulant, funny, snappish, pleading,  apologetic, concealing, revealing, sexy, defensive, eloquent and, in the end,  very affecting indeed in the pain and disappointment they disclose.  </P> <P> Gurney's structure is clever, but his success with it is magical. Having  laughed a very great deal in the course of the evening, you are first  astonished and then moved to realize how much you have learned about these two  people, and how much you care.  </P> <P> They come out of a world that John O'Hara knew and wrote about, the  Manhattan-Connecticut-Ivy League-Seven Sisters-Wall Street world of the quite  rich and the even richer. The riches lead in Andy's case to a kind of driving  ambition that seems motivated equally by noblesse oblige, conformity and a  liking for power for its own sake.  </P> <P> In Melissa's case, the riches lead to rebellion against and resignation to the  expectations of class (both responses equally unsatisfactory). The ultimate  perception is that money is an inadequate consolation prize for whatever you  really wanted and didn't get.  </P> <P> Unlike the poor-little-rich-girl and poor-little-rich-boy romances, comedic and  otherwise, of the Broadway-Hollywood past, Gurney's boy/man and girl/woman are  too real and individual to be enjoyed and then dismissed as merely fictional  types. In "Love Letters," one sees the hurt beneath his stuffiness and her  caustic impudence. Their autumnal awareness that things have not worked out  quite as they imagined and that time has slipped away from them is much closer  to Chekhov than to Culver City.  </P> <P> These characters don't float out of mind as you leave the foyer -- not as Ben  Gazzara and Gena Rowlands delineated them, and not, I'm sure, as the other  castings have enacted them, either.  </P> <P> It's true, of course, that there are as many Hamlets as there are actors (and,  indeed, actresses) who have played him. I suspect, having seen only the  Gazzara-Rowlands casting, that Andy and Melissa change subtly but interestingly  with each new team. It is a tribute to the text's powers of implication, and to  the powers of the performers.  </P> <P> As is also well-known to the faithful, Gurney himself played Andy, with Pamela  Hammond as Melissa, in the first trying of "Love Letters" at the Long Wharf in  New Haven. John Rubinstein and Kathleen Turner were the initial Manhattan  teaming in February of 1989. Since then, in productions here and elsewhere  around the country, Andy and Melissa have been played by a Who's Who of  American stage and screen. Given the SRO business at the Canon, it seems likely  there will be dozens more castings to come.  </P> <P> Film actors particularly must relish the in-and-out short runs, ideal for brief  hiatuses. But, at any length of run, the chance to speak A. R. Gurney's  wonderful lines (and be eloquent sitting motionless) is a challenge no actor  can really resist.  </P> <P> One day there will surely be an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for  whoever can prove they have seen the most changes of cast. I'm off to a slow  start, and I can't imagine being more moved by a Melissa than Miss Rowlands',  but I also can't imagine seeing "Love Letters" only once.  </P></p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Dispatches: Orphans of the Afghan storm ON THE day that Dr Najibullah, the former Afghan president, was deposed from power in Kabul, Bagher Odrat, headmaster of an Afghan 'orphanage' in former Soviet Tajikistan, was faced with a dilemma. Should he take down the portraits of Najibullah that plastered the walls of this remote institution several hundred kilometres from Afghanistan? Or should he leave them as a memento to the regime that had now collapsed? 'Normally, of course, we would take them down,' he says, sitting in his shabby office, nervously sipping green tea from a bowl. Outside the window a gaggle of rainsoaked Afghan children go back and forth across the yard. 'After all, everything has changed,' he adds melodramatically. But the problem, he explains, is the children. When the black and white Najibullah photos disappeared from their classrooms, they staged a rebellion: one by one they had picked up the photos and pinned them back on the walls. 'These children have grown up loving Najibullah and 'grandpa' Lenin . . .It is difficult to explain to them.' admits Odrat with a wry shrug. In the coming months Odrat will have a lot more explaining to do. For the ramshackle orphanage he presides over, in the depths of the Tajik countryside, is no ordinary one. Set up for Afghan children back in the early days of Soviet power in Afghanistan, for more than ten years it has been training - or indoctrinating - a generation of Sovietised Afghan children. The Soviets claimed that this has been done for humanitarian reasons. Every year scores of illiterate 'orphans' have been brought from war ridden corners of Afghanistan to orphanages such asOdrat's. Once behind the blue and white orphanage walls, they have been receiving an intensive communist education - an education that was designed, Odrat says, to transform them into doctors, engineers and teachers, ready to serve Soviet Afghanistan. According to anti-Soviet Afghan Mujahideen, the real role of these orphanages has been rather more sinister. They believe these orphanages have been training the children - most of whom were not orphans anyway  - as spies and soldiers. Either way, the collapse of the regime in Afghanistan has left the 'orphans' looking like yet another sad casualty of the Afghan war. For, after ten years of exile from their native Afghanistan, these Najibullah-loving children are now under pressure to return to 'home', as the money to support the orphanages fast runs out. 'When I think about it, I feel a little scared,' admits Farhod, a 12-year-old from Badakhshan, the mountainous province in the east of Afghanistan. Like many children there, he is not a real orphan, but was sent eight years ago by his father, a colonel in the Soviet-backed army. He is not sure if his father is still alive. But he recently received a letter from a cousin, asking him to return to Badakhshan. 'I'd rather stay here and become a doctor,' he says slowly, chewing incessantly on a grimy piece of bubblegum. With his tattered tracksuit and gap-toothed smile, he seems an unlikely candidate for a surgeon - or spy. His friend, seven-year-old Rasul, is rather more forthcoming: 'When I grow up I want to drive a tank, with a big gun that goes 'boom]' he says with a lisp. Across the muddy courtyard, dotted with placards proclaiming 'Peace to the World]', Sadiqa has more practical matters on her mind. Her father, a bank clerk, has also suddenly resurfaced - and asked her to go 'home.' However, she fears that back in Kabul she will have to wear a veil. Up until now she has always dressed in so called 'Russian clothes' - cheap, acrylic blouses and skirts. 'We are trying to prepare them to return home, to tell them about their culture,' explains Elena, a Russian teacher. As the school's official 'history' teacher, she used to drill the pupils in the principles of Marxism. Now, along with some Tajik teachers, she has been co-opted into the incongruous task of teaching the Koran. 'Afghanistan is now a Moslem regime - the children have to prepare for that. They cannot live in Russia,' she adds, standing in a classroom that was recently converted into a tiny mosque. Along the corridor, Russian language signs are being replaced by the Persian script. A mural titled 'Communist heroes of the Afghan army' has been discretely covered by pastel coloured posters describing the wildlife of Asia. And plans are afoot, she says, to take down the ten foot high painting of 'grandpa' Lenin frolicking with lambs and children in a flower-strewn meadow. But what about Najibullah? I asked cautiously, looking at a dour poster of the man who Mujahideen groups are vying to kill. She smiled uncertainly. Maybe he would be removed next month, she mumbled - or, at least, when the children weren't looking.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRM HOPES CLEAN AIR LAW WILL LIFT SALES;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: STRUGGLING POLLUTION RESEARCH AND CONTROL CORP. EXPECTS THE NEW  FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR ITS EMISSIONS MONITORING DEVICES.  </P> <P> Pollution Research and Control Corp. is a tiny Glendale company that makes  devices for monitoring air pollution. Since it was founded in 1971, its success  in the U.S. market had been limited, so in 1988 Pollution Research turned to  overseas markets -- particularly South Korea -- which recently have accounted  for more than half of its sales.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the Korean market has proved an unsteady one for Pollution  Research, and in the year that ended June 30, the company lost $1.45 million on  $5.4 million in revenues. Not only were South Korean sales slipping, the same  was true for domestic sales.  </P> <P> But with the new federal clean air act, signed Thursday by President Bush,  Pollution Research stands to participate in what could be a bonanza for  companies that make pollution control and measurement products. These products  will be needed by government agencies and factories to measure emissions of  sulfur dioxide and other pollutants from smokestacks and in the surrounding  air.  </P> <P> "We see a very positive impact," said Albert E. Gosselin Jr., Pollution  Research's president and chief executive. Gosselin estimated that the  legislation could result over the next year in a more than $2-million jump in  the company's sales.  </P> <P> Gosselin said specific provisions in the legislation that will most directly  help his company are those concerning acid rain. Pollution Research's monitors  measure sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen -- two of the key components of  acid rain. Most of the electronic devices are about the size and shape of  stereo receivers, cost $4,000 to $18,000, and analyze gases using ultraviolet  light.  </P> <P> Pollution Research hopes to sell more products to its traditional customers --  mostly utilities and government agencies such as the California Air Resources  Board -- which will need the devices to monitor compliance with the new  emissions standards. Orders may also come from consulting companies that buy  the equipment on behalf of manufacturers, Gosselin said.  </P> <P> Industry analysts agree that the clean-air legislation could be a boon for  companies in the $50-million-a-year domestic air pollution-monitoring business.  "We're not just talking 20% or 30% growth here," said Stephen Schweich of Alex  Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. "The market for emissions monitoring systems is  going to expand geometrically," Schweich said.  </P> <P> But John G. Taylor, an analyst at L.H. Alton &amp; Co. in San Francisco,  cautioned that the clean-air legislation is still no guarantee that Pollution  Research will manage a turnaround.  </P> <P> "Just because the stage is set doesn't mean business is going to start walking  in the door," Taylor said. "It's a question of executing a marketing plan and  getting in front of enough people. I think the jury is still out as to whether  they can do that."  </P> <P> Pollution Research's track record has been spotty. Founded in 1971 by Gosselin,  a mechanical engineer, Pollution Research (formerly named Dasibi Environmental  Corp.) made a disastrous 1973 investment in a Colorado cattle ranch, from which  it took the company several years to recover. The company has also fought an  uphill, mostly losing, battle against its two biggest competitors.  </P> <P> That's partly because the two competitors have the resources of large  corporations to draw from. Massachusetts-based Thermo Instrument Systems is a  division of Thermo Electron, which has annual sales of $400 million. Lear  Siegler, a $2.5-billion concern, has a Colorado division that makes pollution  monitoring equipment.  </P> <P> To compete for contracts against its big rivals, Pollution Research more than  doubled its staff to 86 workers from June to December of last year. But  Gosselin said the increased overhead came at a time when domestic orders for  pollution monitoring equipment started to slow as companies waited to see what  the final clean-air legislation would contain.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, orders from South Korea's equivalent of the Environmental Protection  Agency, a big Pollution Research customer, also started to dry up.  </P> <P> Gosselin said he has taken steps to try to turn the company around, including  cutting the staff by more than half to 33 workers. He is also hoping to team up  with larger partners.  </P></p>

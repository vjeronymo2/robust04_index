			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Golyayev: "In Siberia Too an Owner </F> Must Be an Owner"]    [Text] The Russian regions belonging to the "Siberian  agreements" association have elaborated a package of proposals  for the government on changes to the foreign economic activity  mechanism.    Returning Friday evening from a routine session of this  association, in a talk with journalists First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets noted the fairness of the Siberians' demands. "They  still have no right to export or to form banks, which are all in  Moscow, particularly oil banks. The situation must be  rectified. There is nothing more terrible than the  centralization of finances. There are strong people and science  in Siberia -- an enormous potential and the world's richest  region are in such a lamentable state. There is no logic to it."    "Today over 60 percent of the regions live on subsidies from  the center. There should be a very balanced policy for  transferring powers to the localities. The management of  property locally through instructions from Moscow, as some  departments are doing, is impermissible and unnecessary. It is  property which is the main priority for local organs. The  enterprise collectives must be the genuine owners and really  feel that they are the owners. That will be both rational and  respectful with regard to people and to the labor collective  which in this instance workers for itself, for the interests of  the region, and ultimately for the state. So far," the first  vice premier stressed, "we treat property formally. I hope that  the second stage of voucher privatization will make it possible  to remove many so far unresolved questions."    "What is your attitude toward the appearance of questions in  the press asking `Who is Oleg Soskovets working for?'"    "Of course it is unpleasant but not because they have  pointed  a finger at me. Someone is trying to `make politics,' resorting  to utterly incorrect facts and interpreting them as they want."</p>

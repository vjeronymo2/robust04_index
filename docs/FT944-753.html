			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: End-year rally sees FT-SE on the verge of 3,100 - Market Report The UK market took another hard look at the 3,100 level on the FT-SE 100 but ultimately failed in its effort to break through that level, despite more good news on the domestic economy, underlying takeover speculation and renewed strength on Wall Street. The general expectation around London's trading days after the market closed was that the 100 index should manage to move through what is seen as a substantial chart level if Wall Street managed to hold the level it was trading when London dealersclosed their books for the day. But a move above 3,100 is by no means a foregone conclusion, dealers said. 'It could well be something of a trial of strength in the market, with the futures boys trying to drive the underlying market through that level; but you must remember that the Liffe market closes shortly after noon and there are stories that the market's bears could move in to sell the cash market,' said a senior marketmaker. The stockmarket remains open until the normal 4.30pm close, after a Bank of England request, apparently to provide liquidity for the gilts market. At the end of another session of keen interest in equities, the FT-SE 100 index closed 21.3 higher at 3,091.7, its highest closing level since November 21, and a rise of 148.3, or 5 per cent, since December 13. The FT-SE Mid 250 index also made rapid progress, closing 19.3 higher at 3,485.9. There was reassurance around the City's dealing rooms at the relatively high levels of customer activity still going on so close to the Christmas holiday. Turnover yesterday totalled 577.4m shares, with non-FT-SE issues providing activity in 345.7m shares, or 60 per cent of the overall figure. Wednesday's good turnover levels translated into lucrative customer business for the market with deals worth Pounds 1.65bn, well above recent daily levels and a figure given a warm welcome in the market. The securities industry has been hit by a series of small but widely publicised job losses recently and the feeling around the City of London is that the market needs a strong boost to head off what are expected to be further losses in the near future. Rumblings of substantial mergers between some of the big UK marketmaking firms and overseas firms, mainly US, have been heard for some weeks. One story doing the rounds in London was that Chase Manhattan, the US bank, could be seeking to re-establish a presence in the European/UK equity markets after its expensive foray in the wake of the Big Bang. London began the session in good form and apart from an early bout of selling pressure, which was never more than an irritant, performed strongly all day. The early thrust for the market came from the US which jumped more than 50 points at one stage before settling 34 higher. Sentiment was bolstered in mid-morning with news that the UK's balance had moved into the black to the tune of Pounds 846m in the third quarter, the first positive quarterly result since 1987. The marginal downward revision of third quarter gross domestic product, from a 0.9 per cent rise to one of 0.8 per cent, giving an annualised growth rate of plus 4.1 per cent, gave the market. no cause for concern. The good economic news and a strong opening performance by Wall Street, where the Dow showed a double-digit rise shortly after the opening and was up over 20 points two hours after London closed, provided a real boost to UK equities and drove the FT-SE 100 up more than 25 points, before it eased slightly at the close. BP, one of the UK market's great success stories over the year, approached its all-time peak, with UK institutions still trying to achieve market weightings in the stock.</p>

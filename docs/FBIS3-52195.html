The  severity of the fighting and the volume and types of arms used  show that the fighting is unprecedented since the conquest of  Kabul and the fall of Najibollah's regime. Also, the inhuman  dimensions of the fighting -- shelling of residential areas,  hospitals, and even safe areas such as embassies -- are proof  that hostilities have gone beyond their usual, controllable  state and have put Afghanistan on the brink of a new catastrophe.    The recent clashes come when diplomatic efforts are under  way  to end the internal crisis in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the  clashes plunge the horizon for peace into uncertainty.    Each of the jehadi groups considers the unfair distribution  of power in Afghanistan to be the cause of the fighting. The  Afghan Mojahedin, who successfully put a 14-year-long holy war  behind them and have managed to put on show one of the most  brilliant victories, are now finding difficulty in consolidating  sovereignty. The main Afghan difficulty in this respect is the  lack of unified leadership, which is acceptable by all parties  and groups. That problem resulted in bloody clashes right from  the beginning of the mojahedin coming to power, without the  battles putting an end to the crisis. It would seem that two  years of bloody fighting -- which have left nothing but  destruction in Afghanistan -- would be a good experience for  those political and military Afghan groups that seek to resolve  the crisis through military means.    The balance of power among the groups and the rapid change  in  alliances and coalitions prevent progress through military  means. Political analysts believe that peace and tranquillity  will not return to Kabul unless the Afghan jehadi groups put the  interests of their state and people before factional interests  and choose a peaceful path, put down their arms and arm  themselves instead with the weapon of logic, and then embark on  instituting a constitution.    The history of world movements and revolutions shows the  constitution in any state to be one of its main pillars and  guarantees its survival. The constitution must be formulated by  the votes of all the people of Afghanistan. Only in such a  situation can one hope for future peace and tranquillity there.  Therefore, if the Afghan political and military groups do not  quickly pave the way for talks in order to control the current  crisis, opportunists will impose conditions from outside on the  pretext of supporting human rights and establishing peace and  stability in Afghanistan. In that case the real loser will be  the Afghan nation and the 14-year-old aspirations of their holy  jihad will be threatened.</p>

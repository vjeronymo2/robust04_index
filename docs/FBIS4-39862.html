			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("AZG" daily), 06/11/94 -- "We solved the  problems we were to solve", said Russian Defense Minister, Army  General Pavel Grachev, summarizing on his visit to Armenia.    He left for Tbilisi on Friday. "I am leaving with very high  mood", declared Grachev. "All military problems we planned,  found a positive solution and were approved by the Armenian  President". The problem of creating Russian military bases has  also been resolved. These will be created by August 1, and  displaced in Gyumri and Yerevan.    "Armenia lives, I saw people smiling", he continued.  Speaking on his impressions, the Russian General said he was  amazed by training of internal troops in Armenia, by the  attitude to his work and by the stance.    Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan expressed his  contentment about Pavel Grachev's visit. "This was very  important and serious visit, and its main results will be  stationing of Russian military bases in Armenia, improving the  potential of republican anti-air defense and Russian troops  displaced here." According to the Minister, Russian troops will  be reinforced by helicopters and airplanes.    Going in details on creating the Russian military bases in  Armenia Serzh Sargsyan noted, this problem has been completely  resolved. "There are no unclear points left in the agreement  about the bases," he said. This agreement will be signed and  affirmed in summer, "and then we'll start its implementation."    Speaking on leasing land for the Russian bases the minister  said, the Armenian side is ready to resolve these problems in a  mutually advantageous manner. This can be paid back by training  Armenian specialists in Russian military higher education  centers, by providing free communal services to Russian troops  stationed in Armenia or otherwise, said Serzh Sargsyan. On his  opinion, Russian military bases will be created in Armenia by  September 1. Concerning the length of the agreement to be signed  he said that Armenia would like this agreement to be eternal.    In his turn, Russian Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir  Stupishin  said, Pavel Grachev's visit to Armenia was an important  political event, concerning not only military aspects. "This  visit was very important for improving our alliance with Armenia  both within the framework of the CIS collective security  agreement and on bilateral basis," said the Ambassador.    According to Russian "Novosti" TV program Grachev visited  Baku on June 11 and negotiated with the President Geydar Aliyev  about stationing a radio-location station near Gyanja.    Speaking on the TV Russian Defense Minister said, "both  sides  are accumulating forces at the borders, and therefore there is  still a long way before introduction of peace-making forces."</p>

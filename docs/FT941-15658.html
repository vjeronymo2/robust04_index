			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Kohl pledges special role for Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged a special role for Germany, because of its geography and its history, in seeking to integrate both Russia and the rest of eastern Europe into the institutions of western Europe. He suggested that both the Nato alliance and the European Union had the identical aim of including the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe in their existing communities. At the same time, he defended the slow process of moving towards full membership, implied by the Nato 'partnership for peace' programme, as essential to prevent new divisions opening up on the continent. In an apparent attempt to reassure the new east European democracies, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, Chancellor Kohl stressed the parallel process of integration into the European Union as well as into the Nato alliance as the decisive achievement of this week's Nato summit in Brussels. He recognised the security concerns of the east European democracies, and equally, the fears in Russia of being isolated or fenced in by hostile forces. 'We must not create new divisions, and thus create new tensions in Europe,' he said. 'Security and stability in Europe are indivisible. That is why disappointment or discouragement at the decisions of the Nato summit are not appropriate.' Germany had friendly relations with all the countries of eastern Europe, and with Russia, he told the German parliament. It had a particular role to play in ensuring their integration with the west, because of good neighbourliness and because of its special historical responsibility. 'We want the accession of these countries.' However, they must themselves create the necessary political and economic conditions for this to occur. Membership of the European Union also meant involvement in the common foreign and security policy of the existing member states. Future EU members could be involved in that common policy, even before their full accession to the union.</p>

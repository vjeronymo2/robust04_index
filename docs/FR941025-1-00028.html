			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, since 1984, the Commission staff has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempted to clarify the standards' definitions of ``children's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sleepwear'' garments by written descriptions and drawings and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguish sleepwear from non-sleepwear garments in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication distributed to the children's garment industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the staff has not been able to provide definitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance that resolves all questions about the distinction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between sleepwear and non-sleepwear garment. Constantly changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> styles and fashions in children's apparel have been a major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obstacle to this effort. The Commission has reason to believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that further attempts to provide guidance through additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions of the staff enforcement policy guides are not likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet with success (6), (17).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Some comments suggest that the Commission should require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling of all children's sleepwear garments to indicate their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative flammability. Other comments urge the Commission to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require labeling of those sleepwear garments which do not meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flammability requirements of the children's sleepwear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. These comments state that labeling of some or all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children's sleepwear garments would be preferable to prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sale of garments which do not comply with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the children's sleepwear standards (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Research into the effectiveness of labeling indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order for a label to be effective, it must be: (1) Noticed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) read and understood, and (3) acted upon. That research also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that as consumers become more familiar with a product,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are more likely to ignore information about the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, if a product is not perceived as hazardous, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood is greater that a label will go unnoticed (12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Children's sleepwear garments are products that are familiar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to most consumers. Generally, those garments are not perceived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as presenting a safety hazard. Most sleepwear garments offered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for sale to consumers bear labels stating size, price, fiber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content, and laundering instructions. All of these factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease the likelihood that consumers would notice and read  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional label information about the flammability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garment (12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Even if a label is noticed and read, its message must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be understood before it can be acted upon. Explaining the nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the flammability hazard associated with children's sleepwear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the steps that should be taken to avoid the hazard would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely difficult given the limited space that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on a label (12). For these reasons, the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that labeling some or all children's sleepwear garments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be effective as the sole means to communicate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flammability hazard associated with those garments or a practical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to the performance requirements of the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> F. Preliminary Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, section 4(i) of the FFA requires the notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of proposed rulemaking to contain a regulatory analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisting of: (1) A preliminary description of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits and potential costs of the proposed standard or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment, and an indication of those likely to receive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits and to bear the costs; (2) a discussion of the reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for not publishing any existing standard submitted in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ANPR as the proposed standard or amendment, and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluding that any statement of intent to develop or modify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary standard to address the risk of injury under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration is not likely to result in the development of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate voluntary standard; and (3) a description of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable alternatives to the proposed standard or amendment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together with a summary description of potential benefits and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of each alternative and a brief explanation of why each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such alternative has not been published as the proposed standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One potential benefit of the proposed amendments is that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater variety of children's sleepwear will be available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers (14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Early this week pepper prices started stabilising at the lower levels reached during the previous week, reports Man Producten. Accumulated selling pressure, mainly from India and Brazil, and the lack of buying interest in consuming markets sent prices down steeply. However, buyers gradually realised the sudden drop might be overdone and from the middle of the week values began slowly to recover. Black pepper, faq, ended at about US2,400 a tonne and white at Dollars 3,450.</p>

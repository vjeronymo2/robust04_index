			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Wu: "Service Trades Are Opening Up"] </F>   [Text] China is opening up some service sectors that were  off- limits to foreign and domestic investors and is simplifying  its procedures for approving new businesses.    The State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce said  that it  would give a "green light" for foreign investors to join in the  development of China's service industry.    "Foreign investors will be allowed to start handling  previously restricted businesses such as real estate  development, large-sized retail centres, transport and  communications, finance and tourism," said an official with the  administration.    The government's procedures for approving foreign-invested  firms in these businesses will also be simplified this year, he  added.    The administration will give its approval if cash-sufficient  financial companies want to set up non-financial firms or invest  in other businesses.    Existing service businesses and trust and investment firms,  which have raised more than 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in  capital, will be encouraged to expand into other commercial  fields. With the administration's approval, these firms can  establish subsidiaries in engineering, construction and real  estate.    Since the country vows to fortify its service industry, the  administration officials said, foreign and domestic suppliers of  materials and marketing firms are now allowed to engage in more  businesses.    They can be involved in wholesale and retail business and  act  as commercial agents in buying and selling goods for others,  according to administration officials.    The administration will also lend support to technicians and  scientists who have quit their jobs and want to set up firms of  their own.    It will streamline its procedures for granting these  technicians and scientists permission to start consulting and  service businesses related to information technology.    The government, meanwhile, will extend similar treatment to  encourage officials in its own administrative organs to enter  business. These staff officials were essential under the  previous organization, but with the government streamlining its  structure the need for them is diminished.    So now they can apply to run businesses on their own. But  they must first resign from their government departments before  jumping into the "sea of commerce."    The State Administration for Industry and Commerce is also  backing change in the countryside. With its blessing, the  government's agricultural service centres are now free to  explore lucrative businesses on their own.    With the administration's approval rural technique  popularization centres and household livestock veterinary  stations can transform themselves into profit-seeking companies  with farm and sideline processing factories and information  consulting and service businesses.    According to the State Statistics Bureau, the government's  firm support has helped channel more foreign-invested companies  and individual firms into Chinese industries.    The bureau's figures show that China approved 100,000  foreign- funded projects last year, representing foreign direct  investment in excess of $33 billion.    By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million  individual business households, up 16.2 percent from a year  earlier. It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 per  cent.</p>

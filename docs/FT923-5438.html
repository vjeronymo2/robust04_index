			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Little cause for comfort: Japan's corporate sector faces difficult times ahead despite the government's fiscal package Tokyo's financial mandarins have finally opened their eyes to the gathering economic woes in Japan. And they don't like what they see. After months in which they had appeared blind to the threat posed by falling share prices and an increasingly dismal stream of economic news, the government has acted to halt the deepening crisis in the domestic financial markets. At least for the time being. The government's overall Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) fiscal package - announced last Friday - will increase public spending by an amount equivalent to building five Channel tunnels and extending London's Jubilee underground line with the spare change. Salomon Brothers Asia, an investment bank, estimates that the programme will add Y7,600bn to aggregate demand, and boost gross national product by 1.66 per cent, mainly next year. At the same time, the ministry of finance's recent measures for the troubled banking industry appear to have halted this year's collapse in share prices. The Nikkei has risen by 25 per cent in less than two weeks on the back of investors' positive response to the government's willingness to ease pressure on the heavily-indebted financial sector. Yet the combined package of fiscal and financial measures will do little to ease the squeeze felt by many manufacturing companies that have been among the worst hit by the deepening domestic downturn. The recent rally in Japanese share prices may not last. Only when a recovery in corporate profits finally arrives will the dangers of a further collapse in share prices be over. A series of poor corporate results last Friday highlighted the continuing risks facing the economy. On the evening the government approved the spending package and outlined emergency measures for the financial markets, Nissan Motor, Japan's second biggest vehicle maker, warned of losses for the year totalling Y20bn, a further 17 per cent cut in capital spending, and plans to shed 4,000 jobs over the next three years. Nissan was not the only big Japanese company to announce downwardly revised profits forecasts. Similar announcements were made yesterday by computer company NEC, consumer electronics group Toshiba, Komatsu, the heavy equipment maker, retail group Mitsukoshi, Kyocera, the electronic equipment maker, and a string of other companies. Much of the rest of Japan Inc. is likely to follow suit in the weeks ahead. These grim corporate developments are the result of the boom-bust cycle that companies, as well as financial markets, have experienced over the past five years. The years of cheap finance that artificially boosted land and property prices and encouraged an unprecedented acceleration of corporate investment are no more. The fallout from this re-adjustment promises to produce plenty more bad news in the coming months. The problems of both the banking and the corporate sectors have their roots in the period during the mid- to late-1980s, when Japan came under enormous international pressure to cut its huge trade surplus by expanding domestic demand. Following the 1987 Louvre agreement to stabilise the fall of the dollar, the Bank of Japan was required to keep interest rates low so as to stimulate the economy and boost imports. The consequences for the financial sector were turbulent. Low interest rates and financial deregulation inflated the financial markets as property prices and share prices soared and bank lending grew at an unsustainable rate. As inflationary pressures grew, the Bank of Japan eventually raised interest rates in 1989, pricking the economic bubble and leading to a decline in stock prices and a collapse of the property market in 1990. The banks remain burdened by bad debt and property prices continue to fall. What Japan's economic bureaucrats have consistently failed to appreciate is the extent to which the heady years also distorted investment and consumption patterns. Company investments grew sharply because money was cheap to borrow, while the rise in share prices cut the cost of equity capital to low levels by global standards. Growth in private sector capital equipment investment reached a peak of 16.6 per cent in 1989, and continued rising at a brisk pace of 12.4 per cent in 1990. Nissan, not atypical of manufacturing companies, tripled capital investment to Y318.6bn in the three years to 1990, taking advantage of market conditions to renew production facilities. Manufacturers were also encouraged to invest by a brisk rise in consumption, which was in turn supported by the tight labour market. Japanese companies had responded to a blaze of publicity about domestic structural labour shortages by taking on more workers. For employees, the high level of job vacancies reduced the already low risk of redundancy, encouraging them to spend more, mostly on expensive durable goods. Passenger car registrations, for example, rose by 13.2 per cent in 1988 and 12.6 per cent in 1989. The net result was a rise in investment that quickly became unsustainable once interest rates rose, share prices fell and domestic demand began to slow. Companies brought new facilities on stream only to discover that demand had disappeared. Inventories began to pile up, even as production was cut. Capital spending plans began to cut deeply into corporate profits at a time when depreciation charges on previous investments were already rising to a peak. What was a powerful cyclical rise, has turned into an equally powerful cyclical retreat. Companies have responded by cutting investment, reducing bonus payments, curbing overtime and temporary employment, freezing hiring, and even in some cases reducing overall staff numbers through natural wastage. With employment now less secure than before, household consumption began to slow in the second quarter of this year. Yet, in spite of the accumulating evidence pointing to the economy's slowdown over the past year, it is only now that the ministry of finance has accepted that the private sector's pleas for government action amount to more than just special pleading. Why has the ministry been so slow to respond? Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, economist at the Economic Planning Agency, said the government had misjudged the severity of the downturn because some vital indicators on which it kept a particularly close eye, such as plant utilisation, had only been declining early in the year to levels seen in the late-1980s, prior to the upturn. Finance ministry officials continually pointed to other indicators, such as employment and bankruptcies, which showed the economy bearing up much more so than in the 1973 and 1979 downturns following the oil price rise. Financial indicators - falling stock and land prices, and the record slow growth in the broad money supply - all suggested that things were much worse, but were ignored. Most important, the ministry of finance has remained stubbornly unwilling until the past few weeks to reverse its policy of reducing government debt and agree to anything more than a cosmetic fiscal boost. The Bank of Japan has been cutting interest rates since July of last year. But low interest rates alone would probably not have been enough to encourage the economy to pick up. Certainly the US has found that recession accompanied by asset deflation has proved extremely difficult to turn around by monetary policy means alone. And, in spite of the ministry's qualms, Japan benefits from being able to use fiscal instruments on a much larger scale than the deficit-constrained US. Japan's ratio of net state debt to GNP is a modest 7 per cent compared to 36 per cent in the US. But more important, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has forecast that Japan will run a budget surplus of 1.9 per cent of GNP this year compared to a US deficit of 3.8 per cent. Tokyo can therefore afford a spending package of a magnitude denied to Washington. What has prompted the Japanese government to finally act has been the recent plunge in consumer spending, downward forecasts of corporate profits and the accompanying plunge in share prices. Government economists had consistently maintained that the strength of consumer spending would sustain the economy. The government's response has been a typical Japanese-style package of fiscal measures. The package is designed to boost domestic demand and partly offset the fall in private consumption and capital spending that threatens to push growth to below 2 per cent this year. Economists in Tokyo estimate that the increase in central and local government spending on public works outlined in the package - totalling about Y5,000bn - will boost growth by between 0.6 per cent and 0.7 per cent this fiscal year. The money will be used to build roads, houses, airports, railroads, and sewers, all of which are badly needed in Japan. The actual boost to the economy, however, will be much smaller than the Y10,700bn - 2.3 per cent of GNP - total package expenditure suggests. Spending from the postal saving system - one of the government's most important sources of domestic finance - for example, involves only a redirecting of money towards special lending programmes, such as low interest loans for small business, not new money. Several thousand billion yen which will go towards the purchase of land will not make a direct contribution to growth. The government hopes the package will boost the economy by 2.4 per cent in the 12 months from October, when a supplementary budget will be enacted to raise the finance to pay for the measures. Yet the spending programme offers nothing in the short-run for Japan's most successful industries - cars and consumer electronics. Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Japan's eight other vehicle makers all have overcapacity that needs to be chopped ruthlessly These companies, and hundreds of their suppliers will remain under pressure to cut investment, wages and employment in the months ahead. Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming, expects 500,000 manufacturing jobs to be slashed in the next 12 months. Even if employment increases in other sectors of the economy, as the spending programme takes effect, the difficulties in the manufacturing sector will continue to send shivers down the spines of consumers, government officials and the stock market. For sure, what Tokyo's mandarins see before them is not a pleasing sight.</p>

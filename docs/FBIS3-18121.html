			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CDU Deputy Chairman Heinz Eggert by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Election  Campaign Not Just With One Man"]    [Text] [DIE WOCHE] The polls in the new laender have been  disastrous for the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. What has  been the CDU's biggest mistake in the east?    [Eggert] I am not sure that there has been any big mistake  by the CDU. It is often forgotten that it has been four years  since unification. Only a few critics imagine what would have  happened if unification had not taken place. This does not rule  out that in addition to the large amount of help -- one out of  two marks that the east is using is produced in the west -- a  lot of ignorance and arrogance has also been carried from the  west to the east. In addition, the expectations of the people  in the east were too high and cannot be fulfilled, especially  not in times of recession. Now this is attributed to the party  that is in the government.    [DIE WOCHE] Are the circumstances to be blamed?    [Eggert] If a party is no longer accepted, then 80 percent  of the blame naturally goes to itself. There were several  mishaps, personnel quarrels, and homemade affairs. In addition,  we are now paying the bill for the fact that the CDU has been  too clumsy to present the complicated problems, which have  accumulated within the briefest possible period, as such and to  show approaches to solutions. I believe that there has never  been any election period during which so many problems needed  solving at the same time. By the way, during the time of the  upheaval, it was also not made clear enough to the former GDR  citizens that even though a state had collapsed, their life  achievements are not worthless.    [DIE WOCHE] Can the CDU still turn the helm around before  the Bundestag elections?    [Eggert] I just hope that at the Hamburg party congress the  CDU will make one thing clear: Solving material questions is  worth more than preserving power at any cost. My experiences  show that the voter punishes opportunism. He notices when he is  made promises that cannot be kept.    [DIE WOCHE] Do you place your hopes on the chancellor?    [Eggert] It is not only me who is against pursuing the  election campaign with just one man. I am far too much of a  theologian not to know that a message can be spread only by many  people. The more messengers there are, the more visible is the  range of the messages.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Senior IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members have been  working nonstop since 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon to prepare  candidate lists for participation in the election before 6  o'clock tonight.    A Transvaal IFP spokesman, Mr. Hennie Bekker, told the  Afrikaans radio news program, Monitor, that although provisional  lists had been drawn up some time ago, numerous candidates had  to be confirmed before the national and regional lists could be  finalized. He said Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi would  head the national list, but that the decision had to be taken  within the next few hours on whether he would head the  kwaZulu-Natal regional list. Mr. Bekker suggested that the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] consider installing polling  booths in what he termed beleaguered hostels in Thokoza.</p>

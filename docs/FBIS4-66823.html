			<p>CSO     [Text] Bombay, April 15--The government of India's  department of space is now fully capable of making India a major  space power by the turn of the century. "India is determined to  forge ahead by enhancing and sustaining the space services  overcoming any external pressure that may come in the way. And,  the department of space has become, over the years, a dynamic  and vibrant organisation, fully capable of making India a major  space power by the turn of the century," says the just-released  annual report (1993-94) of the department of space.    According to the report, the country was on the threshold of  achieving self-reliance in the launch vehicle technology. In the  process, a strong technical manpower base has been created and a  research and development infrastructure built up.    The space department's statement assumes significance in  view  of the recent remarks made by Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in an  interview to INDIA TODAY that restrictions imposed by the  missile technology control regime (MTCR) will in no way affect  the country's space programmes while referring to the nation's  missile projects.    Dr Kalam, often described as the father of India's rocket  programmes and now tipped to take over as the vice chancellor of  Madras University, said that the country was 90 per cent  self-sufficient in the aerospace field.    The space department's report has stated that the close  space-industry partnership among the public, private and joint  sectors has enabled Indian industry to meet the production  demands for space products and services in a timely and cost  effective way.    Touching on some of the other projects, the report said as  of  October 1, 1993, a total of 142 telecommunications terminals  were operating in the INSAT (Indian National Satellite System)  telecommunication network providing 4,056 two-way speech  circuits.    Over 400 additional earth stations, including 50 for  satellite-based rural telegraphy network pilot project in the  north-eastern region were now under various stages of  implementation in the department of telecommunication's network,  the report said.    Under the INSAT scheme, 2,000 direct reception sets have  been  deployed in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,  Maharashtra and Gujarat for the benefit of the local community.</p>

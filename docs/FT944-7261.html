			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Wrong track It would be better not to have started from here. That is the sensible response to the government's proposed technique for valuing Railtrack, which owns British Rail's track, signalling and stations. In formally announcing Railtrack's privatisation yesterday before there exists a sensible mechanism for valuing it, ministers are putting their desire to raise funds above the need to ensure efficiency in the railways. Privatisation could bring significant benefits to passengers. This summer's rail dispute might also have been concluded more quickly if Railtrack had been free to negotiate without regard to the public sector pay freeze. Yet it is doubtful whether the benefits will be as great as they should be. The heart of the problem is that the government has based the charges which train operators will pay Railtrack on an arbitrary valuation of Railtrack's assets and on an equally arbitrary target rate of return for Railtrack to earn. The proposed asset value of Pounds 6.5bn is more than just debatable - a case can be made for higher or lower figures. It is based on sunk (or replacement) costs that are irrelevant to determination of the infrastructure's current value. As Mr John Swift, the rail regulator has noted, a more commercial approach to valuation is required. That value should be determined by discounting the appropriate level of future revenues at an appropriate rate of discount. The government has approached the pricing question backwards. What needs to be worked out is the revenue Railtrack would earn if it charged prices that ensure efficient use of the railways. Those calculations should take account of the demand for rail transport, the capacity available and the marginal cost of increasing it. They should also allow for social and environmental considerations, such as the desirable balance between use of roads and railways. Given the uncertainties, it would be more sensible to value Railtrack only after the new system of franchises is working. The proposed rate of return of 5.6 per cent, rising to 8 per cent within four years, is also unnecessarily steep for a utility. Partly because of this, the odds are that track charges will end up too high. This would hinder the emergence of competitive, entrepreneurial train operators and ensure socially inefficient underutilisation of capacity. In principle, any overvaluation could be offset by higher subsidies from the Treasury. Yet the government would then find itself taking with one hand and giving back with the other. In practice, however, subsidies on the required scale would not be forthcoming. The government would then take its money, perhaps to finance a tax-cutting bribe, but leave the railways underutilised. Not for the first time, the promise of a privatisation would be vitiated by foolish decisions taken during the act of privatisation itself. The railways need to be put on a better track.</p>

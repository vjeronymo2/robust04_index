			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramoncito P. De La Cruz] </F>   [Text] With only a year before its application, the  Philippines still has yet to harness its capability to  competently implement the Common Effective Preferential Tariff  (CEPT), Bureau of Customs Commissioner Guillermo L. Parayno, Jr.  admitted recently.    In an interview, Mr. Parayno told BUSINESS WORLD hardly any  of his staff has been trained to effectively implement the CEPT,  a set of lowered tariffs for products which contain 40 percent  ASEAN indigenous products in the intra-regional trade route.  The tariff scheme is set to take effect starting tomorrow.  However, the Philippines was able to get a one-year deferment  as it has its own set of tariff reduction scheme under Executive  Order 470.    Based on the agreed CEPT rates these products will be  subjected to 30 percent if they are processed goods, 20 percent  if intermediate products, and 10 percent if raw materials.  After 15 years, three rates will be further scaled down to only  a maximum of 6 percent.    The crux of the implementation of the CEPT will be in  verifying if the import fall under the purview of the program.    "I have to be honest with you," he told BUSINESS WORLD, "we  are not organized as of now...I believe that it is going to be a  very difficult for the BoC [Bureau of Customs]... But with the  amount of work I have, I haven't given it a thought on how to  control it."    According to Mr. Parayno, "What gives me the creeps is the  possible extent of fraudulent and inaccurate certification, it  will affect customs revenue to the effect that transshipment  from other countries not covered by AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area]  passing through AFTA countries, but will be certified as from  AFTA."    It must be noted that since Singapore, a free port area  where  goods from any part of the world can enter freely, has tasked  its private sector groups, specifically the business chambers,  to certify the origin criterion of all its exports out of the  country into its trading ASEAN partners. Some observers pointed  out that since the Singaporeans will have no interest in  outbound goods the certification might be done haphazardly.    Despite the urgency of the matter, the bureau has yet to  identify which among the divisions will handle the  implementation of CEPT.    However, Mr. Parayno hinted he might coordinate with local  business chambers, as they stand to lose due to uncontrolled  influx of cheap goods, to countercheck the verifications given  by their counterparts in other countries as one possible  solution.    At present, the bureau is in the thick of computerizing its  whole port operations and privatizing the release and disposing  of seized goods.</p>

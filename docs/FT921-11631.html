			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: A budget for the ballot box 5.5) Since it is now clear that UK economic recovery will come too late to help the government win the election, the budget has assumed singular political importance. The art will be to give enough away in bribes to the voters without destroying the government's reputation for fiscal rectitude. The City will surely allow the chancellor some leeway if the result looks a winner, though it will also be doubly vindictive if the effort is unconvincing. As it happens, the weak economy bestows a cloak of respectability on further fiscal stimulation, especially given the exchange rate constraint on monetary policy. But the room for manoeuvre is limited by the government's commitment to balancing the budget over the cycle. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, growth must already average 3 per cent just to balance the public sector borrowing requirement by the end of the next parliament, let alone finance a cut in the standard rate to 20 per cent. The political imperative is thus for a budget which uses its limited resources to make a Labour vote even more expensive for the relatively affluent voters of marginal seats in the south-east. A clear conclusion  - though one which the IFS is reluctant to draw - is that a cut in the standard rate would be of greater electoral advantage than raising tax thresholds, because the benefit is tilted more towards the top 30 per cent of wage earners. This is not the only case where the more electorally beguiling options also make more dubious fiscal policy. It will be interesting to see where Mr Lamont's choice falls.</p>

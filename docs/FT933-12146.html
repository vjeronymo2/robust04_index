			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Straight(er) view of the environment needed Sir, While I welcome the emphasis you put on people's well-being in your editorial, 'Clarifying the green agenda' (July 21), there are many things in it to quarrel with. Let me take just two points. I am not sure that it makes sense to speak of a 'purest' form of the concept of sustainability. It is a complicated idea, made more so by being used to sharpen quite different political axes. But perhaps the simplest analogy is with the agricultural idea of husbandry, of managing one's resources and risks to ensure a continuing livelihood through thin as well as thick. Central to it is the need to balance short-term and better-known consequences against long-term, less certain ones, the argument being that the scale of some of the longer-term dangers more than outweighs the uncertainty of their occurrence. (A secular version of Pascal's Wagner, which works.) The policies it advocates involve trade-offs which depend on the state of knowledge at the time, and as that evolves so do the policies have to change. Nothing new in that, but it expressly does not consist, as your leader would have it, of a simple dictum such as 'conservation for its own sake' (though there are cases where that may be right, too). Ring-fencing the prettier parts of nature can be a direct way of undermining livelihoods and with them the well-being which should be sustained. I was also breath-taken by the complacency with which you view the damage to the ozone layer, as though with a Protocol and a bit, we can all rest easy on the beach. There is a clear correlation between UV exposure and skin cancer and I would have thought that ozone thinning presented one of the clearest examples of the risks to health which you started out by saying were the best reason for acting in environmental questions. OK, some action has been taken, but if CFC production were to stop today (and it won't), the ozone layer will still get thinner before it gets thicker, perhaps much thinner. And, quite apart from the suffering and the medical bills, there is the imponderable threat the radiation poses to the bottom of the food chain in the southern ocean. There might also, one would have thought, be some salutary lessons to be drawn from the fact that such an apparently inert and benign gas could, in the course of half a century, wreak such damage. Those long-term consequences again. I don't dispute that sound environmental policy requires priorities, but perhaps the first is to get the subject straight(er).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Karachi (APP) -- Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Saeed  M. Khan said here on Sunday that India's hegemonic aspirations  can only spell trouble for smaller states in the region.    Addressing student-officers of PN [Pakistan Navy] Staff  College here, Admiral Saeed said India's interest in seeking  naval cooperation with regional countries is aimed at allaying  regional apprehension about its naval buildup on the one hand  and isolating Pakistan in the region, on the other.    India is also trying to portray China as an "external"  adversary to justify its naval expansion, now that it has  retracted its opposition to US presence, he said.    The Naval Chief further said that Indian Navy is reportedly  working on a programme for development of nuclear propulsion  capability. Seen in the context of its nuclear capability and a  comprehensive ballistic missiles programme this is ominous  having profound and far-reaching implications for the entire  region Admiral Saeed said.    He said, with the stoppage of US aid in 1990, the Pakistan  Navy received a major setback when three PNC Orion Aircraft,  which had been cleared for release, were withheld. Later, the  US also insisted on the return of eight warships on expiry of  their lease, Admiral Saeed added. He further said, despite all  difficulties the country was on way to building a fairly modern  and balanced fleet of a reasonable size.    Admiral Saeed said, the recently acquired type 21 Frigates  after being updated, would adequately fill the gap created by  the return of American ships. Pakistan Navy's submarines fitted  with Harpoon Missiles can deliver powerful punch, but their  numerical strength is below the required level.    About mine hunters, the Admiral said, Pakistan Navy's  deficiency in mine countermeasures capability has been made up  by the purchase of three modern mine hunters.    He said that in the present strategic scenario and in the  face of continuing Indian naval expansion there is no choice but  to consolidate our navy through self-reliance. He added, a long  term programme has been placed before the government for  building a series of surface ships at the Karachi Shipyard and  Engineering Works (KSEW) in collaboration with a foreign Yard.  Admiral Saeed said, this would be a major step forward which  would also catalyses [as published] development in various  industries in the country.    The Naval Chief said that the next few years are going to be  crucial and to tax all our resources-financial, material and  personnel. He added, if managed and harnessed well these  resources will give the country the much needed maritime defence  capability.    On his arrival earlier at the PN Staff College, Naval Chief  Admiral Saeed M. Khan was received by the College Commandant,  Commodore Serfraz Khan.    Flag Officers and other senior naval officers were also  present on the occasion.</p>

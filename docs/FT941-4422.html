			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Government accepts need to reform treasure laws Valuable antiquities found in England and Wales need more legal protection than the law on treasure trove affords, the Department of National Heritage has accepted. There is concern that the increased use of metal detectors on private land has led to hundreds of thousands of valuable items not going to the Crown each year. However, a private member's bill to widen the definition of treasure trove has been rejected by the department as too complex. The law specifies that finds made of gold or silver which have been deliberately buried with the intention of recovery by unknown owners or heirs belong to the state. Finds which were almost not handed over because of these strict requirements include the Middleham jewel, an important piece of jewellery, and the Sutton Hoo ship burial, a find of early Anglo-Saxon artefacts. The proposed bill, sponsored by the British Museum, sought to create a new definition of 'treasure' - in addition to treasure trove - to include items without high gold or silver content, finds discovered along with official treasure trove and antiquities found regardless of the owner's identity or original intention. Baroness Trumpington, from the government front bench, told the House of Lords that the government accepted the need for reform, but not in the form presented by the bill. She said: 'Because of its long history the law is complicated in ways which really have nothing to do with the present-day needs of archaeology. Our view is that the bill would not actually remove these anomalies. The British Museum is preparing amendments to the bill and hopes to enlist government support at the committee stage on March 23.</p>

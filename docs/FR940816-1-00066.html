			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Park Service will be the primary agency implementing the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of National Parks. The States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and potentially affected Tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements for management of the gray wolf in the Park. These cooperative agreements would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and Tribes have adequate regulatory authority to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. It is anticipated that the States and Tribes will be the primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. The Service will provide oversight, coordinate wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and Tribes do not assume wolf management responsibilities, the Service would do so, as needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management of the reintroduced wolves would allow wolves to be killed or moved under some conditions by Service authorized Federal, State, and Tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation on big game populations. Under some conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private funding sources would be encouraged. There would be no land-use restrictions applied when 6 or more wolf packs were documented in the experimental population area because sufficient wolf numbers would be available and no restrictions around den sites or other critical areas would be necessary to promote wolf recovery. Enhancement of prey populations would be encouraged. Use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves would still be prohibited by existing labeling restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate and, with 6 packs of wolves present in a population, about 20&hyph;25 pups could be born each year to greatly compensate for mortality which would result from management actions. The Service believes that a possible 10 per cent loss of wolves could occur due to control actions and an additional 10 per cent loss could occur from other mortality sources. However, once the number of introduced wolves has reached the goal of 6 wolf packs, the reproductive output of 6 packs of wolves would provide for a wolf population increasing at or near 22 per cent per year. This increase in numbers should easily accommodate more flexible wolf management to further address local concerns and resistance to wolf recovery efforts, and reduce the need and costs of agency actions to resolve wolf/human conflicts. Closely regulated public control also can more effectively focus on individual problem wolves as conflicts occur rather than hours or days after a problem is documented. Agency control actions would more likely target groups of wolves that contain problem individuals, whereas public control could be focused on individual problem wolves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service, or States and Tribes if authorized, may move wolves that are having unacceptable impacts on ungulate populations in the unlikely event that those impacts would inhibit wolf recovery. Wolves could be moved to other places within the experimental population area. Two examples are where wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability because of unusual habitat or weather conditions (e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) or where wolves cause prey to move onto private property and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States and Tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or Tribal management plans. These plans would be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such control could be conducted. Wolves would not be deliberately killed to address ungulate-wolf conflicts. These unacceptable impacts would be identified in State and Tribal wolf management plans and developed in consultation with the Service. If such control by the States or Tribes were likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the experimental rule as determined by the Service, then they would be specifically incorporated as part of an amendment to this experimental rule, which would be adopted following national public comment and review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

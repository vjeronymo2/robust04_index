			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / US senators seek Airbus 'dumping' action TWO key US senators yesterday introduced legislation which would bring a dumping and subsidy complaint against the European Airbus consortium and would help fund a US technology consortium to develop the next generation of US aircraft. The legislation was introduced by Senator John Danforth, a leading Republican on trade matters, and Senator Max Baucus, Democratic chairman of the Senate international trade subcommittee. In a speech yesterday, Senator Baucus also announced his support for a six-month to one-year extension of the 'fast track' negotiating authority to allow completion of the Uruguay Round this year. 'If we cannot conclude a Gatt agreement by the end of that time, we should accept the fact that we are unlikely to get a good agreement,' he said. The bipartisan aerospace initiative by the two senators comes in the wake of strong criticism by President Bill Clinton of the Bush administration's agreement with the Europeans to limit aircraft subsidies. Senator Baucus said the government would not stand by while the largest US export industry 'falls victim to a European aerospace industry that would not even exist if it weren't for the treasuries of France, Spain, Germany and the UK'. His legislation would create a consortium along the lines of 'Sematech', which funds semiconductor research with government and industry financing. The bill also requires the Commerce Department to launch an 'unfair' trade case against the EC. The case would be dropped 'if an agreement is reached'. US and Japanese transport officials yesterday began two days of talks to stave off sanctions and counter-retaliation in a dispute over a United Airlines plan to fly from New York to Tokyo and Sydney.</p>

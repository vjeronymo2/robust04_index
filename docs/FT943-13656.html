			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Canadians ease internal barriers Canada's prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, and leaders of the 10 provinces yesterday signed a long-awaited deal to ease internal trade barriers. The agreement falls short of the federal government's aim of dismantling the plethora of non-tariff curbs maintained by the provinces but business groups have welcomed it as an important first step. Yesterday's signing ceremony in Ottawa was also designed to send a message to Quebec, where the ruling Liberals are about to embark on an uphill election campaign against the separatist Parti Quebecois. Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's outspokenly federalist premier, needs to show voters that the francophone province will fare better as part of Canada than by breaking away. Mr Johnson is expected to call an election later this week for September 12. The PQ leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has scoffed at the inter-provincial trade agreement, noting that it falls short in many respects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and multilateral trade pacts to which a sovereign Quebec would be a signatory. Among areas covered by the package are government procurement, labour mobility, transport licences and product standards. The deal also includes a weak dispute settlement mechanism. However, Ottawa and the provinces were unable to agree on contentious areas such as energy, alcohol and agriculture.</p>

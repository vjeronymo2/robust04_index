This year it has reorganized its  Automation Promotion Sub-panel into the New Technology  Development Research Sub-panel. The sub-panel, which is just  getting started, will support product development and original  technology development of companies in Gumma. The sub-panel  recently began its activity with a sub-panel meeting.    Gumma Prefecture has aggressively attracted companies to the  prefecture, so it has seen the value of industrial shipments  rise. Many local companies are sub-contractors to those  companies, so it is desirable to support the growth of local  companies which can develop their own products and original  technology. The New Technology Development Research Sub-panel  will address that topic through a forum made up of  representatives from industry, academia, and government.    The sub-panel will focus on companies that develop their own  products and technology without relying on technology  introductions and which hold a distinctive position in the  domestic market. It will conduct its research by lecturing on  actual case studies, factory tours, and so on. The sub-panel is  expected to meet twice a year with the meeting held by the  target companies. The first meeting was held on 5 October at  Katsura Machinery (Yoji Sekiguchi, president; Maebashi City,  Tel. 0272-21-1461), Japan's leading block machine manufacturer.  It included a lecture by president Sekiguchi and a tour of the  company's factory. The second meeting is planned for February  1994.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353): "Industrial </F> Policy -- Directional Indicator for Economic Take-Off"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Industrial policy is  still a brand new term for the majority of Chinese people. When  the State Council recently promulgated the "Outline of State  Industrial Policy in the Nineties," people might not have  anticipated that in the next decade, a comprehensive rural  economic system integrated with agriculture, trade, industry,  communications, construction, and service trades will gradually  take shape to facilitate an all-around development of the rural  economy; that the strains on infrastructure and basic industries  will be greatly alleviated to help the national economy develop  at a more solid and substantive pace; that along with the rapid  rise of a number of pillar industries, many people will move  into new living quarters and drive privately owned vehicles,  telephones and family computers will no longer be in exclusive  use by a small number of people, and foreign trade mix and  conditions will be improved markedly and China will play a  bigger role in the global economic and trade arena; that  thriving high- and new-tech industries will bring about a  noticeable improvement in the organizational structure and  pattern of industries; and that there will be a big leap in the  level of industrial technology. All of these will become  materialized under the guidance of industrial policy, the target  that the macroeconomic regulation and control is aimed at.    China has launched an important program of applying  industrial policy to guide the national economy to embark on the  optimal course while bringing into full play the role of markets.  <H5>  I. </H5>   To use simple language, industrial policy is aimed mainly at  readjusting industrial structure.    In any country, industrial structure always takes shape in a  given stage of economic development. Take, for example, China's  pace-setting industries: In the 1960s and 1970s, light  industrial products consisting of dozens of components, such as  bicycles, watches, and sewing machines, became the dominant  groups of consumer goods. In the 1980s, machinery and  electrical products consisting of several hundred components,  such as color television sets, refrigerators, and video  cassettes, were the vogues of the times. Since the beginning of  the 1990s, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his talks  during his southern tour, the Chinese economy has developed  rapidly. What Chinese people on the street feel right now is  that the traditional consumer goods are saturated and urgently  need to be replaced by groups of higher quality capital- and  technology-intensive consumer goods; and that electronic  products, automobiles, residential houses, and other new  products will become leading consumer goods.    With the scale of the Chinese economy being multiplied  several hundredfold as compared with the beginning of the PRC,  the previous simple management system of a planned economy has  become outdated, while the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure is not yet complete. As a result, aimless  development, redundant construction, and low efficiency have  occurred from time to time. On the one hand, much new capital  continues to be invested in traditional industries whose  products have already saturated the markets; on the other, new  industries which have not reached the threshold of large-scale  production cannot turn out highly competitive products. Take  the automobile industry, for example. China has over 120  automobile plants, more than the total number of plants in the  world; however, its total output is less than that of a single  model manufactured by a foreign automobile company. If such a  situation characterized by laxness, chaos, and poor quality  remains for a long time to come, taking part in international  competition can only be an empty slogan.    Under the circumstances of developing a socialist market  economy, the government policymakers and economists are  anxiously trying to seek a new, effective control and regulatory  means.    They are attracted by the experiences of other countries: A  few newly developed nations, with foresight in the process of  developing a market-oriented economy, have their central  government draw up an industrial policy to standardize and  encourage industries which can serve as the foundations and  pacesetters for the national economy, thereby creating a healthy  situation characterized by both competition and a clear-cut  direction of development and making optimal and rational  allocation of resources. For example, Japan and Korea have  successively developed their automobile and electronics  industries from weak foundations. However, both countries  relied on the assistance and interference prescribed in the  state industrial policy to concentrate national resources and  prioritize the development of their industries. Through  assiduous efforts, the Japanese and Korean automobile and  electronics industries have come to dominate international  markets while bringing along the rapid growth of the national  economy and creating world-acclaimed economic miracles.    II.    Some people once suggested that since China wanted to  introduce a market economy, it was not necessary to formulate an  industrial policy as everything would be regulated by market  mechanisms. However, more experts held that simple market  regulation would inevitably lead to loss of resources and  opportunities, which were precisely the things China should  treasure. Besides, simple market regulation could not guarantee  the long-term development of agriculture and infrastructure.  Needless to say, the Asian countries with the same oriental  cultural background as China's had their central government draw  up a guiding industrial policy. Even the United States, which  is known for its free market economy, drew up an industrial  policy for developing space aviation and other high-technology  several decades ahead of time. These two views finally  converged on one point, that is, industrial policy and market  mechanisms are complementary to each other. On the one hand,  industrial policy aims to apply economic means to guide the  direction of industrial development, to change relations between  different relations so as to remedy defects and shortcomings of  market mechanisms, to coordinate and accumulate necessary  capital within a short period of time for carrying out some  major projects having a bearing on the overall situation, and to  promote the optimal allocation of resources. On the other hand,  maintaining the normal operation of market mechanisms and  promoting fair, equal, and open competition constitute the  important functions of industrial policy.    China first tried to formulate its industrial policy in the  late 1980s. In March 1989, the State Council, in the light of  needs at that time, promulgated the "Decision Concerning the  Main Points of the Current Industrial Policy." The "decision"  outlined specific names of projects which the government would  support or restrict in the four areas of production, capital  construction, technical transformation, and foreign trade; as  well as a guarantee system. Strictly speaking, it was a policy  aimed at achieving short-term targets at that time, but it still  attracted extensive attention from many international  organizations and economic sectors abroad.    Since the early 1990s, the center of global economic  development has shifted to the Asian-Pacific region. Along with  China's further opening up and absorption of huge foreign  capital, the country has become a new economic growth point of  the Asian-Pacific region. Moreover, in the transition from a  planned to a market economy, the central government has been  required to conform with international economic trends in both  macro and micro economic operational mechanisms to provide  farsighted guidance for changes in industrial structure and to  accelerate the pace of China's modernization toward the 21st  century. Thus, the formulation of an industrial policy for  long-term allocation of resources was placed on the State  Council's agenda.    In line with the State Council's decision, the State  Planning  Commission took the lead in studying and coordinating the  formulation of an industrial policy. As the commission has been  changing its functions from drawing up annual plans and  allocating financial and material resources to drawing up medium  and long-term plans, the study and formulation of industrial  policy in the 1990s has become a major task of the commission.    Since 1992, the State Planning Commission, in a bid to pool  collective wisdom, invited economists and representatives from  departments, localities, and enterprises to various forums; and  convened a national industrial policy work conference. The  State Council's leaders personally participated in discussions  and listened to opinions at the conference.    Using as reference foreign countries' successful experiences  in formulating and implementing industrial policy and in the  light of the actual conditions in China, the basic principles  for the state industrial policy in the 1990s have been drawn up:  1) They conform with the objective law governing the process of  industrialization and modernization; 2) they conform with the  demand for establishing a socialist market economic structure;  3) they underscore the key areas and focus on solving major  issues having a vital bearing on the overall situation of the  national economy; and 4) they are feasible and can guarantee the  implementation of industrial policy through economic, legal, and  necessary administrative means.    In the process of formulating industrial policy, experts  conducted a host of research on verification of proof, data  analyses, and prediction of trends. After revisions to 14  drafts, the current "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the  Nineties" took shape. After discussion and approval by the  State Council's 16th executive meeting, it was promulgated for  implementation.    III.    The promulgated "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the  Nineties" contains a group of documents, mainly consisting of  two parts: 1) A framework of programmatic documents of a  guidance nature, which involve only agriculture, basic  industries, infrastructural facilities, and pillar industries,  and which allow enterprises and the market to play their optimum  role in the development of a number of key industries such as  foreign trade; 2) a series of practical special industrial  policies drawn up on the basis of the "outline." For example,  the "Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry" and other  special industrial policies on transportation, communications,  construction, electronics, machine-building, petrochemical  industries, and foreign trade, which will be drawn up  successively.    The entrepreneurs of several automobile groups from all  parts  of the country said: The "Industrial Policy for the Automobile  Industry" has enabled China's automobile industry to have a  direction and basis for healthy development since its  establishment over four decades ago. The annual production of  whole sedan manufacturing plants shall not be below 150,000  units; encouragement of the policy of investment and financing  through various channels; encouragement of the policy that  individuals should buy automobiles; discouragement of the policy  of depending on the state to buy automobiles; encouragement of  the consumption policy of using small automobiles; overall  planning for related industries; and other safety policies on  roads, car parking facilities, and inclusion of teaching of  traffic knowledge in elementary schools, which are stipulated in  the industrial policy, will have a decisive impact on the  reorganization and rapid development of China's automobile  industry.    Whether the state industrial policy drawn up by the central  government in consideration of overall and long-term interests  can be successfully turned into a giant motive force for the  development of the economy in the nineties depends on a secure  implementation system. According to the arrangements of the  state, the implementation of the industrial policy will depend  mainly on the departments in charge of various trades; however,  it will be implemented under the overall coordination of the  State Planning Commission. Meanwhile, the establishment of a  secure system for the implementation of the industrial policy  and a supervision, checking, and evaluation system should be  speedily completed. Economic administrative departments dealing  with planning, finance, banking, taxation, customs, foreign  trade, securities, industrial and commercial administration, and  management of state-owned assets will coordinate with one  another to form a force to push forward the smoother  implementation of the state industrial policy.    According to a disclosure by an authoritative source, in the  future when the state is drawing up economic policies, it will  give preferential treatment to industries just as it gave such  treatment to regions in the past. Morever, the state will  render necessary support to important industrial projects being  built in central and western China.    The scientific guidance provided by the industrial policy  will play a sacred role in stimulating the development of  China's economy.</p>

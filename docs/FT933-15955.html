			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Court dismisses banana challenge THE EUROPEAN Court of Justice has dismissed an attempt by the Chiquita Banana Company and subsidiaries to declare the new EC import regime for bananas null and void, Reuter reports from Brussels. Spiers, Bruigom and Viser, August Lehmann, Simba and Comaco lost similar cases. But some banana operators could get compensation for commercial loss caused by the new rules, the court said. This will not be available until the Luxembourg-based court issues a full ruling on the regime, which could take two years. The new regime, which imposes a 2m-tonnes a year tariff quota on imports of Latin American bananas, came into force on July 1 after the court rejected a German challenge.</p>

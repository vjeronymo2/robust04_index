The Spanish Government decided in December to reduce its aid  to Equatorial Guinea by half and cancel all its assistance  programs to the official bodies, notably aid to the radio and  television and training scholarships to the Armed Forces  following the expulsion of Diego Sanchez Bustamante, Spanish  consul general in Bata, the country's second most important  city. Mr. Bustamante was accused by the Equatorial Guinean  authorities of "interfering in the country's internal affairs."    After being recalled for consultations, the ambassador  returned to Malabo on 1 January with a message from his  government to President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. The contents of  the message were not revealed, the radio explained.    Speaking before the Equatorial Guinean press after an  audience with the head of state, the Spanish diplomat stressed  that his country wants to maintain relations with Equatorial  Guinea but that the latter must consider Spain's stand on the  security of its citizens in the country, human rights, and the  democratic process in Equatorial Guinea.</p>

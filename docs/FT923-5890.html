			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING IN the futures market was again dominated by worries over sterling and the possibility of an increase in UK interest rates, writes Christopher Price. The September FT-SE 100 contract opened steadier at 2,293 as dealers and investors reflected on the chancellors' early morning speech. A small squeeze sent the contract forward and it reached a high for the day of 2,305 by 9am. It continued to hold up as sterling steadied, but a story that one German city had reported a rise in its monthly inflation sent September retreating to 2,280 by midday. Pressure on sterling, weak gilts and renewed gloom over the UK economy combined to weaken September throughout the afternoon session, the contract crumbling to 2,275, its low of the day, by 3pm. However, a firmer Wall Street helped inspire a rally towards the end. September finished at 2,292, up 7 from the previous close and around a four-point premium to its fair value of 5.5. Volume came to 11,580 contracts. There was again hefty trading in the options market, with the FT-SE 100 option having 10,146 lots dealt out of a total of 34,378. Asda was the busiest stock option on 7,506 contracts transacted.</p>

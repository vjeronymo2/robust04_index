			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Group of Three agree on free trade pact Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia have concluded negotiations on a free trade accord and agreed it should come into effect at the start of next year. Mexico's trade ministry said the three countries reached agreement yesterday after resolving differences over a legal revision of the original text. Presidents of the three countries will sign the treaty next month at the Ibero-American summit, and the accord will come into effect on January 1 next year. The treaty between the so-called Group of Three follows last month's free trade accord between Mexico and Costa Rica, and recent ones between Mexico, the US and Canada, and Mexico and Chile. The G3 bloc will bring together economies with a combined population of about 150m, and a gross domestic product near Dollars 400bn. The agreement will gradually eliminate tariff and most non-tariff barriers and establish dispute mechanism panels to resolve differences arising from the treaty's implementation. On January 1 about 40 per cent of Mexican exports will enter Colombia free of duty, while Venezuela will dismantle tariffs over ten years.</p>

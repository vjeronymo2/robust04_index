Recently, Shakhray took part in a meeting of  the intergovernmental Commission for Russian Germans' issues.    According to Shakhray, the Russian delegation confirmed to  the meeting that Russia was "interested in keeping all Russian  Germans in Russia." At his assessment, the number of those  leaving Russia for Germany decreased slightly in 1993. At the  same time, the number of Germans coming to Russia from Central  Asian republics and Kazakhstan was bigger than that of emigrants  to Germany.    Shakhray pointed out that the only way for the gradual  restoration of Russian Germans' statehood was to pass a federal  law on the creation of new subjects of the Russian Federation in  areas predominantly populated by Germans. He pointed out that  the process might take several years.    At the same time, Shakhray said the attitude of residents of  the Volgograd and Saratov regions located along the Volga River,  where a German autonomous region was planned to be created, had  become more favorable. These regions used to be a densely  German-populated area before 1941.    Asked whether the draft power-sharing treaty between the  center and the Kaliningrad region (a Russian exclave located  between Lithuania and Poland -- IF's note) would be similar to  the one between Moscow and Kazan, Shakhray said his ministry had  been instructed by the president and the government to prepare a  treaty on the issue before April.    In Shakhray's opinion, the law on a special status of the  Kaliningrad region that Federation Council Speaker Vladimir  Shumeyko had referred to during his trip to the region, "neither  ran counter, nor precluded such a power-sharing treaty between  the Kaliningrad region and the Russian Federation."    Speaking on the parliamentary elections in Tatarstan,  Shakhray pointed out that his ministry considered their returns  to show the approval or disapproval of the treaty between Russia  and Tatarstan. In his opinion, Tatars' active participation in  the elections (57.2) was evidence of their support for the  treaty.</p>

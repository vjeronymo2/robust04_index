			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN MEMORIAM: MAY SWENSON  </P> <P> Force can't make a poem for me.  </P> <P> I am an old poet now. My first book was published over thirty years ago, and  recognition came late. This makes no difference to the quality of the work, or  to how long it will last. But, for me quantity diminishes with age, with  increasing complexities of daily life, decreasing energies both physical and  mental. Yes, one becomes wiser, but that's not good for making poetry. Knowing,  seeing through everything, produces the cynic, the intellectualizer. The best  poetry has its roots in the subconscious to a great degree. Youth, naivete,  reliance on instinct more than learning and method, a sense of freedom and  play, even trust in randomness is necessary to the making of a poem, and if  this ceases to happen often in the poet, s/he either produces less often or  tries to force. Still I visualize a break-through in these, my late years, a  lucky (and magical) period of peace, simplicity, ideal inner and outer weather,  a clean slate away from petty obligations and complications, a surge of power  and self-belief, a sudden ability to make use of my hoard of experiences in the  creation of a great poem. I visualize this ecstasy.  </P> <P> MAY SWENSON, Seacliff, N.Y., Aug. 4, 1989  </P> <P> WEST/WORD 2, dedicated to May Swenson, is available from UCLA Extension Writers  Program, 10995 LeConte, Los Angeles 90024.  </P> <P> </P></p>

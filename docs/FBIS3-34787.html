Talks dealt with the friendly bilateral relations and the  assistance that France can provide to Jordan in the fields of  tourism, transportation, and infrastructure. Discussions also  dealt with ways in which France can participate to advance the  peace process in the region.    Talks also dealt with ways to ease Jordan's financial  difficulties resulting from its commitment to the UN resolutions  dealing with sanctions on Iraq and the inspection of ships  heading for al-'Aqabah port since France is a member of the UN  Sanctions Committee and the Security Council.    The guest minister promised to raise and discuss these  issues  with the officials in his country in order to achieve the best  results.    The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting  minister of state for foreign affairs, and the French ambassador  in Amman.    Meanwhile, the Jordanian side led by Dr. Abu-al-Ghanam, and  the French side led by Alain Juppe, held talks at the Prime  Ministry this morning in which bilateral relations and issues of  mutual interest were discussed.    In a statement to journalists following the talks, Finance  Minister Sami Qammuh said that the two sides discussed bilateral  relations in the political, economic, and cultural fields with  emphasis on a subject that is important to Jordan, that is,  Jordan's foreign debts that are beyond Jordan's means,  especially since the Paris Club's upcoming meeting late March  will discuss rescheduling the Jordanian debts.    Gammu said the guest minister has expressed his country's  full understanding of Jordan's position, and his support for  Jordan's positions and role in the region, as well as the  importance of bolstering this position and easing Jordan's  burdens, particularly its foreign debts.    He added that Juppe showed full understanding, and promised  to support Jordan during the Paris Club meeting that will  discuss rescheduling debts for 1994. These debts amount to  about $950 million, excluding the financing gap.    He said: Jordan's demand was not to be restricted to a  rescheduling process, which is a way of delaying these debts.  Our demand is to ease and reduce these debts because they  constitute a burden, and this step will not be easy without the  consensus of the international community.    He emphasized that the guest minister promised to extend all  appropriate support through the EEC and the Paris Club members.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Long-Term Effects of Critical Habitat Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The analysis of economic impacts of critical habitat designation was based primarily on data that are both current and calculable. Long-term economic impacts, especially on a county-level basis, explicitly have not been addressed. For example, although there may be a very low level of temporary unemployment (less than 0.1 percent) of those laborers on any given Federal allottee's lease/permit, it is normally anticipated that those workers will be reemployed within 2 years or be shifted to other private ranch lands in the short-term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A given county's receipt of grazing fees will be based on final administrative decisions by the surface managing agencies on the number of issued/reissued permits and their percentage revenue sharing base (cited in Schamberger  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mining may be impacted over the long term, but only to the extent that surface expansion is limited explicitly to avoid adverse modification to critical habitat. If such limitations do occur, they would also be predicated on governmental administrative decision at that time (by the BLM, military, tribal councils), but reasonably would be expected to be minimal both in percent and dollar-level impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Act, as stated in section 2(b), is to provide a means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend and to provide a program for the conservation of listed species. Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that ``*&blank;*&blank;* all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat); section 9 (prohibition of taking of listed species); section 10 (wildlife research permits and habitat conservation planning on non-Federal lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants); land acquisition; and research. Other Federal laws also require conservation of endangered and threatened species, such as the Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and various other State and Federal laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service's intent in designating critical habitat is to provide habitat that contains primary constituent elements in sufficient quantities to maintain viable populations of desert tortoises within the six recovery units. Critical habitat designation will help reduce the risk associated with the near-term reduction in desert tortoise numbers and cumulative loss of habitat anticipated from on-going management plans. Critical habitat offers additional protection through section 7, but it does not replace the management recommendations provided by the Draft Recovery Plan. Designation of critical habitat will, however, provide regulatory protection and help retain options until long-term conservation plans are accepted and fully implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Protections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The States of Nevada, California, Arizona, and Utah have established laws that provide varying levels of protection for individual desert tortoises. The State of Nevada affords limited protection to the desert tortoise, having established it as a protected reptile under section 501.110.1(d) of the Nevada Revised Statutes, protected and rare outside of the urban areas of Clark County (Las Vegas) under section 503.080.2 of the Nevada Administrative Code, and unlawful to transport across State lines without the written consent of the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Nevada does not have any laws that regulate the degradation of desert tortoise habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Fish and Game Commission listed the desert tortoise as a State threatened species on June 22, 1989, amending the California Code of Regulations, section 670.5(b)(4) of title 14. California has also designated the desert tortoise as its official State reptile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arizona Game and Fish Commission extended full protection from take to the desert tortoise, effective January 1, 1988, through Commission Order 43: Reptiles. Also prohibited is the sale of desert tortoises and their importation to the State, as well as the release of captive tortoises into the wild. There is no State authority in Arizona to regulate the modification of desert tortoise habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Utah, the desert tortoise is considered a ``prohibited reptile,'' protecting it from collection, importation, transportation, possession, sale, transfer, or release because it poses unacceptable disease, ecological, environmental, or human health or safety risks. No State regulations exist to stop the loss or degradation of desert tortoise habitat through land development or other actions (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

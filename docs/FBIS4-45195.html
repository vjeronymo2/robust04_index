			<p>CSO     [Text] Diego Valades, attorney general of the republic,  gave notice that efforts in the battle against the drug traffic  would be renewed, and that forceful action would be taken,  according to instructions from the president of the republic. He  added that there is an atmosphere of confidence in the  institutions and the force of law in Mexico.    He also declared that the drug traffickers "are acting  intensely," but claimed: "Our capacity for work, and our sense  of organization and responsibility, will make it possible to  achieve good results."    On a working tour of Sinaloa State, accompanied by the state  governor, he emphasized that the department headed by him "has  nothing to hide" regarding its policy for fighting the drug  traffic. Calling it "the policy set by the Federal Executive  Branch," he said that "there is also a commitment to inform the  citizens with absolute clarity."    He expressed the view that the amendments to Articles 16,  19,  20, and 119 of the General Constitution of the Republic would  make it possible to consolidate the prosecution of justice for  the benefit of the citizens, adding that they expand the  guarantees for those governed to a considerable extent.    During his visit to Sinaloa, the attorney general opened the  first regional branch office of the National Institute To Combat  Drugs, headed by commissioner Raul Campos Rabago.    There, he made an assessment of the battle against the drug  trade, claiming Sinaloa to be one of the states in which this  social cancer is being fought with the most intensity. He said  that this is proven by the fact that, during the past four  months of effort, as many drugs have been seized as during all  of last year: 11 tons of marijuana.    He cited the need not only to observe some negative aspects  of the battle against this illicit activity, but also to  consider the positive side, such as the search for and  procurement of sufficient material resources and human personnel  to fight these criminals.    He remarked: "Thanks to the action that has been taken to  counteract the drug traffic, the achievements have been positive  from the standpoint of seizing drugs, as well as seizing both  land and air transport vehicles."</p>

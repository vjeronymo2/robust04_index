			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Astra calms ulcer drug fears Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday insisted there were no scientific grounds to justify a threat by the German authorities to bar an intravenous application of its anti-ulcer drug Losec, the company's biggest-selling product and the world's fifth-largest selling prescription drug. News that BGA, the German health agency, was considering withdrawing approval of the intravenous injectible form of Losec on the suspicion that it was linked to hearing and eye disorders sent Astra's share price lurching downwards by 7 per cent on Friday. Astra A shares recovered later to end the day down 3 per cent at SKr171, but the company will be watching anxiously today to see if investors react further. The German action followed the appearance of vision and hearing impairments in patients being treated intravenously with Losec for bleeding ulcer conditions. The BGA said it was concerned that omeprazole, the active substance in Losec, caused the condition. Intravenous injection accounts for only a small percentage of Losec sales. But total sales of the drug were SKr127bn (Dollars 16.1bn) in 1993.</p>

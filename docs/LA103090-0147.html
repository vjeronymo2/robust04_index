But the newspaper has pledged to donate 10% of  its display ad revenue in September, October and November for canyon  preservation in the name of each advertiser. . . . "It's their money now,"  shrugs taxpayer's vice president Art Casebeer. "They can do what they want with  it, I guess." Ted Johnson and Gebe Martinez  </P></p>

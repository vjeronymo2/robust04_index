			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING CALL: HILL TAKES STEPS TO SEE SON PLAY  </P> <P> Talk about dedication. George Hill has not missed a Cleveland High basketball  game this season.  </P> <P> That's not surprising. Hill's son Eddie is a junior guard averaging 12 points a  game for Cleveland. And the Cavaliers are a victory away from the City Section  4-A Division semifinals as they play host to Fairfax today in the second round.  </P> <P> George Hill, however, currently in South Carolina on business, will go to great  lengths to keep the streak alive. He is scheduled to fly into town just in time  for tonight's 7:30 tip-off. Hill is then scheduled to return to South Carolina  on a midnight flight.  </P> <P> Should Cleveland defeat Fairfax, Hill intends to fly to L. A. for Friday  night's game at the Sports Arena, then once again catch the red-eye across  country.  </P> <P> Said Hill, simply: "I gotta see my boy play."  </P></p>

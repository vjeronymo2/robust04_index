			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK insurance The Association of British Insurers should have known better than to get into a public confrontation with the government over cover for acts of terrorism. Its inflexible demand for extension of full government cover to mainland Britain risks jeopardising the chances of a workable compromise. The industry needs one, though, to secure the continuing goodwill of both the government that regulates it and its large commercial customers. This is not to deny the industry's point. Continental reinsurers are unwilling to continue sharing terrorism risks, which would leave the UK insurers unacceptably exposed. Without the benefits of reinsurance, April's bomb in the City of London would have swallowed up most of the additional capital raised recently by the likes of Royal Insurance and Commercial Union. The proposed insurance pool looks sensible. A similar arrangement covering atomic energy risks provides something of a precedent. The problem is one of capacity. Without near universal participation by the insurers the capital in the pool would hardly cover the risks. Yet the reinsurers will doubtless be no more willing to join the pool than to assume the risk in a conventional manner. That suggests the government may have to step in, perhaps as a reinsurer of last resort. Even if an agreement is forthcoming, though, both sides will have to work fast to put adequate protection in place in time for next year. It would not help the UK's international competitiveness if companies could not fully insure their premises.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / N Sea oil output boosted The steady rise in North Sea oil and gas production - which has been a big factor behind falling international oil prices - will be boosted this week when the East Brae field off Scotland comes on-stream. The first oil should flow today or tomorrow, according to Marathon Oil, operator of the field. East Brae has a capacity of 100,000 barrels a day, although the initial production rate will be about 20,000 b/d. Investment in the field totals Pounds 867m. Output from the UK sector of the North Sea rose to 2.43m b/d in November, compared with 2.13m b/d a year earlier. Production will rise even further next year as new fields approach their peak production rates. The prospects for further gas finds in Liverpool Bay received a boost yesterday when Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and Monument Resources reported that an exploratory well had struck gas in a block 3km (1.8 miles) from the Hamilton gas field. Another well is expected to be drilled in the area. The developers of the Liverpool Bay project, which received approval from the government last month, have been confident of finding a number of smaller oil and gas accumulations near the main fields.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Visegrad, 25 Apr (TANJUG) -- The decision by Radovan  Karadzic, the president of the Srpska republic, and Yasushi  Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy, on the  withdrawal of the Serb forces around Gorazde is being  successfully implemented, Milan Gvero, deputy commander of the  Srpska republic's army, told a TANJUG reporter today.    According to Gvero, the Serb soldiers have withdrawn three  km  from the center of Gorazde, and the decision on the evacuation  of the wounded and civilians from Gorazde has also been  implemented. The passage of humanitarian convoys to Gorazde is  also continuing successfully, Gvero added.    He particularly stressed that he expected that UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] deployed along the separation lines would not  allow any further provocative actions by the Muslims from  Gorazde.    Gvero also said that today he had demanded from UN officials  that all Serb prisoners be unconditionally released from Gorazde  and that this should not be considered a prisoner exchange.  For, according to General Gvero, the Serbs have shown goodwill  so many times, by allowing humanitarian convoys in and by  withdrawing their troops from Gorazde.    It is time that the other side shows goodwill too, Gen.  Gvero  stressed.</p>

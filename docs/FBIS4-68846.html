			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Modestov: "Who Is Next? Today Even </F> Recognized Criminal World Authorities Are Not Immune From  Criminal Lawlessness"]    [Text]  <H5>  The "Queen of England" of the Caucasus Mafia </H5>   The first victim arrived in the admissions room of the  Balashikha TsRB [central rayon hospital] at 0940. Surgeons  diagnosed the condition without hesitation: bullet wound to the  right thigh. The wounded man--30-year-old Chechen  Osmayev--reported that he had been shot on Razina Street near  the office of the Rosinter company. At 1010 local resident  Marina B. was brought to the same hospital with a bullet wound  to a buttock.    A group of operatives that went to the site of the incident  barely got there in time. In the Volga sedan speeding out of the  city they detained a Rosinter company administrator and two  local residents without any particular employment. Under the car  seat the detectives from the ninth department of the oblast GUVD  [City Administration of Internal Affairs] Regional Organized  Crime Administration [RUOP] discovered a TT handgun and a couple  of loaded magazines (with three and seven cartridges). It soon  became clear why the magazines were not full. In the trunk of  the car was the body of mortally wounded 30-year-old Deryabin, a  resident of Zheleznodorozhnyy, also not employed. He died an  hour later without regaining consciousness in the intensive care  unit of the Balashikha TsRB from a bullet would to the eye.    The operatives encountered the main "surprise" later,  however. In the course of a ground search near the woods behind  Novaya village they discovered another corpse. The body of a  young man dressed in a well-made denim suit had been dumped in a  roadside ditch and covered with snow. The experienced detectives  realized that they were not dealing with an ordinary  "score-settling." They recognized the man, killed by a shot  through the back of his head, as 38-year-old Daudov--a  well-known "crime boss" nicknamed Sultan...    In the complex and constantly changing table of ranks of the  criminal world, Sultan had long held a special place. Suffice it  to say that he had been the only "crime boss" among the  Chechens. As is known, this ethnic group does not recognize the  traditions of "bosses" commonly followed in the criminal world.  Chechens remain faithful to their tribal ties and treat clan  elders with respect. Even the so-called "kitty"--a "thieves'"  treasury which exists mainly to support authorities and  "bosses," delivering parcels of "gravy" to investigative  detention facilities and labor camps, is made up of foreign  currency--not "wooden" rubles--"contributions" among Chechens.  Because of these circumstances, Sultan was considered a stranger  among their own both among Chechens and among Russians.    Sultan had four convictions. The first--a three-year prison  term--he got in his native Groznyy back in 1972. All in all he  had accumulated 14 years behind barbed wire... He did time in  the zone in Saratov, Bryansk, Tula, Voronezh, Rostov, and Moscow  Oblasts. As operatives who had known him tell it, Sultan was not  a simpleton. An offspring of a prominent Chechen family  (according to some data his father had worked as a party  functionary in Chechnya), he had his own view of many things,  and intellectually was far above most criminals around him.  Sultan liked to philosophize, gladly proffered advice (and not  bad at that, from what we heard), and was moderate in his use of  alcohol. He did have a weakness--grass; he could not stay off  it. However, even in prison Sultan kept up appearances--was  cleanly shaven, neat, and calm.    He left his family, was "crowned" in prison by Georgian  "bosses," and since then became something like the "Queen of  England" among Chechens. They recognized his authority, but did  not consider him "kin." Perhaps these circumstances eventually  led to Sultan's demise.  <H5>  Are "Thieves" Brothers? </H5>   That morning Sultan, accompanied by his bodyguard Deryabin,  was leaving for Crimea for a meeting with a local authority  nicknamed Shoe. When their Jeep was on its way to the airport,  Sultan suddenly suggested that they stop briefly at Rosinter on  business.    Deryabin was the first to walk into the office. Sultan  lingered for a moment--he was showing something to driver  Osmayev on the car's dashboard. Subsequent events are still to  be reconstructed in detail. (For quite understandable reasons,  witnesses to the murder prefer to keep their mouths shut.) It is  obvious, however, that Sultan and his "cover" were dealt with  professionally, calmly, and cruelly. The operatives also believe  that the victim had a large amount of money from the "kitty" on  him. The money has not yet been found. Oblast RUOP detectives  also know the names of the murderers. What is not entirely clear  is the motive for the murder--who is behind the shooting in the  Rosinter office?    One of the versions is revenge for Balashikha authority  Frol,  killed on the last day of last year (PODMOSKOVYE No. 9 devoted  an article "Epitaph for a `Godfather'" to this event). Frol had  a long-running feud with the "Chechen community"--he was one of  the leaders of the "Slavic wing" of the domestic mafia. He was  threatened many times, and the confrontation, which by some  estimates had been going on since 1988, in 1993 spilled out into  a series of score-settling altercations between Frol's shock  troopers and the Caucasians. On 18 August, for instance, Frol's  villa was fired at by a grenade launcher. The victim decided not  to report the incident to the militia. "Maybe gasoline canisters  exploded in the garage," he told detectives. Frol's response was  much more "tangible." Soon a series of explosions rolled through  Chechen-"protected" sales outlets in Balashikha Rayon.    Sultan lived in Balashikha and of course knew Frol well.  Frol  even contributed money to the "kitty." So far there are no  grounds, however, to contend that he was the person who gave the  "green light" to Frol's killing. Neither can one say with  certainty that Frol's group had something to do with Sultan's  death. There are other versions as well.    Frol was not the only one to take a stand against the  Chechens' preponderance in the capital city metropolitan area.  According to operatives, "bosses" do not like the Chechens,  considering them people who do not live by the law of the  criminals. The Chechens constantly clash with "bosses" and  invade the territory of others, which results in armed clashes  and score-settling. This also explains the attitude of the  "bosses'" lobby to the Chechen authorities. "Crime bosses" do  not want Chechens to have a voice at "conferences." In this  respect, Sultan's behavior was indicative in that he had tried  twice to promote Mairbek, a Chechen, to "thief" status. The  attempts failed twice... The late Globe [Globus] was also  unhappy with Sultan. The famous "boss" said more than once that  Sultan was "flaky," that is, gave the "boss" title to young  criminals who had not earned this "high honor." Interestingly, a  young leader nicknamed Pushkin (he controlled Podolsk and  Serpukhov), who had been "crowned" by Sultan last year, was  "quietly" shot dead by an unknown assailant. For a real  authoritative "boss" this is impermissible. The death of any of  them is an extraordinary event, which is discussed at a  "conference," with appropriate "organizational conclusions."    Sultan's relations with the late "boss" Barberry [Kalina]  were no less strained. Barberry's derogatory remarks about the  Chechens (behind his back he called Sultan an ape and a Czech)  compelled Sultan to threaten to kill him. So Barberry, having  figured out that he was playing with fire, went to Serpukhov,  where Sultan was sitting in the SIZO [preliminary investigative  detention facility], and apologized to the "comrade" for  "accidentally dropped words." In the Serpukhov SIZO, on the  other hand, the attitude toward the Chechen was that of utmost  respect. Two local "bosses" treated Sultan with attention  appropriate to his rank. This is understandable--no "boss" will  insult another one in his face. As is known, "bosses" are  brothers.  <H5>  Going to Crimea--Taken to Chechnya </H5>   After Sultan's murder, an assassination attempt was made  against his good friend, a Lyubertsy authority nicknamed Avil.  The latter was nearly shot to death in Solntsevo by an unknown  criminal. The killer fired several shots from a Makarov handgun  when Avil left his apartment to walk his dog. He did not die,  but ended up in a very serious condition in a hospital.    The operatives remember an incident that happened back in  1989 at the Old Castle restaurant. It all started with some  Caucasians occupying a table next to the one where Sultan and  Avil were sitting began to get rowdy. Sultan walked over to  them, introduced himself, and asked them to tone it down. The  mountain people, high from all the wine they had drunk, told the  "boss" to get lost. Naturally, a fight ensued in which the  "boss" ended up with broken ribs and a cracked skull. The next  day Avil came to the Old Castle, shot the bartender dead with a  sawn-off shotgun, and mortally wounded one of Sultan's offenders  with a sharpened screwdriver...    Does this story offer an explanation of the demise of the  Chechen "boss"? I think this version does not hold water even by  a long stretch of imagination. Neither does another one  frequently discussed by journalists. They talk about the  so-called supersecret "White Arrow" team allegedly created on  the personal orders of the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] leadership for secret suppression of criminal  "authorities." Those who have gained a knowledge of the criminal  world mores from operational work experience rather than from  newspaper articles do not take this tale seriously. It is  obvious that the "White Arrow" myth is being spread precisely by  those bandits who want to write off the blood and murder of  their own confederates to the militia. The causal connection  here is much more simple and material. Behind the death of every  "boss" is enormous money, influence, and a complex disposition  of forces in the criminal world and the criminal economy. So why  did Sultan, who was heading for the warm sea of Crimea, end up  traveling in a casket to his native Chechnya?    Operatives think it possible that the cause of Sultan's  demise may lie in his sharing a neighborhood with Zakhar, also a  "boss" who lives in Balashikha. The latter is known as an  authority who sticks to strict labor camp traditions. He never  concealed his Slavic orientation and claim to leadership in his  territory. According to detectives, Zakhar cannot stand the  Chechens. He knows the "law" very well, but he knows equally  well the golden rule: As a rule, the fight is won by whoever  strikes first and strikes hard. And, as they say, the winners  are not judged...    Was a "shoot" set up for Sultan in the office? And if it  was,  by whom and why? In keeping with tradition, only an equal--that  is, another "boss"--can make an appointment for a "boss."  Actually, the hidden springs of this incident are still not  known. But the operatives, while not dismissing the possibility  of Zakhar's involvement in the bloody "score-settling," know  perfectly well that he himself did not kill Sultan. It is just  that any lead deserves attention and discussion.    ...Over the last half-year alone dozens of criminal world  authorities have been killed in the Moscow region; well-known  crime bosses have fallen victim to shootouts and contract  murders. It is an unprecedented situation; not a single one  among experienced detectives can recall anything like this.  These days a bullet fired by a small-time criminal, who has  barely staked his place among his kind, may take the life of a  criminal world "patriarch," a single word from whom in the past  could change the situation in entire oblasts of Russia.    The "thieves" Globe, Pipiya, Pushkin, and Arsen have been  killed. Givi Scarface disappeared without a trace. Georgian  "boss" Roin also faded into the night while driving home from a  casino. Sultan has been shot dead... And an uncountable number  of less prominent personalities. Bobon was torn apart by a  submachine gun burst; Little Falcon [Sokolenok] shot dead in  front of his apartment; Mikota died of a gunshot would to the  head in a cafe in Kolomenskoye; in Lyubertsy, Hare [Zayats] died  at the door of his own home; Kruglov, nicknamed Beard [Boroda],  was found in Yauza river with a garrote around his neck. There  is a virtual hunt for the "boss" nicknamed Signature [Rospis],  who is considered the most active fighter against the Caucasian  preponderance in the capital city region.    Signature has been hit by a sniper bullet twice. The first  time he was saved by a bullet-proof vest; the second--by his  bodyguard Sharapov, who was killed on the spot. Signature did  not escape unharmed, though. The same bullet that killed  Sharapov hit the "boss" in the liver and tore through his  kidney. It was a miracle that he lived; he flew to the United  States, had surgery there, returned, and came under fire again.  When he left his home accompanied by his bodyguard Shaykhullin  and headed for his Volga car, unknown perpetrators blew up a car  parked nearby. The charge was so powerful that all the windows  in the building--from the first to the 10th floor--were  shattered. This is not the worst, however. Innocent bystanders  were hurt--two girls playing in the courtyard, and two  passers-by. The bodyguard was also killed on the spot. Signature  survived and was taken to hospital in a critical condition.  Doctors list his condition as satisfactory. Quite possibly,  Signature will soon get back into business again. A reasonable  question, through: For how long? And another one: What will the  killers come up with this time to find a more reliable way to  eliminate the adversary? Perhaps blow up an overpass as  Signature's car travels on it? Or will they blow up an entire  rayon when the authority holds an appointed meeting? Operatives  believe, however, that Signature may feel it is prudent to leave  again for the United States...    Lawlessness [bespredel]. This slang word, which means  mocking  even the norms of "morality" commonly accepted in the criminal  world, is increasingly often defining our current life. First we  registered a rise in crime, then we had to admit that it had  practically got out of control. And finally we agreed that crime  itself has undergone a qualitative change. Now lawlessness has  become the norm rather than the exception, and fighting  gangsters who have long lost the notion of propriety is not just  difficult--it is nearly impossible.    "Our laws, the criminal and criminal process codes,  normative  acts, and other juridical mechanisms were created with a  civilized society in mind," is the opinion of Aleksandr  Kartashev, chief of the Moscow Oblast GUVD Regional Organized  Crime Department. "They do not meet the requirements of the  current situation, cannot protect to a full extent society and  its citizens. People get shot, blown up, and stabbed to death in  broad daylight. Brainless, stupid retards pull the trigger  without a second thought. The situation is increasingly often  characterized as extraordinary. What do we have to counter this  lawlessness? Almost nothing except the courage and enthusiasm of  our staff. Hiding behind the letter of the law, leaders and  authorities find loopholes in the criminal code with the help of  high-powered lawyers and escape punishment. In order to  realistically grab a gang organizer, we need a law on criminal  activities, a law on protection of witnesses, and a law on  organized crime. It is necessary to toughen the penalties for  illegal possession of weapons and ammunition. We should think  through how to punish the mercenaries who are coming here from  "hot spots" and are ready to commit any crime. Until these  issues are resolved, we can hardly expect results commensurate  with the militia's efforts in its struggle against runaway crime.</p>

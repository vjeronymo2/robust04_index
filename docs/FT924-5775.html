			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Management: The network links up - Europe's largest computer services company is fast being transformed The vital step from being a company with many international subsidiaries to becoming a true multinational group can make or break a business. One company facing just that challenge today is the FFr10bn (Pounds 1.22bn) turnover Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS), Europe's largest computer services company. It is in the throes of trying to turn itself from a loosely co-ordinated federation of small autonomous branches in 16 countries into a single coherent group in the midst of the toughest downturn it has ever experienced. What CGS is going through provides a valuable example for other companies facing the same painful transformation, as they adapt their organisations to the internationalisation of their markets. 'It is a major cultural change, a huge process,' says Geoff Unwin, one of CGS's presidents responsible for implementing the change. Branch managers have been asked to pool much of their cherished independence and learn to work in partnership with other subsidiaries. The key has been to get the right balance between the dose of centralisation needed to make this possible, while not harming the independent spirit which fosters vital creativity in service businesses, CGS executives explain . The new organisation, presented at a conference of CGS's top 500 managers last June, has not been easy to set up. Implementation has only just begun, three years after Serge Kampf, founder and chairman of the 17-year-old French group, opened an internal debate. The change came in response to several problems which will strike echoes with other internationally expanding groups. CGS's staff has doubled, mainly through acquisitions, to 21,000 over five years, outstripping the old, highly decentralised organisation. Its big customers increasingly demand identical computer services in several countries at once, such as a recent order from BP Oil to harmonise its national computer systems across Europe. It also faces growing cut-price competition from computer producers which are diversifying into CGS's core business because of the downturn in the hardware market. 'The old organisation, a myriad of 50-person branches, was easy to control,' says Philippe Gluntz, the former Alcatel executive hired three years ago to lead the re-think. 'All you had to do was to tell them to make a profit and give customer satisfaction. We now move to a more complex world, where a 50-person branch cannot supply the range of technologies and services that a customer requires.' Unwin, former chairman of Hoskyns, the UK group which is CGS's biggest acquisition, adds: 'We have been through a period of what you might call strategic assembly, of buying companies and letting them run themselves. Now we need to be able to operate transnationally.' The solution, decided after intense internal debate, was to leave the local branches intact but to organise them into seven so-called 'strategic business areas (SBAs)' each employing an average of 3,500 people. The SBAs, each managed by two vice-presidents, are organised along both geographical and industry sector lines so that different regions specialise in the sector where they are naturally strong. France handles telecommunications, for example, while the US handles oil and gas and the UK is in charge of finance and 'outsourcing' - where corporate customers asks contractors to manage their entire data processing departments - a fast-growing part of CGS's business. Each area is then split into seven so-called 'market development units', which co-ordinate the old branches. In this way, explains Unwin, an SBA member branch can take an order from a local customer which might be outside its usual business sector or geographical area and sub-contract it within the group. Previously, the local branch might not even have considered trying to win such a contract. To help different units across the world work on the same projects coherently, the group has drawn up what Unwin calls a 'highway code' of common legal and technical definitions. This is supported by CGS's first cross-group quality control system, christened Perform, which sets common standards for the kinds of technical solutions customers will be offered and the conduct of projects. It also defines the scope of contracts. 'We have tried to take the best practice from each unit and apply it across the group. You can't afford to spend weeks arguing about which kind of software to use while the competition walks by,' explains Unwin. Perform is to be operational across the group by the end of this year. CGS has turned to its own management consultancy arm, Gemini Consulting, to help spread the message across the group, employing at one stage 500 people in a joint CGS-Gemini Consulting team. CGS has always had a consultancy unit, but expanded it substantially two years ago on the grounds that an increasing number of clients' computer problems had a human management dimension as well. Gemini Consulting, formed from the merger of three acquisitions with the group's own team, has 1,500 consultants. Another tool to encourage more team behaviour has been to alter the pay bonus system from rewarding individual performance alone, to rewarding sector performance as well. In the end, says Unwin, most branch managers realised they had no choice because the old organisation simply did not fit with the way the industry was moving. 'The larger companies are grabbing market share, and gradually moving down to push out smaller players. So you will see a polarisation between big multinationals and small niche players, active in one country only. The branch managers knew they would simply be pushed out of the market by this process unless they took advantage of CGS's internationalisation,' says Unwin. CGS had no inkling that it was about to enter the toughest market conditions it has ever known when it embarked on the rethink. Last year, CGS's profits fell for the first time - by 10 per cent - due to a reduction in big customers' investment in computer services and the increase in competition from computer suppliers. There have, as a result, been staff reductions in some areas with 500 job losses in France this year. Surprisingly, Unwin has no regrets about what might look like unfortunate timing. 'Perversely, these tough market conditions are helping us change. They make people question what they are doing. It's the trigger we need.' Other managers in other industries could well benefit from making the most of bad times while they last.</p>

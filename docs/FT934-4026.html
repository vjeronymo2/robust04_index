			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Summit fails to resolve CBoT feud with Globex The summit between the major participants in the Globex electronic futures trading system has made clear that unless the Chicago Board of Trade makes operational concessions demanded by Reuters, it will be left out of the Globex system next year. At the same time Reuters and the joint venture committee that runs Globex are clearing the obstacles that have kept Liffe, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, from joining the system. 'We are facing the possibility that Globex will go on as a partnership between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Matif and Liffe, without the Board of Trade,' said one executive close to the meetings. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the CBoT, and Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters project manager for Globex, attended the summit. None of those attending last week's meeting was willing to comment on the proceedings. But officials said privately that Reuters' patience with the CBoT had grown thin and, while the company was willing to continue to take losses on Globex, it wanted participating exchanges to help boost volume on the system. Reuters wants the CBoT, the world's busiest futures exchange, to list its agricultural contracts on Globex, and to list its giant US Treasury bond futures and options contracts for much longer trading periods. Reuters is also worried that the CBoT's Project A electronic trading system will become a direct Globex competitor and wants it abandoned. The CBoT has resisted these changes. The 18-month-old Globex recorded turnover of 608,719 contracts in November, up 88 per cent from 1992. Paris's Matif contributed 78 per cent of that volume, while CME generated 13 per cent, and the CBoT 9 per cent. While growing steadily, Globex volume is far below targets, and its under-performance is expected to result in a major restructuring when operating contracts reopen this spring. Reuters, the CME and the CBoT are currently joint venture partners in the system. Officials expect a reorganised Globex to give equal governance powers to all participating exchanges, a feature that would lure Liffe, and other exchanges, on to the system.</p>

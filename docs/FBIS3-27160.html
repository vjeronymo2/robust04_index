In a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, he said the other two priorities were to take action to  consolidate other safe areas in Bosnia and to urge the warring  factions to reach an accord on a peaceful settlement based on  the European Union (EU) plan.    According to the Russian president's press office, leaders  of  the two countries expressed support for an active UN role in  resolving the Bosnian issue and said the proposal put forward by  mediator states to end the conflict through political means was  very important.    They hoped that the meeting of foreign ministers from  Russia,  the United States and EU member states, which is to be held  Tuesday [22 February] in Bonn, would present specific measures  for solving the Bosnian issue through political means.    Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev today  reiterated Russia's hope that leaders from Russia, the United  States, Britain, France and Germany would hold special talks on  the Bosnian situation.    In a conversation over the telephone with his U.S.  counterpart William Perry, he also suggested that defense  ministers from these countries meet to discuss specific measures  for resolving the Bosnia crisis.    The Russian television reported that Perry had rejected  Grachev's proposal to send U.S. peacekeepers into Bosnia's  Muslim-dominated areas, but said his country would discuss the  matter with its Western allies.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Rosyth closure threatens 2000 jobs Closure of Rosyth naval base in Fife would put 1,600 naval jobs and 400 civilian posts at risk. Its operations have been scaled back in recent years and the small ships handled there may be transferred to Portsmouth. Rosyth dockyard would not be affected. The RAF's support services are also a target because maintenance of aircraft is particularly labour-intensive and costly. The Logistics Command employs 13,000 people and could be transferred to the private sector. Some defence analysts, however, expect a substantially slimmed-down operation to run in tandem with private-sector maintenance companies. Other large manpower cuts might include slimming the Procurement Executive, responsible for buying forces' equipment, and running down medical and veterinary services. Old inter-service rivalries may be challenged. Analysts think consolidating all three staff colleges into a single base at Camberley would be logical. Staff from the RAF headquarters at High Wycombe and the army headquarters at Wilton may also be squeezed into a unified command at the Navy's base at North-wood. Smaller targets for the MoD knife may include chaplains and music.</p>

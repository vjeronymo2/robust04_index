			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: National gift for water colours - William Packer admires the exhibition at the Royal Academy PONT, that conspicuous ornament of pre-War Punch, got it just about right in his studies of 'The British Character'. There she sits, the little old lady confidently at work in the picturesque French town, her easel set up smack between the tramlines in the middle of the street while the awed populace, down to the cat and dog, looks on. Yes, we do pride ourselves as a nation on having, as his caption puts it, 'The gift of water colours'. That we should thus fix upon what we also instinctively characterise as a minor form of the art of painting is a nice point. For, if this magnificent exhibition at the Academy does nothing else, it demonstrates for ever the absurdity of the distinction that would make oil on canvas inherently superior to water-colour on paper, simply because it is oil on canvas. We have only to look to Thomas Rowlandson, almost exclusively a water-colourist and draughtsman, to take the proof. Yet he, one of our most particular and engaging artists, is oddly under-represented here. The question hangs in the air: would he, even now, be taken more seriously had he chosen to work principally in oil on canvas? John Frederick Lewis, the outstanding mid-Victorian water-colourist, whose Orientalist subjects such as 'Life in the Harem' and 'The Pipe-bearer' were the sensation of the 1850s, was later forced to switch to the more profitable oil, simply to make a living. Clearly the prejudice is nothing new. Yet again, going through the show, it remains inescapeable that few of the artists, the greatest among them especially, from Turner, Bonington and Constable to Whistler, were exclusive specialists. The truth is that painting of any kind is an extremely practical business and artists work in whichever medium is most appropriate, or simply available, to their immediate purpose. It may be more lasting and resilient, but oil paint is heavy and canvas cumbersome. The natural portability of water-colour, its flexibility of execution and speed of drying are obvious advantages, the more so in a time when to be a landscape painter was to be a traveller, and the British painter the most inveterate traveller of all. That water-colour should also be as tricky and testing a medium as any, requiring at any level considerable sophistication of technique, is an irony quite lost in the enthusiasm of the amateur. In particular it requires a commitment and decision that may be as extreme as anything of Zen calligraphy and the formal conventions of the Far Eastern landscape traditions. In the first period and introductory section - under the somewhat stuffy label of The Structure of Landscape: 18th century Theory - come Alexander Cozens and William Gilpin with their random blots in practice and their theories of the romantic and picturesque landscape. That they should actually achieve images of forest, lake and mountain so close in spirit to the idealised landscapes of the Chinese masters must have been a matter of intuitive sympathy, for the fact passes unremarked in the accompanying texts. Throughout there is more than enough of infinite charm to satisfy any more literal and descriptive taste, from the topographical studies of Paul Sandby, to the townscapes of Samuel Prout and Thomas Shotter Boys, to the undergrowth tracery of John Ruskin and the birds' nests of William Hunt. Even so, it is ever that technical engagement that, in its free-est and most abstracted expression, takes the breath away. Turner, greatest of the artists, supplies the thread that pulls the show together through its several thematic sections, but he is also the best known and so not, for once, the star. Rather it is David Cox on Rhyl Sands, or perhaps Thomas Girtin in the Rue St Denis, or John Middleton in a shady lane, or Linnell and Whistler with their grey seas and sailing boats, or Peter de Wint, or John Sell Cotman: whichever we are looking at, for its broad, radical simplicity of image, its expressive spread of paint, its swift, comprehending, comprehensive stroke. And was this truly the golden age? No, but simply the better known and the more critically established. The inclusion of Whistler, with all it implies of what was to follow, begs the question. There is nothing for it but another and no less splendid show.

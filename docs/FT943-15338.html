			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: A new light to shine upon the world - Lucia van der Post has found a modern successor to an old favourite The Anglepoise lamp, now 60 years old, is a design classic. It is as sturdily attractive and practical today as when it first came on the market. The original Anglepoise lamp was a trail-blazer in its day, offering, as it did, flexible lighting using hinges based on the bending of the human arm. The same company has now produced an updated version - equally flexible but using a system derived from studies of the human spine. The Artikula lamp is, indubitably, of a different generation. It looks clean, spare, almost space-age in its uncompromising modernity. It, too, is a reading or working lamp, designed to sit on a table or desk top or be clamped to the side of furniture or shelves. Made from a mixture of nylon, polycarbonate and stainless steel, it is available in slate grey with a choice of other colours on the top of the shade. It has a reach of 1 metre and its chief practical claim is that it is highly flexible. There is a single or double-jointed model. The double-jointed version will be on sale at the end of the month and will cost about Pounds 105, the single later in the year. For details of stockists apply to Anglepoise, Enfield Industrial Area, Redditch B97 6DR. Tel: 0527-63771. Regular readers of How To Spend It and Jancis Robinson's wine column will have heard of Riedel wine glasses and of the intense care that has gone into developing a glass for each grape type, thus enabling the imbiber to enjoy to the full the particular properties of each. Now Riedel has produced a glass for ordinary everyday use. The Gourmet glass, with a tulip-shaped bowl, is designed for drinking anything from mineral water to claret. It is just 6in tall, so can fit into the top drawer of a dishwasher and costs Pounds 5.95. Most department stores and wine merchants sell them.</p>

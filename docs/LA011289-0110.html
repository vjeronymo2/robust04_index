			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILDLIFE OFFICIAL WHO RAISED ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS DISMISSED  </P> <P> Rolf Wallenstrom, director of the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service who raised concerns about offshore oil drilling in California and  agricultural pollution at western wildlife refuges, has been fired.  </P> <P> Calling himself the target of agency politics, Wallenstrom, 56, confirmed  Tuesday that he has been fired effective Friday. He said he is considering an  appeal to the federal Merit System Review Board or a lawsuit.  </P> <P> Department of Interior officials said Wallenstrom was terminated for refusing a  transfer to a new post. Wallenstrom contended the job was created to isolate  him from decision-making in several western states.  </P> <P> Wallenstrom, based in Portland, Ore., argued that he was the victim of a  political vendetta by Fish and Wildlife Director Frank Dunkle. Dunkle, who is  seeking reappointment, has rejected UPI requests for interviews on the  Wallenstrom matter.  </P> <P> He issued a statement Tuesday expressing regret that a career employee "had  chosen to leave the service under unfortunate circumstances." He said  Wallenstrom "tried to politicize an issue that had nothing to do with  politics."  </P> <P> Wallenstrom said a decision to appeal would be "influenced by whether Frank  Dunkle is reappointed. If he leaves and I leave, then I will not appeal,"  Wallenstrom said. "If he is maintained, and if I can afford it, I probably will  appeal."  </P> <P> Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who has tried to save Wallenstrom's job, said  she was "appalled" at his firing. "It was bad enough he was reassigned and now  he's been fired for trying to do an objective job," Boxer said.  </P> <P> Boxer led a group of 20 members of Congress from four states who requested an  investigation by the General Accounting Office in November into the Wallenstrom  matter and other alleged efforts by Dunkle to politicize the agency. That  investigation is under way.  </P> <P> The dispute began last summer after disclosure of an internal report that said  oil drilling off the Northern California coast could have disastrous  environmental consequences. President-elect Bush supported the oil drilling  proposals until the report was leaked to the news media. Wallenstrom said  Dunkle unfairly blamed him for leaking the memo.  </P> <P> Dunkle said he wanted Wallenstrom to take a newly created position to oversee  investigations into pollution problems at the Kesterson National Wildlife  Refuge in Central California and at other western wildlife refuges polluted by  Interior Department irrigation projects.  </P> <P> Wallenstrom refused to take the position and Dunkle called for his ouster.  </P> <P> Susan Recce, the department's deputy assistant secretary for fish and wildlife  and parks, wrote a five-page letter to Wallenstrom last week upholding the  firing.  </P></p>

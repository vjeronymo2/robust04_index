			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Top EBRD official accuses Attali of misleading him MR RON FREEMAN, first vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has taken the offensive in an increasingly heated battle over top management changes at the bank by accusing Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, of misleading him. He made the allegation at a meeting on Monday of the EBRD's finance committee, when he also accused Mr Attali of ignoring an instruction from the chairman of the bank's governors, Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, to delay discussion of the reorganisation proposal. At a meeting yesterday of the bank's directors, who represent countries and agencies which own the bank, Mr Attali made it clear he was pressing ahead with plans for two new senior vice-presidencies. This change would have the effect of demoting Mr Freeman from number two to number four at the bank. Mr Freeman told the meeting on Monday he felt he had been misled over the past few months. Those present had the impression he was referring mainly to being misled by Mr Attali about the reorganisation plan. 'We got the sense that he felt he had been betrayed in other respects as well,' said a bank executive, who called Mr Freeman's outburst 'astonishing'. Mr Attali is also proposing that the EBRD's merchant banking department, responsible for making investments in private sector projects in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, should be merged with the development banking department, which is in charge of infrastructure projects. They would be headed by a new chief operating officer, likely to be Mr Ernest Stern, currently number two at the World Bank. Mr Freeman has taken steps to increase his control of the merchant banking department. He has sent out a message to all members of the department stating that he has relieved Mr Guy de Selliers of his 'responsibility of serving as my deputy for the time being'. He said Mr de Selliers would remain responsible for the project work for which he is assigned, but merchant bank team leaders would no longer report to him. Mr de Selliers yesterday sent out a memo saying he would like to go on working for Mr Freeman and enjoying his trust, but that he had also worked closely with and enjoyed the trust of Mr Attali. The memo says taking sides would mean betraying the trust of Mr Freeman or Mr Attali. Mr Attali's plan has received support from senior finance officials of the G7 group of industrial countries. However, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has been warned in a letter from Mr Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, that under US law Mr Pell must be consulted before any changes in EBRD vice-presidencies are put into effect.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (14): Weathering the storm - New commercial property developments IMPERIAL HOUSE sits within a few hundred yards of the M4 motorway at the western edge of Newport. It is empty at the moment but has been put up speculatively as a joint venture between the Welsh Development Agency, Newport borough council and London University's Imperial College of Science and Technology as the cornerstone of Imperial Park, a science park that is intended to attract the best in the world to this corner of Wales. Imperial House may be empty now but it is on the verge of attracting its first tenant less than three months after being opened at the end of June. A leading European concern, a world leader in its field, has talked about taking two suites for a research centre. Imperial Park, a 50-acre site within the much larger Celtic Lakes development being undertaken by Trencherwood and the local Bassaleg Group, is intended to be the flagship property development in Wales. Celtic Lakes, a Pounds 250m business park is intended to compete with the best in Britain, according to its developers, able to stand comparison with Aztec West in Bristol, the Birmingham business park, the Solent business park at Southampton, or Stockley Park near London's Heathrow airport. The WDA's chairman, Dr Gwyn Jones, who has already been to Japan and the Far East once to extol the virtues of Imperial Park, says: 'Imperial will be a formidable force in attracting even more Japanese companies to Wales. It also enhances the prospects for indigenous business growth.' To launch a science park in the middle of the deepest property recession since the war might seem foolhardy. But south Wales at least has managed to weather the downturn in the economy remarkably well. Mr Freddie Watson, director of Grosvenor Waterside, the property arm of Associated British Ports, in Cardiff may be excused excessive enthusiasm when he says that 'although the property market in Britain is stagnant we are going at 100 miles an hour down here,' but he can at least point to tangible evidence to support his claim. Grosvenor has two pre-let projects, one from the public sector, the other from the private, amounting to 250,000sq ft. 'Where can you find 250,000sq ft of pre-let property anywhere else,' he beams. Nor is it just a matter of Cardiff. Grosvenor has ambitious plans for Swansea, where the first major office building in 40 years has just been completed. The WDA's Dr Jones says south Wales has bucked the trend in the property market, and forecasts that over Pounds 12m will have been invested in Welsh property as a result of private-sector partnerships agreed with the agency in the second quarter alone of this year. Last year the agency's joint schemes led to 800,000 sq ft of new working space being planned, a figure Dr Jones expects to see topped by at least 100,000 sq ft this year. 'There is now a more effective and efficient property market in Wales,' Dr Jones says. Despite the difficulties in the property market, Wales is still attracting increasing private-sector investment.' That optimism is borne out by some figures. The WDA has reported a 45 per cent increase in lettings for the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 1991. Between January and June it let more than 1.1m sq ft of industrial and commercial space, a rise of 347,000 sq ft. A more cautious view is taken by Mr Peter Kelly, director of Debenhams in Cardiff. 'There is a gratifying amount of activity about,' he says, 'especially in the retail sector and among some of the locally-based developers. The two pre-lets in Cardiff Bay are very significant, and with infrastructure work on the second Severn bridge having started, the potential exists for expansion. 'But it is potential and we are not expecting any great material change in the market. The point about south Wales is that the market has stabilised and we don't expect it to decline because there is no significant area of oversupply.' Mr Bernard Ryan, chief executive of the Land Authority for Wales, sees south-east and north-east Wales as being the two areas where interest is greatest - 'the North Pentwyn site in Cardiff offers great opportunities,' he says. 'Apart from housing and leisure interest there are 90 acres of employment land which will produce between 1m and 1.5m sq ft of space. This is being undertaken as a joint venture between the WDA, DMD, a local company, and the Italian concern, Cogefar-Impresit, a subsidiary of Fiat which built the Kariba dam in Africa. 'Other developments are taking place in Caerphilly, led by Boots the Chemist, as well as at Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend. Generally, I am fairly optimistic about the situation.' The one area where movement is difficult is in north Wales. With the exception of the Redrow group, which is locally-based, though it operates nationally, it is being left to the smaller and medium-sized developers to sustain the market. Mr Ryan says that even in these difficult times, though, a steady flow of land is released to developers in north Wales, 'which may not be headline news but it does keep the market moving. The market never drops here as it has done in England.'</p>

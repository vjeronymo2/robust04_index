			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEN. HELMS-TYPE EDICT IS NO-NO, ACLU TELLS CITY;  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP: COSTA MESA VICE MAYOR SAYS THE POLICY WILL NOT CONTAIN RESTRICTIONS  ON ARTS CONTENT AND WILL APPLY TO ALL ORGANIZATIONS SEEKING MONEY FROM THE  CITY.  </P> <P> Members of the Costa Mesa City Council, who at their last meeting ordered the  city attorney to draft new policies on awarding arts grants, were warned in a  letter Thursday of "vigorous opposition" from the American Civil Liberties  Union of Southern California if there is "any attempt to enact Helms-type  language."  </P> <P> The ACLU letter was prompted by broad content restrictions proposed by two  Costa Mesa residents, John and Ernie Feeney, in a letter to Mayor Peter F.  Buffa, which he passed to City Atty. Thomas Kathe as a possible model for new  arts grant contract language.  </P> <P> Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle said Thursday that she had not yet received the ACLU  letter but that she understands the language being drafted will not include  content restrictions and will be "rather generic" compared to that proposed by  the Feeneys.  </P> <P> In wording that mirrored language proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms for the National  Endowment for the Arts, the Feeneys proposed this clause: "By accepting this  grant, the recipient agrees to neither visually nor verbally, deliberately  denigrate anyone's race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical  handicap, marital status, sex or age." The Helms proposal was rejected by  Congress.  </P> <P> In a statement, the ACLU said the Feeney proposal "fails both the spirit and  the law of the First Amendment." The language, the statement continued, "is  vague and overbroad" and provides "no fair idea to either the artists or the  government officials evaluating applications as to what art will be denied  funding by the city."  </P> <P> Hornbuckle said she has been told that the new contract language will require  that organizations provide strict accounting showing that none of the money is  used for political activity, a procedure that Hornbuckle said is widespread,  but will not include content restrictions. Furthermore, the language would  apply to all organizations that receive funds from the city, not just arts  groups. The draft language could be put before the city at its meeting Monday.  </P> <P> The brouhaha started when the city, acting on a complaint by John Feeney,  delayed distribution of $175,000 in cultural arts grants to investigate whether  South Coast Repertory used any city funds in printing and distributing flyers  supporting the NEA. Such an expenditure would have put the city in the position  of endorsing a political activity, according to Buffa.  </P> <P> The funds, including $30,000 for SCR, eventually were released when the theater  company assured the city that no public money had been used for the flyer.  </P></p>

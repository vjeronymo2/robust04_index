			<p>BFN     [Text] On the second day of his visit to Gilan, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani attended the session of the provincial  administrative council. At this session, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed his gratitude for the pure  sentiments of the dedicated people of Gilan and asked the  officials to be more compassionate toward the people. He said  that the people fully comprehend the difference between service  and work on the one hand and the mere shouting of slogans.    Regarding the supply of potable water in Gilan, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that with the construction of the Estur  dam, the needs of the province would be fully met. He said: We  have approved Anzali port as a protected area; this will  naturally cause a major change in Gilan Province. He added:  Bandar-e Anzali is certainly one of the focuses for our trade  activity in Central Asia. Astara has its own role to play and we  are striving to implement massive projects in Astara as well.  With the construction of a huge bridge in Astara, we will be  able to link all routes to Astara; this in itself will have a  great impact on transit and maritime activities.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: We have raised the purchase prices  of green tea leaves by 14 percent and we pay a further 17  percent to the tea-manufacturing plants. As for the  construction of tea-manufacturing plants, we should act in such  a way that the people and the private sector stand to gain by  participating in this field. We should encourage investment in  this country.    He continued: At present our factories do not need steel and  petrochemicals, and many spare parts are also manufactured in  this country. Much of the other materials are also being  manufactured in Iran. All this indicates that this is a period  of endeavor and construction in our country.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani called on all 'ulema, Friday  imams, clerics, Majles deputies, the Voice and Vision and other  public media of the country to motivate the people so that the  cash which is hoarded or used to buy foreign exchange and coins  is channeled into investments in major infrastructural projects.    The president then referred to changing most of the highways  of Gilan into freeways, especially the Rasht-Qazvin highway,  adding: The Government will provide financial assistance.  Coastal highways are also being studied.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani dispatched a team to the  deprived areas of Gilan yesterday to study the problems and  difficulties of the deprived areas of Gilan Province. This team  is led by Besharati, head of the office of the country's  deprived areas; it will visit the villages of Shemam, Deylaman,  and Totli. The members of the team met the people of these  villages and familiarized themselves with their problems and  difficulties at close quarters.</p>

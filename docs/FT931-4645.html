			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Fiscal fever infects congressmen THE US Congress's Democratic majority is set to agree on even deeper cuts in spending than those proposed by President Bill Clinton. The House of Representatives Budget Committee is expected to vote today on a budget resolution that will make extra spending cuts totalling Dollars 63bn (Pounds 44bn) over five years on top of Mr Clinton's own plan, which had aimed to trim government spending over the period by a net Dollars 222bn. Agreement on the budget resolution is the latest stage in a fever of fiscal responsibility that has infected liberal spenders, conservative farm subsidisers and fervent opponents of tax increases alike. President Clinton first agreed on an additional Dollars 55bn of spending cuts with Democratic party leaders in the House of Representatives on Monday night, but further meetings on Capitol Hill prompted Democrats on the House Budget Committee to expand those cuts to Dollars 63bn, and Democrats in the Senate are working on an even larger batch of cuts. When Mr Clinton announced his budget plan last month, it was widely assumed that he would have trouble keeping its spending cuts intact. Instead, Congressional Democrats have outdone him. 'When the whole process started, the issue was, would the Congress go as far as the president recommended,' said Congressman Martin Sabo, chairman of the House Budget Committee. 'I'm just indicating we'll go further.' The White House is now worried if it will be able to preserve the increased spending on infrastructure, technology, the environment and education that also forms part of the Clinton economic plan. Some conservative Democrats are seeking, in particular, to trim the Dollars 16.3bn package to provide a short-term stimulus to the economy. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said yesterday that Congress was 'moving in the right direction' but warned that deeper cuts might be counter-productive. The debate is concentrated on the budget resolution, which provides general outlines for spending and revenues. When detailed cuts are taken line-by-line in later appropriations bills, following presentation of the complete Clinton budget on April 5, members of Congress are expected to lose much of their new-found enthusiasm for fiscal discipline as they fight to preserve the programmes that benefit their own districts. However, Democratic leaders have had to work towards a consensus on the budget resolution knowing they can count only on their own party, since the Republicans have made it clear they will not vote for the Clinton budget.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Business leaders are concerned about the formation  of the Hata government lest the Hosokawa government-initiated  "reform policy lines," such as political reform, take backward  steps. Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation  of Employers' Associations], commented: "It is true that the  base of the minority ruling parties' government is insecure."    Masaru Hayami, head of Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of  Corporate Executives], said: "The important thing for business  circles is to see the 1994 budget passed without delay." Where  the budget is concerned, as the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] is willing to support its passage, business circles are  relatively optimistic. On other matters like taxation system  reform, however, a staff official of the Keidanren [Japan  Federation of Economic Organizations] said: "We cannot draw a  picture."    Ken Moroi, a vice chairman of Nikkeiren, noted: "What  concerns us most are actions on international issues like  Japan-U.S. relations and North Korea." He added: "The nation  is now in a state of difficulty. I hope the coalition will deal  with these international issues in consultation with the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ. It is necessary for the  coalition parties to be humble."    Even as far as administrative reform, including  deregulation,  is concerned, Nagano said: "The SDPJ should cooperate since it  was part of the team that prepared the Hiraiwa report during the  Hosokawa government." Another top business leader said: "The  coalition parties are basically weak; I hope they and opposition  parties like the LDP and SDPJ will cooperate and tackle pending  issues together."    For a while after the SDPJ bolted from the coalition, there  were voices in business circles saying: "The coalition parties  should seek cooperation with the LDP." But since then it has  been learned that the LDP and SDPJ have decided to cooperate in  parliamentary operations, and business circles have not been  able to follow the swift shifts and shuffles within and among  the parties.    Tadahiro Sekimoto, a vice chairman of Keidanren, holds a  severe view, saying, "I hope this cabinet will achieve visible  results within the next two months. Otherwise, it will turn out  to be a short-lived government." Business circles do not like  the prospect of the lower house being dissolved and the next  general election being conducted under the current medium  electoral district system. As such, all that business leaders  are saying essentially is: "This is no time to talk about who  the ruling parties are or who the opposition parties are. All  of them should get together to deal with policy matters."</p>

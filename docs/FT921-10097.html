			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Corning takes Dollars 800m charge SHARES in Owens-Corning, the large US manufacturer of fibrous glass products, moved sharply higher yesterday after the company announced that it was taking an Dollars 800m non-cash charge for the uninsured cost of future asbestos claims against its fourth-quarter earnings, writes Nikki Tait. The company maintained that this should cover cases occuring up to 2000. 'We will, of course, make adjustments to our reserves if that becomes appropriate, but this is our best estimate of these uninsured costs,' said Mr Glen Hiner, Owens-Corning's new chairman and chief executive. The announcement was welcomed on Wall Street as a move to clear the decks. Shares in the company surged Dollars 7 3/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 . After the charge, Owens-Corning's operating figures showed a Dollars 757m loss in the fourth quarter, compared with a Dollars 7m deficit in the same period a year earlier. For the 12-month period, the group's net loss stood at Dollars 742m, compared with a Dollars 73m profit in 1990, with sales down from Dollars 3.1bn to Dollars 2.8bn.</p>

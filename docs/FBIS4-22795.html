			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Saktaganov, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk: "Sakhalin </F> United Emirates"]    [Text] [Begin boxed material] This is gold. In such a  miserable little bowl--real gold extracted by our  poverty-stricken super-rich. It is an eternal absurdity. And, it  seems, for Russia a rather characteristic one. There is a way  out of this pathetic situation. Strictly speaking, there are two  ways out. The first--to demand attention from the state, or more  precisely, money. The second--to sell ourselves to someone  richer. And as soon as possible. The truth lies, as it should,  somewhere in between. Or perhaps it lies somewhere entirely  elsewhere. In the sphere of common sense. [End boxed material]    Finally, almost for the first time, the interests of  the Center and the territories have coincided in their  intentions to "unseal" the Sakhalin shelf oil deposits.    At the very end of 1993, the "negotiations marathon" finally  reached the home stretch. Representatives of the Russian  Government and major foreign firms interested in developing the  oil and gas deposits of the Sakhalin shelf participated in it  for many months. Literally in the course of one week, the  preparation of key documents was completed in Moscow, and part  of them were even signed. Among them were several international  investment projects whose scope and proposed influence on the  domestic economy are simply astounding.    It is enough to note that by the summer of last year, when  the negotiations on the Sakhalin off-shore deposits were in full  swing, the overall volume of foreign investments in Russia  comprised around $7 billion, according to the data of the  Russian Government itself. And now let us compare. Three foreign  consortia whose membership includes such well-known companies as  "Shell," "Texaco," "Exxon," "Mobil" and others, intend to invest  a sum of approximately $8-$10 billion in direct investments  alone in the development of a relatively small area of the  coastal zone of Sakhalin (around 17,000 square kilometers).    Without a doubt, the oil business is in no way reminiscent  of  the Western humanitarian aid to which we have already become  accustomed. The foreign partners expect to realize profits in  the billions here. And, we might add, with good reason. The  development of five deposits and the geological survey of three  prospective areas of the Sakhalin shelf open up access to a  considerable and hitherto untouched storehouse of hydrocarbon  raw material in a geographically favorable region. The reserves  of only a few of the deposits which have already been confirmed  here are estimated at about 252 million tonnes of oil (volumes  which are fully comparable with the annual export of the entire  former USSR) and more than 1.5 trillion cubic meters of gas.    Thus, in literally a few years, Sakhalin will be able to  offer its closest foreign neighbors specifically that which they  will acutely need. We know, for example, that by 1996 there will  be a shortage of gas in South Korea in a volume of approximately  4 million tonnes of RNG (rarified natural gas), while the  guaranteed sale on the world oil and gas market, under the  current conditions, is valued at no less than the raw material  itself.    Naturally, by granting our partners in developing the shelf  these concessions which are unprecedented in their  technical-economic parameters, we too will not be the losers.  For example, within the scope of the "Sakhalin-2" project, up to  70 percent of the work is to be performed through our own  efforts with the use of domestic building materials and  structures. Moreover, the representatives of the VPK  [military-industrial complex] are already formulating a list of  enterprises which expect to stay afloat in the whirlpool of  conversion with the aid of the unexpected currency orders.  Within the scope of the oldest project, "Sakhalin-I," the  Japanese-American consortium has agreed to "forgive" the former  debt of the union government which took credits for the  exploration of the current deposits. And, if you add the  interest which has accumulated over the elapsed decades, the sum  turns out to be quite significant even by all-state  standards--around $300 million.    Finally, according to the results of the competition for the  "Sakhalin-2" project which has just been concluded, the winners  were companies which guaranteed that they would invest no less  than $473 million in the search for oil and gas in the  northeastern end of Sakhalin over the next six years. And,  naturally, with the successful realization of all three  projects, Russia will get a share of the extracted raw material,  and its budget will be replentished by the appropriate taxes and  bonuses granted in such cases--uncompensated payments by the  foreign companies to the country owning the deposits.    The packet of Sakhalin projects has already been nicknamed  the "second BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line]" by Far East residents.  And this is quite understandable. With the start of development  of the first off-shore deposits in the Sea of Okhotsk, one of  the most remote regions of Russia which has been shortchanged in  a social and economic respect will receive a strong impetus in  the development of its infrastructure. It will get thousands of  additional jobs, the latest Western technologies and even entire  enterprises for the drilling and primary processing of the raw  material. Hope has appeared also for reducing the shortage of  power resources which has traditionally existed here. After all,  every year it is necessary to bring up to 19 million tonnes of  oil and petroleum products to the Far East from the western  regions of the country, and the interruptions of heat and power  supply in many local cities have already become a sad tradition.    The heads of several Far Eastern administrations and  mayoralities quite reasonably expect to replentish the local  budgets from various concessions payments. The oil dollars may  be used to build a hospital, to reconstruct an ageing airport,  or to extend new automobile roads and high voltage transmission  lines...    The hold-up, specifically, centers around a minor matter.  After many years of negotiations and discussions over the fate  of the off-shore projects, in which almost everyone was  involved--from the rank-and-file deputy of a taiga rayon soviet  to three presidents: The presidents of South Korea, the USSR,  and then Russia--it finally became clear that we do not yet even  have any legislation regulating mutual relations with foreign  companies in such large-scale undertakings. The law on  concessions which was prepared at one time never reached the  stage of a final reading in the former Supreme Soviet.    Nevertheless, we cannot do without the legislative  formulation of conditions and forms of concessions which are  unified for the entire country. The deposits of strategic raw  materials are present not only in the Far East, and the foreign  companies which are prepared to develop them, as a rule, strive  to gain various benefits and guarantees for themselves during  the negotiations. For example, the representatives of the  Russian Government have already promised the international  consortium MMMShM (unifying the corporations  "McDermott-Marathon-Mitsubishi-Shell-Mitsui"), which aspires to  the "Sakhalin-2" project, that it would be exempted from payment  of all taxes with the exception of the tax on profits and  "royalties." The consortium "Sodeco-Exxon" ("Sakhalin-I project)  has been offered another benefit: The right to develop an  additional, third by count, deposit in Arkutun-Dagi without the  competition which is traditional in such cases.    Naturally, other investors are also presenting their  conditions. But, you must agree, such "indulgences of the  capitalists" will not evoke great happiness among part of the  deputies of the new parliament. And this means that the "second  BAM" itself may be considered a convenient pretext for rather  heated polemics in the country's supreme legislative body, in  the course of which not only the government may suffer, but the  projects themselves. We might add that some of the foreign  investors in the Sakhalin projects, who have become disenchanted  with the omnipotence of the presidential edicts, are inclined to  wait for adoption of a new law...    Then again, even before the adoption of new legislation, the  "second BAM" is capable of bringing both pleasant concerns and  considerable profit. For example, the upcoming cooperation with  the foreign firms provides for one other mandatory condition:  Within a period of five years, they must transfer the sum of  $100 million into a specially created Fund for the Development  of Sakhalin. Whether we like it or not, we must agree with one  of the participations in the negotiations on the shelf projects:  Something akin to the Sakhalin United Emirates might just arise  in the insular oblast.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / HMSO to go ahead with 4.7% pay increase HER MAJESTY'S Stationery Office is to increase salaries of 2,000 staff by 4.7 per cent this week even though two unions are taking industrial action to try to win a better offer. HMSO is thought to hope the award will weaken the resolve of unions involved in the action. The two unions involved, the CPSA and NUPCS Civil Service unions, said an overtime ban and work-to-rule were continuing. They are considering further ballots on selective strikes by key groups of workers. The dispute is significant because HMSO was the first government agency to introduce a pay system outside national bargaining in the Civil Service. The deal being implemented by HMSO provides less than other civil servants have received recently. The 4.7 per cent is backdated to January, after a three-month pay freeze from the settlement date in October last year. The unions say it will be worth 3.5 per cent in the 12 months from the settlement date. The two unions have held a week-long strike, now fin-ished, by some workers in HMSO's publication centre. Mr Mike Lynn, HMSO deputy chief executive, said he believed there was little support among union members for further strikes. He added that it was difficult to gauge the effect of the overtime ban and work-to-rule. Members of the IPMS Civil Service union are working normally after balloting to accept the offer.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A distant parliament In theory the elections to the European parliament today and on Sunday should be taken more seriously than previous such ballots. The assembly at Strasbourg is not an impotent talking-shop. It has the power to amend European Union legislation. The Maastricht treaty enables it to veto some proposals, accept or reject the nominations for the new European Commission due to take office in 1995, and check the union's budget. It should be able to influence a broad range of EU policies, including foreign relations. Some of its elected members may become rapporteurs on important Union directives. As such, they arguably have more power than most backbenchers in national parliaments. Lobbyists and pressure groups have discovered this. Consequently, they devote increasing attention and expenditure to influencing MEPs. The public, perhaps influenced by the media, remains largely unmoved. Voter participation this weekend is expected to be low, on average below 50 per cent in countries where voting is not obligatory. The turnout in Britain in 1989 was only 36 per cent. It would not be surprising if the figure this time is even lower. Few of those who vote will do so primarily for the ostensible purpose of this weekend's election, namely to choose a representative to send to the European Parliament. Most are likely to use the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with their national governments. Opportunity In Britain, the Conservative party's nationalistic rhetoric may be in tune with the sentiments of many of its traditional supporters, but the expectation is that large numbers of them will stay at home anyway. Everyone can see how divided the government is in its approach to the EU. Besides, the opportunity to deliver a protest to an administration that polling suggests is more unpopular than any in post-1945 history seems too tempting to miss. This is why Labour has campaigned on domestic, not EU, issues and the Liberal Democrats have not flaunted their Europeanism. Britain has stuck to first-past-the-post rather than a proportional voting system. In consequence, the left bloc in the European parliament is likely to be disproportionately well represented. It is not clear that this will mean much to the European electorate. In Germany, where the turnout was 62.4 per cent in 1989, both the Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats have campaigned on national issues such as unemployment and crime, although these have been given a European flavour. In France (1989 turnout 48.7 per cent) participation is also expected to be lower this year. A lacklustre campaign is primarily interesting as a guide to the likely outcome of next year's presidential election. Anti-Maastricht parties may, however, do relatively well in both countries. A small but disturbing minority may support parties of the far right, notably in France, Germany and Italy. Accountability This anticipated lack of fervour for the European parliament may disappoint its members, but the voters know what they are doing. The Strasbourg assembly does not have the full power to grant or withhold taxation, or pass legislation. Such prerogatives are still held by the national states. The European Commission is an executive of sorts, but it is not democratically accountable. It is not dependent on a majority in the parliament for day-to-day decision-making, as are the cabinets of the 12 member governments. Its powers, while not negligible, do not seem to the electors to relate to their bread-and-butter concerns. Since the fall of communism in 1989 Europe has entered a period of uncertainty. The evolution implicit in the Maastricht treaty is no longer regarded as desirable by all member states. Putative new members of the Union are understandably hesitant, as the Austrians may show in their referendum on Sunday. The further evolution of the EU will be pursued, if at all, at variable speeds according to national circumstance. The shape of that evolution is no longer predictable. Many citizens of the EU understand this. Their response is naturally to focus on their national interests. Voting for a distant and incomprehensible parliament towards the end of a deeply-felt recession is therefore bound to be patchy.</p>

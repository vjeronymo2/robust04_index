			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN PAYS PART OF FINE FOR LATE STATEMENTS  </P> <P> Huntington Park Councilman Luis Hernandez on Tuesday paid $1,260 of the $2,110  he was fined for turning in late campaign disclosure statements for last  April's election, a city spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Hernandez, 30, was fined by City Clerk Marilyn A. Boyette, who said the  councilman will pay off the rest of the fine in monthly installments.  </P> <P> Hernandez turned in his statements as many as 117 days late. The campaign  disclosure statements are required by law to enable voters to find out who is  supporting a candidate.  </P> <P> The councilman spent $29,219, more money than any other candidate, to win one  of the three seats being contested in last April's election.  </P> <P> Hernandez said he waited until after the election to turn in the statements  because he wanted to protect his contributors from retaliation by city  officials. Mayor Thomas E. Jackson has called the assertion "nonsense."  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is investigating Hernandez's  campaign.  </P></p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company Profiles): Far East specialists - Baring Securities BARING Securities stands out among Queen's Awards winners in two ways: not only is it the only stockbroker to win an award, but it does so for the second time. 'It's helpful for staff morale . . . and intriguing for our foreign client base', Mr Christopher Heath, founder and managing director of the company, says thoughtfully. After its last award in 1988, one Japanese business magazine mistakenly credited it as being newly-appointed stockbrokers to the Queen. That certainly did not harm business. Overseas earnings have tripled since 1988. Over the same period the number of offices around the world has increased from five to 19, and the number of staff from 370 to more than 1,000. The significance of exports is such that all but 2 per cent of revenues come from abroad, principally the Far East. Earnings were estimated to be around Pounds 70m during the last financial year. The vast majority of earnings - some 70 per cent - are from Japan. Around 20 per cent derive from south-east Asia, with the remainder coming from Europe and Latin America. The company has focused on the Japanese market since it was launched in 1984, and makes its money from both equities and derivatives - warrants, futures and options. More than half of that business is notable in coming from Japanese businesses themselves, which are buying Japanese products. Mr Heath points to three factors which have helped the company do so well in a difficult foreign business environment: a commitment to research; a strong distribution team; and an acknowledged expertise, including strong market-making capabilities. It also helps that 215 of the 250 staff in the Tokyo and Osaka offices are Japanese. 'We are unique among stockbrokers', Mr Heath adds. 'Japan has always been our business. We are not simply a UK business that has decided to diversify.' 'Culturally, we run as a broking operation. Our success since Big Bang is due to the fact that we started from a blank sheet', he says. Baring has not had to fight the internal battles that have hampered and destroyed many financial service businesses since the mid-1980s. Mr Heath himself was a Far Eastern specialist with stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite when he was asked to establish Baring Securities in the build-up to the changes in the City wrought by Big Bang in 1986. 'I had personally been following the Japanese market since 1974, and believed it had a lot to offer', he explains. 'We had a research base and an office in Tokyo, and built up a business based on Japan.' Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, approached him to set up an independent company, to be run on similar lines as Baring Asset Management: financed by the parent company as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary, but operating entirely independently. However, intense concentration on Japan has brought someproblems. 'We were fortunate up till last year', says Mr Heath. 'Then the Japanese market collapsed.' The declining volume of equities being traded cut into earnings. Nevertheless, business from other regions - and in derivatives, which were less affected by the stock market crash - meant the company did not cut employment, but actually increased the number of staff. 'I think things will consolidate and we will be well positioned to benefit from sustained recovery in the market,' Mr Heath says. At the same time, he has also increasingly steered the company into new regions. Barings' earnings from Japan have declined to 70 per cent from 85 per cent three years ago. Looking to the future, Mr Heath predicts that the company will continue to diversify into new areas. He is sceptical of new opportunities in eastern Europe, at least in the short term. But he is looking carefully at Latin America, and planning further expansion in the emerging markets of Indonesia and Thailand.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Nice view - shame about the crush / Joel Kibazo flew to the recently opened Kansai International airport in Japan On a clear day, Kansai International must be one of the world's most spectacular sights from the air. Japan's new airport, which opened five weeks ago, is on a man-made island about 2 1/2 miles offshore of Osaka. The terminal building, which stretches for just over a mile, is encased in glass, with white metal bars to support it. The airport, which took seven years and Pounds 9.2bn to build, is the only man-made structure other than the Great Wall of China to be visible from space. Yet for all the architectural splendour of the building, created by Italian designer Renzo Piano and his team, not enough attention has been paid to the needs - or foibles - of travellers. Leaving the aircraft to enter the airport, you encounter easy-to-follow directions - so long as you are fluent in Japanese or English. There are no signs in French, German or Arabic - which seems an oversight, given that a large proportion of those using Kansai are likely to be international business travellers. On your way to the baggage hall, you may appreciate the bright yellow and orange chairs which you pass in the boarding lounge. But then you hit the arrivals hall. There is so little space that you have to squeeze - or at times fight - your way through the waiting hordes. Your fellow passengers are not your only problem. The new airport has become a tourist attraction for locals, so if you land at Kansai over the next few weekends, you will have to make your way through crowds of gawpers. The Kansai authorities claim that sightseers pose no problem, but the long queues at each restaurant and the piles of rubbish outside the main airport terminal were evidence of the extra 300,000 people that had visited Kansai one weekend recently. Having made it through arrivals, there is an information desk to the left of the exit where staff are keen to help with further directions. Hotel and ticket information is available at an adjoining desk (the main airport hotel does not open until next year). Just in front of this desk are two small bureaux de change. But there is only one window at each, so if two flights arrive within a few minutes of each other, long queues spill into the road. Two expressways link the airport to Osaka, so leaving the airport is not difficult. There are plenty of buses, coaches and taxis outside, though the Pounds 50 cab fare to Osaka may come as a bit of a shock to first-time visitors. The authorities are keen to encourage use of rail connections. The station is close to the terminal, and buying a ticket is easy. After you have bought your ticket, however, and are waiting for your train, you may feel less enthusiastic. You could have an hour or so to wait, and there are no seats for tired travellers to use. Delays of that length may persist for as long as sightseers continue to be drawn to Kansai. The cleanliness and swivel-seats of the trains themselves may offer some compensation. Flying out of Kansai is relatively straightforward. For those who do not speak English or Japanese there are information machines that speak other languages. Be prepared for the stiff departure tax - euphemistically called 'airport facilities charge' - which is Pounds 17. And count on almost everything, from beer to hamburgers, to be expensive. The choice of drinks or cigarettes at the few duty-free shops is limited, with only the dearest brands on offer. Many international airlines have started flying to Kansai, which is designed to serve as a hub for passengers to Australia and elsewhere. Japan Airlines is its biggest user to date, with the greatest number of flights from Europe, including four from London and three from Paris each week. British Airways has two flights a week from London. Surprisingly, All Nippon Airways, the other big Japanese carrier, has yet to start direct flights from Europe to Kansai. The big Japanese airlines have direct links from the new airport to Tokyo. But the flight takes 45 minutes, so use Kansai only if you are heading for the Kansai region. And remember to enjoy the view.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Nearly 60 hurt in violence at Italian union protest NEARLY 60 people were hurt yesterday, including 23 police, when a protest demonstration by Italy's three main trade union confederations against the Amato government's economic policy degenerated into violence. The violence was provoked by a small group of militant trade unionists and their supporters who sought to break up an open-air meeting at the end of a march through the streets of Rome. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and prevent scuffles between the marchers and those trying to disrupt the meeting. The violence appears part of a pattern that has emerged since the unions initiated a series of regional four-hour general strikes on September 22 to protest at proposed cuts in pensions and the health service. Small groups have hurled insults, coins and vegetables at union leaders who, they claim, have sold out and no longer represent grass-roots interests. These incidents have underlined the potentially dangerous strategy that union leaders have embarked on by calling mass protests. Yesterday, as well as the strikes in Rome and the Lazio region, there was a day-long stoppage by Italy's 3.5m public-sector employees, which paralysed ministries and disrupted airports. The CGIL, the largest trade union confederation, formerly dominated by the now defunct Italian Communist party, is pressing for a general strike against the austerity measures proposed in the 1993 budget, and to force the government to renegotiate an outline agreement signed in July ending the system of indexed wages. But the other two confederations, the CISL and UIL, have refused to commit themselves, conscious that they could alienate public support at a time when the country faces financial instability. In contrast to these protests, Thursday's presentation of the 1993 budget was favourably received in the press, and there were signs in parliament that the four parties in the coalition government had accepted that few substantive changes could be made without undermining the credibility of the whole package. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said the special stand-by facility which Italy on Thursday sought from the EC, would not be more than L17,000bn (Pounds 7.7bn). But he added the precise amount had yet to be agreed. The lira yesterday remained weak, floating at around 880 against the D-Mark.</p>

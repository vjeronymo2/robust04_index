			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GARCIA DISDAINS 'HISPANIC' LABEL  </P> <P> Compliment him on his hairy chest. Compliment him on his natty wardrobe. But  don't call "Godfather III" star Andy Garcia a "Hispanic heartthrob."  </P> <P> "There's nothing that I cherish more than my culture and what I am," Garcia  says in January's Glamour. "But to call me the great Hispanic actor is  ridiculous; it's racism. They don't call Dustin Hoffman the great  Jewish-American actor."  </P> <P> Garcia's family fled Cuba for Miami in 1961, when he was 5.  </P> <P> Garcia, 34, who plays Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone  in the latest "Godfather" movie, says his Cuban heritage is "the source of my  strength." But it also has boxed him into Latino roles during his 13-year  career, which has included parts in "The Untouchables," "Internal Affairs" and  "Black Rain."  </P> <P> Though his fame is increasing, Garcia's ego apparently is not.  </P> <P> Told that he looks handsome in a tuxedo in the movie, Garcia bowed his head and  told the interviewer: "Vincent thanks you." Told that the interviewer was also  fond of his "glorious chest," the actor replied:  </P> <P> "I can't take responsibility for the chest. It's a genetic thing."  </P></p>

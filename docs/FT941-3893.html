			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Managers in buy-out at Radio Marconi A group of 40 managers at Radio Marconi, Portugal's intercontinental telecommunications operator, plan a Es30bn (Dollars 170m) management buy-out. The government has welcomed the bid for the state's 51 per cent holding, a manager said. The plan also has the support of UK and US institutional investors who own 30 per cent of company, he said. The management group, led by Mr Francisco Murteira Nabo, president of the holding company for Radio Marconi's overseas subsidiaries, aims to complete the buy-out by June with financial backing from foreign and domestic banks and investors. Under the plan, Radio Marconi would hand over its concession to operate intercontinental telephone services to Portugal Telecom, the single operator to be formed in April from the merger of Portugal's two other wholly state-owned telecommunications companies. The managers want Radio Marconi to keep - and possibly increase - its 33 per cent shareholding in Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN), a mobile telephone operator, and the business of 40 subsidiaries operating in 18 countries. Radio Marconi's sales were Es46.5bn in 1993 and net profits totalled Es4.2bn. The buy-out would resolve what otherwise threatens to be a complex question of the state reaching agreement with Radio Marconi's private shareholders on a merger with Portugal Telecom. However, officials indicated that the government may be reluctant to allow a wholly private-sector Radio Marconi to keep its stake in TMN. The group plans to invite Mr Goncalo Sequeira Braga, Radio Marconi president, and other members of the executive board to join them in the buy-out. Employees in all of Portugal's telecommunications companies would also be invited to invest.</p>

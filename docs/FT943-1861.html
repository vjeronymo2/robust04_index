			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Unified accounts council proposed One of the six leading bodies for accountants will today propose the creation of a new supervisory and controlling council to govern the profession. Mr John Moore, president of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, said: 'The General Accounting Council will provide a single, prestigious and authoritative organisation to deal with those areas where the profession has shared a responsibility to the public, and common professional interests.' The move follows a series of consultation meetings with chartered association members to consider a merger plan put forward by the working party of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies. Only 19 per cent backed the CCAB scheme to create three institutes in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Mr Moore said the chartered association plan would preserve the existing bodies, but provide a new institution at the highest level to defend public interest including that of the consumer. Clark Whitehill, the 12th- largest accountancy firm in the UK, has announced that it is to join the Horwath International network of accounting and management consulting firms. Clark Whitehill's move depends on Stoy Hayward moving from Horwath to BDO Binder, the network currently represented in the UK by Binder Hamlyn. Binder Hamlyn is expected to merge with Arthur Andersen.</p>

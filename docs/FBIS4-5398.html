			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a Central Vietnam-based Voice of  Vietnam Radio correspondent, from 7-8 April, the Khanh Hoa  Province party organization convened a two-day conference of  cadres. Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and  addressed the conference.    The conference thoroughly studied the Mid-Term National  Party  Conference Resolution and discussed the report on the local  socioeconomic development over the past three years and on the  orientations and tasks for the 1994-95 two-year period.    According to the report, the value of agricultural products  has increased by three percent per year and that of marine  products by 20-25 percent compared with 1990. The annual growth  rate of agricultural production has increased by more than seven  percent. The total value of budget revenues has increased by  nearly five times compared with 1990. Most of the economic  targets set by the province have been fulfilled or  overfulfilled. Cultural, scientific, educational, and public  health services have also made improvements. The people's right  of mastership has been developed step by step. Positive results  have also been recorded on the national security and national  defense front.    The conference also analyzed shortcomings and weaknesses and  discussed measures to overcome disunity that has dragged on and  on and seriously affected local socioeconomic development. The  conference focused on major objectives that must be fulfilled  during the 1994-95 two-year period. It is necessary to continue  to effect changes in the economic structure in the direction of  industrialization, agriculture, service industry, and tourism.  Efforts must be made to effect an average annual increase of  eight-nine percent in gross domestic product. Measures must be  taken to improve the people's material and cultural life a step  further. It is necessary to attract and make good use of the  contingent of scientific-technological and management cadres.  Plans must be worked out to promote educational and vocational  training activities. Steps must be taken to renovate the  operating procedures of state agencies, fight the evils of  corruption and red tape, consolidate political stability, firmly  maintain national security and national defense, and renovate  and strengthen party leadership over grassroots establishments  and the masses.    Speaking on this occasion, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi  commended the Khanh Hoa Province party organization and people  for their achievements over the past three years. He stressed  the need for Khanh Hoa to step up industrialization, deep-sea  fishing, and aquaculture as well as link efforts to protect  marine resources with endeavors to defend the Fatherland.    The comrade general secretary pointed out Khanh Hoa's  geographical role and responsibility toward the task of  developing public healthcare and national security and defense  systems in the island district of Truong Sa and at Cam Ranh Bay.  He also reminded the Khanh Hoa Province party organization of  the need to satisfactorily carry out party-building work,  promote internal unity, and devote efforts to directing the  local army and people in building Khanh Hoa into a prosperous,  powerful, and civilized province.    The conference also informed the participants of the  Secretariat's decision to remove 11 comrades from the Khanh Hoa  Province party organization's provisional executive committee  and supplement the committee with 13 other comrades.</p>

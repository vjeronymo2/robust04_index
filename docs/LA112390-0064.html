			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 1 NEAR HIT, 1 CLEAR MISS IN 'RARE BIRDS' AT THEATRE OF NOTE  </P> <P> Marvel Mohat's "Confessions of a Temporary Secretary," the opener in Theatre of  NOTE's evening of two one-acts under the umbrella title of "Rare Birds," is a  totally dismissible hourlong skit with a large cast that is also dismissible,  at least under the overblown, frantic direction of Ed de' Leal. The same  material is covered in about 60 seconds by Mass Hysteria (see following  review).  </P> <P> Paul Selig's "Moon City" is of much more interest, though its style and  statement are firmly rooted in the early '70s. There's not a man nor boy in  Moon City who's safe from the erotic clutches of Nancy Huckaby. Her current  trick is 15-year-old Georgie, a friend of her brother Cubby, a pyromaniac who  gets his sexual kicks at a nearby military base. Nancy's retarded friend Lila  gets in on the libidinous action, and even Mama, after two strokes, has a shot  at Georgie.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the play is treated with compassion and a lot of fun by director  Roxanne Rogers, who sure knows how to make the genre work. She gets good  performances out of the whole cast, but particularly Karen Hott as Nancy,  Brooks Ann Hayes as the nutty mental deficient, and James Jonathan Green as  Georgie, a kid with a landing strip between his ears.  </P> <P>  At 1705 N. Kenmore Ave., Hollywood; Fridays &amp; Saturdays,8 p.m.; Sundays, 7  p.m.; endsDec. 9. $10; (213) 666-5550.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> An Amicable 'Life' at Tamarind Theatre  </P> <P> A member of the comedy troupe Mass Hysteria announces at the start that the  group's split (with director Robin Menken) from Second City was "amicable."  Their late-night show, "Life on the Sidewalk" at the Tamarind Theatre, is  amicable too, but that's about all.  </P> <P> The audience didn't find one belly laugh in the hour, and few hearty chuckles.  It's not that the group isn't talented -- it's not that the material is dull.  There just isn't much to laugh at.  </P> <P> They cover a gamut of subjects from a doctor who jokes about death to the  jungle of temporary office help, but the only two pieces that get a rise out of  the audience are an intellectually bright vocal chorale on procrastination and  a bitter, funny blackout about a nerd trying to communicate with more popular  students.  </P> <P>  At 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood; Fridays &amp; Saturdays, 11 p.m.; added 9  p.m. shows today and Saturday; ends Dec. 15. $10; (213) 466-1767.  </P></p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Observer: Dennis menaced Marmaduke, Lord Bunkerton ('Snooty' to his pals) would never have stood for it. The Beano comic, his ancestral home for half a century until 1988, is beset with not just new competition, but a sort that smacks - dash it all - of democracy. Owned by Dundee's clannish D C Thomson group, Beano is under attack by debutant rival Triffik] whose stakeholders are numbered in tens of thousands. The competitor is a joint venture between Newsforce Marketing, a branch of the UK's 29,000-strong National Federation of Retail Newsagents, and the sales promotion company Business Development Partnership. With an initial print-run of 400,000 against Beano's claimed circulation of 300,000, Triffik] sells at the same price of 28p. Its cartoon characters, such as Harry Hacker and his magic computer, are meant to be more switched-on than those of its forerunner. Whether they'll catch on with enough little horrors is another question. Beano says it continually tries to inject fresh features. But while it has succeeded in sidelining the now 54-year-old Snooty, its popularity polls show that no newcomer has come near shaking the grip of characters such as Dennis the Menace, born in the 1950s. Could that be why Triffik] includes a non-computerised youth called Disastrous Dick? 'Weel . . . perhaps,' said the voice from Dundee. 'But we're no worried. There's nothing Dennis likes more than a wee bit o' competition.'</p>

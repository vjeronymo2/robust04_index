			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SENATORS INTRODUCE CABLE TV BILL  </P> <P> A bill that seeks to increase competition in the cable television industry  through federal regulation was introduced today by 15 senators.  </P> <P> The sponsors said they were acting in response to sharp increases in cable TV  rates and rising complaints about service since the industry was largely  deregulated in 1984.  </P> <P> "The growing concentration of ownership in the cable television marketplace has  led to charges of unfair competition," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz).  </P> <P> McCain said rates were up an average 29% nationally in the past three years  with many areas even higher.  </P> <P> The bill would prohibit cable programmers from discriminating against cable  competitors, such as microwave broadcasters and satellite dish owners, and  would limit the size of multiple cable system operators to 15% of the nation's  cable subscribers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HATCH COMMENTS ON IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> I am concerned and disturbed by the statement quoted in a Times' article  "Heavily Asian Town's Mayor Holds Tight to Controversial Views," by Berkley  Hudson, (Metro, July, 16) on Barry L. Hatch, outgoing mayor (and current city  councilman) of Monterey Park.  </P> <P> The statement quoted in the article stated that "new Asian immigrants have told  him, 'We don't care about your culture, your traditions and your history. We're  here to make money.' " Hatch has not only denounced the new Asian immigrants,  but entire ethnic people groups.  </P> <P> If this statement was allegedly made, it certainly does not reflect the  attitude of the entire new Asian immigrants or the Asian population. Those  sweeping generalizations made by Hatch attach derogatory connotations to a  particular group. The contents of the article touches upon a grave matter for  the Asian people in the United States.  </P> <P> At the present, many Asian people continue to daily confront racial stereotypes  and expectations that society has perpetuated. Many erroneous judgments and  opinions originate from a single experience which does not give a true  representation of the whole. It is an unfair and a wrongful assumption to  single out and blame particular people groups on the present ills of society  such as the "overburdened streets, schools, jails and hospitals of Southern  California."  </P> <P> The culture and language barrier have alienated many people on both sides of  the conflict. There are many Asian and Asian Americans who have successfully  maintained their cultural identity and assimilated into American society, but  this is masked by the visible group who is ignorant on how to or,  unfortunately, choose not to. The vast majority of Americans have descended  from or are immigrants from foreign countries, yet why is there a present  outcry against those who come to the United States to seek a better life?  </P> <P> A constructive alternative to finger-pointing and increased animosity is an  educational program to assist those new immigrants and others in assimilating  into the American culture and society. This problem needs to be recognized and  addressed. We can start by practicing the virtue of brotherly love and mutual  help.  </P> <P> IRVIN R.

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel launches Pounds 858m cash call: Pounds 42m in fees as City remains unenthusiastic Eurotunnel yesterday sealed its long-term future by signing up an Pounds 858.3m rights issue and completing Pounds 693m of bank financing, just weeks before the company's money was due to run out. After Pounds 42m of fees to advisers and underwriters - with Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg Securities as the main beneficiaries - the company will receive Pounds 816m. The three-for-five issue at 265p was pitched 25 per cent below Wednesday's closing price of 355p, reflecting an unenthusiastic response from the City. The price fell a further 7p yesterday. It was the most widely expected rights issue since Eurotunnel's Pounds 566m call in 1990, when the prospectus said that funds raised would be 'sufficient to complete the project and provide the necessary working capital'. The latest issue, the largest in the transport sector and one of the largest in UK history, had to be preceded by the signing up of Pounds 700m of new senior debt from a 220-bank syndicate. After breaching two deadlines, the core banks agreed Pounds 693m in financing on Wednesday. An additional Pounds 50m has been arranged with a separate syndicate. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman, said the refinancing was a turning point. 'We are now open for business, and we are funded through to financial viability.' The deal was accompanied by the news that Mr Andre Benard is stepping down as co-chairman to be replaced by Mr Patrick Ponsolle, a Eurotunnel director and former managing director of Cie de Suez, the French group. The primary cause of the latest refinancing was the delay in opening the tunnel, costing an estimated Pounds 610m in lost revenues. There was a further Pounds 290m increase in construction costs, and the remaining capital is required to pay interest on the new debt until Eurotunnel breaks even - scheduled for 1998. Under its latest financing - which assumes agreement for the Pounds 50m additional loan and the exercise of 1993 warrants - Eurotunnel has a Pounds 470m cushion against any shortfall in revenues. It has also suggested that arbitration over the British and French railway authorities' failure to install agreed infrastructure could give it 'Pounds 100s of millions'. Once it can demonstrate steady cash flows, it may be able to refinance its Pounds 8bn of debt on more favourable terms. Concerns remain over the quality of Eurotunnel's projections, which are based on unknown quantities, but provide a limited margin for error. Sir Alastair said: 'It is now possible to perceive a period 18 months from now, where the operations reach cruising speed. This is when the value will begin to emerge in the company.'

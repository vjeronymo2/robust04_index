			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ramon Sune report: "Serra Asserts That Roldan's </F> Accusations Are Dictating People's Party's Political Strategy"]    [Text] Barcelona -- Narcis Serra asserted yesterday that  the "People's Party's [PP] strategy seems to be dictated by Luis  Roldan," emphasizing the lack of consistency that, in his  opinion, characterizes the main opposition party's conduct over  the past few days. On the one hand "they attack us for having  trusted" the former Civil Guard director general, but on the  other "their only arguments are those given them by somebody who  is fleeing justice."    During his speech at the opening of the Spanish Socialist  Youth (JSE) Federal Committee meeting, held in l'Hospitalet  yesterday, the deputy prime minister acknowledged that the trust  placed in Roldan was "a grave mistake," and reaffirmed the  government's pledge to place the former Civil Guard chief "in  the hands of justice." Narcis Serra, who again denied the truth  of all the accusations leveled against him by Luis Roldan  through statements made to the newspaper EL MUNDO, warned that  "we will not flinch from criticizing the PP whenever it uses  unethical methods, insults, or threatens." "We will not follow  them on that path," he stressed, "because we will never perform  actions that could damage the democratic institutions'  credibility."    Answering journalists' questions, Narcis Serra specified  that  "Mr. Roldan's false assertions were the central feature of Mr.  Aznar's speech in last week's parliamentary debate, and also of  the questions that the PP put to me in the Congress last  Wednesday [18 May]." The deputy prime minister expressed regret  that the PP, "instead of preparing a strategy of political  debate on the matters worrying citizens, on how to combat  corruption, should formulate a strategy of using this matter for  partisan ends and attacking the government." "It is clear,"  Serra stressed, "that there are two stances: Some of us wish to  resolve the problem of corruption for society's sake, while  others are using this problem as a political weapon."    The deputy prime minister tried to hearten the Socialist  Youth with promises of a 12 June election victory over the  People's Party. He also tried to convey a hopeful view of the  current political and economic situation with the emphatic  assertion that "we are emerging from the tunnel" of corruption  and crisis. Serra asserted that, despite the grave existing  difficulties, we are experiencing "an interesting time," when  the "need to defend ethical principles in politics" is  particularly relevant. "The present time," the Catalan  Socialist leader said, "requires of us a political response that  had perhaps gotten rusty because we did not need it too much."    Serra asserted that the government and the Socialist Party  are "correcting past mistakes, making up for lost time, and,  above all, laying the foundations for greater openness and  effectiveness in the struggle against corruption." The  consequence of all this is that "we are going to win the battle  against the corrupt, whoever may fall, even while knowing that  this does not interest our political opponents because for them  the struggle is not against corruption but against the  Socialists."    The deputy prime minister criticized the PP's aim of "making  the European elections a link in its campaign to demand Felipe  Gonzalez' departure," and took the liberty of delivering a  warning to his political rivals: "There are two ways to attain  power: to win a general election, or to submit and win a censure  motion; but until this is done the European elections are just  that -- European elections."</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Abattoir row fans flames of faith: Delhi butchers are up in arms over court case India's Supreme Court is due to decide today on a case of immense interest to Delhi's butchers, their customers, vegetarian critics and the city's many vultures. The learned judges will consider whether to re-open the city's only abattoir, shut for more than a month. The closure, stemming from the order of a lower court, was ostensibly on health grounds. But the case touches on issues of faith and diet central to the beliefs of many Indians: while many Hindus are vegetarian, Moslems tend to be hearty meat-eaters. Already, the case has attracted wild accusations from both sides, some Hindus claiming the abattoir was partly used for the illegal slaughter of sacred cows, and some Moslems condemning the affair as an anti-Moslem conspiracy. Meanwhile, meat prices have doubled; luxury hotels have started shipping meat from as far away as Jaipur, some 250 miles distant, and cheaper establishments have been forced to take kebabs off the menu. The argument was started by Mrs Maneka Gandhi, a former minister and widow of Mr Sanjay Gandhi, Mrs Indira Gandhi's playboy son. Mrs Maneka Gandhi is India's best-known vegetarian, who bans even her dogs from eating meat. They have to chew on grain and pulses. An anti-slaughter movement launched by Mrs Gandhi filed a court action earlier this year demanding that the 90-year-old abbatoir be closed on health grounds. The Delhi High Court accepted the evidence of bad conditions, poor hygiene and the dumping of untreated waste. On March 18 it ordered the abattoir to close, pending immediate renovation. The judges also ruled that when it re-opened, the butchers could slaughter only 2,500 animals a day, enough for Delhi's consumption, but not for exports to other parts of India and abroad. Before the row, some 13,000-14,000 buffaloes, sheep and goats were slaughtered daily. The 25,000 butchers, porters, drivers and other workers, mostly Moslems, went on strike. Some have joined a black market trade, illegally bringing into the city animals slaughtered elsewhere. A killing ground has developed on the edges of the national and international airports, attracting vultures away from their normal haunts, and into the flight paths of aircraft. After two bird-strikes, extra sharp-shooters have been posted around the runways. Mrs Gandhi argues her movement is not about imposing vegetarianism but promoting the humane slaughter of meat. The butchers, particularly Moslems, claim they are being treated unfairly. 'They are calling us criminals. Our community is upset,' says Mr Mohammed Haneef Qureshi, a Moslem butcher and president of the Delhi Meat Association. He claims sick people are suffering for lack of meat. Moslem celebrations are not what they were. 'Normally we eat mutton. Now we must make do with chicken and vegetables.'</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Heseltine still has aces up his sleeve ANY remaining expectations that Mr Michael Heseltine would emerge as a knight in re-polished armour from the coal industry debacle have been dispelled by his latest rows with the power generators. The struggle between the trade and industry secretary and the generating companies National Power and PowerGen has underlined again how the political crisis created by last autumn's pit closure programme left the government in a no-win position. As one of Mr Heseltine's cabinet colleagues commented recently: 'It was never a game which we could win. We are in the business of cutting losses.' But ministers believe it is still too early to say whether the generators' refusal to bear any of the costs of salvaging about a dozen of the 31 pits earmarked for closure threatens even that damage-limitation exercise. Mr Heseltine still has a powerful card to play. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, is warning Mr Heseltine that his own duties to shareholders come before the government's concerns to placate its backbenchers. The generators will buy and stock extra coal only if Mr Heseltine picks up every penny of the bill. There is recognition in Whitehall that the generators' position appears impregnable. Mr Heseltine has no legal powers to enforce any contract between British Coal and the generators. He can threaten new legislation, but the companies are as aware as anyone at Westminster that the government is keen to avoid months of protracted Commons debates. But National Power and PowerGen also know that Mr Heseltine can be pushed only so far. He could retaliate if negotiations on an expanded coal contract broke down. The unspoken threat to the generators is that he might respond by seeking to break up the duopoly established when the industry was privatised two years ago. It is not a threat that can be made explicitly: even hinting at the possibility of retaliation through a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation would leave him vulnerable to a challenge in the courts. But the threat is there nonetheless, confirmed by senior ministers with nods and winks. There is little doubt at Westminster that if National Power and PowerGen did not strike a deal acceptable to the government, Tory backbenchers would soon clamour for an MMC inquiry. Mr Heseltine's position has been strengthened by the fact that most of the cabinet disputes over coal have ended. Leaks about disputes with the generators may actually have helped the government. The message that there are no easy options has percolated down to potential Tory rebels at Westminster. Mr Heseltine will not survive this trauma untarnished. But he looks set to survive, nevertheless.</p>

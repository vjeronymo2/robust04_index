			<p>BFN     [Text] Republic's National Assembly continued its session  today.    In opening the morning session, the Chairman of the  Parliament, Rasul Guliyev, gave detailed information on the  sociopolitical situation arising from recent violations of law  in the republic's capital and other rayons. The chairman of the  Supreme Soviet then proposed that these matters be discussed at  the parliament.    Interior Minister Ramil Usubov briefed the deputies in  detail  on this problem. He said that the opposition's attempt to hold  a rally on 21 May had grave consequences, and he declared the  participation of some deputies in the organization of  unauthorized rallies to be against the law.    The deputies expressed their views on these events and their  effect on the sociopolitical situation.    After the recess, the deputies continued the debate,  emphasizing especially the impermissibility of acting against  the law in the present conditions.    People's deputy Arif Rehimzade proposed that  parliamentarians  Tofik Gasymov [former foreign minister and a member of  Azerbaijan's People's Front, APF] and Ibrahim Ibrahimov [a  leader of the APF] be deprived of membership in parliament for  aggravating the situation in the republic and for instigating  people to hold a rally.    The National Assembly deprived parliamentarian Tofik Gasymov  and Ibrahim Ibrahimov of their membership in parliament for  causing lawless acts, attempting to organize a rally, and  instigating people to join the rally. Abbas Abbasov [deputy  prime minister and head of State Committee for International  Relations] and Gulabbas Kahramanov were elected members of  parliament.    With this, the National Assembly concluded its session.</p>

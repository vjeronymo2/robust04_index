			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kleeneze warns of only small profit Kleeneze Holdings' shares lost 12 per cent yesterday after the home shopping concern warned that it expected only a small profit for the year to August 31, compared with Pounds 1.06m. However as a mark of its confidence in its prospects, it said the full year dividend would be not less than 1.5p, against 1p. The shares fell 18p to 138p yesterday. The company blamed weak control over the recruitment of new agents during 1993 and 1994, which had led to the need for a bad debt provision of about Pounds 1m. This was in addition to the previously announced adverse impact of operating losses and losses on the disposal of The Leading Edge, estimated at Pounds 1.5m.</p>

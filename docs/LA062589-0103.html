			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE DEFLECTION POLICY AT UCI MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> The recently instituted deflection program at UCI Medical Center has engendered  heated debates, sometimes degenerating into unsubstantiated accusations and  recriminations.  </P> <P> As residents in obstetrics and gynecology, we have experienced the consequences  of the enormous increase in the volume of deliveries. In a unit built to safely  handle 250 deliveries per month, we have over the years seen this number climb  steadily to as high as 550 deliveries per month. It has become an  all-too-familiar scene to have women laboring and delivering in hallways and on  gurneys. This is not only unsafe and unacceptable, but also degrading and  dehumanizing to the patients seeking care.  </P> <P> The media have unfortunately seized the financial aspect of the deflection  decision and have chosen to ignore the most important facet of the deflection  program -- to continue providing an outstanding and safe level of care. Every  patient who has not received prenatal care at UCIMC, be she funded or unfunded,  will be turned away once we reach full status. Our own patients will be  admitted in all situations. The receiving care as evidenced by the fact that,  since its inception, the medical center has almost single-handedly shouldered  the burden of indigent care for the inhabitants of the county. It is indeed  hypocritical and ironic for private hospital administrators around Orange  County to preach morality and insinuate impropriety when for years they have  ignored our pleas for help.  </P> <P> Orange County, one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, has a  growing number of working poor who cannot afford the medical care they need.  Every civilized society has a humane and moral duty to care for its less  fortunate with little financial support from the county. Less affluent counties  than Orange County allocate far more funds to care for their indigent. A system  that has been held together in recent times by last-minute financial bailouts  is, with the present overcrowding and understaffing, threatening to collapse.  In concrete terms, if the tremendous increase in volume, if the shortage of  equipment, if the insufficiency of nursing and doctor staff, were to cost us  the life of a baby or a mother, we feel that is too dear a price to pay and  accordingly are in full support of the difficult and drastic measure of  deflection.  </P> <P> EVE BOYD, MD  </P> <P> Obstetrics and gynecology,  </P> <P> UCI Medical Center  </P> <P> (This letter was signed by 17 residents at the UCI Medical Center.)  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LIFE FOR NEPAL'S SHERPAS HIT PEAK WITH HILLARY'S ARRIVAL, GUIDE SAYS  </P> <P> When Edmund Hillary reached the summit of Mount Everest 36 years ago, he did  more than make history, he changed the lives of a people -- the Sherpas.  </P> <P> One of those affected was Pertemba Sherpa, who today runs a trekking company  and exudes all the confidence and warmth of a man who has climbed the world's  highest mountain three times.  </P> <P> "Hillary loved the Himalayas and especially the Sherpa people and he came back  many times after 1953. He opened a school in 1960 and I became one of the first  to study there," Pertemba said with a broad smile in his Katmandu office.  </P> <P> Until Hillary's school, education was almost nonexistent in the highest regions  of northeastern Nepal, where Sherpas had migrated from eastern Tibet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Altitude Porters  </P> <P> They worked as farmers, herders and tradesmen. Their physical prowess and good  nature also made them excellent high-altitude porters on mountaineering  expeditions.  </P> <P> But meeting Hillary -- who is now the New Zealand High Commissioner to India  and Nepal, based in New Delhi -- and his friends changed Pertemba's life.  </P> <P> "I dreamed of following in their footsteps to the summit," he said.  </P> <P> Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest mountains. Freezing  temperatures, threats of avalanche, ice falls, strong winds and high altitudes  have tested the most experienced climbers. Sherpas are ideally suited for the  extreme conditions.  </P> <P> Pertemba, who was born in 1949 in the shadow of Everest, worked as a trekking  and climbing guide before he got his first chance to scale a major peak. He  joined British mountaineer Chris Bonington on an expedition to Annapurna.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Supported the Team'  </P> <P> "I didn't get to the summit but I supported the team," he said.  </P> <P> In 1975, after two previous unsuccessful attempts on Everest, he joined  Bonington as sirdar, or chief Sherpa, and scaled the world's highest peak at  29,028 feet. But the experience was marred by tragedy when Englishman Mick  Burke died during the descent.  </P> <P> "It took me a long time to get over it, but I went back to Everest in 1979 with  a West German expedition and reached the summit again. The weather was good,  the view was fantastic and I found myself much more relaxed."  </P> <P> He joined Bonington again on a Norwegian expedition to Everest in 1985 and made  it to the top of the world for the third time.  </P> <P> "I've been very lucky," he said. "I've had enough for now. Maybe I'll still try  the north side or some other route but reaching the summit isn't the most  important thing -- it's the enjoyment, the sharing of the experience and the  building of friendships."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lasting Bonds  </P> <P> The bonds forged during a climbing expedition are lasting, he said. "So many  things go together -- good weather, good equipment and a good team."  </P> <P> Religion is also an important ingredient. Devout Buddhists, Sherpas pray for  protection and hold prayer sessions during climbs.  </P> <P> Fate has been kind to Pertemba. During his mountaineering career he has had  only two close calls, once narrowly escaping an avalanche and a second time  during a descent in darkness.  </P> <P> Other Sherpas have not been as fortunate. Seven were killed in the first  attempt on Everest in 1922 and many have died since.  </P> <P> Pertemba's close friend, Sungdare, who holds the world record along with Ang  Rita for scaling Everest five times, was not as lucky.  </P> <P> "During his first attempt he and two other climbers were forced to spend the  night outside. The others died but we had a very good rescue team who managed  to get Sungdare down," Pertemba said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Six Months in Hospital  </P> <P> Sungdare lost four toes to frostbite and spent six months in a hospital, but  "he hasn't had any problems since going back," Pertemba added.  </P> <P> Mountaineering has changed since Hillary's time. Siege-style expeditions with  large teams have given way to smaller groups and solo attempts.  </P> <P> The opening of Nepal's borders after World War II also resulted in a booming  tourist industry and Sherpas can now choose less hazardous occupations. Many  run guest lodges, tea houses or trekking companies.  </P> <P> The tourist boom has brought about improvements in education, health care and  the standard of living. Despite the influx of foreigners, Pertemba said,  Sherpas have guarded their ancient traditions.  </P> <P> "The local culture has become stronger because the changes have given us an  opportunity to explore our own country. Very few people could travel before."  </P> <P> Bonington has a "profound regard" for Sherpas and has often acknowledged how  vital they have been to all Everest expeditions. But that's not their most  important achievement, he said.  </P> <P> "The great success of the Sherpas is how well they have adapted to a changing  society," he said. "They are a resilient and wonderful people."  </P></p>

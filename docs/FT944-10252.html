			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Sears Roebuck Though Allstate now sells little insurance through Sears stores, the group used to point to tax advantages to justify keeping the two businesses together. But these benefits decline as Allstate's underwriting performance improves. Sears has finally decided that losing the tax break is a cost worth paying to set the two companies free. The market's initial reaction was to mark down Allstate shares, partly on fears that a large proportion of Sears' investors will dump the new Allstate stock, while the Sears share price rose sharply. In the longer term, they may move the other way. While Sears will finally revert to being a focused retailing group, it faces a tough task clawing back its position in the fiercely competitive American market. On the surface, Allstate's situation is even more difficult since it was hit by Dollars 845m (Pounds 515m) of earthquake losses in the first nine months of the year. Yet it is financially strong with a powerful market position. So its prospects are healthy if only it can reduce its catastrophe exposure. In this respect Tuesday's election of a Republican insurance commissioner in California could prove significant. The new commissioner is likely to prove more sympathetic to the industry's case than the present incumbent. The election is also good news for BAT Industries' Farmers unit, which is even bigger than Allstate in California. A fully independent Allstate is unlikely to be a more aggressive competitor. But its greater stock market visibility may emphasise the value of Farmers hidden inside BAT.</p>

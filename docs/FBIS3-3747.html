			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jian (7115 1696): "Nie Li and Tsang </F> Hin-chi Elected to NPC Standing Committee Through By-Election"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Lieutenant  General Nie Li and Hong Kong businessman Tsang Hin-chi were  elected to the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee in a by-election today.    Hence, the standing working body of the supreme organ of  state power in China has co-opted the woman with the highest  military rank in China and the only member from Hong Kong.    The fourth plenary session of the Second Session of the  Eighth NPC was held here this morning. A total of 2,728  deputies attended the plenum and made these two selections.    According to the stipulations of the Law on NPC  Organization,  when the NPC is not in session, the standing committee takes the  place of the NPC in discharging the legislative and supervisory  duties granted by the Constitution. The standing committee  should be composed of 155 members, including a chairman, 19 vice  chairmen, a secretary, and 134 standing committee members.    Over the past year, Vice Chairman Gan Ku, and Standing  Committee Members Yang Lieyu and Pu Jie passed away; Yang Yanyin  was appointed vice minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs,  and so resigned from standing committee membership. Therefore,  there were four vacancies.    Nie Li is the daughter of Nie Rongzhen, one of the late 10  marshals. She is vice president of the All-China Women's  Federation.    When she was 25, she went to the Soviet Union to study  automation control. She worked arduously for the development of  China's military industry for 33 years. Last September, she  retired from the important post of standing committee member of  the CPC Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for  National Defense.    Lieutenant General Nie Li, 63, has been a deputy to the  Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's.    Tsang Hin-chi, who comes from the Hong Kong business  circles,  is quite well-known among the people in China because whenever  we go to any large shopping mall in China, we can always find a  special counter exhibiting products of the "Gold Lion" series.  In the previous decade, this tycoon, who is well-known for his  "Gold Lion" business, donated hundreds of millions of Hong Kong  dollars to educational, cultural, sports, and social welfare  undertakings in China.    One after another, senior Chinese leaders and concurrent NPC  deputies Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji,  Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren deposited pink-colored  ballots in the ballot boxes in the Great Hall of the People  today.    This reporter saw that there were a total of 22 ballot boxes  and 32 balloting scrutineers in various places in the hall.    The votes, which are approximately twenty-four-mo in size,  were printed in the characters of eight nationality languages:  the Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uygur, Kazakstan, Korean, Yi, and  Zhuang nationalities.    After winning the by-election, Tsang Hin-chi expressed his  thanks for the NPC deputies' trust in him. He said that as a  standing committee member, he would represent the interests of  the people of Hong Kong to exercise various powers granted by  the Constitution in accordance with the law.    Tian Jiyun, executive chairman of the plenum, presided over  the election session today, which lasted about one hour and 40  minutes.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL SHORTCHANGED ON THE SECOND SHIFT  </P> <P> During the early 1970s, a radical notion arose that husbands should share the  work at home. This idea, which set men hyperventilating all over America, was  followed by the plague of lists.  </P> <P> "Up against the refrigerator door!" Mister. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, he would  cook. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, she would do the laundry. He would wash, she  would dry; he would drive the kids to school, she would pick them up; they  would live equally ever after.  </P> <P> Thus began power struggles over the vacuum, wrangles over the dryer, the  diapers and the children in them. She would insist, he would resist. Actively  or passively. Progress was often followed by slippage. And articles about  sharing housework were followed by articles about "The Women's Lib Divorce."  </P> <P> Ah, how quaint it all seems now. So petty. Can you believe that we once argued  over something so minor in the great scheme of the universe as changing the  sheets, dear? That love was limited by the list?  </P> <P> Welcome to the late 1980s. The lists have come down. So has the heat. There is  an uneasy truce or maybe simmering hostility in two-worker households.  </P> <P> He is doing more than his father and feeling under-appreciated. She is doing  more than her husband and feeling undervalued. There is a friction between  women whose lives have changed faster than the men they share them with. There  is a stalemate over the household.  </P> <P> Now Arlie Hochschild, a Berkeley professor, has written a book on the subject  that puts work at home back where it belongs: in the context of marital  relationships. "The Second Shift," her study of two-career parents over eight  years, describes what goes on in the hours before and after our "real jobs."  </P> <P> She begins with what we know. The wage gap in the outside world is mirrored by  a leisure gap at home. Women are "working" on average one month a year more  than their husbands. About 20% of men in her study shared the second shift  equally, 70% did more than a third and less than a half, and only 10% did less  than a third.  </P> <P> Even in the most egalitarian households, Hochschild suggests, women did  two-thirds of the daily jobs -- cooking -- while men did jobs without the same  deadline -- bills, repairs. When men shared, they were more likely to take over  child care, leaving women with the same amount of housecare, a job they found  much less satisfying.  </P> <P> Through her intimate portraits of families, we get to dissect the emotional  meaning of the work disparity. "When couples struggle," she says, "it is seldom  simply over who does what. Far more often it is over the giving and receiving  of gratitude." What happens to gratitude when a wife wants help at home and a  husband "gives her" the paycheck that comes from more time at the office.  Neither gets what he or she wants.  </P> <P> In one of the many small, telling observations of this book, Hochschild notes:  "In my interviews, a surprising number of women spoke of their fathers helping  their mothers 'out of love' or consideration . . . . But not one man . . . made  this link between help at home and love."  </P> <P> In the '80s, she says that "more couples wanted to share and imagined that they  did." But the quest to keep reality in line with ideals sometimes stretched  that imagination mightily. One of the couples devised an equal "division of  labor" this way: He took care of the dog and garage; she took care of the child  and house. They called it a deal.  </P> <P> In the basic deal of the '80s, most women whose husbands are not sharing have  giving up trying to change the division of labor. They have their own  strategies for working the second shift, "They were either super-moming,  cutting back their hours at work or cutting back at home."  </P> <P> They stopped pushing their husbands to change, Hochschild believes, because  "getting help at home was second on their wish list after 'want fewer tensions  at home.' " This fear of divorce quieted many women's demands. But at the same  time, women whose husbands didn't share thought about divorce more often, and  women who did divorce listed "neglect of home and child" as their chief  complaint.  </P> <P> I have always assumed that the argument about who works the second shift was  less about labor relations than about personal relations. Not surprisingly,  those men who "win" the argument about housework, whose wives work that extra  month, lose a good deal to exhaustion and resentment.  </P> <P> The bottom line of Hochschild's study is, after all, that difficult-to-quantify  thing called happiness. What one thing did contribute to marital happiness? She  reports unequivocally: "the husband's willingness to do the work at home." Put  that on the refrigerator door. Right where they used to post the lists.  </P></p>

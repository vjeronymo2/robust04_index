			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRET INGREDIENT  </P> <P> In response to "The Revenge of Successful Sitcoms," Jan. 14, by Steve  Weinstein:  </P> <P> Regarding TV producer Bob Boyett's comment that he and partner Tom Miller "want  a certain amount of nurturing people, a certain amount of women and older  people (on their sitcom staffs)," may I suggest that in his next interview he  refrain from referring to women and people over 35 as some kind of secret  ingredient in their sitcom stew.  </P> <P> Instead of coming across as the open-minded, family-loving fellows they claim  to be, Boyett and Miller sure sound like just another pair of sexist, ageist  Hollywood producers to me.  </P> <P> S. WENZ  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

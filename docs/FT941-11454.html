			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / BSkyB appeals on pirate cards British Sky Broadcasting is to appeal to Dublin's Supreme Court today in a new effort to block the distribution in the Irish Republic of pirate 'smartcards', which can unscramble the coded signals broadcast over the BSkyB system. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a substantial stake, lost a High Court case last month against Satellite Decoding Systems, which has been distributing the pirate cards outside the UK.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PORCELAIN'S FLYING AT ILLINOIS COURTHOUSE AS 5 TOILETS EXPLODE  </P> <P> Be careful about where you sit in the Sangamon County Building, where the  toilets have been exploding lately.  </P> <P> A water tank in the building's basement filled with air Tuesday, and the excess  pressure caused five toilets to be blown apart, sending the porcelain flying.  </P> <P> Court reporter Jerry Wedeking was a witness. He flushed a toilet in a  fourth-floor jury room and saw dollar-size pieces of porcelain fly around him.  </P> <P> "The first thing I did was check to see if there were any pieces sticking in  me," said Wedeking, a 27-year courthouse veteran.  </P></p>

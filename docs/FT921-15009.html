			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Big ideas in the small world of machine tools: A significant takeover There can be few big industrial sectors where a company can turn itself into the biggest US producer, and the fourth largest in the world, and still have annual sales of less than Dollars 700m (Pounds 384m). But in the world machine tool market, such a company is one of a handful of giants among thousands of minnows. And in an era of megadeals, all it took to bring about one of the biggest takeovers in machine tool history was a Dollars 70m acquisition. For that modest sum, Giddings &amp; Lewis bought fellow US machine tool maker Cross &amp; Trecker, once the world's largest machine tool maker, in November. The deal may have been a pinprick in takeover terms, but for Mr William Fife, the large chairman and chief executive at Giddings &amp; Lewis, there are big issues at stake: America's continuing role as a manufacturer, the future of a US machine tool industry trying to rebuild itself after a long battering from Japanese and European competition, and the lure of the European market, which accounts for 40-45 per cent of world machine tool consumption. Mr Fife, fortunately, is used to tough assignments. He is one of the few executives in the boardrooms of US manufacturing who have built their careers literally from the ground up - after leaving the Navy he became a sweeper on the midnight shift at Inland Steel. It is fitting, though, that he and his team from the small town of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, should have begun their task of integrating the two companies in a year which saw the strategic importance of machine tool manufacture underlined as never before. The Gulf war exposed the dependence of US aerospace and defence industries on foreign equipment, such as gears, made on foreign machine tools, giving a boost to campaigners for greater US government support of strategic industries and turning their future into a trade issue. Just after Christmas, President George Bush authorised negotiations with Japan and Taiwan to extend for two years voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) on exports to the US of certain computer numerical controlled (CNC) machine tools. But the VRAs are to be phased out gradually during that period, giving US machine tool makers, says Mr Fife, 'the opportunity and the incentive to continue our successful rebuilding to help make all American industry more competitive'. In the early 1970s, the average US machine tool company was small- or medium-sized, primarily serving the domestic market with a single product that faced little foreign competition, and conducting very little research. As recently as 1982, there were 1,400 active US machine tool makers. But very few seemed to realise that their market was changing - customers wanted multiple product lines and a much closer working partnership with the machinery manufacturers. Machine tools were becoming part of ever more complex machining centres and flexible manufacturing systems, and customers demanded solutions that could raise their productivity in increasingly competitive global markets. Now there are probably fewerthan 600 active US machine tool makers - still far too many in an industry where fragmentation has caused chronic financial weakness. Worse still, the US share of world machine tool consumption has fallen from around 20 per cent to 10 per cent over the past decade while the world market has doubled in size to about Dollars 43bn - a symptom of US industrial decline. And, over the same period, imports have doubled their share of the US market to 47 per cent last year, nearly half of which were from Japan. Most observers say that the Japanese, with their relentless product development programmes and marketing power, and the Europeans, with their commitment to spending on research, have responded better to the changes in the US and world marketplace. Mr Fife certainly thinks so, but since taking the top job at Giddings &amp; Lewis in 1987 after a spell at Cross &amp; Trecker, has been trying to buck the trend. Artificial divisions between product lines have been removed, a significant investment made - albeit rather belatedly - in a company-wide computer-aided design (CAD) network, and research and development spending lifted sharply to 10 per cent of sales, three times the US industry average. While the sales of Giddings &amp; Lewis' sales have nearly doubled from Dollars 125m in 1987 to Dollars 242m last year, producing earnings of Dollars 20m, the performance at Cross &amp; Trecker has been very different. It has clocked up losses of Dollars 100m over the last four financial years while sales have fluctuated around Dollars 420m-460m. The David-and-Goliath deal created the sole US representative in the world machine tool top 10, and a company of around 5,000 employees, but exploiting and maintaining this position will not be plain sailing. Mr Fife has three aims from the deal - product range expansion and extension, and global presence. A wider presence in the European market is a crucial element in the deal - C&amp;T's strengths on the continent should complement the Giddings &amp; Lewis UK presence, said Mr Paul Lugara, Arbroath-based group vice-president for European operations. In Mr Fife's favour is his continued willingness and ability to invest in research and development. That is due in part to tight cost controls forced by public company status - Giddings &amp; Lewis was spun off from AMCA International, a Canadian manufacturer, in a 1989 public offering. Giddings &amp; Lewis will also have to move quickly to lift morale at C&amp;T, which had been depressed by its recent performance. Already, a small UK factory at Telford has been closed with the loss of 27 jobs, and Mr Lugara says some further cost reductions and elimination of duplication will be necessary. But he denies reports that four senior UK executives at C&amp;T have been dismissed: 'There may be some changes of position, but we need their expertise,' he adds. There have been rumblings in the trade press, too, about the speed with which the Giddings &amp; Lewis name has supplanted much-loved names of C&amp;T subsidiaries such as Warner &amp; Swasey. But Mr Lugara says the change have not been a problem for customers or employees. 'We want to get across that we are one-stop shopping for factory automation,' says Mr Lugara. Only then can the Giddings &amp; Lewis deal create a unified bulwark against European and Japanese competition - giving the takeover a significance that few Dollars 70m deals could claim.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TOP TEN MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US Sales                                Worldwide sales COMPANY                 Dollars m       COMPANY               Dollars m Giddings &amp; Lewis          *663          Amada                   1,207 Cincinnati Milacron        429          Yamazaki Mazak          1,150 Ingersoll Milling          400          Okuma Machinery Works     739 Litton Industries        **290          Giddings &amp; Lewis         *663 Gleason Works              177          Mori Seiki                661 Monarch Machines Tool      116          Komatsu                   471 Hardinge Brothers          103          Schuler Group             464 Wean Inc.                  101          Toyoda Machine Works      464 Hurci                       94          Gildermeister             443 Brown &amp; Sharpe              67          MAHO                      442  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Combined sales of Giddings &amp; Lewis plus Cross &amp; Trecker Source: American Machinist **Excludes material handling  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Ghana votes on Rawlings and reform: Economic programme is on the ballot and in the balance GHANA goes to the polls today after eleven years of military rule. The presidential elections, the first since Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings seized power in 1981, will be a critical test in Africa of the continent's fragile transition to democracy and sustainable economic growth. After nine years of economic growth, Ghanaian voters are faced with a complex choice: should they stick with Flt Lt Rawlings, despite his heavy-handed leadership and well charted human rights abuses, or should they return to the mould of two traditional political parties with a less than favourable track record on the economy since independence in 1957. Concerns about the future of Ghana's economic reform programme in a post-electoral democratic order are also shared by international donors who have poured in about Dollars 650m a year (8 per cent of GDP) to support Ghana's drive towards economic reform. Many donors fear that austere economic reform in Africa could be jeopardised by a wave of democratic populism. They also believe that many of the unpopular reforms, undertaken in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa throughout the 1980s were only possible under authoritarian government. In a recent internal World Bank document entitled 'Ghana  - 2000 and beyond' the Bank says that if Ghana makes the leap to self-sustainable growth it would have tremendous implications for other African countries, but it warns: 'Authoritarianism often has been seen as a useful, if regrettable, expedient for effective policymaking in the face of political instability.' There is little fundamental economic policy difference between the five presidential candidates in today's election. However, opponents of Flt Lt Rawlings are more critical of the austerity programme without offering a coherent alternative. Western donors feel that at the very least a defeat of Flt Lt Rawlings would cause a period of economic policy instability and that a democratically elected president would be more inclined to pander to populist sentiments and opinion. The question Ghanaian voters will decide, in part, is whether the past nine years of painful economic reform which has produced considerable benefits will translate into support for Flt Lt Rawlings, particularly among the rural farmers who have benefited most from better producer prices. 'To a certain extent the election is a referendum on structural adjustment,' said a western economist. There are four contenders standing against Flt Lt Rawlings. The strongest challenger is Prof Adu Boahen representing the conservative New Patriotic Party. He is expected to draw his support from Ghanaians who have suffered during the past decade, particularly town dwellers and sacked civil servants, and from the powerful Ashanti tribe. However, the decision by Ghana's electorate on structural adjustment will be considerably distorted by Flt Lt Rawlings' poor track record on human rights and by the government's less than total commitment to the reform programme, which many economists say could have yielded much better results. Donors say Ghana's economic reform faltered in the face of government reluctance to accept the critical second phase of adjustment which involves stimulating investment by releasing economic control and ownership to private foreign and local investors. After nine years of austerity and often painful reform, many Ghanaians have yet to see significant increases in living standards. The promise of short, sharp, shock therapy for the economy quickly turning into high economic growth rates has faded. Measures which include devaluation, liberalisation of trade and foreign exchange, a disciplined fiscal and monetary policy and retrenchment of bloated bureaucracies have given Ghana some rewards. Inflation has fallen from 123 per cent in 1983 to 18 per cent last year and the country has managed an average growth rate of 5 per cent a year since 1984. But with population growth at around 3 per cent real per capita incomes have only grown about 2 per cent. When savings are deducted, real per capita consumption is even less. If economic and population growth continues at current levels, economists estimate it will take Ghanaians 40 to 50 years to double their incomes, presently at a paltry Dollars 400 a year. The critical question facing Ghana, as in many other adjusting countries in Africa, is how to move to self-sustainable accelerated growth of 8-10 per cent a year where private flows of capital and export growth replaces aid-dependence. To achieve this gross investment will have to increase significantly from 16.5 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 20-25 per cent over the next five years and national savings will have to rise from 13.1 per cent to 20 per cent of GDP. A private sector working group has made recommendations to government of measures to be taken. The list includes speeding up divestiture of 330 state-owned companies including 17 classed as 'strategic', slashing bureaucratic obstacles to foreign and local investment and reducing the role of the Ghana Investment Centre from an overly-protective body to a facilitatory and promotional one. Many Ghanaians feel that Flt Lt Rawlings, with his distaste for private profit enterprise, has been a big obstacle to the fundamental change in attitudes which need to be taken towards foreign investors and businessmen to achieve much higher growth. However, any incoming elected president will face the same challenges and tasks: deepening the reform programme and accelerating economic growth while dealing with the new post-electoral democratic reality.</p>

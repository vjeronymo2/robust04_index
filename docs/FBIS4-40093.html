			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ostankino television company has reduced  broadcasting to Armenia to just a few hours in the evenings.  ITAR- TASS reports that this has been caused by demands for  additional payments for daytime broadcasts. Tigran Akopyan,  chairman of Armenia's State Television and Radio, explained that  the restrictions will be in force until Yerevan pays Moscow for  the additional expenses of communications enterprises. The  technical service of Armenian television estimates the cost of  the services at 600 million Russian rubles.</p>

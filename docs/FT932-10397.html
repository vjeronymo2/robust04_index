			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Sport: Japanese tee ceremony - Golf / John Hopkins plays a round with a millionaire club owner THE CAR pulled up slowly and carefully at the crest of a hill and two men clambered out eagerly. In front of them was a patch of earth, smooth and flat - a tee, clearly, but one without any grass. The land plunged violently downhill to a pond ringed with wooden stakes. Beyond lay the green, slim and enticing and tilted slightly from back to front. 'Welcome to the 12th hole,' said Masao Nagahara. 'What club would you like? It is 180 yards to carry the water. The wind is following. I think it is a five wood or maybe a three iron. I lose many balls on this hole.' This was the scene at the London Golf Club last Tuesday morning. Wherever you looked there were men at work, raking, digging, hoe-ing, smoothing, finishing. The concrete cart paths, eyesores on any course, reflected the May sunshine. Far away in the distance, near where a gentle snore rose from the traffic on the M20 motorway, a gang of men picked up stones. I took the five wood and tucked my tie into my shirt. 'This is how Harry Vardon, Ted Ray and Francis Ouimet dressed when they played off for the 1913 US Open,' I said. Nagahara giggled. He giggled a lot. He was entitled to. It was his course, his club, his ball. The whole shooting match as far as the eye could see was his. My shot flew over the water and the green before thudding into the retaining bank. 'Congratulations,' said Nagahara, grinning. 'You are the first journalist to carry the water at this hole.' The London Golf Club, which sprawls over more than 600 acres near Wrotham in Kent, will open in September. It has two courses, one designed by Jack Nicklaus personally, the other by Ron Kirby, an employee. At a conservative estimate of Pounds 30m, it is the most expensive new club in Britain. But if anyone can afford it, Nagahara can. He earned his money by buying land around Tokyo. As the city expanded, so sold at ever-increasing profits. First he endowed a foundation in Osaka, the Osaka Sports College. Then, he endowed himself. 'This country is the home of golf,' he said. 'I thought to myself: I will build a golf course in Britain. Golf and life are very similar. They both have many dramas. When you play 18 holes, you have 18 stories.' A stocky man with the forearms of a stevedore, he is besotted by golf. As he piloted a Nissan saloon car around the site of his creation last Tuesday, he was asked if he knew the old joke about Nicklaus: 'He was given an unlimited budget to build a golf course and he exceeded it.' Nagahara laughed so much, he almost choked. 'Jack Nicklaus is the best,' he said. 'He is known for that. I knew he was expensive but he is best.' He giggled again. 'I am proud. This course is all paid for. There is no mortgage.' The London Golf Club might be the most expensive Japanese golf venture in Britain (and perhaps outside Japan) but it is by no means the only one. Since the mid-1980s, when their economy was booming, the Japanese have had both a yen to spend and the yen to do it. Hitoshi Matsuura bought the Turnberry hotel and golf club in Scotland sight unseen. 'As long as I have been building and running golf courses in Japan, I have always wanted to own a course in the home of golf as well,' said Matsuura. 'Everybody in Japan has heard of Turnberry.' Before this, Zenya Hamada had bought the Old Thorns club near Liphook, Hampshire, before selling it on to London Kosaido, the London subsidiary of a Japanese printing group. The Buckinghamshire, owned by Asahi Breweries, is in operation near Denham, and The Oxfordshire, a lavish club built near Thame by Matsuura's Nitto Albion Company, will open this summer. This move into golf in Britain by the Japanese was part an investment and part a reaction to the prejudice against them that exists at many British clubs. For years, the Japanese had been one of golf's under-classes, like women and Jews, victims of racial prejudice. The Jews overcame the prejudice that was shown to them by building their own clubs: Dyrham Park and Hartsbourne in the London area and Moor Allerton near Leeds. Now, the Japanese are doing the same. At the London Golf Club, the aim is for 70 per cent British, 10 per cent international overseas members - and the rest Japanese. The clubhouse contains western-style showers and Japanese o-furo baths as well as a spike bar and a Japanese restaurant. Nagahara himself is as westernised as he could be. At lunch at a local pub, he drank a lager to wash down hamburger and chips doused in tomato sauce and mayonnaise. Before taking me around his course, he donned a golf cap, put a camera around his neck and said: 'Now, I am typical Japanese tourist.' Later, he insisted on taking my picture outside the handsome clubhouse. Even Japanese money, however, must bow to British traditions. A public footpath passes through the site of the London Golf Club and no amount of money could divert it. 'Sometimes, we Japanese do not understand the British,' said Nagahara, clearly puzzled. We drove through a glade thick with bluebells. 'Smell them,' commanded Nagahara. 'They are beautiful.' We visited the manor house, sadly in decay but soon to be renovated, with the oldest apple tree in Kent in its garden. Masao Nagahara looked around at all the beauty that Kent, one of England's most bounteous counties, could lay at his feet. 'May in England is a wonderful month,' he said.</p>

As the press secretary of the Lithuanian Government Viktoras  Baublys told Interfax, the meeting focused on the consequences  for the housing construction program of the arrest of the  president of the Lithuanian construction company Selma.    Selma's president Vladas Laurinavicius was arrested last  Thursday while the Prosecutor's Office searched homes of those  suspected of machinations with the purchase of arms from the  Russian military by the Ministry of Home Defense.  Laurinavicius, former prisoner, was a mediator during these  operations. His company "Selma" is building housing for the  Russian military in the Kaliningrad region under an agreement  with Russia.    On Friday Laurinavicius was scheduled to meet with the  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who was then visiting  Kaliningrad.    It was agreed in Vilnius that on Thursday, Deputy Foreign  Minister of Lithuania Vladislovas Domarkas and government  officials would pay a visit to Kaliningrad. They will assess  the situation with the construction of housing for the Russian  military and determine if there is a need for the Lithuanian  Government's interference in the process.</p>

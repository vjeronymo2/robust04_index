			<p>BFN     [Text] Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Espirito Santo, 8 Jun (AE)  -- If elected president, PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva wants to create a public television channel  to counterbalance the "monopoly of the great private  broadcasting companies." Today he defended the creation of a  public broadcasting company reaching from "Oiapoque [Amapa  State] to Chui [Rio Grande do Sul State]," and asked, referring  to the owners of the television networks: "How is it that one  citizen alone can speak to 80 million Brazilians?"    Lula mentioned the "TV Cultura" station of Sao Paulo as an  ideal model for the new public station. "I want a television  channel transmitting serious reports to counterbalance the large  television networks, a channel that will broadcast something  more than commercial programs."    The PT candidate criticized the excessive violence shown on  television, and said that in Brazil 90 percent of the media is  in the hands of nine families. He also criticized the rules  used to grant television station licenses. "Every town in the  interior has a former deputy, a former governor, who owns a  radio or television channel," he complained.    Lula guarantees that the new television channel -- which  would be created by reformulating TV Educativa -- would not be  just another public television station serving merely to  increase the federal government's payroll. "I want to take  advantage of what already exists in several states, and transmit  a uniform national programming," he said.</p>

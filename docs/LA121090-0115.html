			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> COAST DEBUT FOR RUTTER'S 'MAGNIFICAT'  </P> <P> Christmas concert season has begun, which means it's time, in most quarters,  for Handel's "Messiah." But William Hall and the Master Chorale of Orange  County decided on a different route for their holiday program, performed in  Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Saturday night.  </P> <P> It's a decision that has its risks, not the least of which is that most  Christmas choral music pales in comparison to Handel's masterpiece. Most of  what the Master Chorale performed Saturday did so -- including and especially  the evening's main event, the "Magnificat" by English composer John Rutter, in  its reported West Coast premiere.  </P> <P> The piece is a virtual encyclopedia of musical cliches, a long-winded, tamely  tonal, predictable exercise in glitzy populism. In it, Rutter makes plentiful  use of composers past and present, from Copland to Vaughan Williams, from  Stravinsky to John Williams. He starts right off in the first movement (out of  seven) by crossing Carl Orff with the Marlboro theme.  </P> <P> To this kind of drivingly rhythmic, choral heftiness he adds plenty of  contrast, in the form of gushingly sentimental pop ballads. The Latin text,  given the context, sounds ridiculous throughout, but especially here.  </P> <P> Mezzo-soprano Deborah Winsor-Williams sang the ballads with simple point and  generous tone, despite occasional strain. The choir, as throughout the evening,  sang with massive gusto, astute balance and precise ensemble. It was never in  danger of being overpowered by the considerable orchestral contribution, played  energetically by the so-called Master Chorale Orchestra.  </P> <P> Elsewhere the program consisted mostly of slick arrangements of carols: There  were more medleys than in a Sammy Davis Jr. act, more modulations than on a  dozen Barry Manilow albums.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa Children's Chorus made its debut performance, singing solidly in  antiphony with the chorale in "While by My Sheep." The Californians, a small  group of women singers, made a campy appearance, singing, among other things,  "Mr. Santa" to the tune of an Andrews-Sisters style "Mr. Sandman."  </P> <P> The high points of the evening: Daniel Pinkham's Renaissance-tinged "Gloria,"  and two refreshingly simple, a cappella arrangements of carols by Hall. Good  music is the best way to celebrate Christmas.  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: NYSE approves policy to protect shareholders The New York Stock Exchange has approved a new shareholder voting rights policy that will prevent US companies from restricting or diluting the voting powers of shareholders through special stock issues. Mr James Buck, the NYSE's corporate secretary, said: 'The new policy prohibits the most abusive types of recapitalisations which take away the voting rights of shareholders.' Under the policy, companies will not be able to conduct share exchange offers where the stock issued carries lesser voting rights than of the stock originally owned by shareholders. They will be prohibited from adopting plans which require shareholders to hold stock a certain length of time before they can use the stock to vote, and from issuing 'super-voting' stock above existing common stock, unless such stock existed at the time of the original flotation. However, companies with existing dual-class capital structures will not be affected by the new policy. The NYSE's new policy has been approved by the American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers. The rules should be quickly approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, Mr Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman, proposed the exchanges adopt a uniform policy to protecting shareholders' voting rights. The exchanges were able to draw up a new voting rights policy after reaching agreement with the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the largest US public companies. In 1990, the Roundtable successfully appealed to a Federal court to block the SEC introducing a voting rights policy. Since then its position has softened and, according to Mr Buck of the NYSE, the new policy enjoyed 'the overwhelming support of the business community'.</p>

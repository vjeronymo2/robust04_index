			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok] </F>   [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said on 1 April,  Washington time, that the UN Security Council's adoption of the  president's statement raised the possibility of resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Minister Han said  this at a news conference he gave to ROK correspondents at the  National Press Club in Washington after holding talks with U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry. He also said: "We attach  more significance to the measures -- which may be taken by the  UN Security Council -- than to dialogue." He added: "The  government has no plan for now to propose a diplomatic  initiative to Pyongyang."    The following are questions posed and the answers:    [Question] What has happened to the ROK-U.S. coordination of  views on the Team Spirit exercise?    [Han Sung-chu] North Korea has not fulfilled its agreement  with the United States. This has created circumstances under  which we can cancel our plan to withhold the exercise. However,  a final decision will be announced after consultations between  the ROK and the United States which will be held when U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry visits the ROK.    [Question] The signing of the contract to purchase Patriot  missiles is reportedly imminent. Can you comment?    [Han] That is absolutely not true. We did not buy those  Patriot missiles to be deployed in the ROK: The United States  deploys them because the U.S. Forces in the ROK need them.    [Question] What do you think of Secretary Perry's strong  remarks toward North Korea?    [Han] He said portions of his full remarks were reported  after being exaggerated. He also said he stressed a need to  maintain a deterrent or defensive capability depending on the  future situation.    [Question] Did President Kim Yong-sam not give you the  mission of having a resolution passed at the UN Security Council?    [Han] UN Security Council discussions are multilateral.  Therefore, no country can have its hope fulfilled 100 percent.  Our country had tried to have a resolution passed at the UN  Security Council. However, one must not overlook the fact that  the recently passed statement of the Security Council president  contains more substantial details.    [Question] Do you have any hidden card for resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue?    [Han] The North Korean nuclear issue is complex and has no  special remedy. Therefore, I would like to highly assess the  Security Council president's statement because the statement has  made it possible to start discussions on the nuclear issue again.    [Question] Is the troop reinforcement, which Secretary Perry  has referred to, an irrevocable, final decision?    [Han] I do not think so.    [Question] How will our diplomacy be carried out for a few  weeks from now?    [Han] First of all, I think, China will make efforts to make  North Korea correctly realize the message contained in the  president's statement, and the contact between the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will possibly  resume. I believe that if nuclear inspections are completed in  this course, the possibility of resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue will arise.    [Question] When do you think North Korea will receive  further inspections?    [Han] We think there is a deadline in actuality even though  one was not mentioned in the statement. The fact that the IAEA  believes that inspections must resume in six weeks is a good  point for consideration.</p>

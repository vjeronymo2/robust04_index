			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Devanlay to strengthen hold over Lacoste DEVANLAY, the French textile group, is strengthening its hold over Lacoste sportswear by buying the North American manufacturing and distribution rights to the brand. Since 1977 Lacoste has been manufactured and distributed in North America by Crystal Brands, a US clothing company. Crystal's contract runs until June 30 1993 and will then be taken up by Devanlay, which already holds 35 per cent of Chemise Lacoste, the company responsible for Lacoste's sports shirts. Crystal is also selling its 50 per cent interest in Lacoste Alligator, the holding company for the brand, to the Lacoste family and Devanlay.</p>

Kasoulidhis said the measures must be implemented in a  way that will not directly or indirectly recognize the  pseudostate. He said some of the points in the report will be  discussed if and when the Turkish side replies positively to the  three UN documents. The spokesman said: It would be a great  diplomatic mistake to say that the Greek Cypriot side will  negotiate the methods suggested by the experts, who will be a  point for negotiating themselves.    Kasoulidhis said President Glavkos Kliridhis does not intend  to convene the National Council to discuss the substance of the  confidence-building measures or the reports by the UN experts.  He concluded: The National Council discussed the tactics and  strategy.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Consumer credit shows 36 per cent increase: Confidence stimulated by lower interest rates and receding fear of unemployment Consumer credit in December was 36 per cent higher than in December 1992, the Finance &amp; Leasing Association said yesterday. The figures indicate that consumer confidence has revived as interest rates and the fear of unemployment have declined. The association, which represents companies providing consumer credit, business finance and leasing, and motor finance, said it was surprised by the weak trend in official retail sales figures for December. Those showed a seasonally adjusted fall of 0.2 per cent from November and an annual rise of just 4 per cent. However, the credit figures may indicate that consumers are increasingly turning to store cards or hire purchase to buy goods, rather than using cash. Motor finance figures were particularly strong, showing a 45 per cent rise between December 1992 and last December. The FLA said companies were starting to upgrade their car fleets, having postponed such expenditure during the recession. Mr Tony Mallin, FLA chairman, said April's tax rises would stretch consumers' cashflow and the growth of retail sales would slow down. Official figures for December consumer credit - which, unlike the FLA figures, include bank credit cards - will be published on Monday. Business finance figures were less strong, increasing by 13 per cent between December 1992 and December 1993. Mr Mallin said: 'We would expect the improvement in industrial investment to lag behind consumer credit as we come out of recession, and our figures reflect this. All the indications are that companies are now beginning to invest in new plant and machinery.'</p>

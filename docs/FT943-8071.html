			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Smokeless bullets give British Coal a shot in the arm: The turnaround at one of the corporation's subsidiaries In the early years they were called Bronowski's bullets: small lumps of smokeless fuel named after Jacob Bronowski, the National Coal Board research director who later went on to write and present the Ascent of Man television series for the BBC. But although the bullets are popular, the British Coal subsidiary which sells them - Coal Products - has struggled for most of its life to make a profit, and usually made losses. It has turned itself around just in time for privatisation. As the corporation yesterday sent potential bidders confidential details of Coal Products, it was able to boast of a company that last year made operating profits of Pounds 16m. The subsidiary's turnover of Pounds 131m is larger than three of the corporation's five core mining regions which are being sold off this year. Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said the recent turnaround, which began in 1992-93 with Pounds 5m of profits, had generated a keen interest in the sale. Coal Products was given its strongest impetus in the 1950s after a series of smogs alarmed London and increased pressure for a ban on burning coal in cities. The 1956 Clean Air Act established a series of smokeless zones. Although other smokeless fuels were on sale, notably Anglo-United's Coalite, the NCB, later renamed British Coal, developed several of its own including Homefire, which attracted the 'bullets' nickname. These have helped the company to capture 30 per cent of the UK solid smokeless fuel market and 60 per cent of the foundry coke market. Among British Coal's non-mining companies, only British Fuels Group has a larger turnover. Making money out of sales has proved problematic, however. Mr Proctor said the profits turnaround of the last two years was due in part to a decision to concentrate on marketing just Homefire and one other brand, Phurnacite. The company had also benefited from the closure of a lossmaking plant in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and a 50 per cent reduction in headquarters overheads in the last 18 months. British Coal was unable to say who the likely bidders would be but it is thought that several of the companies which are considering bids for the five mining regions will also be looking at Coal Products. RJB Mining and Ryan Group, which both have interests in smokeless fuel, are among possible contenders. Coal Products buys about 1m tonnes of coal a year and this would provide mining companies with scope for vertical integration. Several foreign companies are thought to be considering bids and Mr David Foster, the subsidiary's operations director, is considering launching a management buy-out. British Coal is asking for initial bids by September 30 with the hope of completing the sale by the end of the year. The corporation's widespread property interests and its British Fuel Groups are among other subsidiary activities being prepared for disposal. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "Sellafield Catastrophe 'Could Be 10 </F> Times Worse Than Chernobyl'"]    [Text] Millions of people would need to be evacuated if  just one of the high-level nuclear waste storage tanks at  Sellafield in Cumbria lost its coolant and released  radioactivity, said a report published yesterday.    The report, commissioned by local authorities potentially in  the path of the radioactive plume, says that the risk of  catastrophe may be remote but the effects would be huge --  potentially at least 10 times more than Chernobyl.    Sellafield's 1,400 cubic metres of heat-producing waste is  kept in 21 tanks by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). Both the  Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, which polices safety at  Sellafield, and BNFL said yesterday they were confident that a  series of fail-safe devices would prevent the kind of disaster  warned of in the report.    Its author is Dr. Peter Taylor, a nuclear researcher who has  served on a government committee on the sea disposal of nuclear  waste and advised the Department of Environment. The European  Commission made available to him computer equipment on which an  accident could be modelled.    It showed that a major release from a single tank could  require evacuation and decontamination of populations out to  1,000 kilometres (625 miles) from the site, and relocation of  large numbers of people for periods up to a year. Depending on  wind direction and whether it was raining (which increases  contamination), between 2 million and 28 million people faced  evacuation.    Glasgow, Strathclyde, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and  Liverpool could all be under the plume, depending on the  prevailing wind. All these cities contributed to the cost of  the report. Technology exists to make the tanks safer, says the  report. Its cost would be about equal to the 500 million pound  profits from the first 10 years of the new Thorp reprocessing  plant.    BNFL said in a statement that the report assumed a series of  events that was unlikely in the extreme. "It appears to be  nothing more than scaremongering, in order to get cheap  headlines."    Dr. Sam Harbison, of the nuclear inspectorate, said: "The  probability of an accident is small, even if the consequences  are large."</p>

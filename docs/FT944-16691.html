			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Russia's tragicomedian: Boris Yeltsin's antics could backfire President Boris Yeltsin has long been attacked by Russia's nationalists and communists as an unworthy upholder of democracy. They have accused him of falsifying last December's referendum result to get the constitution he wanted; and derided him for subsequently acting outside that constitution to push through measures, such as privatisation, against parliament's will. But the disillusionment that is now taking hold among his supporters in democratic and liberal circles is altogether more worrying. That these new critics, from the core of his power base, are finding him increasingly autocratic and unpredictable, bodes ill for his political survival. However, more than Mr Yeltsin's reputation is being damaged by the actions that have prompted their criticisms. Russia's position on the world stage has been diminished by his recent erratic behaviour on foreign trips. And the country's need for greater domestic stability has hardly been served by the policy reversals that have come with Mr Yeltsin's accommodation of his foes, at the expense of his supporters. Pro-reform ministers allege that presidential advisers are interfering or even blocking them in their efforts to introduce more liberal policies, while the president is ignoring appeals to sack those accused of corruption or authoritarian behaviour. The president's long-serving (by Russian standards) press secretary, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, last week warned that Mr Yeltsin was being tempted to authoritarian measures by some of his more powerful and conservative aides - especially Mr Victor Iliushin, head of his sec-retariat. Two former aides - Mr Genady Burbulis, once his right hand man and first deputy prime minister (in 1992), and Mrs Galina Starovoitova, former adviser on nationalities - have both called for the democratic movement to distance itself from him. Mr Burbulis said that there could be no question of Mr Yeltsin running again after his term expires in 1996 and that the greatest problem for democrats was to support him in ending his present term with dignity. Mr Boris Fyodorov, who twice worked with Mr Yeltsin as finance minister, last weekend called for liberals to pass into opposition, since the administration was now becoming more communist than democratic. However, it has been the 'three embarrassments' of his recent foreign trips that have brought to a head the attacks from both the opposition and the president's former allies. During the ceremony in Berlin to mark the withdrawal of Russian troops, Mr Yeltsin grabbed the baton from the conductor of a police band and staged an impromptu display of vigorous conducting and singing. In Washington, after meetings with President Bill Clinton, he was decidedly over-boisterous. And two weeks ago, he snubbed Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, when he failed to descend from the aircraft at Shannon airport on his way back from the US. Comic in themselves, these incidents add up to a potentially terrifying vision of a nuclear state's leader not in control of himself. They also undermined the purpose of Mr Yeltsin's trip to the US, which was to emphasise that Russia is a great power and should be seen as such. Mr Yeltsin does represent a great power, but it is much weaker than the superpower Soviet Union and getting weaker. His initiatives on the world stage, including a proposal for deep nuclear cuts by the main nuclear powers and a push to strengthen the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at the expense of Nato, have had at best non-committal reactions from the west. Were he stronger, he might command more attention for ideas which are at least interesting. At home, Izvestiya, once his most loyal ally in the press, has ripped into him for the Germany incident, calling his behaviour 'our shame'. Communist deputies repeated the charge on the opening of parliament last week. And Mr Yegor Yakovlev, the veteran liberal journalist, sharpened the attack in his Obshaya Gazeta last weekend. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the economic reformer who leads the Yabloko block and has been running for the presidency for more than a year, says Mr Yeltsin is a spent force: a man - who as he said himself in his recent presidential memoir, A View from the Kremlin - wants no more than 'tranquillity' for Russia. Mr Yeltsin can hope for little tranquillity. This year's impressive fall in inflation, achieved by slashing public expenditure, now looks like unravelling after Mr Yeltsin announced, in late summer, Rbs4,200bn worth of soft credits for the defence sector and for investment. The International Monetary Fund is sceptical about a standby agreement this year, and though foreign portfolio investment has gone up sharply, little of it has been in the form of longer-term capital. Last week, Mr Yeltsin said he would not seek to delay the June 1996 presidential election, but did not say if he would stand. Whether he does or not, from now on the pressures on him will include those from the pretenders to his chair. No one really knows how resilient Mr Yeltsin will prove to be. For every expert who knows he is a hopeless, even a fatally ill, alcoholic, there is another who knows he is a strong if moody man, who likes a drink.</p>

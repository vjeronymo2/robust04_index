			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Market activity declines Declines in activity in Europe's two biggest equity markets, Germany and the UK, brought total turnover at the eight bourses measured by NatWest Securities down by 3.5 per cent in September after the substantial, 10.7 per cent rise in August. However, says Mr James Cornish at NatWest, the fall was by no means uniform; five of the eight saw turnover gains although share prices fell overall with the FT-Acturaries Europe index down 6.4 per cent, after the July/August summer rally which took them 7.8 per cent higher. Mr Cornish adds that international investors returned after a summer lull, with turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London rising to a 'normal' 16.2 per cent of that in continental domestic markets from 15.2 per cent in the month before. The star performers in volume terms last month were: France, where turnover rose 15.8 per cent although the share price index dropped 8.6 per cent; Italy, with a 12.5 per cent gain after a 15.9 per cent August drop - reflecting hopes that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, was getting his political act together; Spain, where a rise of 11.9 per cent in Madrid volumes contrasted with a drop of 16.4 per cent via the Spanish Seaq International market in London; and Belgium, which saw business up 10.7 per cent on top of a 29.4 per cent rise in August.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                MONTHLY TOTAL IN LOCAL CURRENCIES (BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     May       June       July       Aug      US Bourse             1994       1994       1994      1994   Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium            73.08     71.22      43.50     56.27      1.73 France            175.15    215.75     145.26    146.71     27.15 Germany           151.07    165.42     127.41    152.68     96.69 Italy             99,228    59,404     49,940    46,276     29.31 Netherlands        21.80     26.40      18.40     23.90     13.49 Spain           1,340.00  1,308.75   1,282.19    903.85      6.91 Switzerland        26.12     21.63      18.58     18.80     14.14 UK                 44.27     46.32      45.16     52.78     81.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

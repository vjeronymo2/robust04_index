			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Service by fractions - Costs do make a difference In an industry which defines the difference between success and failure in fractions of a percentage point, costs make a difference for sharp-eyed clients asking whether the fund manager has under- or out-performed the industry median. High on the list of costs are those required for custody. 'Typically, all the leading fund managers in the UK had their own custodians,' says Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner in the investment practice at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow. 'It was a fairly cosy relationship and there was no unbundling of services because pension fund trustees did not know what a custodian was.' The recent publication of a report from the UK government's advisory panel on occupational pension law, headed by Professor Roy Goode, urged that the appointment of custodians should be a function delegated to trustees, a move which Mr O'Sullivan believes will only serve to heighten awareness of just how much that service costs. 'We came across one European bank that was offering clients interest rates of three percentage points below base rates on cash balances of Pounds 250,000 or less,' he says. Furthermore, in the course of advising clients, Mr O'Sullivan says he has come across custodial banks which habitually credit client accounts for transactions the maximum number of days after execution which the client's contract allows. Mr O'Sullivan is one of a growing number of UK pension fund consultants specialising in advising clients how to get the most out of their custodian at the lowest cost. Consultants of a similar stripe have been carrying on a land office business in the US for years, with the result that prices for the basic master custody service have been driven down to barely profitable levels. Consultants urge clients to consider the various components of a custodian's service, and examine whether each can be obtained more cheaply through the use of several providers. Awareness about fees is accompanied by increasingly complex client needs. The use of derivative instruments for sophisticated hedging strategies is becoming an accepted element of investment. Investment strategies around the world increasingly require cross-border fund movements. A study prepared by InterSec Research Corp, a pension fund research group, concludes that US pension funds transferred nearly Dollars 50bn abroad in the first six months of 1993. This compares with Dollars 30bn which went abroad in the whole of 1992. Of that, Dollars 2bn went into emerging markets. By contrast, at the end of 1992, US investment in emerging markets was Dollars 5.4bn in total. The later development has in particular spurred demand for the so-called global custodian - the custodian who can service the client's needs in any number of centres, especially investments in emerging markets. According to Philips and Drew Fund Management's 1993 survey of investment industry trends, there has been an increasing use of global custodians by clients. Some say this may be somewhat misleading. 'They are choosing custodians with global capacity,' says Mr Michael Borkan, vice president at Bank of New York's custody business. 'But what they really want are a series of regional custodians.' Mr Simon Murray, consultant at Davis International Banking Consultants, says that some European banks still do not offer interest on cash balances, and have tended not to have made the significant systems investments, thus forcing them to be more labour-intensive and more expensive. But Mrs Adrienne Cooper, partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, says that price is typically not at the top of the list of criteria for clients selecting a custodian. Mrs Cooper, who carried out a comprehensive study of custodial services in Britain for a leading UK insurance company, says: 'People talk about all these added services. But what they really want is to have all the basic stuff done well. Better than if they had done it themselves. 'But it is important to say that most of the outfits contracting for custodial services don't know what it is costing them.' One UK pension fund which has loudly advocated greater transparency in custodial charges is ESN, which manages the Pounds 12.5bn pension scheme of the privatised electricity companies. 'You appoint a custodian and you appoint a fund manager on the basis that you have clarity of responsibility and clarity of cost,' says Mr Brian Matthews, finance director.</p>

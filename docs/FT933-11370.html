			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Brussels split over loans for steel restructuring THE European Commission yesterday failed to agree a loan scheme to help steelmakers establish a Dollars 1bn restructuring fund, dealing another blow to the European Community's steel rescue plan, Reuter reports from Brussels. Several commissioners questioned the legal basis which would be used to implement the plan, a Brussels spokesman said. The Commission will not be able to consider the matter again until early September because of its August break. This could make it difficult for steel companies to meet the Community's September 30 deadline for presenting a restructuring plan. That deadline was already in doubt because the EC postponed a critical meeting of industry ministers which was supposed to resolve several steel subsidy disputes this month. The loan scheme is part of an EC rescue plan designed to persuade steel companies to shed 30m tonnes of excess crude steel capacity. The money would be lent to groups of companies, organised along three product lines, which had agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts. Those making the cuts would be paid by those who benefited, with the loans helping to get the plan off the ground. Commission sources said the scheme would involve about Ecu1bn to cover capacity cuts of about 10m tonnes of finished steel products, divided as follows: Ecu700m for 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip; Ecu140m for 2m tonnes of plates; Ecu160m for 2.5m tonnes of heavy sections. Brussels is seeking about 20m tonnes of cuts in finished products, but some will have to come from companies which are not part of those groups, a Commission official said. The spokesman had no further details about the problems with the scheme's legal basis, but said the Commission's legal service had some reservations. The plan is based on provisions of the European Coal and Steel Community treaty. Industry ministers are scheduled to meet on September 21 to resolve disputes over Spanish and Italian plans to aid their steel industries, a move considered critical to the restructuring effort.

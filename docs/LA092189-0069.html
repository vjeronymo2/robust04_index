			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIOPPINO CHALLENGE  </P> <P> Santa Monica's Ocean Ave Seafood won the first cioppino contest staged in this  seafaring town, indicating that what started as a San Francisco specialty may  be more at home in the Southland.  </P> <P> Another Southern California restaurant, John Dominis of Newport Beach, came in  third, while second place went to the Spyglass Inn of Shell Beach.  </P> <P> Cioppino is a robust fisherman's stew based on the day's catch rather than any  set formula. Tomatoes, olive oil, herbs and wine are standard ingredients, and  shellfish usually predominate. Introduced decades ago by Italians and  Portuguese working off the northern coast, cioppino has become linked to  Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Because no restaurant from that tourist attraction took part in the contest  (two canceled), judges could not determine whether San Francisco had lost its  culinary grip.  </P> <P> The competition took place on neutral terrain, about midway between San  Francisco and Los Angeles. The site was the Olde Port Inn on the pier at Port  San Luis. However, restaurant manager Leonard Cohen was not out to start a  North-South rivalry. "I wanted everybody to win," Cohen said.  </P> <P> Entries were judged for aroma, flavor, creativity, presentation and overall  quality. Ocean Ave Seafood scored high in still another area, thoughtfulness.  Cioppino is messy to eat, and sticky-fingered judges were delighted by the  entry's accompaniments: finger bowls and wet towels topped with lemon slices.  </P> <P> Kelly Mullarney, Ocean Ave chef, made the dish spicy with black pepper and  crushed hot red peppers. But the mellow broth was also amply seasoned with  fresh herbs, porcini mushrooms, tomatoes and aromatic vegetables such as fennel  root. Large white individual serving bowls were piled high with Dungeness crab,  clams, large spot prawns and swordfish substituting for albacore, which the  restaurant had not been able to obtain.  </P> <P> For dunking, Mullarney provided sourdough bread -- not the celebrated San  Francisco variety but a hometown product from the Pioneer Boulangerie in Santa  Monica. And for drinking, he presented a bottle of Sanford Pinot Noir 1986, the  same wine that flavored the sauce. "I thought it married well with the  tomatoes," Mullarney said.  </P> <P> The wine was a savvy choice because the contest was accompanied by a tasting of  Central Coast Pinot Noirs. Cohen, a wine enthusiast, considers Pinot Noir the  ideal accompaniment to cioppino and had dubbed the event a "Cio-Pinot" cookoff.  </P> <P> What is poured into the pot can vary, however. "White wine gives leaner,  crisper flavor," said Cohen, who sometimes adds both white and red wines and  uses all Pinot Noir only for special occasions.  </P> <P> Matt Murphy, chef of the second place Spyglass Inn, seasoned his cioppino with  dry vermouth while Robert Reash Jr. of John Dominis used a dry white wine.  Chardonnay went into a full-bodied Sicilian-style cioppino prepared by  Stephanie Ciambra-Ball of Genovese's Italian Restaurant in Grover City. Ed Diaz  of the Yankee Clipper restaurant in Ventura added Chenin Blanc for sweetness.  And Joe Zoellin of Flaherty's in Carmel finished off his stew with a splash of  Port, apparent only in the first whiff when the lid of the pot was lifted.  </P> <P> From its start as a simple seaman's supper, cioppino has advanced to a luxury  dish with, occasionally, some surprising ingredients. The Spyglass Inn prize  winner, presented in an elaborately carved, footed silver tureen, was packed  with enormous prawns, lobster, scallops with the roe attached, cockles, clams  and albacore. The John Dominis entry, served in gleaming copper-and-brass  casseroles, also contained a wide range of costly seafood and combined such  contemporary California seasonings as cilantro and jalapeno chile with saffron,  which is a classic component of French bouillabaisse.  </P> <P> Ernest A. Wally of Chef Wally's Bistro in San Diego produced what may be the  state's only cioppino containing shark fins. Wally also added barquetta bass  cheeks, lobster, rock crab claws, halibut, swordfish, sculpin and skate wings,  all fresh from the San Diego area. Although the entry did not place in the top  three, it boasted one of the most well-balanced broths.  </P> <P> Vienna-born Wally, who has worked in Australia and Hong Kong, startled the  judges by adding a side dish of highly seasoned, Indian-style tomato chutney.  The chutney was meant to go with thin slices of firm bread, not the cioppino.  </P> <P> Ciambra-Ball topped Genovese's cioppino with basil sprigs and accompanied it  with sourdough bread lushly seasoned with Sicilian olive oil, butter, garlic,  Parmesan cheese and Italian parsley. As if that weren't enough, she added  little pots of intensely flavored pesto. Although her cioppino came in fourth,  Ciambra-Ball won first place for creativity.  </P> <P> Another idea for dunking was warm olive oil seasoned with fresh basil. This  accompanied the Dominis cioppino. Most of the chefs served sourdough or crusty  French breads, but Eugen Kunstmann of Jagermeister in Arroyo Grande offered  slices of Bavarian rye bread. Kunstmann, who is from Bad Kissingen, a health  resort in Germany, entered a mild cioppino with distinctively German  ingredients. Among these were celery root and leaves from his home garden in  Santa Maria, and parsnips. In addition to Port wine, Kunstmann added  Jagermeister liqueur, an herbal-flavored concoction produced south of the  Rhine.  </P> <P> The panel of judges took four hours to assess the merits of the eight  cioppinos. The $50 a ticket tasting that followed was a benefit for the San  Luis Obispo County Unit of the American Cancer Society. Wineries that  participated were Wild Horse, Meridian, Creston Manor, Talley, Edna Valley,  Corbett Canyon, Byron, Zaca Mesa, Firestone, Sanford and Congress Springs.  </P> <P> Here are recipes for the winning cioppino and for the top rated accompaniments,  Ciambra-Ball's pesto and Wally's tomato chutney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OCEAN AVE  </P> <P> SEAFOOD'S  </P> <P> FIRST-PLACE  </P> <P> CIOPPINO  </P> <P> 4 (2- to 3-pound) whole Dungeness crabs, live if available  </P> <P> 2 pounds Manila clams  </P> <P> 3 pounds large spot prawns with heads  </P> <P> 3 pounds fresh albacore or swordfish  </P> <P> 1 cup virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 16 large cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 large leek, white part only, split lengthwise, then sliced crosswise  </P> <P> 1 large green pepper, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1 large sweet red pepper, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 36 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 (6-ounce) can tomato paste  </P> <P> 1 bunch parsley, chopped  </P> <P> 1 bunch fresh basil, shredded  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves, chopped  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon fresh marjoram leaves, chopped  </P> <P> 4 dried bay leaves  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper (coarse grind)  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons dried hot red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms  </P> <P> 2 quarts Ocean Ave Fish Stock  </P> <P> 1 (750-milliliter) bottle Pinot Noir  </P> <P> Sea salt or rock salt, if needed  </P> <P> Chopped parsley and basil for garnish  </P> <P> Prepare crab.

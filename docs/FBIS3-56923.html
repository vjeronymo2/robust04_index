The scandal erupted after interior troops were sent close to  the building where the parliamentary session is going on late on  Thursday. Lawmaker Ivan Gerasyuk asked the parliament to clear  up on whose orders the troops arrived.    "Without naming the concrete people who gave the order it is  impossible to continue the work of the session," he said.    Parliament Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich said that troops  appeared in full combat readiness in downtown city and this  could have been sanctioned only by the prime minister.    Shushkevich also informed that he had called Interior  Minister Vladimir Yegorov and instructed him that his first  deputy -- interior troops Commander Konstantin Platonov --  appears in parliament.    Shushkevich recalled that when the current parliamentary  session began interior and reinforced police units appeared on  Independence Square as well.    This time the troops appeared after two days of  parliamentary  discussions about who allowed Lithuanian police to arrest two  communist leaders of Lithuania on the territory of independent  Belarus.    Mikolas Burokiavicius and Yuozas Jarmalavicius arrived in  Minsk for a secret meeting of communist leaders of the three  Baltic states, were arrested by Lithuanian police and taken to  Vilnius.</p>

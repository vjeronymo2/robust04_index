			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Corporate axe starts to swing at those at the top JAPAN'S economic downturn has made the country's tradition of lifetime employment less reliable for the average salaried worker. Figures released yesterday, however, suggest that Japanese company presidents have not been shielded from the swing of the corporate axe either. A record 242 Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo stock exchange have replaced their presidents since January, according to the Wako Research Institute of Economics. The figure exceeds the previous record of 238 companies for the whole of 1989. Wako expects this year's total to reach about 270. Among prominent changes at the top were the resignation of Mr Akio Tanii, former president of Matsushita, the electronics group. Mr Tanii stepped down in February to take responsibility for a subsidiary's involvement in a financial scandal and for the sale of defective refrigerators by another subsidiary. More recently, Mr Kuniyoshi Kosuge was forced to resign as president of Isetan, a leading department store chain, ending rule by the founding family. Although Mr Kosuge was a member of the family, his management attracted much internal criticism while Isetan has had difficulty improving its profits performance. The reasons behind the large number of resignations include old age, the need to find a scapegoat for a company's poor results or for involvement in a scandal, and to make it easier to introduce changes needed to return to profitability, Wako said. At the same time, Japanese companies have tended to replace presidents in odd-numbered years, Wako added. The tendency stems from the two-year tenure for executives which is common in Japan. Among those which replaced their presidents, 48 per cent of companies chose a new one from within the company while 42 per cent found someone from outside, in many cases from a company within the same keiretsu, or corporate grouping. Often the replacement is not voluntary. Yamatane Securities, for example, was obliged to accept a new president from Sakura Bank, which was supporting it through a major restructuring.</p>

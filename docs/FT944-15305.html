			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Recyclers on a paper chase - Old newspapers and card have suddenly become a scarce and expensive commodity / Implications for US waste recovery Two of North America's biggest newsprint producers, Vancouver-based Fletcher Challenge Canada and Jefferson Smurfit of St Louis, Missouri, broke with tradition in August when they announced their third price hike of the year. In addition to the usual across-the-board increase (in fact, a cut in discounts), the two companies said they would slap a Dollars 27.50 (Pounds 17.50) per tonne surcharge on all newsprint made from recycled paper. The move reflects a dramatic turnround in the North American market for used newspapers, stationery and cardboard boxes. From being a cheap and readily available alternative to wood pulp (the natural raw material used in paper-making), waste paper has suddenly become a scarce and expensive commodity. The price of old newspapers (ONP) has almost quadrupled from a low of about Dollars 30 per tonne a year ago to Dollars 110/tonne. Old corrugated cardboard (OCC) prices shot up from Dollars 45 to Dollars 210 per tonne earlier this year, but have since eased to about Dollars 80-Dollars 120, depending on region. The paper shortage comes just as North American forest-products companies are in the middle of massive investments in paper de-inking and recycling facilities. According to the American Forest and Paper Association in Washington DC, 56 recycling projects are currently on the drawing board in the US. The industry is expected to spend about Dollars 10bn on new recycling capacity over the rest of the decade. By 1996, the US paper and paperboard industry is expected to rely on recovered paper for 35 per cent of its fibre supply, against 42 per cent from primary wood pulp. (The rest comes from residues, such as sawmill waste.) The present shortages reinforce fears that de-inking and recycling plants could struggle to acquire sufficient quantity and quality of old paper. 'We need to collect more, especially in the office-waste side,' says Jon Ashley, manager of fibre procurement at International Paper, the world's biggest paper producer. Mark Roseborough, general manager of Newstech Recycling, a waste-paper processing company in Vancouver, notes that 'we're competing against virgin pulp. There's a choice to be made.' Publishers' enthusiasm for an ever-higher recycled content in newspapers and magazines could wane if used-paper costs keep climbing. Some US state laws exempt publishers from recycled-content targets if the price of newsprint made from recycled material rises above that made from virgin fibre. Fletcher and Jefferson Smurfit abandoned their plan for a two-tier price structure after other producers failed to follow their lead. Some feared resistance from publishers, whose newsprint costs have already jumped by about 15 per cent this year. Others, protected by long-term contracts, have yet to feel the full impact of the jump in recycled paper costs. But Mark Gibson, Fletcher's vice-president for paper marketing, predicts that the surcharge 'remains a very real possibility in the future'. According to Gibson, Fletcher now pays more for de-inked, recycled pulp than for virgin fibre: 'Most people assume that because it's old newspapers, it must be cheap, but they're wrong.' The used-paper shortage partly reflects rising domestic and foreign demand as overall business activity picks up. US waste-paper exports, mostly to the far east, rose by about 34 per cent in the first six months of this year. Soaring wood-pulp prices, which have jumped from Dollars 390 to Dollars 700 a tonne in the past year, have encouraged papermakers to turn to used paper as a raw material. But the shortage has been exacerbated by the rising threshold imposed by US and Canadian authorities on the minimum recycled content of packaging, newspapers and other paper products. The Clinton administration decreed last year that all paper ordered by the US federal government must have a recycled content of at least 20 per cent. In California, the rule is that one-quarter of state purchases must have a minimum 40 per cent recycled content. North American recycling targets are well below those in some European countries, especially Germany. But US and Canadian paper mills also have to fight harder to lay their hands on suitable used paper. One sore point is the sizeable quantities of waste paper being directed to energy-from-waste plants. According to some estimates, as much as 10 per cent of paper that might normally go to landfills or recycling plants is being channelled into energy production. The terms of bond issues floated to finance energy-from-waste plants frequently require municipalities to control the flow of combustible materials. Municipalities are also eager to collect recyclable materials to help raise money for their waste-management services. 'Any time you interfere with the free flow of our fibre source, you're going to be creating some problems,' says Virgil Horton, vice-president of the AFPA's paper group. The paper companies want free-market forces rather than municipal ordinances to decide what happens to used paper. A growing number of producers have moved into waste-paper collection as a means of securing their raw material supplies. Some industry experts are confident that the shortage of old paper will subside. 'Recovery rates are still nowhere near what is attainable,' says an executive at one Canadian company. Paper companies have become increasingly active in recycling programmes. International Paper, for instance, was involved in a milk-carton recycling drive in Los Angeles. The AFPA has set up task forces to try to ease bottlenecks in supply. Papermakers are also encouraged by a rapid consolidation of the North American waste industry. Big waste services operators, such as Waste Management, Browning-Ferris and Laidlaw, have the resources to improve collection and invest in extra recycling capacity. Even if waste-paper prices stay high, recycling fans can take heart that prices of virgin fibre are unlikely to drop much in coming years. The North American forest industry's concern about waste-paper prices is matched by fears that stricter rules to protect old forests in British Columbia and rare species in the north-west US, are also making trees a scarce and expensive commodity.</p>

Just ask Maj. Gen. Bernard Sandoz, chief Swiss member on  the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), who is three  years and five months into an assigment that secludes him in  barracks in the middle of no-man's land in the truce village of  Panmunjom on the dividing line between South and North Korea.    "We have to accept other channels of dialogue. They (South  and North Korea, the United Nations Command [UNC]) don't need us  so much," Sandoz tells reporters from YONHAP, the first Korean  journalists to meet him inside the Swiss barracks. The  commission was powerful when it was formed at the end of the  1950-1953 Korean war.    Purpose -- to supervise, investigate and control so that  neither side of Korea will increase military tension in  violation of the Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the  war.    Members -- Czechoslovakia and Poland picked by North Korea,  and Sweden and Switzerland chosen by South Korea.    It had five inspection teams in both halves of Korea to  check  every ingoing and outgoing ship, aircraft and train to prevent  arms smuggling and espionage.    "In 1954, 1955, 1956, there were no discussions (between  South and North Korea)," Sandoz recalls. "We were the only ones  to be able to cross the border freely. We would tell each other  what the other thinks.    "The main job was to make contact, make them understand the  viewpoint of the neighbor."    It was the NNSC that persuaded South and North Korea to sit  down for informal, secret talks at the outbreak of the Pueblo  incident in 1968, when North Korea captured a U.S. spy boat and  its crew.    It was in the NNSC lounge that the two Koreas held sports  and  students talks, and here that they exchanged the agreement on a  non- nuclear Korean peninsula.    "This is proof that it (NNSC) is still useful," says Sandoz.  But NNSC history tells of numerous ups and downs.  Demonstrators opposing the Armistice Agreement rallied against  the commission and some people even sent bombs to its barracks.  All inspection teams were recalled, and staff drastically  reduced from 96 to about 10 at the Swiss commission.    Recent years saw more disappointments. Czechoslovakia left  the commission after North Korea insisted that its breakup into  separate states had invalidated its status.    The seat has remained vacant since April 10, 1993. North  Korea is yet to name a successor since it "found no one who can  give the assurance they will be neutral," according to Sandoz.    North Korea refused to recognize the appointment of the  first  South Korean as chief of the UNC side of the Military Armistice  Commission in March 1991, and the next May, when the NNSC chose  to remain neutral and not pressure the UNC to revoke the  appointment, North Korea cut off all official contact with the  commission.    "It's very frustrating to be here and not be able to fulfill  our mission completely because of the boycott," the 58-year-old  general tells the YONHAP reporters.    There are limitations to how much the commission can do  right  now because North Korea insists on talking only with the United  States.    "The NNSC is at any time willing to mediate, but the problem  is both sides have interest to negotiate directly, North Korea  directly with the United States, South Korea directly with North  Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) directly  with North Korea without any intermediary," he explains.    Sandoz travels to Pyongyang and other North Korean cities  every few months at unofficial invitation from his counterparts  there and China, a signatory of the Korean Armistice Agreement.  He was invited to Pyongyang for President Kim Il-song's 80th  birthday celebration in April 1992 and went through North Korea  last year on his way to and back from Tibet and China.    There is no telling when Sandoz will return to his home  country and resume his diplomatic career. The post is for three  years, but his stay in Panmunjom was extended at the lack of a  successor. But he is sure about one thing, that NNSC has to  stay until the Korean Armistice Agreement is replaced by a peace  regime.    "We believe strongly we are still useful because we are part  of the Armistice Agreement, the only legal base," he says.  North Korea wants the commission dissolved, but South Korea and  the UNC say otherwise.    "As long as they have different views, we stay. This is the  official position of NNSC and the members' governments," Sandoz  says.</p>

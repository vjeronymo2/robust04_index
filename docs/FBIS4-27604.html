			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's current  account surplus for 1993 turned into a deficit starting in  January and had worsened to 2.8 billion U.S. dollars by April,  the Bank of Korea [BOK] said Monday.    Although improvement is likely in the latter half of the  year, Korea is expected to run a deficit of around 3 billion  dollars compared with last year's surplus of 453 million  dollars, the central bank forecast.    April showed deficits of 178.5 million dollars in the trade  and 103.8 million dollars in the invisible trade accounts, with  the unrequited transfer surplus stopping at 24.4 million dollars  to go 257.9 million dollars in the red on the current account.    Though last month's current account deficit was an  improvement over the 672.3 million dollars in March, it was far  larger than the 41.8 million dollars registered in April last  year. Together with deficits of 1.4 billion dollars in January  and 427.8 million dollars in February, the total reached 2.76  billion dollars in April compared with 822.6 million dollars a  year earlier.    Exports grew 10.7 percent in January-April but imports  climbed 14.1 percent, resulting in a trade shortfall of 3.01  billion dollars and an invisible trade deficit of 1.23 billion  dollars.    Imports of capital goods like machinery and electronics rose  21 percent, while those of consumer goods increased 16.2 percent  due to a surge in cocoa (up 54 percent), knitwear (up 51.7  percent) beef (up 44.5 percent) and electronic home appliances  (up 38.5 percent). Companies importing for reserves due to shaky  international raw material prices also fanned the import rise.    In the first four months of last year, imports for eventual  export rose 9.8 percent while imports for domestic sale dropped  8.6 percent due to recession: The former has inched up just 2.7  percent while imports for home use soared 19.6 percent this  year, however, proving that the spending habit is back.    A BOK official said the current account deficit is unlikely  to grow further as it is gradually decreasing. But imports will  probably continue to increase considering that international  prices of raw materials, including oil, are on the rise.    Without radical export growth, the current account is likely  to remain mired in the red. The good news is that the export  unit price rose 0.4 percent in January-April while the import  unit price dropped 3.6 percent, improving 4.2 percent the net  trade terms that divide the former by the latter.    Net foreign fund inflow for stock investment dropped to 72  million dollars from 909.9 million dollars a year earlier. The  overall balance of payments combining the current and capital  accounts thus showed a deficit of 227.7 million dollars for the  first time in eight months, since the 136.1 million dollars  recorded in August last year.    The January-April overall balance of payments totaled 333.9  million dollars, far below the 2.14 billion dollars of the same  period last year. Foreign currency holdings reached 21 billion  dollars in April, up 260 million dollars from the previous month.</p>

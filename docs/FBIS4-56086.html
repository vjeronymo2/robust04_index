			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 26 (TANJUG) -- Diplomatic sources in  Belgrade on Thursday said the possibility of lifting U.N.  sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) voiced by  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and a statement by the  Security Council president calling on Bosnia's three warring  sides to cease hostilities were positive developments in the  quest for a settlement of the Bosnian crisis. The same sources  believe the positive developments were triggered by the meeting  of the U.S., Russian and E.U. foreign ministers and U.N.  representatives in Geneva on May 13.    The participants in the meeting called on the warring sides  in Bosnia-Herzegovina to cease all hostilities and urged a  negotiated settlement of the Bosnian war and gradual lifting of  the sanctions against Yugoslavia imposed in late May of 1992.  The latest statement by the Security Council president for the  first time makes no reference to the Bosnian Serbs alone, but  treats all warring sides equally, diplomats in Belgrade said.  Furthermore, Butrus-Ghali made the first explicit reference to  the lifting of the anti-Yugoslav sanctions, without making it  conditional on a final and lasting settlement of the Bosnian  crisis, they added.    U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement that Washington's  unilateral exemption of Bosnian Muslims from a U.N. embargo on  arms deliveries to all of former Yugoslavia would kill the peace  process fits perfectly into the latest positive developments.  Bearing all that in mind, the impression is that some changes  have nevertheless been made in the international community  regarding its stands on the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This is especially true of Europe, which is obviously in a  hurry to close the `Bosnian file' before the infinitely more  dangerous `Crimean file' has been opened.    The positive developments would first be tested in the  French  town of Talloires, where the international `contact group' for  Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday started a second round of talks  with the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats. There are some  indications that the talks are progressing fine, which has also  been confirmed by Speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament Momcilo  Krajisnik. There are also indications that Bosnian Muslims and  Croats are willing to accept an internationally-brokered plan  according to which they would get 51 per cent and the republic  of Srpska 49 per cent of Bosnia's territory.    The Muslim and Croat representatives first demanded 58 per  cent of the territory for their binational federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

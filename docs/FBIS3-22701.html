Honorable Shija made the call while opening a  week's seminar for mass media institutions on AIDS at Kibaha  today.    In his speech, which was read on his behalf by the director  of the Department of Information, Ndugu Bwire Musarika, the  minister said that recent figures indicated that Tanzania had  many more AIDS patients than other East African countries. He  said that according to the figures cases of AIDS had increased  rapidly in the country during the last three years. He added  that the alarming spread of AIDS in the country called for new  strategies in combating the disease, including use of the mass  media.    Hon. Shija said abject poverty, over-population in towns,  and  frequent family squabbles had greatly contributed to the spread  of AIDS in many African countries. He called on journalists to  be composed while filing reports on AIDS without being alarmist  but to file reports which contained a message on ways of  controlling the spread of the disease.

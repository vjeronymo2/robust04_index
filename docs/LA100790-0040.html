			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH HOLY DAYS 'SCHLEP' RAISES OBJECTIONS  </P> <P> Paul Feldman, like so many other Jews, tends to concentrate on the High Holy  Days as the focal point of Judaism. He therefore seeks the perfect place to  spend a few hours once a year in pursuit of a "meaningful experience."  </P> <P> Unfortunately this is not possible.  </P> <P> Please do not think that I wish to demean his attendance at High Holy Day  services. Rather, I congratulate his participation. However, I believe that the  satisfaction a person derives from a religious service comes principally from  within him or herself, not from the trappings of the place it is conducted or  the individuals conducting the service.  </P> <P> Perhaps more important, my frustration with Feldman is my belief that a temple  is more than just a place to conduct a High Holy Day service. It is a place  dedicated to the education of adults and children, to addressing social action  programs, to helping people in time of need, to celebrating births, to mourning  deaths and to serving the needs of the community at large.  </P> <P> To maximize the spiritual benefit one derives from the temple, one must  affiliate with, actively participate in, and help form the spiritual and social  mind-set of that temple. Affiliation is the key word. Not attendance.  </P> <P> FRED ROTHENBERG,  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Temple Ahavat Shalom  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

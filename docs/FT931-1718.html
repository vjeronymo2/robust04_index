			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bowater ahead 49% in line with rights issue forecast BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films company, yesterday announced profits in line with its own forecast, and will pay a second interim dividend rather than a final as a way of beating Budget changes. Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 were Pounds 147.2m, a 49 per cent increase on 1991, as forecast last month when the company launched a Pounds 295m rights issue to fund its acquisition of Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings company. Turnover improved from Pounds 1.27bn to Pounds 1.57bn, again in line with expectations, and the operating profit margin rose to 9 per cent against 8.6 per cent. Bowater's shares closed unchanged at 490p as the company announced it would pay shareholders a 'second interim' dividend of 6.65p in place of a final. The pay-out will be made on April 2 to take advantage of the existing tax credit of 25 per cent. Mr Norman Lamont announced in last week's Budget that investors' tax credit on dividends would fall to 20 per cent from the start of the next financial year on April 6. If Bowater had waited to get shareholder approval at the annual meeting in May to pay the final dividend in June, it would have cost the company about Pounds 1m more to fund the same distribution. The total dividend for the year is 11.5p (11p), payable from earnings per share ahead 12.5 per cent to 25.2p. 'The financial results are commendable when compared with UK plc' commented Mr Norman Ireland, chairman. 'The overall improvement in earnings in the last quarter of 1992 and into January 1993 reported in the rights issue document has continued into February. 'We remain cautious on the out-turn for 1993 but Bowater remains ready to move wherever the upturn in the business is sighted.' Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said he was particularly pleased that it had been able to integrate DRG and Cope Allman, the two companies it bought in March last year for Pounds 444m, so quickly. Together, they contributed Pounds 338m to turnover, which had exceeded the company's expectations. Bowater said its business in the UK had remained steady, although it had shown some decline in continental Europe, especially in Germany. The US had been showing signs of recovery for the last 18 months, and Australia was also showing signs of an upturn. COMMENT Bowater is a very different group from the one the present management came to in 1987. The City has been impressed by the speed with which it has realised its goals, first of focusing the company on its core businesses, and then achieving through acquisitions a 'critical mass' in the added-value areas of health care packaging, personal care packaging and coated industrial films. Now the challenge is to develop the synergies between divisions and harness the potential of a group spread over a large geographical area and with a wide range of expertise. Judging by its performance to date, the management is up to the task. Pre-tax profits this year are forecast at about Pounds 195m, and the shares, on a prospective multiple of 17.5, look a good long-term buy.</p>

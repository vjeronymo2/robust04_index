However, Ciskei  told the meeting it was withdrawing from the five-member  negotiating forum to join the Transitional Executive Council.    Participants in the talks hope to break the political  impasse  with the Freedom Alliance. The three sides, after two rounds of  trilateral talks at the end of last year, gave themselves until  January 24 to broker an inclusive political deal.    "The leaders of the Freedom Alliance...recommitted  themselves  to the negotiation process, with the aim of finding an  all-inclusive political settlement for southern Africa," they  said in a statement on Friday. A new round of talks had  provisionally been set for next Wednesday, they said.    The decision by Ciskei to withdraw its membership was  announced at the end of the five-hour meeting at the  Bophuthatswana Embassy. The remaining Alliance leaders were at  pains to stress Ciskei's withdrawal in no way affected Bisho's  "commitment to the position of the Freedom Alliance and its  demands for an improved constitution".    "Ciskei will continue to uphold these positions in its  future  political activities."    The leaders expressed "deep understanding" of Ciskei's  position, but regretted they felt obliged to accept the  withdrawal. "Since the Convention for a Democratic South Africa  (Codesa), Ciskei has been subjected to destabilisation action by  the ANC, and the vulnerability of Ciskei to further  destabilisation and pressure from the Transitional Executive  Council is very unfortunate."    Present at Friday's meeting were, among others, Inkatha  Freedom Party president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Conservative Party  leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner  National Front] leaders Gen Constand Viljoen and Gen Tienie  Groenewald, Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope,  Bophuthatswana chief negotiator and Alliance Chairman Rowan  Cronje, deputy chairman of Ciskei's Council of State Col Simons  Pita and Ciskei chief negotiator Mickey Webb.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Arthur Shaw The new calm at ARTHUR SHAW, the Willenhall, West Midlands, building products group, was ruffled yesterday when it was announced that John Walmsley, the chief executive, had left the company. But his departure apparently has nothing to do with the boardroom rows which had led to rebel shareholders demanding extraordinary general meetings, the movement of chairmen in and out, and High Court proceedings about who should be a director. Those proceedings were only settled last month. The reason simply was that Walmsley prefers Sweden to Willenhall. Finance director Lindsay Melvin explained that Walmsley married a Swede two years ago and bought a house in Sweden at the beginning of this year and, aged 54, is now retiring. Consequently, Brian Phillips, a former managing director, and chairman since March, is assuming the role of chief executive as well and the company will be looking for another non-executive director. Apart from Phillips and Melvin, the only other board member is Ian Tickler, who, with his family and friends, controls 49 per cent of the Arthur Shaw equity.</p>

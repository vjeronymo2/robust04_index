			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Series in search of cult status - Television Still they come, the new series for the autumn season; not just fresh series of old titles, but genuinely new series: Wild Palms, The Great Depression, The Talking Show, Blood And Belonging and If You See God, Tell Him. Remembering the long doldrums of the summer, does this really seem like a sensible arrangement? The broadcasters tell us that they save all their best (well, newest and most expensive) series for the autumn and winter because we watch so much less in the summer. But what do they expect if they save up all the rubbish and show it in the summer: of course we watch less. Wild Palms which began on BBC2 on Monday, comes to us described as 'a second Twin Peaks' which will seem ominous to anybody who found the David Lynch series too long and in the end too clever by half. Furthermore, having seen Wild Palms do rather badly in the US, its producers - who include Oliver Stone - are looking to the British to give it at least a succes d'estime. This is becoming something of a habit. Series such as Cheers have acquired 'cult status' in Britain after a poor start in America, and the British reputation has then been used in the US to justify the production of further series. Perhaps that will happen with Wild Palms, but I doubt it. What we have here is a slickly directed series, full of the atmosphere of menace, the anachronistic costumes (stand-up collars and collar studs in the year 2007 - does it seem likely to you?) and the bizarre non sequiturs which have always characterised fantasy series on television. Patrick McGoohan showed the way 26 years ago with The Prisoner which was shot in Portmeirion where a man who drove a classic sports car was held against his will by a mysterious organisation that called people by numbers and sent out a huge opaque globe to chase escapers. Years earlier, in The Avengers, we had seen how classic sports cars and old fashioned clothes could be combined with a sense of threat to produce the feeling of a lopsided alternative universe. In Wild Palms there is a rhinoceros in the empty swimming pool, sure enough the hero drives a classic sports car, and there is that familiar feeling of a sinister force behind the story of a television company which is moving into inter-active virtual reality. The trouble is that, as with The Prisoner, the drama does not really seem to have anything significant to tell us, about the past or the future or, come to that, the present. Moreover, it is so busy being mystifying and studiously weird that the story is almost impossible to follow. That leaves you with little more than a sense of style, and strong though it is, it is not enough to sustain interest on its own. Much the most impressive new American offering is The Great Depression, a classic documentary series of a sort which, five years ago, we might have thought would never again be made in the US. Then came The Civil War, a superb piece of work which rightly won awards all over the world. Now (on BBC2 on Saturday evenings immediately before the admirable 'Performance' studio dramas which this week gave us the first performance of The Maitlands in 60 years; not a great play but one well worth seeing) here is a series which brings a strikingly graphic quality to the events of the slump. This week's programme with its accounts of bank robber Charles 'Pretty Boy' Floyd, and the 'bonus marchers' - veterans of the first world war demanding promised bonus payments from the government - and the manner in which the demonstrators were eventually evicted from Washington, proved again what the BBC's recent Thatcher series showed: that no book can match the movie camera for vividness in reporting modern history. True, this programme was particularly striking because so much of the footage, instead of being grey and rainy, looked as though it had been shot last week, albeit in black and white, but it is not solely a matter of technical quality. To see MacArthur, Patton and Eisenhower as young army officers, and in particular to watch MacArthur's body language as they drove the starving men out of the city, was eye opening. On the other hand The Talking Show is a series which, however good it may have seemed at the discussion stage, should never have been allowed to reach the screen. No doubt the producers said 'We've never had a television series about the human voice - you know, accents, public speaking, conversation, everything', but perhaps there are good reasons. Sandy Toksvig, the presenter, is an excellent comedian, but that is scarcely what is needed here, and the idea of trying to distract us from the programme's shortcomings by laying disco beat over most of the soundtrack is a disaster. It might have worked better as a radio series, though even then it would have needed radical re-thinking. On Blood And Belonging we shall have to wait before reaching a firm conclusion. The idea of having Michael Ignatieff investigate the resurgence of nationalism by globe-trotting through some of the worst affected areas seems sensible enough. He has proved himself an excellent conductor of studio discussions, admirably free of the urge suffered by so many television journalists to go tabloid and talk down to the viewers. Given his background (born in Canada of Russian parents with a childhood in Yugoslavia and recent years in the UK with its Northern Ireland problem) he would seem ideally suited to such a series. Yet the opening episode was rather less than enlightening. We watched Ignatieff's profile as he drove down a road perforated with borders musing 'Is it ever going to be possible for Serbs and Croats to live together again? I don't know . . . It's so difficult to understand . . .' He asked a couple of Croats 'What do you feel when you look out that way and you see Serbs on Croatian territory?' and was told 'It hurts, it hurts'. He picked over the detritus of a smashed concentration camp museum and wandered through other ruins. It all looked awfully like the places where Martin Bell has been filming since the whole ghastly business began. We can hardly blame Ignatieff if the honest conclusion is that it is all depressing and virtually hopeless, but if we wanted astute analysis of the roots and sprigs of nationalism we might have done better to keep him behind a studio table. The most entertaining of the week's new programmes was clearly the BBC1 comedy If You See God Tell Him which lasted 45 minutes instead of 30, had no laughter track, and starred Richard Briers and Imelda Staunton. This is one of those comedies that rest on a single idea: in this instance, Briers (Godfrey Spry, hence God) is hit on the head by a load of builders' rubble and as a consequence becomes entirely credulous, believing every word of every advertising campaign. He test drives cars along clifftops at sunset, crunches crisps all through his wife's funeral, and visits his bank manager convinced that he will be allowed to borrow a million pounds. Briers is splendid in the role, and the running gag held up strongly throughout the opening episode; the only question is whether it can sustain three more. Since producer/director Marcus Mortimer is having a wonderful time making marvellously accurate spoof television commercials, the answer may well be yes.</p>

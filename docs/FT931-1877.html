			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese caution on chip target THE INCREASE in foreign suppliers' share in the Japanese semiconductor market to more than 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year has been welcomed in Japan. However, Mr Nobuo Kanoi, chairman of the Users Committee of Foreign Semiconductors, cautioned against relying on short-term market share figures. While the increased market share was a positive development, it was important to focus on stable long-term business relationships, he said. 'In the future, as in the past, the global economic environment and fluctuating exchange rates can influence short-term market share figures. It is important not to become overly optimistic when the quarterly numbers rise or overly pessimistic when they do not,' Mr Kanoi said. Important progress has been made in industrial co-operation. Japan's 10 largest semiconductor users, for example, had prepared 'inquiry lists' as tools for foreign suppliers to formulate order forecasts. 'No one can deny that the Japanese market is 100 per cent open, or that tremendous progress has been made to date in improving business opportunities. . . ,' Mr Kanoi said. A senior official of Japan's Trade Ministry said yesterday that Japan did not plan to set market-share targets for foreign goods in any sector beyond semiconductors, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister for administrative affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, was speaking after Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, was quoted as saying the market-share goals might need to be expanded to other sectors. The bilateral semiconductor agreement is the only significant trade pact to set specific targets for a share of the Japanese market. Officials have said the agreement invited misunderstanding and should not be copied in other sectors.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / NTT share sell-off postponed THE Japanese government announced yesterday that it would postpone the sale of a tranche of shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the former state-owned telecommunications company, in order to avoid depressing the Tokyo stock market. The recent slide in NTT shares, prompted by fears that the additional tranche would depress the stock price, has helped drag down the market in the past few weeks. The Tokyo market remains vulnerable, although the Nikkei average has rebounded from its six-year low reached last week following a government announcement to support the country's ailing banks. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said plans to offer the remaining government-held NTT shares during the two years to March 1994 had been suspended. 'The negative impact could be large on the market,' he said. The government, which still owns two thirds of NTT, was forced to postpone planned sales of 500,000 shares last fiscal year because of a sluggish market. The decision means the government, which hoped to use revenue from NTT shares to help fund public works projects, will need to find other means. Mr Hata said the Finance Ministry was considering issuing construction bonds to get funds. Mr Hata said the share price of NTT, which rose as high as Y3.18m (Pounds 12,800) in 1987 and has rebounded from its record low of Y453,000 (Pounds 1,823) reached earlier this month, was a 'symbol' stock on the Tokyo market, adding that it was important to remove negative factors depressing its share price.

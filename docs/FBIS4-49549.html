			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 7 May (XINHUA) -- The Seventh Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee  held successive group discussions over the past few days.  Standing Committee members present at the meetings examined and  discussed six draft laws submitted to the current session for  its consideration.    While examining and discussing a draft law on foreign trade,  most members expressed their opinion that the current draft law  is relatively complete because it has gone through revisions.  They expressed their belief that it has the characteristic of  internationalization; focuses on the implementation of a system  for unified foreign trade as well as arousing the enthusiasm of  localities; pays attention to encouraging developed areas'  foreign trade while stressing the need to support areas  inhabited by minority nationalities to develop foreign trade;  and embodies the characteristic of looking after the interests  of other countries. Therefore, it is conducive to establishing  China's international prestige and has very important  significance for the reinstatement of China as a signatory to  GATT.    Members also put forward some opinions concerning revisions  during their deliberations. Some members expressed their belief  that the current draft law does not adequately reflect the need  for deepening the reform of the foreign trade system. Some  members said that the centralized management of foreign trade by  the central government is not conducive to bringing into play  the initiative of localities and enterprises, and that it is  necessary to appropriately delegate some powers to them. Some  members expressed the hope that a transition from the permit  system now in force to a registration system will be completed  as quickly as possible. Some members stressed: The law  contains more restrictive and prohibitive provisions; it lacks  provisions on the development of and a strategy for foreign  trade. The law should contain specific provisions on  encouragement and development.    As for the draft law on compensation by the state, members  expressed their belief that the formulation of the law has  important significance for China to build its socialist  democracy and legal system; to further protect the legitimate  rights and interests of its citizens, legal persons, and other  organizations; to facilitate the performance of duties by state  organs and their working personnel in accordance with the laws;  to promote the drive to build a clean and honest government; and  to develop a socialist market economy.    During deliberations, members also put forward their  opinions  on revisions of the draft law. Some members pointed out: In  the realities of life, some victims claimed there were mistakes  in the handling of their cases and demanded compensation,  whereas there were many occurrences of organs entrusted with the  compensation obligation which claimed that no mistake was made  in the handling of such cases; some cases have dragged on for  years without a settlement. Therefore, to settle the issue of  compensation, we need a just and authoritative arbitration organ  to judge the rights and wrongs of a case. Many members  expressed different views on the standards of compensation set  by the current draft law. They expressed their belief that the  standards of compensation are too low and that the standards of  computation are unreasonable. Meanwhile, some members maintained  that economic compensation should be provided for damage to  one's reputation. There were also some members who stressed:  The formulation of the law constitutes only one aspect of the  work. What is more important is that there must be a practical  guarantee for the enforcement of the law after it goes into  effect and for the supervision of its enforcement.    While examining and discussing a draft resolution on  punishing criminal activities that violate the management of  companies and enterprises, draft supplemental provisions to the  regulations governing penalties for offenses against public  security, draft revisions of the regulations on military service  by officers on the active list of the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] of China, and draft revisions of the regulations on  military ranks of PLA officers, most members adopted a positive  attitude toward the need to formulate or revise these laws.  Meanwhile, they expressed their views and made suggestions on  some specific provisions contained in these draft laws.</p>

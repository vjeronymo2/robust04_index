			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Major denies cabinet split on Maastricht MR John Major moved yesterday to quell reports of damaging splits within the cabinet over the Maastricht treaty. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary and one of the most Euro-sceptic cabinet ministers, last night released a statement denying he was at odds with the prime minister over Maastricht. Speaking in Bogota, Columbia, the prime minister said: 'There is no cabinet crisis and there is no difference of view whatever among any members of the cabinet.' Ministers acknowledged privately, however, that the government is under pressure from Tory MPs, even in more pro-Europe sections of the party, to look for greater revisions than it has been prepared to contemplate. As Labour MPs yesterday voted to keep their options open over tactics on the Maastricht bill, some Conservatives said the government would be defeated if the Commons voted on the treaty before the summer recess. With Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in France until Friday and Mr Major in South America, speculation at Westminster of government rifts and possible resignations has grown - centred on reports that Mr Lilley and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, attended a meeting of Tory Euro-sceptics last week. Conservative business managers were yesterday warning of 'black propaganda' by the most radical of Euro-sceptics who, they said, were keen to talk up the government's dilemma. So far, the government has hinted at only limited flexibility, in order to overcome the Danish referendum result. It argues that a renegotiation would not be to Britain's advantage and could wreck the government's ambitions for its presidency, which begins on July 1. 'It would be folly to throw away the gains we have in that treaty rather than building on those gains for the future,' Mr Major said. But ministers stressed that the government was playing a waiting game, pending the outcome of at least the Irish referendum next week and the Lisbon EC summit at the end of the month. 'All of us are trying to use as cautious language as possible', one said. The Foreign Office has already hinted that Britain may try to add an addendum to the Maastricht treaty reinforcing the principle by which decisions are made at the lowest appropriate level of government. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, underlined his scepticism about fast moves towards European union, when he said on BBC radio that: 'We don't want to see ever more resources being taken from individual countries and appropriated to the centre. . . We want a looser and a broader Europe.' European finance ministers agreed public opinion could not be ignored, Mr Lamont said. In his statement, Mr Lilley said the deal negotiated by the prime minister at Maastricht 'gives us a good opportunity to shape Europe in the way we want'. Meanwhile, a meeting of the Labour parliamentary party yesterday suggested growing support for rejecting Maastricht among Labour MPs - although the party leadership succeeded in presenting the party as unified by postponing a vote until next week at the earliest.

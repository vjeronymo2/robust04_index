			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Salvation Army to break silence on missing Pounds 6m THE Salvation Army is preparing to break its silence on the circumstances surrounding an alleged Pounds 6m fraud by publishing an interim report on the affair. The charity has refused to comment on the alleged fraud since it surfaced on February 15 when a writ was issued in the High Court. The writ alleged that Tilen Securities Inc and Birmingham businessman Mr Stuart Ford and Mr Gamil Naguib conspired to defraud the charity of the money. The charity has maintained that it had to balance the public's right to know the facts with the need to recover the missing money. It was advised by its lawyers that to make any statements would jeopardise that recovery. Senior charity officials now appear to be responding to internal pressure to clarify what, if any, are the charity's own responsibilities in the matter although only a small proportion of the missing money has been recovered. In two weeks the charity's High Council of senior representatives from the its various 'territories' meet to elect the new head or 'general' of the organisation. The present general, Ms Eva Burroughs, has reached the end of her five-year term. It is felt that the incoming general should take up the post without the affair remaining unresolved. The Salvation Army last night confirmed that it planned to make an interim statement shortly following meetings with its lawyers and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm which has been investigating the alleged fraud for the charity. The statement may shed some light on the future of Colonel Grenville Burn, who was in charge of the charity's fundraising and was involved in contacts between the charity and Mr Naguib and Mr Ford. Col Burn has been officially on sick leave since writs were issued and refused to comment last night.</p>

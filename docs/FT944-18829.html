			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign sales push Hong Kong down 1.9% With most of the profit-taking for the interim book closing out of the way, corporate and banking investors remained inactive and the Nikkei index closed marginally lower after fluctuating within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed down 51.31 at 19,563.81 after a high of 19,719.04 and a low of 19,519.70. Small lot buying by public pension and postal funds supported share prices in the morning, but arbitrage unwinding and selling by dealers eroded the gains. Volume totaled 223m shares against 263m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 0.62 to 1,576.89 while the Nikkei 300 fell 0.30 to 288.39. Advances led declines by 518 to 437 with 224 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.89 to 1,287.32. Traders said that dealers and most investors were cautious of carrying positions over the weekend due to the uncertainty over the course of the US-Japan framework talks on trade. Car companies were stronger on hopes of strong car sale figures, due to be released on Monday. Suzuki Motor rose Y30 to Y1,200 and Nissan Motor gained Y15 to Y809. Steel stocks were traded actively. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, fell Y2 to Y390 and NKK remained unchanged at Y292. Speculative stocks fell on profit taking. Tsumura, a drug maker, lost Y50 to Y1,190 and Sumitomo Coal Mining declined Y21 to Y705. Tokyo Style, a leading apparel maker, retreated Y150 to Y1,770 on reports that its interim operating profits fell by 13 per cent. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 6.30 to 21,985.13 in volume of 29.5m shares. Roundup HONG KONG fell 1.9 per cent, responding to the depressed tone of some overseas markets and and weakness in local property company shares. The Hang Seng index lost 178.97 to 9,521.24, after briefly dipping below 9,500, in turnover that rose to HKDollars 4.14bn from Thursday's HKDollars 3.67bn. The index was 1.2 per cent lower on the week. Analysts said that European funds were sellers at the start of their business day following Wall Street's slide overnight, and a low sale price of some local flats also hurt sentiment. Cheung Kong tumbled HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 37.60, Sun Hung Kai dropped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 57.50 and Henderson Land lost 80 cents to HKDollars 48. TAIPEI edged back as the market consolidated after setting a four year high on Thursday. The weighted index was 10.00 lower at 7,191.13, for a 3.8 per cent rise on the week. Financials that led the week's saw the heaviest selling. Hwa Nan, Chang Hwa and First Commercial banks each lost TDollars 5 to TDollars 227, TDollars 208 and TDollars 208 respectively. Steels, however, posted gains on reports that a steel factory in South Korea had been shut because of fire. China Steel climbed 40 cents to TDollars 27.8 and Kao Hsing Chang was up 80 cents to TDollars 25. BANGKOK edged higher, led by energy shares, and the SET index closed picked up 3.59 at 1,485.71 for a 1.4 per cent fall over the week. KUALA LUMPUR saw late bargain hunting that helped share prices to recoup most of their early losses and the composite index closed down 3.92 at 1,129.76, for an 3.5 per cent loss over the week. SINGAPORE was broadly easier on a day marked by profit-taking and book-squaring ahead of the end of the corporate quarter. The Straits Times Industrials index ended 16.27 lower at 2,332.63, for a 1.3 per cent rise on the week. MANILA posted further gains on the continuing recovery of PLDT, bargain hunting among blue chips and the peso's fall against the dollar. The composite index closed 16.28 up to 2,908.24, for a 1.7 per cent fall on the week. PLDT rose 50 pesos or 3.4 per cent to 1,510 pesos. SEOUL picked up in active trade after two days of consolidation as petrochemical shares led a broadly based rally, and the composite index closed 12.95 higher at 1,050.50, for a 1.9 per cent rise on the week. BOMBAY was lower on sustained selling pressure and the BSE 30 share index lost 53.82 to 4,304.48 for a 175 per cent fall on the week.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLS STUDENTS SAVOR LESSON IN WINNING;  </P> <P> FEMINISM: WOMEN SAY THEY WERE CHANGED BY THE SUCCESSFUL PROTEST AGAINST  ADMISSION OF MEN. 'WE CAN DO ANYTHING,' SAYS ONE.  </P> <P> Joyce Adca is proud of the education she has received at Mills College. But as  the 22-year-old senior prepares to graduate today, she says the past two weeks  have changed her view of what she values most about her college days.  </P> <P> Reflecting on the two-week student strike that shut down the campus and helped  persuade Mills officials to reverse a decision to admit undergraduate men to  the college, she says the protest has provided her with a profound lesson:  </P> <P> "Women can change the world. We can do anything. This proves it," said Adca, a  psychology major. "I didn't think the protests would work, but we did it. I  think it's the perfect happy ending to my four years here."  </P> <P> The "happy ending" was Friday's vote by Mills trustees to reverse the decision  to admit undergraduate men to the 138-year-old college. The reversal came in  response to the protests and a financial rescue plan put together by alumnae.  </P> <P> The trustees had wanted to admit men in fall, 1991, to boost enrollment from  the current 777 to 1,000, and to help balance Mills' $24-million annual budget.  </P> <P> Adca's sentiments about the protest were echoed by more than a dozen students  interviewed Saturday at Mills' sprawling, tree-dotted 135-acre campus. They all  agreed that the last two weeks changed the way they look at the world.  </P> <P> "It was such a clean revolution. There were no police, no violence," said  Chiara Monodori, 21, a senior. "We didn't have to riot or burn cars. . . .  Women can organize to get what we want without violence."  </P> <P> A celebratory mood continued to prevade the campus Saturday. More than a  hundred students gathered on the main square, hugging one another and shouting  congratulations. Many still wore T-shirts that had become an unofficial uniform  for the protest, emblazoned with the slogan: "Better Dead than Co-ed."  </P> <P> Nearby were neat piles of tents, posters and banners left over from the  protest.  </P> <P> "I've never been so proud to be a Mills woman," senior Barbara Needell said as  she waited for the beginning of rehearsal for today's commencement ceremony.  "I've learned so much in the past two weeks. People who used to just pass by  one another have learned so much from each other."  </P> <P> Needell, like many Mills students, re-entered college after working. At 41,  she's old enough to remember a different era of campus activism.  </P> <P> "I've learned a lot from the 19- and 20-year-olds," she said "The passion for  what they believed in is reminiscent of the civil rights movement or the  anti-war movement."  </P> <P> Strike organizers claim that more than 500 students participated in the protest  at Mills. Several said they hope to transfer the school's new-found activism  into a long-term struggle for women's rights.  </P> <P> "I think in a way Mills College could be the start of the women's movement of  the '90s," said Lisa Kosiewicz, a 21-year-old junior from Salem, Ore.  </P> <P> But she added, "Right now, we need this energy to keep Mills College alive."  </P> <P> College President Mary Metz said that even though there were tense feelings and  disagreements during the two-week strike, she's proud of the Mills students.  </P> <P> "It's clear that what we do works. These women haven't just been educated  intellectually," said Metz, gesturing to the seniors lined up at the rehearsal.  "These are proud and strong women who cannot be put down."  </P></p>

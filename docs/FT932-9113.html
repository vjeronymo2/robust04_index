			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Ex-detectives join private investigators TWO FORMER senior officers of the Metropolitan Police have been recruited by Kroll Associates, the US private investigation agency. The move became known yesterday as Mr Jules Kroll, head of the agency, called for bank secrecy laws to be eased in cases of suspected criminal activity. Former Detective Superintendent Tony McStravick, who was until recently the commander of the Met's Fraud Squad attached to the Serious Fraud Office, has been appointed a consultant to Kroll. Mr John O'Connor, former commander of the Met's Flying Squad and Regional Crime Squad, becomes Kroll's director of investigations. Mr Kroll said the agency expected the officers to contribute 'knowledge of City institutions and of the investigation and prosecution of fraud'. Mr Kroll told the Financial Times yesterday that the International Monetary Fund should put pressure on member countries to ease bank secrecy. 'Today there are many more places in the world where banking secrecy is a powerful obstacle to discovery,' he said. 'It has become more of a problem to chase the money than to chase the people.' Mr Kroll said there were about 16 banking jurisdictions including Austria, Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, the Dutch Antilles and Paraguay where investigators were encountering lack of co-operation. He named Switzerland as an example of a country that in recent years had become more co-operative in proving banking information. 'By contrast Austria is terribly difficult. It is one of the most vigorous countries in enforcing bank secrecy laws and has used this as a tactical advantage with which to take business away from Swiss banks,' Mr Kroll said. Mr Kroll, sometimes known as Wall Street's 'private eye', employs 250 people in 11 offices worldwide. After the Gulf War he was hired by the Kuwait government to trace Iraqi assets around the world. Mr McStravick has been involved in a series of major financial investigations in recent years including the House of Fraser takeover by the Fayeds, Homes Assured Corporation, Dunsdale Securities and Brent Walker.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Olympic Games spin-off put at Pounds 4bn NORTH-WEST England would benefit to the tune of at least Pounds 4bn and gain the equivalent of 11,000 full-time jobs if Manchester were to succeed in its attempt to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultants. About Pounds 2.5bn would be generated by capital investment in new facilities, environmental improvements and regeneration projects. Running the games would be worth a further Pounds 1.5bn in sponsorship, media activity, merchandising, tourism and additional income. Manchester's final bid document was yesterday given the official blessing of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to underline the government's commitment. Manchester is bidding against Brasilia, Berlin, Milan, Istanbul, Beijing and Sydney. Mr Major said legislation was expected soon to give the organising committee the necessary powers to plan and implement the event. Mr Tim Johnston, who led KPMG Peat Marwick's study team, said the figures were conservative. Other benefits might include extra tax revenues to the government of about Pounds 400m and a contribution to the UK balance of payments, which a 1990 study by two academic economists put at Pounds 500m. 'We have only attached figures to what we can be reasonably be sure of,' said Mr Johnston. 'We have not even tried to assess the inward investment that might flow because of increased worldwide interest in Manchester, although it would be very easy to say this might be worth 30,000 jobs.'</p>

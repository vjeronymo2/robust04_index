			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 24 (CNS) -- The safety problem  facing foreign-funded enterprises in the Mainland has become an  immediate concern in the wake of the collapse of a fire-stricken  textile factory in Zhuhai, which claimed dozens of lives in the  disaster. The incident indicated that early precaution was  desperately needed in order to prevent such a tragedy from  happening again.    Serious incidents concerning safety problems that occurred  in  foreign-funded enterprises since the beginning of last year  highlighted the urgent need for precautionary measures. Two  separate fire cases occurred in a Hong Kong-funded factory in  Kuiyong Township of Shenzhen and in a Taiwan-funded enterprise  in Mawei in Fuzhou last November. A sudden collapse happened in  a toy factory in Shaoguan of Shenzhen early this month. All  these incidents were very shocking.    Worries are aroused because there are so far over 100,000  foreign-funded enterprises in operation across China, and the  safety problem is highlighted following these incidents.    Surveys carried out by the Shenzhen authorities showed that  several of these incidents were attributed to man-made factors  which were in violation of regulations and law, while a survey  conducted by the Fujian authorities went further to indicate  that the safety problem facing foreign-funded enterprises was  very serious, including the locking of fire exit, illegal  occupation of staircase area, combination of warehouse and  workshop and no separate storage of inflammable articles, which  were often kept together with other items.    The potentially dangerous situation, which had existed for a  long time, mainly lay in several reasons. First, a rush of  introduction of foreign capital led to a simplification of the  procedures required, which in turn caused neglect of industrial  safety. Second, it is difficult for supervision and law  enforcement to be carried out because Chinese management  personnel employed by a particular foreign-funded enterprise  were not legitimately empowered to take care of safety affairs.  Third, foreign-funded enterprises generally tended to  re-construct their buildings in an unauthorized way, mainly out  of consideration for profit making. Some foreign businessmen  went further, ignoring safety of employees because they had  their factories insured overseas.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL POLICY CHANGE FAVORS ADMINISTRATORS  </P> <P> In a strong victory for principals and other administrators, the Los Angeles  Board of Education on Monday night rescinded a policy that would have required  them to go back to the classroom periodically.  </P> <P> The policy requiring every administrator to teach for at least 45 hours every  other year was aimed at easing teacher complaints that many principals and  other managers are out of touch.  </P> <P> And it would have made the Los Angeles Unified School District the first big  school system in the nation to require administrators to return to the "front  lines."  </P> <P> But on Monday night, on the recommendation of Supt. Leonard Britton, the board  voted 5 to 2 to rescind the never-implemented policy.  </P> <P> Britton, who had been bombarded with complaints from administrators ever since  the board adopted the back-to-the-classroom policy last May 8, told board  members that the timing was lousy and the policy unneeded.  </P> <P> Britton wrote in a memo to the board that administrators will be involved in a  number of time-consuming activities over the next several months that will be  "demanding of their leadership and their energies." He cited looming budget  cuts, the district's shift to a year-round calendar and the implementation of  programs for low achievers and for students who speak little or no English.  </P></p>

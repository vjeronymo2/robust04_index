			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Suman Chattopadhyay: "Congress Party Faces </F> Disunity in Every State But the West Bengal Case Is Exceptional"]    [Excerpts] The question of whether or not two fellow  travelers converse with one another arises only in the Congress  (I). This is the situation we find today between Somen Mitra and  Mamata Bandapadhyay.    Disunity within the Congress (I) is routine news. Unity is  the exeption. This is important in the case of Somen, Congress's  elected president [in Bengal] and Mamata, Congress's most  popular leader [in Bengal]. They have been at odds with each  other for years and are only now talking of unity. Five years  ago, Somen Mitra never dreamed that he, the general, would have  a lieutenant named Mamata. Times change, however, and he has  survived [while opposing Mamata] only due to others standing  beside him. Many of those, however, who stood beside him, have  gone their separate paths. At that time also, Somen and Mamata  had not intensely clashed. Their rivalry has grown in its  intensity. So what has happened to cause them to sound a unity  theme?    The answer lies in Delhi. Somen's writ ran out in April.  Congress's working committee in Delhi made a decision that state  organizational leadership will be determined by Narasimha Rao.  Now both Somen and Mamata want to be seen by Delhi as guiding a  unified Bengal Congress. One seeks to hold onto the reigns of  power while the other, who saw it slip away two years ago, wants  to appear disciplined in the effort to gain power. So both have  adopted the same strategies though their factions remain intact.  The stategy works only on paper. [passage omitted on meetings in  Delhi]    If Somen and Mamata really want to work out their  differences, they do not need Delhi's help. They can give Bengal  Congress a new face. This unity, however, will elude them. Those  who with Somen, opposed Mamata, will not allow unity, forming a  new faction if necessary. By resigning from his post as State  Party Vice-President, Subrata Mukherjee has done just that.  Mamata will also lose many in her faction by standing with  Somen. Neither wants to take this huge risk too far.    It is not just this state's Congress party which experiences  disunity. In fact, if we open our eyes, we will see its like  this most everywhere. In Tamil Nadu, G. K. Mupaner and Ram  Murti, A.K. Anthony and Karunakaran in Kerala as well as Vijay  Baskar Reddy and Raj Shekhar in Andhra Pradesh all have  competing factions. So do Madhav Singh Solanki and Prabodh  Rabhal in Gujarat, Sharad Pawar and Shankar Rao Chavan in  Maharashtra and Arjun Singh and Vidhya Charan Shukla in Madhya  Pradesh. Even Jagannath Mishra and Sitaram Keshari of Bihar and  Tripura's Sudhir Mazumdar and Samiranjan Barman have factions.  At times, factional fighting in these regions is more severe  than that in Bengal.    Congress' image in states ruled by the Left Front or by  Janata Dal factions is decidedly worse. But factionalism is not  the cause of losing elections. Bengal serves as the perfect  example of this. The constant fighting and hair-pulling  [backstabbing] between leaders is what loses elections. This is  hard to prove with statistics.    It is arithmitic which argues against Congress winning  elections in Bengal, not factionalism. Jyoti Basu and the CPM  [Communist Party India-Marxist] have won four consecutive  elections due to arithmitic being in their favor. [passage  omitted on election results]    Congress sees an opportunity before it now. Somen and Mamata  each have the ability to confront the leftists as Narasimha Rao  and Manmohan Singh have at the national level. But they will not  take this path. They proved this by not challenging CPM over the  state budget and by not being vocal over Dunkel [Signing of the  GATT Treaty], allowing CPM to claim whatever it wanted. Somen  Mitra, instead spent all of his energy fighting Youth Congress  leader Mamata Bandhapadhyay. Maybe this is why Delhi is now  beginning to coerce unity.</p>

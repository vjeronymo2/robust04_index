			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Receivers called to City PR company STREETS, one of the oldest financial public-relations companies in London has closed, and receivers have been called in by Royal Bank of Scotland. The action brought to an end nearly 180 years at the forefront of public communications in Britain. The company was set up by Mr George Street, a colleague of Mr Charles Barker, another leading figure in the public-relations industry. Staff cleared their desks at lunchtime yesterday after being told that the company would not be able to pay September salaries and expenses. Mr Mark Reilly, representing receivers Clarke Whitehill, said the 43 employees would receive their statutory entitlements when the investigations were complete. Meanwhile, Citigate, another public-relations company, moved to snap up the direct and financial marketing divisions of Streets for an undisclosed sum. Citigate has been expanding, most recently with the purchase of Charles Barker Advertising from Corporate Communications, which went into receivership last month. Streets is believed to have left debts well into six figures. Mr Reilly said the receivers hoped to recover between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m from debtors. But the total might not meet all the obligations. Streets was once London's largest financial PR company, employing 150 people in 1987. However, it has suffered difficulties since the departure of several senior executives, who set up Citigate.</p>

L. 91&hyph;190 as amended), the National Park Service has prepared a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS), to the General Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement (GMP/FEIS) for the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, in conjunction with an amended Development Concept Plan (DCP) for Willow Beach on the Arizona side of Lake Mohave. Pursuant to Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, the National Park Service has prepared a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of Findings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  for the proposed plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DCP Amendment/SEIS describes and analyzes four alternative development concept plans for Willow Beach. The final proposal, Alternative C in the SEIS, differs in some minor respects from the draft proposal because of revisions in response to public comment. The proposal focuses on enhancement of visitor experience along the riverfront at Willow Beach with the addition of picnic areas, fishing piers, walkways, small docks, and additional parking. Parking spaces would be increased to 510 spaces from the existing 330. The existing trailer village, motel, a dry boat storage and restaurant/store, currently located within high hazard floodplain areas, would be eliminated. A new building consolidating retail, restaurant, visitor contact, restrooms, and fuel service functions would be constructed on the northern side of Willow Beach Wash, which would allow the launch ramp to be shifted to the north, moving these facilities farther from the main flood flows along the south side of the drainage. A 125-slip marina would be retained and consolidated in one area on the north end of Willow Beach Wash. A new campground would be constructed above Willow Beach Wash approximately one-half mile from the riverfront. Park and concession support facilities would be relocated. Flood mitigation would consist of a combination of flood warning system and evacuation plan, structural protection, and relocation or elimination of some existing facilities. All overnight facilities would be located outside of the main flood flows and structurally protected to the probable maximum flood level. Day use facilities would be located outside of the floodplains or structurally protected to the 100-year flood level. Alternative A, the no action alternative, would continue present conditions and uses within the floodplain, and flood protection would consist of non-structural measures limited to an early warning system and evacuation plan. Alternative B would retain existing uses in the floodplain but would add structural flood protection and relocate some facilities. Parking would be reduced to 224 spaces. Alternative D would allow for continued provision of a variety of visitor services at Willow Beach except that the motel and trailer village would be eliminated. A campground would be added, as in the proposal, and flood protection measures would be similar to the proposal and Alternative B. The proposal and alternatives were analyzed for impacts on public safety and property in floodplains, desert plant communities, water and air quality, species of special concern, visitor experience, trailer village occupants, concession operations, and cultural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of Findings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  addresses floodplain aspects of the proposed plan, including mitigation and measures to minimize exposure of life and property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The no-action period on the development concept plan will extend for 30 days after the notice of its availability is published by EPA in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .

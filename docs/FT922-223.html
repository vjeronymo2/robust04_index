			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Lisbon acquits itself honourably at helm AT MIDNIGHT tonight Portugal's six-month stint at the helm of the European Community presidency will end, and Portuguese officials will heave a sigh of relief. It has been a gruelling task for a small country with relatively limited resources. It was Portugal's first presidency, and some 2,500 officials had to be specially trained to cope with the work. The concluding summit in Lisbon at the weekend failed to live up to earlier Portuguese expectations, but there have been some important successes. Portugal faced an unusually difficult agenda. On the internal front there was the thorny question of finding agreement on a financing package for the Community for 1993-97; agreement was also needed to reform the Common Agricultural Policy; and further measures had to be implemented to consolidate moves towards the internal market. On the international front, the crises in Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union placed additional demands on Portuguese diplomatic skills. The verdict appears to be that Portugal ran a workman-like and relatively successful presidency. There were no major mistakes, and some significant achievements. Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese agriculture minister, took risks but succeeded in winning agreement on a farm reform which will have a long-term impact on the Community. 'It certainly wasn't obvious that a small country like Portugal could complete such a negotiation,' says one foreign diplomat. The view from Brussels is that Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, did good work behind the scenes, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, his foreign minister, was effective, and Mr Cunha pulled off a big gamble by watering down Commission proposals on farm reform but keeping everyone on board. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, who had only just been appointed finance minister, after spending some years at the Commission, was not intimately known by his ministerial colleagues, though he showed himself to be effective in the debate on convergence. 'The Portuguese presidency was overshadowed by the important decisions taken at Maastricht. After that, time was needed to prepare the follow-up. There was an obvious conflict between rich and poor over a new financial package, then the Danish referendum made things even more difficult,' says one official. The biggest disappointment was the failure to achieve a breakthrough on finances for the Community. This was a particular blow for the Portuguese, as well as for Spain, Ireland and Greece, the main beneficiaries of planned increases in resources. However, Portugal oversaw progress towards harmonising EC legislation before the abolition of internal trade barriers on January 1, 1993. Over 90 per cent of the agreements, including an 'open skies' policy on liberalising air transport, will be in place when Britain takes over the presidency tomorrow. Because of its low profile and desire to find consensus, Portugal was criticised at times for being over-cautious. However, in view of the difficulties facing its presidency, that may well have been one of its greatest virtues.</p>

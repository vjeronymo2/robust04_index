			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (7): Skills base on offer / Town profile of Preston PRESTON, although a traditional manufacturing town dependent on engineering and textiles survived the l980s well. While other industrial towns in the north of England exerienced high levels of unemployment, Preston consistently registered a jobless number below the level for the north west and often below the national average. In September this year, unemployment in the Preston travel-to work-area was 11.7 per cent compared with 10.8 per cent for the north'west and 9.9 per cent for Britain as a whole. (In the inner town, however, male unemployment is over 20 per cent in some wards). The reasons for the relative buoyancy was that a large industry - aerospace  -held up well, thereby helping to support service industries, particularly retailing. Preston is the administrative centre for the county. Lancashire County Council's headquarters are there; so are the crown courts and other subregional offices of public bodies. It is also the home of Lancashire Polytechnic which is in the process of becoming the University of Central Lancashire. Public administration accounts for more than 8 per cent of total full time employment; education for a further 9 per cent. Retailing distribution is put at 10 per cent. In the past decade Preston, the sub-regional shopping centre for a catchment area of 400,000, has built up its central shopping area. There is also a thriving indoor market, and an outdoor market operating four days a week. The town has also attracted some headquarters of banks and insurance companies. Mr Peter Bulmer, assistant director of planning, says: 'We estimate that of the 2,221 jobs created at Preston Riverways, the docklands redevelopment, 810 are office based.' Despite these successes in service industries, including tourism, the backbone of the economy has been aerospace, where British Aerospace has announced that by l993 its Strand Road plant is to close down. EAP Consultants, asked by the borough council to study the impact of the closure suggests that unemployment could rise from 11 to 17 per cent by l993. About 2,000 jobs will be shed from the original Strand Road workforce of 4,500; a further 500 through natural wastage. Further jobs will be lost among sub-contractors to BAe. Even if pessimistic forecasts are not realised, Preston will still have a job on its hands to find new employment. The strategy is to try to encourage home grown companies and to secure the relocation of outside companies, ideally small to medium high technology companies which will avail themselves of the existing skills base. Mr David Borrow, leader of Preston borough council, says: 'We need to make sure we do not lose the highly skilled labour that we have here. We want smaller companies because we want to avoid the branch factory mentality where decisions to close factories are taken by distant parent companies.' In the past a shortage of industrial land has acted as a brake on attracting new manufacturers, but 1m sq ft of space should become available at the Strand Road plant. A further 200 acres for industrial use have been identified; some belong to the Commission for New Towns (CNT), which took over from the Central Lancashire New Town Development Corporation. At about Pounds 100,000 an acre, it is competitively priced compared with other locations in the north west. Preston receives aid under the urban programme and also derelict land clearance grants, but it does not qualify for assisted area status.</p>

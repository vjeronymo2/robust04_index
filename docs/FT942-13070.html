			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Reward offer highlights China venture problems An unusual advertisement being placed by a British businessman in Asian newspapers could embarrass a state-owned Chinese company against which he has waged a four-year legal battle. Mr Richard Gosling is offering a Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 340,176) reward for information on the 'assets, cargo and bank accounts' of China Tianjin International Economic &amp; Technical Co-operative Corporation (CTIETCC), his partner in a failed joint venture. The company is effectively the commercial arm of the government of Tianjin, an eastern Chinese port city. Mr Gosling wants to locate Dollars 4.5m of the Chinese company's money in order to enforce a 1992 judgment made in the High Court in London against CTIETCC. Although the scale of Mr Gosling's investment was relatively small, his case highlights the absence of legal redress in China for foreign investors whose ventures go wrong. Chinese officials admit that developing a better legal system is a high priority in the country's economic reform. Not only are there few legal avenues in China, but Chinese companies often have complex corporate networks, making it difficult to pin down a legal entity which can be pursued. Mr Gosling's joint venture with CTIETCC, formed in 1989, was to produce printed circuit boards as well as other goods such as car tyre foot pumps. But, it was alleged no circuit boards materialised, nor did the pumps meet specifications. The case underlines the need for foreign companies to build up their contacts and knowledge of China before investing, to negotiate carefully, and to work closely with joint venture partners after signing an agreement. Mr Gosling obtained a judgment for Pounds 1.86m, since inflated by interest and legal costs, in the English High Court, and has since been seeking CTIETCC assets so the judgment can be enforced. His latest step follows his failure to win a garnishee order against the Bank of China's London branch which sought to recover money from CTIETCC bank accounts in China.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Japanese market deal for ICL ICL, the UK-based computer group which is majority owned by Fujitsu of Japan, is to sell its high performance Unix-based mid-range computers in the Japanese market through a subsidiary of C Itoh, the large Japanese trading house, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. The agreement with C Itoh represents a breakthrough for ICL into the highly competitive Japanese computer market and provides it with an opportunity to underline its independence from its Japanese parent company. 'For ICL to be able to get into the Japanese market this way has some significance and we are not doing this through Fujitsu,' ICL said. The group, which was excluded from some European joint research projects because of its Japanese ownership, has consistently claimed that commercially it operates at an arm's length from Fujitsu. Fujitsu sells the same Unix-based DRS 6000 system, which is manufactured in Manchester, in Spain, North America, parts of South-East Asia and Australasia but not in Japan. Although details of the agreement with C Itoh have not been disclosed, ICL is optimistic about the benefits of the new relationship. C Itoh Techno-Science , the subsidiary that will market ICL's computers, is a systems integrator that has been the sole Wang systems integrator in Japan for 20 years.</p>

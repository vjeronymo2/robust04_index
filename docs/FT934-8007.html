			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh price record set for Nymex seat ANOTHER RECORD has been set for the purchase price of a seat on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy futures market. The Dollars 375,000 paid last Friday beat the previous record of Dollars 370,000, set only nine days earlier. Mr R Patrick Thompson, president of the 816-seat exchange, said yesterday that the increase in Nymex seat values reflected 'the overall growth in exchange volume evident last week in the establishment of an annual record for the 13th time in 14 years. 'We expect to see continued success and opportunities for our members in 1994, especially with the globalisation of our markets reflected in the early success of Nymex Access, our after-hours electronic trading system'. The Access system went live in London two weeks ago.</p>

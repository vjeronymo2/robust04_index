			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bell May Stop Work on V-22: Bell Helicopter Textron will begin layoffs next  week unless the Pentagon restores funding for the Osprey V-22 tilt-rotor  aircraft, a company spokesman said. In a letter to the Defense Department, Bell  said it would halt work on the program Friday and begin laying off about 2,000  employees Monday. Bell has been threatening to lay off employees in Ft. Worth,  since last week, when it became clear the Osprey was in trouble. Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney announced $10 billion in defense cuts -- among them, the  V-22 program.  </P></p>

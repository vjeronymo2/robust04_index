			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLERS: NEW IN FEBRUARY  </P> <P> As the good St. Valentine himself would have been the first to admit: "The  course of true love never did run smooth." And the popular fiction outpouring  for February underlines it with affairs of the heart ranging from the merely  turbulent to the erotic to the mismatched to the bizarre to the far-fetched.  </P> <P> In Michael Korda's The Fortune, for instance, we are faced with an ages-old  conundrum: Can an attractive, savvy young New York art dealer find love in the  arms of a man old enough to be her grandfather -- and who also happens to  control a family fortune running into the billions? So, hey! Why not? Bulging  pecs aren't everything! Korda, the editor-in-chief of Simon &amp; Schuster and  the author of four previous nonfiction books as well as two novels, "Worldly  Goods" and "Queenie," has great fun with the affair between crazy-like-a-fox  Elizabeth Alexandra Walden and the reclusive billionaire, Arthur Alden  Bannerman.  </P> <P> Rightfully, Korda goes to considerable pain to probe the nature of the  blossoming relationship between them. A casual roll in the hay between an  opportunistic young woman and a slavering derriere-pincher, this is not. But,  when Bannerman -- defying his brooding and dangerous family and especially his  mother, the steel-would-melt-in-her-mouth matriarch of the Bannerman clan,  Eleanor -- actually marries Alexa and wills her, not simply a few million in  worldly goods for a job well done, but the whole kit and caboodle of the  Bannerman fortune, there's unabashed heck to pay. And especially when Arthur  has the bad form to die in his new bride's arms in the marriage bed.  </P> <P> Menacingly, the Bannermans and their attorneys begin circling the hapless Alexa  like a covey of mating ospreys, and this would appear to be the biggest  mismatch since Custer chose to take on the Sioux nation. But, stay tuned. Our  girl has a keen instinct for the jugular, herself and a few knuckle-ball tricks  as well. "The Fortune" is a main selection of the Literary Guild and has been  sold to ABC-TV for a four-part miniseries.  </P> <P> Love, in the lexicon of martial-arts guru author, Eric Van Lustbader, is as  physical as the lethal clashes between his protagonist and the black-hearted  villains that populate the pages of French Kiss. The body count here is  awesome, and, by Page 30, one has lost track of how many hapless players have  succumbed to the deadly iron war fan, the gunsen, a sort of portable guillotine  blade, and to other fatal variations of pentjak-silat, or anatomical weapons.  </P> <P> Here we have up-and-coming New York attorney, Chris Haye, seeking to unravel  the murder, in southern France, of his brother, Terry -- an early, gunsen  decapitation victim -- and Terry's obsession with obtaining a trio of jade  weapons known as the Prey Dauw, or the Forest of Swords. Seemingly ugly truths  about his dead brother begin emerging -- notably, Chris learns, that whoever  possesses the mystic Forest of Swords also controls all of the opium warlords  operating out of Burma.  </P> <P> And who, exactly, is "The Magician," the evil engineer of all of the related  murders? Van Lustbader has honed the brooding, goose-bumply sensation of  sudden, violent death likely to burst out of the darkness at any moment into a  unique art form. And in "French Kiss" he is in fine fettle with a suspense that  is sustained to the final page.  </P> <P> Despite an old pledge to our mother that we would never read a novel populated  by a heroine of heart-stopping beauty bearing a name like Flame, or a darkly  handsome, charismatic, hero bearing a name like Chance, we did it, anyway.  Mother had a good point. Janet Dailey's Rivals is a love story of the stripe  where the lovers-to-be -- catching sight of each other across a crowded room --  exchange a look of such searing intensity that, along with their clothes, it  also peels the lamination right off their respective driver's licenses.  </P> <P> Chance controls a global real estate empire. Flame is a dynamic advertising  executive. Boy meets girl. Boy beds and marries girl. A shocking truth during  their idyllic Mexican honeymoon -- Flame is the sole heir to an Oklahoma ranch,  the possession of which Chance desperately needs for a multi-million-dollar  land deal. Worse yet, they are the surviving members of two feuding Oklahoma  families -- a bitter vendetta that goes back to the Oklahoma land rush of 1891.  </P> <P> Did Chance rush her into marriage simply to claim the land? Does Flame have the  driving ambition, and finances, to beat her estranged lover at his own game?  Are these feckless kids going to see the self-destructiveness of what they're  doing? Is this an FHA-approved real estate development in the first place?  </P> <P> Not only have the first serial rights to "Rivals" been sold to Cosmopolitan  magazine, but it is a Literary Guild Main Selection. So cool it, Mother.  </P> <P> In Dean R. Koontz's blood-chilling Midnight, a late-night jogger along the  beach at Moonlight Cove in Northern California becomes suddenly aware that she  is not alone. Somebody . . . some thing . . . keening, panting and alternately  running upright and then silently on all fours . . . is joined by another and  then another and the circling closes in. And the eerie mood of this creepy,  crawly novel of the supernatural is vividly etched. What evil force is abroad  in this otherwise idyllic coastal town? Tessa Lockland, suspicious of her  sister's unprompted suicide, wants to know, and so does Sam Booker, an  undercover Federal agent investigating a string of equally suspicious deaths.  And so does veteran, wheelchair-ridden Harry Talbot, whose tip to the FBI  brought Booker to Moonlight Cove in the first place. And throw in for good  measure the razor-sharp, 11-year-old Chrissie Foster, an irrepressible charmer  with literary aspirations -- and with a particular interest in the strange  forces that are warping her home town since she is a principal target of them.  </P> <P> "Midnight," follows on the heels of Koontz's earlier works in the genre of the  macabre-thriller such as "Strangers," "Watchers" and "Lightning." While there  are overtones in "Midnight," of both "The Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" and  "The Stepford Wives," Koontz plows new, and even more chilling ground, in this  gripping story of a little town at the mercy of a high-tech evil spirit. You  put the book down at your own risk. The minute you do there could be a muffled  rustling and a soft whinnying sound behind your chair.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FORTUNE  </P> <P> by Michael Korda  </P> <P> (Summit Books: $19.95; 481 pp.)  </P> <P> FRENCH KISS  </P> <P> by Eric Van Lustbader  </P> <P> (Fawcett/Columbine:  </P> <P> $19.95; 512 pp.)  </P> <P> RIVALS  </P> <P> by Janet Dailey  </P> <P> (Little, Brown: $18.95; 400 pp.)  </P> <P> MIDNIGHT  </P> <P> by Dean R.

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR SAYS MOTHER ACTED LIKE DRUG DEALER  </P> <P> A Topanga Canyon woman charged with hiding cocaine in the backpack of her  7-year-old daughter, who carried the drug to school, was "not concerned for her  child, but of getting rid of the evidence," a prosecutor said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Maria Christina Torres, 40, acted like a drug dealer and not like a mother when  she went to the school to retrieve the cocaine, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tracy Watson  said in her closing argument of the two-week-long trial in Van Nuys Superior  Court.  </P> <P> "The defendant was not concerned for her child, but of getting rid of the  evidence," Watson told the jury. "Her actions were that of a drug dealer."  </P> <P> Torres, a Colombian citizen, is charged with child endangerment and possession  of cocaine for sale. If convicted, she could be sentenced to seven years in  prison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Children Tasted It  </P> <P> Police were called to Canoga Park Lutheran School on June 13 after Torres'  daughter and eight other students told their teachers that they had tasted the  powdery substance out of curiosity. The youngsters were taken to a hospital  after the substance was found to be cocaine. All were released in good health.  </P> <P> Police said Torres went to the school after lunch to retrieve the cocaine,  which she said she later flushed down a toilet. But Watson told the jury that  Torres never told teachers that the substance was cocaine, thereby endangering  all the children.  </P> <P> Torres was arrested that same afternoon when she came to the school to pick up  her daughter.  </P> <P> The defendant has testified that the cocaine was placed in the child's book bag  by Denny Meyers, a longtime friend, after she left the backpack in a car she  loaned to Meyers.  </P> <P> Torres testified that Meyers was in Kansas. Watson has said that even if  authorities could locate Meyers she could not force him to testify because of  his "rights against self-incrimination."  </P></p>

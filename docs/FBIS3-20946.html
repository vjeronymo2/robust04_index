			<p>Language: <F P=105> German, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Klaus Beumler, technology consultant at </F> VDI/VDE-IT (Association of German Engineers and Association of  German Electrical Engineers - Information Technology Ltd)]    [Text]  Privatization. With the help of business contacts,  the Velox Automation Ltd is finding the direction to the profit  zone in West Europe 1994. Established in 1990, this new  technological enterprise employs already 13 workers.    "Direction to profit zone has been found" say ex-officer  Wunderwald.    The family of products offered by the team of ex-officers  includes special sensors for operation in intricate and extreme  environments, also robust but efficient measuring instruments as  well as control and regulation engineering devices. The new  developments, registered under the trademark "Velomat", utilize  the latest knowledge and experience concerning error-tolerant  networks and simulation of complex sensor or actuator fields.    The founders of this enterprise located at the Brauna in  Saxony had previously worked in the Department of Scientific  Instrument Design at the Officers' College in Kamenz. Reinald  Wunderwald, the guiding spirit of the founding foursome, did not  want to wait till others would decide his professional fate. He  aroused in his friends enthusiasm for establishment of an  engineering office: "We should be able to successfully apply our  technical know-how and team spirit to production of civilian  goods."    The four of them plunged into preparatory theoretical work  and then let an enterprise consultant help them with the  financial concept. After the Velox Ltd had finally been  established in spring 1990, there followed usual difficulties:  aggrevation with hesitant bankers and attendance in many places  at the same time. Simultaneously with the development of a  salable product line, there also had to be built up a core of  customers.    During this difficult phase the Velox team made contact with  the VDI/VDE- Technology Center for Information Technology. The  offered TOU (Technology- Oriented Enterprise Establishments)  assistance program was gratefully accepted and subsidies were  quickly approved. Meanwhile, the Velomat product line has grown  to include 20 items and more are being developed. Stimulation  for this is now already provided by the expanding core of  customers.    This TOU assistance provided the foundation for dynamic  evolution of the Velox Ltd from an engineering office into a  manufacturing enterprise. "The program has helped us a great  deal" says Wunderwald. He does not hide, however, that arriving  so far has required quite a lot staying power. "We relied too  much on the East German medium-size industry." The recession in  machine manufacturing in the old (East German) States created  gaps in the original conversion plan.    The management team of this enterprises, which had already  grown to a staff of 13 employees, was helped by business  contacts in Austria, France, and the Netherlands in overcoming  those deficiencies. "The present status of orders indicates that  next year we will have reached the profit zone" joyfully  announces Wunderwald.</p>

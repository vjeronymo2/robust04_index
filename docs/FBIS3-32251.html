The Paraguayan  Government believes these privileges should be the same as those  established by the Vienna Convention on diplomatic ties.  Ramirez Boettner's letter responds to a letter Glassman sent to  Wasmosy.    The letter states that the government has studied very  closely the offer encompassed in the "Agreement between the  United States of America and the Paraguayan Government on joint  exercises known as Strong Roads 1994-South" and the "Memorandum  of Understanding between the U.S. State Department and the  Paraguayan Public Works and Communications Ministry." The  Paraguayan Government expresses its thanks for the U.S.  "interest" in building six schools, six wells, and one clinic in  San Pedro Department.    "After a careful study of this operation, the value of which  is not specified anywhere in the two aforementioned documents  although the annex establishes that the amount is `to be  specified' -- while statements to the radio and the press Your  Excellency has said it will total $12 million -- we wonder if  the amount will be invested in Paraguay through the works  encompassed in this project, or if it represents the total cost  that the United States will spend deploying 600 U.S. Army  servicemen to Paraguay, the equipment (which will not be donated  to Paraguay), and the maintenance of the personnel. In this  case, it does not constitute cooperation for Paraguay but the  financing of what the agreement calls `Joint Exercises'  conducted in Paraguay." [passage omitted]    After stating that the requirements of the Americans for  their arrival are "very costly," the Government insists that  Paraguay "would be allocating far more resources than the United  States." [passage omitted]    On the agreement to allow the entrance of U.S. servicemen,  among other things, the government proposes "that the Paraguayan  Army be the counterpart of the joint exercise, for which a  sapper battalion will be designated; that the value the  technical cooperation program be specified; that Congress  authorize the arrival of the troops with their respective arms  because this affects our country's sovereign rights; that the  joint exercise will be carried out only in the areas specified,  including ports, airports, and Paraguayan air space, clearly  specifying the number and characteristics of the planes or  helicopters to be used; and that the import of arms be  restricted." The letter to Glassman also states that if these  conditions are not met "It may be convenient for the Paraguayan  Government to carry out these works with its own resources,  without the cooperation of your country."</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Extermination in Eden: Christina Lamb visits uncharted Amazonia where the last Stone Age tribe is threatened by starving gold-seekers 'THOSE WHO have already died will have their revenge. They will cut the sky into pieces so that it falls all over the land.'  - Davi Kopenawa Yanomami UNDER THE pounding glare of the Amazonian sun, a few wispy clouds throw their shadows onto a carpet of green treetops covering mountains and chasms as far as the eye can see. Stencilled through the heart of this dense jungle is the flashing ribbon of the Macujai river. Along its banks, the occasional clearings for a maloca (a conical woven hut) are the only signs of human presence. The US aviation map of the north-western reaches of Roraima, Brazil's most northern state, warns intriguingly that the area is 'largely unknown'. The depths of the Amazon basin near the Venezuelan border was the setting for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World. Progress has not yet arrived and, almost 500 years after Pedro Cabral discovered Brazil, this stretch of rain forest remains untouched by the highways, hydro-electric projects, wood-cutters and settlements that have devoured much of the Amazon. It is home to an estimated 9,000 members of the world's oldest surviving isolated Indian tribe - the Yanomami. The Yanomami are believed to have been there for thousands of years. They do not read or write, and use bows and arrows. Female children are often killed at birth and names are never spoken. After a death, the body is left in the trees for a week before burning, and the ashes are then eaten with banana paste. They subsist on hunting and fishing and precarious agriculture. The land is poor so the population is sparse and moves often. The Yanomami reserve is accessible only by small plane after a laborious process of government authorisation. It has a tranquillity for which I could easily renounce urban living. The nearest road linking Roraima to the rest of Brazil starts 300km away. It was built in 1977 and has yet to be paved. Bulldozers and four-wheel drive vehicles are unknown. The somnolent day is interrupted only by the shrieks of parrots, unidentifiable whoops and calls from the bushes, and the chatter of monkeys in the trees. Until 1987, the Yanomamis' only contact with whites was the occasional missionary. Five years ago it was discovered that these Stone Age people were sitting on one of the world's richest mineral deposits replete with gold, tin, diamonds and uranium. The result was a flood of 45,000 garimpeiros, or wild-cat gold miners. They brought guns, rum and diseases which, in three years, wiped out 10 per cent of the Yanomami population in what human rights' groups called genocide. The international outcry prompted three operations to remove the garimpeiros. The first official trip by image-conscious President Fernando Collor in 1990 was for the widely televised destruction of 84 clandestine airstrips. Last year, amid more grand publicity, he created a 9.4m sq km reserve (the size of Portugal) for the Yanomami to win points at the Earth Summit and reverse Brazil's reputation as an eco-villain. Now Collor is in disgrace, the Earth Summit forgotten and the garimpeiros are back - 12,000 since November. Once more, Yanomami are dying: 200 in the past 12 months. The Homoxi region, under the shadow of the Surucucu mountains, has been mutilated by airstrips slashed out of the jungle. The Macujai river has been choked with silt, polluted with mercury used to extract gold, and diverted in the frantic search for the precious metal. From above, you can see tiny figures working Heath Robinson-type sluice contraptions, digging craters where fetid water gathers, breeding mosquitoes which carry malaria lethal to the Yanomami. Charlotte Sankey from Survival International, a London-based organisation active in the fight to preserve them, says: 'If we don't do something, we will see another people wiped out  -forever.' Although the 1988 constitution guarantees that all 180 remaining Indian tribes in Brazil will be granted their traditional lands by October - a total of 90m hectares in 510 reserves - powerful interests threaten the extermination of the Yanomami like so many others before them. Since 1500, Brazil's Indian population has fallen from 5m to 220,000. The 'noble savage' has been seen as a barrier to development. Fernando Ramos Pereira, then governor of Roraima, said in 1979: 'We're not going to let half a dozen Indian tribes stop progress.' The constitution is to be reviewed this year. Bishops, mining companies, politicians, land-owners, the military, environmentalists and garimpeiros are battling over the mining of Yanomami land. This would provide work for thousands of poor Brazilians and revenue for the government - but probably destroy the tribe. In Homoxi, Funai, the national Indian agency, and Medicins Sans Frontiers, a medical aid organisation, have a post tending to the 48 Indians living nearby. At the sound of the plane, several emerge from their maloca, naked except for small knotted tangas, with red body paint and straws protruding from above their upper lips. Like children they come forward, touch and stare, chatter and giggle to themselves. Bored quickly, they go back to their hammocks where they loll listlessly, their stick-thin limbs and distended stomachs no advertisement for the natural life. Suddenly, they begin jabbering. Zelia, the Peruvian nurse, says they want to know if we have come to remove the garimpeiros. At the other end of the short runway, makeshift huts covered with blue plastic sheeting show how close the invaders have come. Eight planes a day unload more, along with such diseases as influenza, malaria, tuberculosis and syphilis - against which the Yanomami have no defence. The pollution of the river has killed the fish and the noise of the planes has scared off animals. To appease the Yanomami, the garimpeiros gave them flour and rice - but their plantations have been left to wither and die. In their brutal introduction to western civilisation, they were given rum and the women were seduced. According to Zelia, two-thirds of the Homoxi Yanomami have had malaria. On the morning of my visit, three more sorry sufferers came in. The garimpeiros do not look like villains. They are well-armed and sport gold watches or nuggets, but most have hollow cheeks, dull eyes and dirty shorts. All I met were from the poverty-stricken north-eastern states of Maranhao and Bahia. They had been forced out by drought, and all asked for food. Many have no alternative but to move from place to place, following the latest fofoca (rumour about a gold discovery). 'I will only leave dead,' said Vajel, who has been a garimpeiro since he was 15. 'On a good day, you can get 20 grammes of gold - that's five months' minimum salary,' said Raimundo. 'If they push us out again, we'll come back. We've got no other option.' Some 5,000km and several ages away in Brasilia, a bearded man with furrowed brow paces a government office in heavy hiking boots and khaki shirt. Sidney Possuelo is charged with protecting Brazil's indigenous people as the head of Funai. He is angry. He feels powerless and worried that Brazil's new president, Itamar Franco, will succumb to pleas to open up the reserve for mining. 'I'm a malandro (scoundrel), not a politician,' he says as he fires off a letter to the army chief complaining about the arrest of a French nurse in the Yanomami reserve. At Possuelo's offices the lift is out of order, the 'phones are sometimes cut off and few lights are on. The government cash crisis has left Funai with no money to monitor the 272 existing reserves, or to demarcate the 238 outstanding. Last year, Possuelo received less than 10 per cent of his budget. So far this year, he has received nothing. None of Funai's nine planes is working. The Collor decree, overriding military protests to create the Yanomami reserve, should have been a victory but, without funds to enforce it, Possuelo now suspects it was a mere marketing stunt. 'It's not enough to create a reserve when, inside, you have riches and, outside, marginalised people,' he says. He accuses his opponents of distorting the picture. 'What we're talking about is not maintaining the Yanomami as they are, like some museum piece for the benefit of anthropologists, but of giving them the option of staying as they are or joining the world around with time to adjust.' Over in the flying saucer-shaped Congress building, Senator Joao Fagundes says is having none of this. 'We never felt we needed to keep the Vikings preserved in cages. It's no good saying that the Yanomamis' ways are lovely, let's keep them. What was good 200 years ago is not now.' He favours the solution of the former Sarney goverment, which demarcated 19 islands of 2.4m sq km to the Yanomami but gave garimpeiros or mining companies access to the rest. 'The Yanomami land takes up 40 percent of Roraima. That's 10 sq km per person - no people in the world has that kind of land,' says Fagundes. Davi Kopenawa Yanomami, the tribe's Portugese-speaking representative, also visited Brasilia that day to present a bow and arrow to President Franco. 'I will tell Great White Chief that Omame (a Yanomami god) put minerals beneath the earth because it is cold. When these are taken out, they spread hot air and venom which causes many illnesses. We have tried to tell the whites but they don't listen.' To Possuelo's surprise, Franco did listen and agreed to a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.4m) operation to remove the garimperios. In the Funai office in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, Wilk Celio, the co-ordinator of the removal programme, is sceptical. 'It's useless - the garimpeiros will keep going back. There are 100 garimpeiro planes operating in this area while we don't have one. The only answer is constant monitoring and that means funds. Last year, we didn't get a cent.' His colleague, Manoel Reginaldo Tavares, gestures at a wall map of the state showing the location of its 24,970 Indians of eight different tribes, and laughs. 'Our resources are not even enough to run a creche of 100 children, let alone 25,000 Indians.' Tension is high in Boa Vista. Roraima state depends on federal handouts but would be rich if allowed access to its minerals. The population has tripled to 230,000 in 10 years because of the influx of garimpeiros, and not just from Brazil. A Londoner has just arrived from Mile End and a Scot, John Boyle, runs the Bay Bar and nightclub after eight years as a garimpeiro. Prices are in grammes of gold, and everyone seems to have a stake in the garimpeiro-Yanomami struggle. The headlines in the local papers are about murders. People mutter of mafia-like activities and aid workers tell of pet dogs slaughtered in their gardens. Celio gets constant threats and lives between his office and hotel. 'I'm a prisoner,' he says, and talks of going on holiday and not coming back. The centrepiece of the giant main square is an enormous concrete statue of a garimpeiro. This is overlooked by the state assembly, where all 24 members are against demarcation, and the governor's palace. His spokesman, Francisco Netto, says: 'The federal government can keep on spending more and more but will never succeed in taking out the garimpeiros. The only answer is to create mining reserves and allow in companies so that we can collect taxes.' Elton Rohmelt, the head of the state energy department, has no doubt that day will come. He is one of the main garimpeiro bosses, with a fleet of four 'planes and a helicopter. Rohmelt says: 'No one knows the Amazon better than me.' He is so fat that his jowls quiver as he speaks and the buttons strain on the patterned shirts he buys in London. Rohmelt decided to lie low when Collor took office. 'I saw he was mad, so I took up the governor's invitation to run the state energy department.' He is using his position to put in place the infrastructure for his future mining operations. Here a hydro-electric project, there a road to Venezuela and the port. His company, Goldmazon, has more than 60 claims in the Yanomami areas. He says: 'Refusing access to this is a crime for a poor country like us. I'm absolutely sure that, within the next few years, mining in Yanomami areas will be allowed - and I'm ready.' His great rival, the ebullient Ze Altino, a media-loving representative of the garimpeiros' union, Usagal, is more careful to play down his personal interest. He says: 'What's the point of blowing up airstrips if, six hours later, they are rebuilt.' He points out that there are 1m garimpeiros in Brazil, of which 400,000 are 'professional'. He adds: 'They say garimpeiros are illegal, but there are more garimpeiros in indigenous areas than there are Indians in Brazil. Don't they have rights, too?' Haroldo Eurico dos Santos, the state planning secretary, is a former professor who used to advise governments to burn down the Amazon. He is busy drawing up mega-plans for Brazil's poorest state. Above the noise from roaring, clanking pipes, he shouts: 'This state is basically unviable. We generate only 16 percent of our expenditure and our only potential economic base is either demarcated or will be. Ninety-nine per cent of the population are against demarcation. The only ones in favour are the church, communists and some Indians.' The most vitriolic opposition is on Rua do Ouro (Gold Street). There, many of the gold shops are boarded up, the stores full of mining utensils deserted, and clutches of garimpeiros sit miserably at bars, biding their time, comparing the number of times each has had malaria (one man has had 34 bouts). They recall the days when they could make a good living just from the end-of-day sweepings outside the gold shops. Most of the gold is smuggled out of the state to avoid taxes, so figures for the amount produced are vague. According to Altino, production reached 12 tonnes in the peak year of 1990, plus 500,000 kilos of diamonds. Even then, few got rich apart from the bosses, the Rohmelts and Altinos, who run airstrips, planes, bars, brothels, and rent machinery at inflated prices. In Gold Street, the blame for the latest crackdown is laid on everyone from the Americans ('they are scared of Brazil becoming a great power') to the padres for their defence of Indian rights. So unpopular is Dom Aldo, the bishop, that a petition was mounted last year to get him out. One man told me: 'I'd like to have his kidneys on a barbecue fork.' After 17 years in Boa Vista and overseeing a Yanomami mission, the fire seems to have gone out of Dom Aldo. Wearily, he tells me: 'People say we are working for gold or trying to create another nation, but that's a lie. Nor are we trying to convert them (the Indians). They don't yet have the terminology for catechism, so it's very hard to explain our Christian concepts. 'People get angry because we tell the Indians their rights. It's a war between economic interests and human rights in a country where the powerful always win.' Among so many voices, the only ones not to be heard are the Yanomami. Experience from other tribes suggests that Indians are keen to have the badges of progress such as televisions, speedboats and ghetto-blasters. Some of the more acculturated Amazonian tribes, such as the Kayapo and Xingu, have organised and demand royalties for prospecting in their areas. But along the river Branco from Boa Vista, at Fazenda Sao Marco, a community of Macuxi Indians lives in pitiful squalor. White contact has robbed them of their old ways without equipping them to find a substitute. For the primitive Yanomami, the future looks bleak.</p>

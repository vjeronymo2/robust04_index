The Seoul Government, having already examined two lists of  arms Russia recently offered, has concluded that some would be  useful in evaluating North Korea's weapons systems because they  follow those of the former Soviet Union, informed sources here  said. But Seoul would reject many others on the lists  considering that its weapons systems are patterned after U.S.  systems and that it maintains close relations with Washington,  they added.    In response to Russia's proposal, Seoul will shortly send a  group of weapons specialists to Moscow to study any technical  problems with the arms and negotiate the terms of receiving them  in place of the defaulted loans.    The Russian Army Chief of General Staff, Mikhail Kolesnikov,  will visit Seoul in march to meet with Korean defense officials  to discuss Russia's offer of weapons in payment for outstanding  loans.    Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said in a  recent interview with YONHAP that Moscow is ready not only to  offer many of its state-of-the-art weapons in payment for South  Korean loans in arrears, but also to introduce Korean capital  and marketing techniques in privatizing the Russian defense  industry.</p>

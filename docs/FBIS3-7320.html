Mieno's four-year  term as governor of the central bank is due to expire December  16.    Matsushita, 68, joined the Finance Ministry in 1950 after  graduating from the University of Tokyo. He served as vice  finance minister, the ministry's highest post for bureaucrats,  for two years from June 1982.    Matsushita became president of Taiyo Kobe Bank after leaving  the ministry and has been serving as chairman of Sakura Bank  since April 1990, when the bank was set up through a merger of  Taiyo Kobe Bank and Mitsui Bank.    The sources, however, added some senior officials of the BOJ  and the Finance Ministry have strongly recommended Yoshihiko  Yoshino, 63, president of the Japan Development Bank, as Mieno's  successor. Yoshino was also the former vice finance minister  from 1986 to 1988.    Former vice finance ministers and career BOJ officials have  taken turns serving as BOJ governor for the past five terms.  Mieno, who entered the central bank in 1947, assumed the BOJ's  highest post in 1989 after serving as vice governor.    The sources also said the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is  likely to name Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, currently president of the  Export-Import Bank of Japan, as its next president. They said  the TSE's current president Minoru Nagaoka, who will complete  his second three-year term in May, will discuss the appointment  with the Finance Ministry and leaders of the securities industry  early next week.    After approval by TSE member companies, Yamaguchi's  appointment will be formally decided at the stock exchange's  general meeting May 25, they said. Yamaguchi, 66, started his  career in 1951 at the Finance Ministry and served in such  positions as director general of the budget bureau before  becoming vice finance minister in 1984.    If Yamaguchi accepts the offer at the TSE, he will be the  fifth former vice finance minister in a row to serve as its  president.    After resigning from the ministry in 1989, he served as the  head of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund before moving on  to the Ex-Im Bank as president in May 1990.</p>

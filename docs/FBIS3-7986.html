			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, former finance minister and </F> economic expert for the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Lorinc  Szendrei; place and date not given: "We Are Heading for  Restructuring, Not Restoration"]    [Text] The socialists are steadily moving upwards on the  popularity lists of various opinion polls. How different is the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] from the former state party?  Where can we place the MSZP on the list of left-wing formations  in Europe? Will the MSZP start restructuring or restoring  things if they get into power? We asked former finance minister  and current MSZP politician Laszlo Bekesi, whose name is also  mentioned as a possible candidate for the position of prime  minister.    [Szendrei] We cannot find a single party today that does not  have some kind of problems or reservations regarding the  socialists, while a considerable part of political forecasts  mention the MSZP as a potentional governing factor. You are  being measured, and possible coalition partners do not seem to  hurry to contact you. From the other side, you receive the label  of being the successor to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party  [MSZMP]. Threatening tones can also be heard, claiming that the  communists will come back with you. Preparing for its last  congress before the elections, where does the MSZP stand in the  left-wing arena used in the Western- European terminology?    [Bekesi] First of all about "measuring." The tough  quarantine after the elections held in 1990 is the consequence  of the demarcations of various intensities and intentions. Most  parties won over a considerable number of voters through a tough  anti- Bolshevik and anti-leftist propaganda. This worked  perfectly in 1990. Of course, in that cast, the MSZP was the  undesirable and improper successor party. Most parties think  that this anti- communism might also bring votes this year. The  third cause can be the essential one: It has become clear that,  with very tough and detailed work, the quarantined MSZP  preserved its calm and strengthened the professional image that  emerged as a nostalgia for the Nemeth cabinet. This feeling is  so strong today that all the political parties running in the  elections regard the MSZP as their biggest rival.    [Szendrei] Do you think that only fear of a socialist  victory and the loss of power dominates the evaluation of the  MSZP?    [Bekesi] The government coalition displays an aversion to us  and accuses us of everything because it clearly realized that a  considerable part of our society finds the leading energies in  the MSZP. It is, therefore, clear to the coalition parties that  the MSZP represents the biggest danger against their desire to  hold on to power. Therefore, nothing is too costly for them,  and they make use of everything, including slander, lies, and  the misinterpretation of achievements.  <H5>  Without Sacred Dogmas </H5>   [Szendrei] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] does not  get closer to you either; on the contrary: Viktor Orban sent  you a message in the press according to which the MSZP is facing  34 years of opposition.    [Bekesi] The liberals, who generally follow the same goals  as we do, see us as a rival whose success at the elections would  lead to its predominance in a potential coalition.    [Szendrei] Would you accept this coalition?    [Bekesi] Why would we discard it? Let us stay with the idea  that the liberals fear that we, the socialists, could gain the  upper hand in the government. However, a social-liberal  coalition is the real solution in Hungary. They can only  envisage such a coalition if the MSZP can only get a subordinate  role. This is their interest.    [Szendrei] After all, no matter how we look at it, the MSZP  suffered a defeat four years ago. The hope for a comeback is  only natural.    [Bekesi] There are no revanchist emotions or hopes involved  here. The accusation that we are a successor party preparing  for the restoration of the old ways is totally unfounded. We  are preparing for restructuring, and not for the restoration of  the milder phase of the Kadar regime.    [Szendrei] Apart from rejecting the accusations, how else  can the MSZP get rid of the labels of the past?    [Bekesi] Of course, we know that rejecting accusations is  not enough. It also transpires from our program that the MSZP  is a pragmatic party definitely in favor of modernization, a  party that does not stand on ideological bases, and a party that  offers recipes for solving the current Hungarian social and  economic problems. In addition, to the extent our economic  scope allows it, we are also trying to represent classic  left-wing values, like solidarity, the reduction of inequalities  of chances, and help for fallen strata.    [Szendrei] These words coming from socialists make us recall  the empty dogma of the past.    [Bekesi] I use the aforementioned expressions without fear,  because we are definitely not thinking about these values on the  level of dogma. The MSZP is not based on an ideology equivalent  to the program of the German social democrats in the sixties.  We are far rather following the Scharping-thinking  characteristic of Western Europe at the end of the 20th century,  a reasoning according to which nothing dogmatic is sacred.    [Szendrei] This is how communists became socialists?    [Bekesi] Neither here nor abroad can people claim that this  is some kind of post-communist party with nostalgia, one  strengthening and stressing the social democratic roots of the  19th century.    [Szendrei] However, along with the increasing sympathy, many  people fear that the reviving old political elite is preparing  to violate the democracy emerging in the wake of the first free  elections.    [Bekesi] Such opinions have indeed been voiced. Before  listing our counter-arguments, I must firmly declare that there  can be people among the politically-active public who reject the  left and the MSZP from the outset, but they do not treat the  fears and accusations seriously. Obviously, there is such a  narrow circle of people, but these people can never be convinced  with arguments. They voice their prejudices.    [Szendrei] Let us turn to the concrete counterarguments.    [Bekesi] In other words, we are the camouflaged communists,  the deniers of pluralism and democracy, and even the pioneers of  restoration? If the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] or other  similar parties did nothing else but review the way they gained  power and objectively analyze the period in which the Nemeth  cabinet played the leading role, they could read from this the  refutal of all the accusations. If they came to an objective  conclusion, they would see that it was the post-communist Nemeth  cabinet, and not they and the opposition at the time, that laid  the basic pillars of democratic restructuring, including the  legal, constitutional, and economic pillars. If they took a  look at the system of institutions that emerged between 1988 and  1990, institutions that shaped the bases of market economy, they  would not continue to be suspicious regarding the sincerity of  our decision to change the regime. We formed a two-tier banking  system, reduced the budget, liberalized the imports, reduced the  subsidies, reduced the political expenses, started the  privatization, legislated laws regulating the enterprises,  created the stock exchange, and so on.... I cannot list  everything now. It is rather difficult to call all this an  attempt of the post-communist Nemeth cabinet to preserve the  existing and discredited socialism. One can calmly examine the  past four years. It transpires from this that the legislative  proposals of the MSZP, its parliamentary motions, its attitude,  and now its program have always been directed at accelerating  the process that has begun, rather than slowing or reversing it.  If you find a single element in our program that refers to  restoring old ways rather than accelerating the conclusion of  the process of restructuring, then there is sense in arguing.  Otherwise, all that remains is the labelling, something that is  not taken seriously anywhere.    [Szendrei] In other words, this is the Socialist Party that  wants to build capitalism and not socialism. Who will lead the  party? The first three places on the party's list are occupied  by former members of the MSZMP Central Committee.    [Bekesi] Our program is European. Two out of the three  members of the national list were members of the aforementioned  Nemeth government. Despite the accusations hurled against him,  it would be difficult to say that Gyula Horn was not one of the  driving forces of restructuring. Of course, there are also  historical lies, but one can also find facts in history. A  considerable stratum of young professionals has emerged in the  party and its surrounding in the past three years, people who  are indeed less known. But every opposition party received  little coverage in the media and, thus, new faces find it more  difficult to become known.  <H5>  Mistaken Indicators </H5>   [Szendrei] We have not yet spoken about the third member of  the socialist troika, namely Sandor Nagy. A liberal economic  policy with trade union support? Some Western-European  governments have already failed in this. What will the trade  union leaders do if the citizens demonstrate and strike against  government measures?    [Bekesi] First of all, let us clarify the permanent  attributes. The Hungarian economy is struggling with a deep  crisis. We have no right or reason whatsoever to provide  liberal, social, or conservative labels to the realistic  economic policy capable of treating this economic situation. It  is either a realistic policy spiced with any ideological  elements, or it is unrealistic, and then we can call it by any  name. According to my experience, there are not even slight  differences between the party programs formulated after a  serious analysis; at most, there are differences in phraseology  and technical solutions. However, the guidelines are the same  in the economic programs of the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz], or the MSZP alike. I see more decisive  differences among the ideological parties. However, I must  point out that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is also  beginning to become more realistic, precisely as a result of its  government experience. Therefore, every labelling is mistaken.    [Szendrei] What about the cooperation with the trade unions?  They are good in order to obtain power, but it is better for  them to remain in the background in the governing activity.    [Bekesi] The MSZP has never claimed that the political  agreement signed with the trade unions will guarantee a  government free of arguments if the socialists participate in  the coalition. No one believed even for a moment that the  implementation of our economic policy program will not find some  opposition points with the trade unions. There will be tough  debates. The socialists do not want a trade union government.  We cannot allow the trade unions to suppress a rational  economic policy in the direction of distribution. However, we  must add that the inevitable difficult steps will not succeed  without a new social agreement. We, who regard the trade unions  as our partners, have more chances than others.    [Szendrei] Hopefully Sandor Nagy will not become labor  affairs minister....    [Bekesi] You must be kidding. This is impossible. If any  trade union leader accepts a position in Parliament or in the  government, he will naturally resign from his trade union  position. These two positions are incompatible. Besides, trade  union leaders work in the parliaments of every European  democracy.    [Szendrei] Thus, the employees' representatives can clearly  see what they can count on. What can the employers hope for?  Superficial readers of the program fear that the socialists want  to introduce the property tax.    [Bekesi] Nothing like that. We are not talking about a  property tax; we are talking about taxing the increase in  property. This is something totally different. On the other  hand, our program contains the elimination of the minimum tax,  the restoration of tax benefits for investments, the elimination  of tax on the interests of accounts that encourage savings, both  forint and hard currency accounts. We are the only ones to say  that investment benefits should also be extended to  amortization. It is our goal to return the general turnover tax  in order to increase housing construction. We say that the  share of income and profit taxes should be reduced in the entire  tax system. In other words, we would gradually reduce the  company and personal income taxes. On the other hand, however,  we would tax the final consumption and property increase. This  means the inheritance tax on non-productive accumulated luxury  property. We would not tax the active property.    [Szendrei] The elections are approaching, and then the  formation of a government. The socialists met with Miklos  Nemeth. The congress in not preparing to name the candidate for  prime minister either. Among the rumors, it emerged that your  party would accept Gabor Kuncze as prime minister. Your name  has also been mentioned. Has the time come to clarify the issue?    [Bekesi] The essential thing is that the socialists are  concentrating on solving the tasks in the election campaign, and  not on distributing the future government positions and  nominating the people. Only a coalition government can emerge  in Hungary. We can envisage several variations. Therefore, we  cannot name a candidate for the position of prime minister now.  With this, we would considerably limit the chances of coalition  talks. Miklos Nemeth has indeed been considered. He rejected  the nomination because of his work in London, and thus we took  this issue off the agenda. About Gabor Kuncze I can say that we  indeed see the future in the form of a social-liberal coalition.  Our programs also match. We say that we need a government that  knows its job. Thus, we do not find it impossible to have the  politician of a smaller party that wins the election become  prime minister. Therefore, we will ask this congress to decide  on this matter at a special congress after the elections.    [Szendrei] In such a moment, what would you say if they  asked you to become prime minister?    [Bekesi] This is an academic question.... There could be  such a constellation.    [Szendrei] Would you accept the position?    [Bekesi] A lot of conditions must be fulfilled in order to  say yes, but such a possibility cannot be excluded.</p>

Andre Maniani has the details:    [Maniani] The Beninese security forces made every effort to  disperse the demonstrators, therefore the huge general assembly  planned by the students at the Cotonou Trade Fair Center could  not be held. Nonetheless, thousands of students circulated  throughout Cotonou in buses chanting (?antigovernment) slogans.    The Beninese students are protesting the new decree whose  contents fix the conditions for obtaining scholarships and  allowances. According to Article 12 of the decree, scholarships  are awarded to the most deserving students, to those who  qualify, and to those who have the right connections. Students  are demonstrating against the decree. According to the  students, a close reading of the decree leaves one frustrated at  the fact that Nicephore Soglo's regime is trying to block the  way of knowledge to the most destitute. Scholarships that were  automatically awarded to students in the third year of the  university first cycle can no longer be awarded if one's average  grade falls below 11.51.    The other motives for this abortive general assembly include  working conditions, student residences, the quality of lectures,  and the longstanding problem of public transportation. Despite  the intervention of the security forces, thousands of students  went to the venue of the general assembly at the Cotonou Trade  Fair Center and swore to plan another meeting in the coming days.    In any case, Nicephore Soglo's regime is far from being out  of the woods.</p>

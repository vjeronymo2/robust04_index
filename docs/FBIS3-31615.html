The Russian foreign minister will be visiting  Krakow, where he will meet Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski.    The talks between the two ministers will be dominated by  political issues. The Polish side expects Kozyrev to present a  new concept of relations between Russia and the states of  east-central Europe. Moreover, the ministers will exchange  views on the subject of European security and present their  positions on cooperation with NATO, including "Partnership for  Peace." Bilateral economic contacts will also be discussed.    According to officials of the Polish MSZ [Foreign Ministry],  regarding bilateral issues the two sides are likely to seek  forms of political and economic cooperation in spite of the  existing differences on individual issues.    One of the problems in Polish-Russian relations is an  impasse  in talks on settling the status of the Vistula Lagoon. Russia  regards the lagoon as part of its internal waters, whereas  Poland is demanding that it be designated as open sea, which  would make shipping easier and facilitate the development of the  town of Frombork as a sea harbor.    An important unresolved issue is also the continued fishing  of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk. Some Russian deputies, as  well as ministers, are demanding that fishing ships flying  foreign flags be withdrawn from the so-called open area of the  Sea of Okhotsk, that is, from international waters. Among other  things they are demanding is that the 1987 fishing agreement  with Poland be broken off.    During Kozyrev's visit a Polish-Russian agreement will be  signed on graves and sites of remembrance. Under the agreement,  each sides will, among other things, finance the protection in  their own country of sites commemorating deaths of the other  country's citizens.    On 23 February the foreign ministers will take part along  with politicians and academics in the opening of a three-day  Polish-Russian conference entitled "Toward a New Partnership."</p>

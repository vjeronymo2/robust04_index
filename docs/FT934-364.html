			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Hints of progress at Cairo talks Israeli and Palestinian negotiators hinted last night they were making progress in their Cairo talks searching for a formula to unblock the Mideast peace process and begin implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 'The talks went very well,' according to Mr Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation team. An Israeli official said: 'They have moved to the stage of wording but it still remains to be seen if the wording will be final.' At one stage Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa joined the discussions between the PLO and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The talks, which began on Monday night, are due to resume today. The two sides have been deadlocked over who should control border crossings, as well as over the size of the Jericho area to be handed over to Palestinians and over security for Jewish settlers once Israeli soldiers withdraw. Under the peace accord with the PLO, Israel was to have begun moving troops out of Gaza-Jericho more than two weeks ago, but deadlock in negotiations has delayed implementation of the agreement. Meanwhile, pro-Iranian guerrillas launched a wave of attacks on Israel's security zone in south Lebanon, just hours after three Israeli air raids killed two guerrillas. Hizbollah fighters firing machineguns, anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs attacked eight positions of Israeli forces and their allied South Lebanon Army militia. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, earlier accused Syria of not doing enough to prevent attacks by Arab guerrillas on Israeli targets in Lebanon. Despite his accusation, there were signs of a thaw in relations between Damascus and Jerusalem ahead of the summit between President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad next month. US officials confirmed that Damascus last week issued the first of 850 exit visas to Syrian Jews agreed last month as a confidence-building measure.</p>

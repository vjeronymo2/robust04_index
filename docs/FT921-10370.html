			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Indonesia 'committed' to E Timor inquiry MR ALI ALATAS, Indonesia's foreign minister, last night reaffirmed his government's commitment to bring to justice all involved in the killing of dozens of civilians by security forces in an East Timor funeral procession clash in November. But he said he did not know if a specially appointed military council would court-martial any of the armed forces involved, nor did he indicate when its investigations would be completed. He pleaded only for the international community not to prejudge the affair. At a press conference in London after meeting Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, he pledged that a United Nations envoy, due to arrive in Jakarta on Sunday, would be given free rein to examine what Mr Alatas described as the 'tragedy'. He gave a detailed breakdown of the numbers of civilians - among them supporters of the island's Fretilin independence movement - whom he said were still being held for their part in allegedly inciting the violence. Of 56 in detention, four were ready to be brought to trial on charges of subversion, to which they had 'readily and proudly confessed'. Twelve others would stand trial on lesser criminal counts, while most or all of the rest were to be released. At their meeting Mr Hurd reiterated Britain's concern over human rights in Indonesia but welcomed the summary report of the Jakarta government's inquiry. The report estimated that 50 died and 90 were still missing, figures which are challenged by independent witnesses as too low. Britain has since resumed its aid programme, and annual discussions on aid between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the former colonial power, are to take place this month as scheduled. New aid from Canada remains suspended, although a spokesman for that government said it too was encouraged by the summary report and Mr Alatas is expected in Ottawa later this month. Mr Alatas last night condemned the cut-off of aid by some countries as 'irrational and maybe counter-productive'. Portugal remains hostile to Indonesia and has accused the government of torturing East Timorese arrested after the November 12 massacre. Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, annexing the territory a year later in a move still unrecognised by the UN. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, this week appointed Mr Amos Waco, Kenya's attorney general, as his special envoy.</p>

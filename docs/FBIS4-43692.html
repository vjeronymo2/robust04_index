			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martino Sees Greater Role for </F> Cultural Policy"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- Italian Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino said here today that he sees a greater role for  cultural affairs in Italian foreign policy.    Addressing a session of the National Committee for the  Promotion of Italian Culture Abroad at the Foreign Ministry, he  said the new policy would strive to give greater stress to  interactions between science, technology, economics, political  science and culture.    According to Martino, in this perspective, the promotion of  culture would be an important factor in lending credibility to  Italian activity on the international stage.    He also said this would mean giving the Foreign Ministry the  appropriate tools and means for achieving the target in which he  said he expects the committee to produce concrete and  appropriate proposals in the very near future.</p>

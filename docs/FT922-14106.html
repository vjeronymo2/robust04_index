			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smith's Budget fails to impress industry chiefs - FT/Mori Poll of Top Company Executives MR John Smith's shadow Budget has not impressed business leaders, according to the second Mori survey of board-level executives for the FT. Only 7 per cent of the 165 executives, taken from a sample of 235 first interviewed at the start of the election campaign, said that Labour's package would be best for business. That compared with the 89 per cent who preferred the package of tax changes announced by Mr Norman Lamont. The executives acknowledge that Labour's proposed 50p top tax rate and abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions has made personal taxation a much more important factor. An overwhelming 72 per cent say that management of the economy is the most important factor (against 71 per cent in March). But the proportion citing personal taxation as a key issue has jumped from 27 per cent to 45 per cent. Twenty-two per cent said that Labour's higher tax rates would mean they were likely to work less hard. But more than double that number - 48 per cent - said they thought that Mr Smith's tax package would reduce work incentives for their middle management. In spite of criticism of his performance during the campaign, Mr Lamont's personal rating among business executives has risen slightly. Some 41 per cent say he would make a better chancellor than Mr Smith, up from 39 per cent in March. Mr Smith's rating has fallen from 46 to 44 per cent. Most discouraging for Labour are the findings that 96 per cent think interest rates would have to rise if Mr Kinnock wins the election; 83 per cent expect downward pressure on the pound; and more than a third (38 per cent) predict a fall in their companies' investment spending in Britain. That represents a hardening of anxieties about a Labour victory during the campaign. In the first interviews, 76 per cent said that interest rates would have to rise, 75 per cent said sterling would weaken and only 26 per cent said their investment would fall. But the executives are distinctly unimpressed by the Tories' handling of their campaign. Only 1 per cent thought the governing party had run the best campaign. Mori/On-line Telephone Surveys interviewed by telephone 165 directors of companies from the FT UK Top 500 on April 6 and 7. All respondents, with 70 others, had been interviewed on March 11 and 12.</p>

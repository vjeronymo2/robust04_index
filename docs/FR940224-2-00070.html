Market participants, as well as regulators, are particularly concerned about current methods for settling multi-currency, cross-border transactions. Data published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) indicate that the daily average value of global foreign exchange market activity was approximately $880 billion in April 1992. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The interbank payments generated by foreign exchange transactions account for a substantial portion of the total value of payments settled in many of the industrialized countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ``Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange Market Activity in April 1992'' published by the Bank for International Settlements, Basle, March 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most significant settlement risks presented by foreign exchange or other multi-currency contracts involve the risk that a counterparty to such contracts will pay one currency and not receive payment in the contra-currency. Concerns about such risks have been prominent since the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974, when foreign exchange counterparties of Herstatt made Deutsche mark payments to Herstatt to settle foreign exchange contracts, but did not receive contra-payments in U.S. dollars before the closure of the bank, which occurred at the end of the German banking day. The settlement risk associated with the sequential payment of currencies, and involving the potential loss of the full principal amount of foreign exchange contracts, has come to be known as Herstatt risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the rapid growth of the foreign exchange markets since 1974, foreign exchange contracts are currently settled much as they were at the time of the Herstatt episode. For example, in the case of yen-U.S. dollar foreign exchange contracts, the yen amounts due on a particular banking day would be paid and settled in Tokyo before the start of that banking day in New York. U.S. dollar contra-payments would likely be initiated early in the U.S. banking day and settled with finality at the end of the U.S. banking day, some 18 hours after the close of business in Tokyo. Similarly, payments in most European currencies would be made and settled hours before U.S. dollar payments are either initiated or settled with finality. The overall magnitude of Herstatt risks associated with these settlement delays has grown commensurately with the rapid growth in foreign exchange and other multi-currency transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the past few years, there has been a series of central bank studies aimed at heightening the understanding and awareness of risks in various international payment and settlement processes. These studies have also provided a common framework for evaluating both new and enhanced interbank settlement arrangements, as well as changes in central bank services, that might be designed to reduce and manage better Herstatt risk. Working groups from the G&hyph;10 central banks have published reports, under the aegis of the BIS, on such topics as minimum standards for interbank netting systems, delivery-versus-payment (DVP) in securities settlement systems, and options for enhanced central bank payment and settlement services with respect to multi-currency and cross-border transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Report on Netting Schemes, February 1989; Report of the Committee on Interbank Netting Schemes of the Central Banks of the Group of Ten Countries, November 1990; Delivery Versus Payment in Securities Settlement Systems, September 1992; Central Bank Payment and Settlement Services With Respect to Cross-Border and Multi-Currency Transactions, September 1993. These reports are available through the Bank for International Settlements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recent report on central bank services, for example, pointed to the significant expansion of the operating hours for large-value payment systems as an important central bank option that could contribute to reductions in risk in settlement practices. Longer hours for central bank large-value payment systems would provide the banking sector <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with additional flexibility in developing innovative methods to reduce time delays between the settlement of the different legs of foreign exchange contracts. Such innovations might include the development of delivery-versus-payment techniques, in which one currency is paid (settled) when and only when the contra-currency is also paid (settled), either by individual correspondent banks or by groups of banks that are members of clearing arrangements. Over the long run, such arrangements could substantially reduce Herstatt risks in the settlement of multi-currency contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For discussion purposes only, references to bank include all depository institutions, such as commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions. As used in this docket, the term private-sector bank means any bank (including a Federal Home Loan Bank) other than a Federal Reserve Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even without the development of delivery-versus-payment techniques, the possibility of greater harmonization of the timing of currency settlements based on longer operating hours of central bank large-value payment systems could help reduce time delays and risks in settlements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Significant advances in information technology have been introduced to banking and financial markets in recent years. The level of automation and sophistication of banking systems has increased rapidly and likely will continue to do so for some time to come. In this environment, and particularly during a time of increasing volumes, values, and sophistication of financial transactions, advanced technology needs to be applied to payment systems so that these systems can provide for both high efficiency and low risk in the settlement of all kinds of economic transactions. The adoption and implementation of this kind of technology, however, requires significant lead times and careful, advanced planning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dh. M.] </F>   [Text] Commenting on a statement by Albanian President Sali  Berisha that his country's openness to dialogue is a message of  goodwill, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said he hopes  Greek-Albanian relations will cool off.    However, the Greek Government continues to expect a lot from  the U.S. stance and the pressure that it is in a position to  exert on Tirana. In a letter to his U.S. counterpart Warren  Christopher, the Greek foreign minister asks that the United  States intervene immediately to create the conditions that will  allow Greece and Albania to come to the negotiating table. In  his letter, the Greek minister notes that the Albanian economy  essentially depends on remittances by the 400,000 Albanian  citizens who live and work, legally or illegally, in Greece.  Papoulias asks the U.S. secretary to remind the Albanian  Government of this fact and suggest to it that it move away from  issues that create tension between the two countries, so that  the way can be opened for a new approach.    At the same time, the Greek Government is trying to involve  the European Union [EU] in the issue of Greek-Albanian  relations. Of course, this will happen if the EU supports the  Greek positions on the violation of the Greek minority's human  rights. The Greek minister said: "In any case, the government  is determined to take drastic measures to deal with the  situation."    The Greek Government is in a hurry to ease the tension in  Greek-Albanian relations, and not just because of the dangers to  peace in the entire region. According to safe information, the  Greek Government is concerned about the outcome of a possible  trial for the six arrested members of the minority group  Omonoia. According to the same information, the Greek  Government is concerned about the possibility that the Albanian  charges against some of the six will be proved either with  existing or fabricated evidence. Indicative of the Greek  Government's "embarrassment" is government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos' answer when asked if it is possible for a  Greek-Albanian dialogue to begin when Albania insists on trying  the six. Venizelos gave an ambiguous answer: "The Greek  positions on protection of human rights and the rights of the  Greek Albanians have been given."    The spokesman's answer reflects the Greek Government's  dilemma, whether or not to pursue a political settlement of this  issue. The views on this are split but many believe that the  issue must close as soon as possible through political moves.  Some diplomatic and government officials agree that if there is  no trial, the Greek side will have to face the Albanian charges  for the activity of some Omonoia members and the international  community's suspicion. According to the second view, which is  gaining ground, the Greek Government will lower its tones and  let the initiative move to the Albanian Government. If Tirana  proceeds with a trial, then Athens will condemn the procedure as  a fabrication.... [ellipsis as published]</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Ministers relent on town hall tendering MINISTERS are preparing to soften their approach to extending compulsory competitive tendering to local authority white-collar services because of the difficulty in devising a sensible way of taking account of the quality of work. The move will mark an abandonment of the scheme set out in a government consultation paper last year, which proposed a 'quality threshold' for tendering in areas such as architectural and engineering services. That suggestion came in for widespread criticism, not least from the relevant professional organisations. Officials now argue that while these services should still be subject to compulsory tendering, the government should not attempt to impose a 'straitjacket' on how local authorities carry out the process. 'We are moving to a less dirigiste policy,' one Whitehall insider said yesterday. The original proposal was a 'double envelope' system, under which unpriced tenders were initially considered against a pre-set quality threshold, followed by a further evaluation, so the lowest-priced tender was automatically accepted from those meeting or exceeding the threshold. Ministers are keen that the step back from specifying how quality should be addressed should not be seen as diluting their commitment to extending competitive tendering. They are determined that April 1994 will remain the date after which any new work will be carried out by in-house staff only if it has been won in competition. In private, however, officials admit that, unless the government insists on a detailed procedure, the scope for a council which does not want to contract out professional services to continue to award work to in-house tenders is so great that much of the policy's impact will be lost. The Department of the Environment has already experienced similar problems with the introduction of compulsory tendering to blue-collar services, where standards are easier to define. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will announce the revised approach early next month, when MPs have their first chance to debate the bill dealing with housing reforms and setting up the urban regeneration agency. The legislation includes the extension of tendering to local councils' housing management, which will not be affected by this shift of emphasis.</p>

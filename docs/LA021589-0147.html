Final  </P> <P> ARTS;  </P> <P> THREAT CLOSES BEIJING ART EXHIBIT  </P> <P> A major exhibition of avant-garde art, which opened amid controversy last week,  was closed for a second time today after an anonymous letter writer threatened  to blow up the gallery, artists said.  </P> <P> Police barred the entrance to the prestigious China Art Gallery in central  Beijing and authorities posted a sign saying the show was closed for two days  for security reasons. The exhibition of pieces satirical, sexual and strange  opened with a bang Feb. 5 when a woman pulled out a small pistol and fired two  bullets into her work -- two glass telephone booths -- as an expression of  "action art."  </P></p>

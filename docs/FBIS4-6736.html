			<p>BFN     [Text] The government sent a telephone message to North  Korea this morning, objecting to North Korea's call for the  repatriation of long-term prisoners who refused converting from  communism. It has, however, urged North Korea to repatriate  figures who were kidnapped to North Korea and to resume talks  between the North and South Red Cross societies.    This morning, the government sent the telephone message to  Yi  Song-ho, acting chairman of the North Korean Red Cross Society  Central Committee, in the name of Kang Yong-hun, president of  the Korea National Red Cross, and stressed: Because Mr. Kim  In-so--whom North Korea asked on 19 April to be repatriated to  the North as a long-term prisoner because he refused to convert  from communism-- acquired the ROK nationality on his free will,  is no longer a prisoner of war. If North Korea is interested in  the humanitarian issue, it should take practical steps to  resolve the separated family matter.    In today's message, the government said that the reason no  progress had been made in the settlement of the separated family  issue is because of the North side's failure to implement an  agreement reached between the North and South and demanded that,  based on the spirit of the Red Cross Society, the North side  repatriate approximately 440 persons -- who were kidnaped to the  North -- including Tongjin Ho sailors, as soon as possible, and  that it immediately resume the suspended Red Cross talks.</p>

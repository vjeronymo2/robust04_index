			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR HELPING BOYFRIEND IN KILLING  </P> <P> Cynthia Lynn Coffman, who said she helped her boyfriend kill two young women in  a five-day crime rampage, Wednesday became the first woman sentenced to death  in California since the state reinstated capital punishment 12 years ago.  </P> <P> Coffman, 27, sitting eight feet away from co-defendant James Gregory Marlow,  33, tearfully told a San Bernardino County Superior Court judge, "I'm sorry for  what happened and I'm ashamed that I let it happen."  </P> <P> But Judge Don A. Turner, who upheld jury death verdicts for both of them, said  Coffman "was in this thing up to the hilt, and enjoyed it right up to the last  minute."  </P> <P> Coffman, the mother of a 9-year-old son, will be sent to the Correctional  Institution for Women at Frontera. If her appeals, expected to take at least  seven years, are unsuccessful, she would be executed at San Quentin State  Prison, site of the state's only gas chamber.  </P> <P> The last woman executed in California was Elizabeth Ann Duncan, on Aug. 8,  1962, for the murder of her daughter-in-law in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Coffman and Marlow were convicted of first-degree murder five months ago for  the Nov. 7, 1986, slaying of Corinna Novis, 20, of Redlands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Slaying  </P> <P> The two are now scheduled to stand trial in Orange County for the murder of  19-year-old Lynell Murray of Huntington Beach, strangled at an oceanfront  Orange County motel five days after the Novis killing. Details of the Murray  slaying were presented to jurors at the penalty phase of the couple's trial in  San Bernardino.  </P> <P> The two are also under indictment in Whitley City, Ky., for the July 7, 1986,  killing of Gregory Hill, 28. Police believe that was a murder-for-hire.  </P> <P> "It's still very difficult for judges and juries to vote death for an  attractive young woman," Turner said. "But this jury got to know (Coffman) too  well."  </P> <P> Coffman moved to California from Missouri, the judge said, because she found  middle-class married life dull. But when she met Marlow, he said, "the two of  them just clicked."  </P> <P> "For Ms. Coffman, here was a man who was thrilling, who was exciting, who was  dangerous," Turner said.  </P> <P> Marlow and Coffman had once been lovers -- she has "Property of Folsom Wolf,"  his nickname, tattooed on her bottom. But by the time of the trial, they were  enemies. They asked for separate trials, which the judge refused.  </P> <P> Coffman testified that she was under Marlow's domination during the two-county  murder binge. She told jurors that Marlow had raped her, beat her, and cut off  all her hair. He once told her, she said, 'I am the devil, and I own you.' "  </P> <P> She said she believed Marlow intended only to kidnap and rob Novis, not kill  her. After the two kidnaped Murray at a Huntington Beach cleaning store where  she worked, Coffman said, she helped twist a towel around the victim's neck in  the motel room. She said, however, that Marlow forced her to do it.  </P> <P> But prosecutors in both San Bernardino and Orange counties said that while  Marlow may have been the actual killer, Coffman was equally responsible.  </P></p>

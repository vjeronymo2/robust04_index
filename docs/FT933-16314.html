			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / France wants world ban on nuclear tests FRANCE yesterday responded to President Bill Clinton's decision to suspend US nuclear testing by calling for a global ban on tests. A statement from President Francois Mitterrand's office said France was 'in favour of a treaty banning tests completely providing it is universal and verifiable'. The French have not carried out any nuclear tests since the former Socialist government suspended them in April last year. However, nuclear planners are seeking a series of tests on two new submarine-launched weapons, the M45 and M5. French tests are undertaken at Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific. In addition, prime minister Edouard Balladur has come under pressure from right-wing members of his centre-right coalition government to resume testing. The National Assembly finance committee last week approved a paper calling for the resumption of tests. Mr Balladur yesterday said on French television that he was 'in complete agreement' with Mr Mitterrand. He said he and Mr Mitterrand planned to 'put our minds at rest' by forming a group of military and scientific experts to ensure that France's nuclear deterrent did not suffer as a result of the suspension of tests. British ministers say the UK can 'live with' a US test ban as long as it receives assistance in computer simulation techniques to replace live tests. The UK has to follow Washington's policy, since it relies on the US test site in Nevada. The UK Ministry of Defence said it had no plans to test elsewhere and would seek further consultations with the US. British planners are believed to want tests to update the WE-177 gravity bomb, which will have to stay in service beyond the end of the century, and to perfect safety features on the UK warhead for the Trident submarine-launched missile. However, the main programme of Trident warhead tests is complete. Limited further testing need not prejudice progress towards a comprehensive test ban treaty, the ministry said. Britain has recently taken a more positive stance towards a complete ban, after previously only paying lip service to the idea as a 'long-term objective'. In the US Mr Sig Hecker, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, made clear he had wanted to carry on testing right up to the implementation of a comprehensive test ban. 'We would have preferred more time to prepare for the test ban,' he said. The nuclear laboratories have argued that they needed more tests to improve the safety of the US's nuclear arsenal. After a divisive debate in the administration, pitting the Pentagon, the State Department and the nuclear weapons laboratories against the Energy Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the White House had initially come down in favour of nine further tests - three of which would have been British - in the next three years. Mr Clinton's ultimate decision to extend the moratorium on tests, unless another nation resumes testing, reflects belated recognition of the political reality that both the House of Representatives and, more surprisingly, the Senate remained solidly opposed to more tests. The decision to extend the moratorium will, however, provide comfort to Russia, whose Foreign Ministry on Friday called for urgent discussions 'to achieve a verifiable international agreement that will totally ban nuclear testing'.</p>

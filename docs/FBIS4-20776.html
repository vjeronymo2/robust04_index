			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "A Historic Resolution"] </F>   [Text] History was written into the proceedings of  Parliament when the two Houses unanimously passed a resolution  reiterating the people's resolve to resist any attempts to  separate Jammu and Kashmir from the rest of the country and  condemning strongly the continued abetment and encouragement  Pakistan was extending to subversive and terrorist activities in  the State. In a rare exhibition of unanimity, members of  Parliament belonging to various parties and groups had  unequivocally and in the strongest terms told Pakistan that any  attempt from any quarter to interfere in the internal affairs of  India would be met resolutely. Coming at a time when Pakistan is  trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue knowing full well  that it was violating the Shimla agreement both in word and  spirit and resolution adopted by Parliament should convince the  outside world that Pakistan's anti-India campaign was going to  achieve little.    The resolution also highlights the fact that sophisticated  weapons were being supplied by Pakistan to the militants in  Jammu and Kashmir and the main objective of the resolution was  to expose this before the world. Pakistan must now understand  that everyone in India knows for certain that it is the  unconcealed sponsor of the armed struggle in Kashmir and all its  efforts to grab the State by providing material help to the  insurgents occasionally covering up its tracks if only to  mislead the international community when it comes close to  questioning the extent of involvement will come to nought. A few  thousand mercenaries let loose by Pakistan can no doubt create  havoc but to think that they can pin down a large Army and a  determined people who are prepared to resist efforts to  destabilise the State is nothing but foolish. Unfortunately the  pro-Pakistani fighters have extended their area of operations to  newer districts of Jammu and the administration which is engaged  in tackling them has already registered some notable successes.    While the rise in the armed capabilities of the more extreme  groups is essentially due to the lavish Pakistani sponsorship,  Islamabad is never tired of talking about the violation of human  rights in the sensitive State in order to divert the attention  of the world community from reality. The Armed Forces and the  paramilitary outfits dealing with an unrelenting enemy which is  responsible for swelling the ranks of the fanatical militants  have been showing tremendous restraint even if there have been  occasional aberrations but to say there has been a largescale  violation of human rights in the Indian State of Jammu and  Kashmir is a travesty of truth. That much was proved during the  recent visit to the State of four European envoys who reported  that militancy was getting support from across the border. India  must also resort to an effective campaign against Pakistan which  is indulging in an intensive diplomatic offensive coupled with  the instigation of more violence in the Valley with the sole  objective of bringing the Kashmir situation back to the world's  attention. Of course, Pakistan's domestic compulsions are also  involved in its efforts to whip up anti-Indian feelings. Some  of the revelations made by repentant militants about being  ill-treated in Pakistani training camps must have opened the  eyes of those who took to arms in a fit of misguided zeal. Now  that the national consensus on Kashmir is very clear it should  be obvious to Pakistan that it is well nigh impossible to even  seek to dictate the agenda by remote control. It is now for New  Delhi to evolve a game plan on Kashmir that enables it to win  the battle for the hearts and minds of the people and brings  into being a truly democratic structure to replace what looks  like an embittered and traumatised security  apparatus.</p>

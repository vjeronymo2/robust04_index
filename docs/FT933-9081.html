			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Indonesia ponders US trade warnings INDONESIAN economic and trade ministers met yesterday to discuss threats to trading privileges with the US following criticism of Jakarta's treatment of workers, Reuter reports from Jakarta. 'This is an old issue in bilateral trade with the US. We faced this issue in the previous cabinet and so far we have been able to settle it well,' Mr Saleh Ariff, co-ordinating minister for economics, told reporters before the meeting. 'However, it (the criticism) is indeed getting sharper.' Washington has threatened to cut imports at preferential tax rates under the Generalised System of Preferences if Indonesia does not improve labour practices. Fourteen per cent of Indonesian exports to the US, worth Dollars 600m (Pounds 402.6m), qualified for tax concessions last year. Mr Tungky Ariwibowo, the industry minister quoted by the official Antara news agency, said on Tuesday that Indonesia would strive to maintain the system. 'We should solve the GSP facility problems as soon as possible.' Washington criticised Indonesia for barring the country's largest independent trade union, the Indonesia Welfare Labour Union, from holding its first congress late last month. Indonesia has also come under increased US criticism on human rights. The US State Department cited human rights concerns last week when it blocked the sale to Indonesia of four ageing American-built F-5E fighter jets from Jordan. Indonesian State Secretary Murdiono said on Tuesday the government would explain its position on human rights to Washington. 'I hope the problem can be solved,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A joint statement was issued and a meeting between  President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic was announced in  Vienna at the talks between Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegovina  delegations, headed by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Jozo Curic reports from  Vienna.    [Curic] Minister Granic and Prime Minister Silajdzic are  holding talks with co-chairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. At around  1300 [1200 GMT] the two delegations ended this round of talks  which was held in preparation for the Geneva conference  scheduled for 18 January. Both sides accepted a peaceful  political resolution of the crisis. The talks were constructive  despite a difficult situation on the ground. Both sides  acknowledged the situation and the danger of a wider escalation  of the conflict. Croatia firmly insists on Neum and is against  [granting the Muslims] access to the sea near Prevlaka [on  Croatian-Montenegrin border], which the co-chairmen proposed.    A joint statement was coordinated and issued. Both sides  confirmed that an urgent cease-fire, a permanent cessation of  hostilities, and a permanent normalization of relations between  the Croat and Bosniak [Muslim] peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  including territorial, political, humanitarian and other aspects  of a permanent resolution, were in the long-term and strategic  interest of both peoples and the two states. In light of this,  it was agreed that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and  President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic should  meet in Bonn on Saturday 8 January 1994. Special attention at  the talks was devoted to the need to fully and consistently  respect previous cease-fire agreements, particularly because of  the situation in central Bosnia. The two sides confirmed that  in preparing for the summit, efforts would be made to prepare a  comprehensive plan for implementing the cease-fire along the  entire front line and ending all combat operations, in order to  create conditions for a permanent cessation of hostilities, the  protection of the population and the implementation of  confidence-building measures, the joint statement says.    Both sides confirmed that the disputes on territorial  demarcation should be resolved only by peaceful, political means  without the use of force and in accordance with the Sarajevo  declaration dated 12 November 1993. As far as humanitarian  issues are concerned, it was agreed that a commission for  humanitarian issues should meet on Friday 7 January, to reach an  agreement on free movement of humanitarian convoys, including  discussion on establishing new routes as well as securing the  evacuation of the wounded and providing permanent supplies for  hospitals. It was agreed to provide all necessary guarantees  and documents for free passage of a field hospital for the  eastern [Muslim-held] port of Mostar by Thursday 6 January. It  was also agreed that the commission for exchange of prisoners  should meet on Tuesday 11 January. A meeting of the Mostar  commission should be held on Friday 7 January in the  headquarters of UNPROFOR's Spanish battalion in Medjugorje, to  prepare a program of the revitalization of Mostar and the return  of citizens of Mostar to their city, in keeping with agreements  reached at the last round of negotiations in Brussels. The  agreement on the establishment of a free port zone in Ploce was  confirmed.    We should also mention that for the first time proposals  were  put forward for the bilateral demarcation of the two republics  [Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia]. The proposals are different but they  represent a basis for more concrete talks. The Muslims have  demanded sovereignty near Neum and the Croats have firmly  rejected this. There are areas about which the two sides could  negotiate bilaterally, without the third side. A meeting with  the co-chairmen, Owen and Stoltenberg, is in progress.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 11 (CTK) -- The lustration  [screening] law in Slovakia should be amended so that it  corresponds to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms,  Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik told  CTK today. The greatest shortcoming of the law was that it did  not respect the need for the court protection of citizens who  were unjustly accused of having collaborated with the former  Communist secret police (StB), Ftacnik said.    "International institutions also blamed us because the law  does not set down the possibility of court protection," he said.  Many of the people who received a positive lustration  certificate appealed to the court and were vindicated, he added.    The lustration or screening law, which was passed by the  now-defunct Czechoslovak federal parliament in 1991 and assumed  by its two successor states -- the Czech and Slovak republics  after Czechoslovakia's division in 1993, bars former Communist  Party officials, StB agents and collaborators, and People's  Militia members from high economic and political posts until  1996.    The problem of lustration in Slovakia became urgent after  information leaked out to the public that one of the ministers  in the current Slovak cabinet of Premier Jozef Moravcik had  failed the screening process. According to the Slovak press,  Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi who was nominated to the  cabinet by the SDL may be having problems with the screening.  Magvasi, however, in an interview with CTK denied his alleged  cooperation with StB.    The former Slovak Government of Vladimir Meciar requested  the  Slovak Constitutional Court in the middle of January to start  investigations into allegedly major discrepancies between the  screening law and the Slovak Constitution. The Constitutional  Court, however, rejected the request on May 10, arguing that it  declined to deal with the proposal of government which had  subsequently fallen, since the court had already made a decision  on the matter once.    The lustration law in Slovakia remains valid, although no  official body has been empowered with issuing lustration  certificates. Under the regulation of Meciar's cabinet the  Slovak Information Service (SIS) has thus far been dealing with  the issue, however the regulations became invalid nine months  after the division of the federation. A law should have been  then passed to establish a body for carrying out lustration but  such a law had not been passed. Therefore there is no body to  implement the screening of Moravcik's government members as  Moravcik had asked shortly after the new government was  appointed. The coalition parties are considering amending the  law on the SIS to empower it to issue lustration certificates.    Ftacnik told CTK that the Coalition Council did not reach  any  decision on the issue at its meeting today. He said that  Meciar's government had a bill ready last September which would  have also specified the body responsible for lustration. "The  bill was then withdrawn but for which reasons -- that is not a  question for me," he said.</p>

Martynov; place and date not given; fron the "Vesti" newscast  -- recorded]    [Text] [Martynov] What was the aim of your visit to  Yugoslavia, the territory of the former Yugoslavia, today?    [Churkin] It was very simple: to prevent the renowned air  strikes around Sarajevo.    [Martynov] What do you think, can Russia really prevent the  bombing of the Serb positions and, more generally, the bombing  of Bosnia by NATO forces?    [Churkin] All of our efforts are directed toward this, but I  would like to stress the following, that we have a dual task. I  have tried to underline this. Although the prevention of air  strikes is important, the lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo is  important too, because we really can no longer tolerate what has  been happening around this city for almost two years now. We  were perhaps even the first to state after the well-known,  tragic events in Sarajevo on 5 February that it there should be  agreement during the next few days, that this task, the lifting  of the blockade on the city, should be carried out.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SINGAPORE'S PREMIER SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AT END OF 1990  </P> <P> Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who turned a colonial backwater into a modern  industrial giant, announced Sunday that he will step down from the post he has  held for 30 years before the end of 1990.  </P> <P> In his New Year's message, the 66-year-old Lee said First Deputy Prime Minister  Goh Chok Tong will be his successor, ending speculation that he would  immediately pass the post on to his son, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien  Loong.  </P> <P> Lee, the country's first and only prime minister, has made it clear he is not  retiring but has said in the past that he will become a senior Cabinet  minister.  </P> <P> Western observers expect he will retain veto power on all critical decisions  and leave the day-to-day running of the country up to his handpicked second  generation of leaders, including his 37-year-old son.  </P> <P> Although Goh, 48, has said he expects Lee Hsien Loong to eventually follow him  in the No. 1 job, he ruled out any interim label for himself by making it clear  he expects to run for prime minister in the next election in 1993.  </P> <P> Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in control from the time Singapore achieved  self-rule in 1959 and full independence from Britain in 1965, said the country  of 2.6 million residents "enters the 1990s with its people and leaders  confident that they have pulled together when the going got rough, and can do  so again."  </P> <P> "For Asia and the Pacific, a sound relationship between America and Japan is  crucial to stability and growth," Lee said. He noted this "may be more  difficult in the future without a common threat from the Soviet Bloc," which  has been swept by democratic reforms.  </P> <P> He exhorted his countrymen to "let the 1990s be the decade when Singapore comes  of age as a developed country."  </P> <P> "It has been a decade of self-renewal," Lee said of the 1980s. "A new  generation has assumed leadership positions in the Cabinet, Parliament and the  public service.  </P> <P> "Before the end of 1990, Goh Chok Tong will take over as prime minister," Lee  said, in his most explicit statement yet about relinquishing the prime  ministry.  </P> <P> Skeptics, however, recalled that five years ago, Lee indicated he would retire  at 65.  </P></p>

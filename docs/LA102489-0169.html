			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SEARS ANNOUNCES 15.6% DROP IN PROFITS FOR THIRD QUARTER  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. today announced a 15.6% drop in its third-quarter  profit, reflecting sharply lower income from its retailing and Allstate  Insurance Co. operations.  </P> <P> Allstate's earnings were hit hard by damage claims after Hurricane Hugo. The  hurricane, which battered the southeastern U.S. coast, caused the largest  single storm-damage loss in Allstate's history, Sears said.  </P> <P> Sears reported net income of $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, for the three  months ended Sept. 30, contrasted with $305 million, or 80 cents a share, in  the same period a year earlier.  </P></p>

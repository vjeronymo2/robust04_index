			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Moscow set for tough battle over budget A draft of Russia's 1994 budget, aimed at bringing monthly inflation down to less than 10 per cent by the end of the year, will be submitted to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, today. It is the first step in a difficult budget process during which the proposed deficit is likely to be swollen by additional spending demands. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, said the projected budget deficit was Rbs36,000bn or 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product. Revenues for 1994 are projected at around Rbs114,000bn. 'This is a budget which would enable us to manage inflationary processes in the country,' he said yesterday. 'But I am sceptical that the prime minister will agree to such a budget and his decision is only a first stage.' The budget next has to go to a cabinet meeting, and then to parliament for approval. The version which emerges from this process will provide the first real indication of whether Mr Chernomyrdin can stick to the tough fiscal and monetary policy he says he plans to complement with 'non-monetary methods' to fight inflation. In the absence of significant public sector borrowing, the budget deficit in Russia is financed mostly by the printing of money which has been the main source of double-digit monthly inflation rates. An IMF mission in Moscow at the government's request has not been involved in the preparation of the budget, as some Russian officials had wanted it to be. 'They asked us to come to show that it is business as usual, but they are not ready yet.' The pressures for increased spending - regardless of its impact on inflation  -are tremendous, while the political will to resist these pressures is shakier than ever before. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the reformist acting finance minister, has cut proposed budget expenditure to Rbs150,000bn from the Rbs234,000bn sought by various ministries. But his power to obtain the budget he wants is limited by the lack of political support for fiscal discipline within the new government and from the parliament.</p>

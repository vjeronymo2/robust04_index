"Important changes have been  made at the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry where our  major concern was to appoint civilians just as the old  democracies do... Of course, we have thought also to the  stability and credibility of these institutions... The  appointment of a civilian to head the National Defense Ministry  was also meant to shelter the Armed Forces from political  infringements and ungrounded allegations. The Armed Forces must  remain our main national support, the major trustee of Romania's  territorial integrity," said the Romanian premier.    "The appointment of a civilian as defense minister was not  imposed to us from outside... The council of Europe recommended  it, they did not obligate us to do it... We have followed the  practice in the majority of the democratic countries which have  civilians as defense ministers.    "The new minister of the interior, a lawyer, will monitor  closely the enforcement of the law and, not the least to  mention, will speed-up the pace of the reform of the Interior  Ministry departments... This move has been thought of also in  point of the fight against corruption. We hope that the  finalisation of the reform of the justice would mean another  step forward in the fight against this plague," said Romanian  Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.</p>

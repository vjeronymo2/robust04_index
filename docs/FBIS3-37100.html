			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Negrea article: "Snegur Gives Moscow Reason for </F> Satisfaction"]    [Text] In the final period of the election campaign for  parliamentary elections in the Republic of Moldova, the  conservative, procommunist, and pro-imperial forces, which hold  political and economic power in Chisinau, have intensified their  attack. The recent meeting entitled "Our Home -- the Republic  of Moldova" fulfilled all the functions of former traditional  congresses of the Communist Party by formulating "directives"  and "theses" for the coming period. The anti-Romanian  atmosphere of the proceedings and the anti-unification promoted  by all speakers triggered lively applause in Moscow. Here is  how Radio Moscow and Ostankino Television acclaimed the said  congress: "The participants in the forum condemned the  political forces and media opposing the state's independence and  spread national feuding (...) Moldova's President Mircea Snegur  delivered a profoundly substantiated speech in front of those  present. The ultra-patriotic slogans supported by a number of  parties and movements led to a split not only of the people of  different ethnic origin, but also among the ranks of Moldovans."  And at the end of the report, which apparently is not linked to  what was reported before, but which actually testifies to the  fact that Moscow endorses Chisinau's official stance, it is  emphasized: "The same day (6 February), Russian President Boris  Yeltsin signed an intergovernmental draft accord that  establishes the rules and conditions for the stationing of  Russian troops on the territory of Moldova." Once again this  proves that Snegur's previous statements in connection with the  need for the 14th Army to withdraw were false.    Even the organization of the congress (by the so-called  Civic  Alliance in Chisinau, a formation that was set up recently, and  the Government of the Republic of Moldova) does not differ in  any way from the former measures of defense and security adopted  by the communists. The proceedings were attended by delegations  from several countries, including from former Soviet republics;  Romania was not invited. Access to the congress was very  restricted. The invitations had been issued by state  structures. The same procedure was also in force for most of  the journalists, who, not having the authorities' approval, had  to withdraw when faced by the cordons of policemen. Chisinau  radio and television carried live relays of the congress, so  that the citizens' indoctrination would be more effective. In  practical terms, the speakers respected the electoral platform  of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM] by trying,  first and foremost, to slander the pro-union political forces  and promoting Romania-phobia and an exaggerated, abnormal  Moldovanism.    Adrian Usatai, general director of the national radio  television in Moldova and leader of the Civic Alliance in  Chisinau, went as far as to contest the national ideal of the  country's reintegration, thus questioning -- with sinister  sarcasm -- the supreme sacrifice accepted by Ilie Ilascu: "Mr.  Ilascu, it is one thing to defend the integrity of the Republic  of Moldova in Tiraspol, and another, if you state, in your cage,  that Romania is your homeland. In what capacity were you there  and what was the purpose of being in Tiraspol?"    Not wanting the Republic of Moldova to become "a province or  domain of other countries," Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader,  supports the presidential point of view militating for an  independent Republic of Moldova, eventually united with Moldavia  on this side of the Prut River.    During a recent meeting with the electorate of the Cantemir  Rayon, Motpan said that, after the genuine consolidation of  Moldova's statehood, the PDAM "will proceed to the unification,  but not with the whole of Romania, but merely with Romanian  Moldavia."    Unfortunately, the agrarians are the ones who can most  easily  manipulate public opinion in villages, both at the 27 February  1994 elections and during the so-called sociological referendum  on 6 March 1994, considering that the majority of peasants rely  on the kolkhoz and sovkhoz leaders, who constantly put pressure  on them due to the directives received from the "center."</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs firm The euphoria surrounding the regional electricity stocks since the distribution review by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, gathered pace with many of the front-line broking houses telling their clients that the review provided plenty of upside in the sector. 'We have identified relative winners and losers, but it must be stressed that all the recs are winners under Offer's formula,' said Mr Douglas Falconer at Yamaichi. Kleinwirt Benson said: 'The recs will become rated on a restructuring story as the market realises the hidden value of rec balance sheets and their National Grid holdings. With 10 per cent real dividend growth to 2000 the recs will outperform.' The recs were also boosted by news that BZW, the powerful UK investment bank, and Swiss Bank Corporation had issued call warrants on the sector. BZW issued 15m warrants to subscribe for baskets of recs, comprising Eastern, Midlands, Seeboard and Southern shares. SBC issued 1m warrants for baskets comprising East Midlands, Eastern, London, Midlands, Norweb, Southern and Yorkshire. Among the best performers yesterday was Eastern, which jumped 24 to 763p, with the market still intrigued by the purchase of a near 3 per cent block of shares in a single trade on Wednesday afternoon, which continued to drive suspicions of possible takeover moves in the sector ahead of the lifting of the government's golden share next year. Southern raced up 26 to 740p, Midland jumped 25 1/2 to 756p, South West 25 to 739p and South Wales, 24 to 746p. Seeboard put on 18 to 414p. Water stocks, left far behind the recs recently, staged a powerful rally with some institutions, unable to buy large lines of the recs, shifting into the waters. Severn Trent jumped 8 to 547p, and Anglian 5 1/2 to 537 1/2 p. Rumours in the US that Glaxo was interested in Ely Lilly, the drugs group, helped depress the UK company's shares in London, which closed a penny down at 623p. The Wall Street speculation was putting a Dollars 75 a share price on Lilly's head, its shares advancing Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 3/4 during London hours. Last month, Eli paid Dollars 4bn for PCS, a US drugs distributor. There was a return of rumours that Grand Metropolitan might be looking to sell its stake in IEL, a jointly-owned pub retailing group. Australian-owned brewer Courage was again the name being touted as the most likely candidate to buy the stake, although there were suggestions that management could be involved in buying many of the pubs. Grand Met shares advanced 5 to 434p. Lehman Brothers, the US brokerage, was responsible for the latest upsurge in British Gas shares, hoisting its rating on the stock and revising its earnings estimate for 1996, to take in the benefits of sharply increasing exploration and production profits and the benefits of restructuring. Mr Simon Trimble, Lehman's energy analyst said market fears over the safety of Gas's dividend are unfounded, based on Lehman's forecast of future cash flows, that restructuring will cut costs by Pounds 600m a year and that Gas will respond vigorously to emerging competition in the domestic gas market 'if it is allowed to comptete on an equal basis with new entrants'. Gas shares settled 2 higher at 288p after turnover of 4.6m. Royal Insurance delivered one of the best individual performances in the FT-SE 100 list, the shares advancing 14 more to 279p as the market continued to warm to the excellent interim figures released on Thursday and the good growth prospects. British Aerospace tumbled 13 to 491p on talk that a Japanese airline was seeking to cancel or delay its order for five A340 Airbus aircraft and five options. British Steel succumbed to profit-taking and the shares eased 1 3/4 to 160 1/2 p after trade of 7.2m.</p>

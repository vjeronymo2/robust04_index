			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Chrysler to boost European output CHRYSLER, the US vehicle maker, announced yesterday that Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria is to build up to 47,000 of Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles a year, to meet European demand. The vehicles will be made at the plant in Graz, Austria, where Steyr has been making some 20,000-30,000 Chrysler mini-vans a year since late 1991. The Cherokee production line will start late next year. The move marks a further push into Europe by Chrysler, which unlike its Detroit rivals Ford and GM, has no manufacturing presence in the region. However, Chrysler is keen to expand there to help offset future downturns in the US market. Its European sales jumped 48 per cent to 17,130 vehicles in the third quarter.</p>

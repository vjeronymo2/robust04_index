			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Porsche in DM200m cash call Porsche, the German luxury sports car company, is planning a rights issue which will probably raise about DM200m (Dollars 117m) in cash to help fund the development of its new model range. 'This decision shows that the Porsche and Piech families who own the company remain committed to preserving Porsche as an independent company,' Porsche said. 'With this decision the families also demonstrate that they are convinced of a speedy recovery for the company.' The Stuttgart-based company said that family shareholders (who own all the group's ordinary shares) and outside shareholders (who can buy the group's quoted preference shares) would participate in the issue in equal measure. Porsche said that turnover for the last financial year was DM1.9bn, down from DM2.7bn in the previous year. Full details of the group's earnings situation will be presented next month, but it is thought that Porsche will report a loss of around DM250m for the last financial year. Current-year losses are believed to be running at half of last year's level, and Porsche is unlikely to break even until the 1994-95 business year. In spite of its poor earnings situation, Porsche is a cash-rich company, with about DM650m in net cash before 1992-93 losses are taken into account.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Industry image set for another battering: Employers and ex-sales agents are preparing for battles in the courtroom The arcane phrase 'commission clawback' will soon start reverberating through the courts as part of an extraordinary battle between some of Britain's biggest insurers and hundreds of their former sales agents. At stake are several tens of millions of pounds in lost earnings and fees which an estimated 400 to 1,000 agents claim they are owed by their former companies. In many of these cases the agents have themselves been issued with writs from their former companies, arguing that they should repay large sums of commission paid on insurance policies that have lapsed. The courtroom recriminations - assuming enough cases reach trial rather than being settled privately - are likely further to harm the image of the insurance industry. By concentrating on the often complex and contentious relationship between companies and their sales staffs, the court cases will shed more light on the patchy nature of the controls over sales agents which has been a factor behind recent allegations of mis-selling of life products such as pensions. They may also lead, however unlikely this appears, to a surge of public sympathy for life insurance agents - who are generally portrayed as sharks attempting to extort money out of unsuspecting consumers. Mr Tony Whiteley of the MSF general technical union said: 'A lot of these people are not villains but victims.' The union is co-ordinating legal help for several hundred former agents. In the late 1980s the life industry expanded enormously, taking on tens of thousands of sales agents to sell products such as life insurance and private pensions to cash-rich consumers. However, the recession and tougher regulations introduced by the industry's regulator Lautro, which have raised the quality threshold for sales staff, have encouraged insurers to shed agents. The number of registered agents has shrunk by half since 1990 to about 100,000. Many of the agents who have lost their jobs, most of whom were self-employed, had their contracts terminated. Partly because of the complexity of these contracts and the way insurance companies stage commission payments to sales representatives over a long period, the parting has often been acrimonious. A crucial area of dispute concerns the repayment of loans, often amounting to tens of thousands of pounds, which many companies handed to sales people  -particularly 'tied agents' working at arms-length - during the 1980s expansion. Even more contentious have been altercations over commission clawback - efforts by insurance companies to reclaim commission paid to sales agents on life products that lapsed after the client stopped paying premiums. An insidious part of the clawback practice - as far as many former sales people are concerned - is that under Lautro rules once they have run up a debt of more than Pounds 1,000 on clawback they are not allowed to work for other insurance companies. In some cases this has severely limited their chances of finding alternative employment. Take Mr Vojislav (Joe) Sujdovic, who sold insurance and pensions for Guardian Royal Exchange between 1988 and 1990. According to Mr Sujdovic GRE is claiming Pounds 53,000 from him on the basis of 'clawback'. He says that because of the debt he has been unable to get another insurance job. He now works as a Pounds 100-a-week garage attendant, earning a tenth of what he made at GRE. In Mr Sujdovic's case - which has yet to come to court and which GRE did not want to comment on - he has countered the clawback claim with a writ alleging that GRE owes him Pounds 69,000 on unpaid commission and lost earnings. The sums of money involved in this case are dwarfed by some of the amounts in other disputes. Mr Chris Price, a former Legal &amp; General agent, is pursuing his former company for about Pounds 100,000 in loss of income and commission payments. Mr Joseph Meade, a former Pounds 75,000-a-year Colonial Mutual salesman who is now seeking work in Thailand, has a claim for damages and wrongful termination of contract against his company for Pounds 500,000. In both these cases the companies involved also have claims against the two men - of about Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 91,000 respectively. While Legal &amp; General said it pursued legal action only after thinking 'long and hard' and did not want to discuss individual cases, Colonial Mutual said there had been a 'breakdown in the relationship' with Mr Meade. It felt it was pursuing the matter fairly. Probably the biggest claim is that being made through a writ by Mr Hugh Beaumont, a former GRE agent who reckons the company owes him Pounds 2.5m due to loss of earnings and commission. In this case GRE has a counter-claim calling for repayment of Pounds 119,000 on a repayable development grant and commission. Assuming the case gets to a High Court trial - which is unlikely before the middle of next year at the earliest - critics and supporters of the insurance industry alike will be packing the aisles. The public image of the industry will be in for another battering.</p>

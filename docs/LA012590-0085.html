			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> HEIGHT LIMIT WORDING SET  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday decided on specific language for the  citizen-sponsored height limit initiative on the April ballot, but the  initiative's sponsors called the wording confusing.  </P> <P> The measure will read: "Shall a measure setting a maximum height of fifty-six  (56) feet the heights of some buildings in the C-3 (Commercial), C-3MR (Midrise  Commercial), S-1 (Studio) and P-D (Planned District) Zones be adopted?"  </P> <P> Initiative co-sponsor Robin Turner, who last week accused the city of trying to  misinform voters about the measure, said the wording is unclear, especially  when compared to the ballot question for a competing, city-sponsored  initiative.  </P> <P> That initiative would impose density limits and require traffic mitigation for  non-residential buildings taller than 43 feet and prohibit them from blocking  views or causing "significant detriment" with shade, shadows or glare. On the  ballot, it will read:  </P> <P> "Shall a measure establishing phasing, traffic, height, site coverage, glare,  air flow, shade, shadow, view and vista standards for all non-residential  developments in all zones be adopted?"  </P> <P> "If I read both initiative (questions), I'd vote for theirs because it sounds  better," said Turner, who said she opposes the city's measure because it has no  built-in height limit and leaves too much to the discretion of the council.  </P> <P> Slow-growth advocates collected nearly 3,000 signatures in 1988 to place the  Turner-sponsored initiative on April's ballot. The city's initiative was put on  the ballot by the council earlier this month.  </P></p>

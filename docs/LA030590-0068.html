U.S. and  Soviet negotiators meeting in London announced an agreement in principle to  open commercial air service between Anchorage and the Soviet Far East cities of  Magadan and Khabarovsk. If a final agreement is reached, Alaska Airlines hopes  to offer two to three flights a week starting in 1991.  </P></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Such rank ingratitude - Gilts / Reaction to the Budget Kenneth Clarke must feel slightly disappointed by the government bond market's grudging reaction to this week's Budget. After all, the rosy picture painted by the chancellor of an economy growing strongly, with low inflation and healthy public finances, should be exactly what any sensible bond investor wants to hear. Yet, gilt prices tumbled while he was speaking and have since recovered only slowly. The trouble is that most of his good news had been heard before: he simply confirmed what investors knew. Thus, the gilt market largely ignored it and sagged after hearing of a borrowing requirement for the present financial year of Pounds 34 1/2 bn (the City was looking for a figure closer to Pounds 30bn), plus the lack of more concrete proposals for an open repurchase (or 'repo') market for gilts. Another disappointment was the Budget's failure to extend the coverage of personal equity plans (Peps) to include gilts. One welcome surprise, however, was the extension of Peps to include corporate bonds, convertibles and preference shares. Although details are still unclear, the prices of those corporate bonds most likely to be included rose significantly to outperform gilts as the week progressed. Michael Dyson, of securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says: 'It provides the opportunity for people who invest for income purposes to obtain a higher income from their Peps without buying high-yielding shares.' And Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, estimates that corporate bond Peps could attract between Pounds 400m and Pounds 800m a year. The Budget contained a few other surprises that may provide solace for gilt investors in the longer term. One was the chancellor's prediction of a current account deficit down from Pounds 10 1/2 bn last year to only Pounds 4bn this year - and falling even lower in 1995. If this is right, then the UK's dependency on inflows of foreign finance is declining gradually, along with its vulnerability to shifts in international investor sentiment. This is a boost following a year in which countries with the largest current account deficits have been hit hardest by the global shake-out in bond markets. A further surprise was what Clarke's economic forecasts implied about the future path of UK interest rates. His prediction of strong growth combined with subdued inflation has led many City analysts to advance their forecasts of when the next batch of rate rises will take place. Economists at BZW now think rates, at present 5 3/4 per cent, will rise to 7 per cent by the middle of next year. Before the Budget, they were not expecting them to hit that level before the end of 1995. The first rate rises could come soon. On Wednesday, Clarke and Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, meet to discuss the situation. And while most analysts expect them to wait until January, the eventual increase is likely to be welcomed by investors and spur the gilt market. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the Budget was Clarke's talk of future tax reductions. His remark that the Tories 'are tax-cutters by instinct' will have served only to remind gilt investors of past pre-election give-aways. Indeed, if this Budget was remarkable for anything, it was in marking a policy shift away from the fiscal restraint of its predecessors in recent years towards what is likely to be a tax-cutting Budget next time. But cuts, just at a time in the economic cycle when the output gap is closing and inflationary pressures are really beginning to bite, are hardly a comforting prospect for gilt investors even if interest rates do rise quickly.</p>

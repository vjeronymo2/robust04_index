			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Israelis delay Arab peace talks delegates Palestinian negotiators delayed their departure for a sixth round of Middle East peace talks yesterday because Israel stopped five delegates from leaving, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Delegation spokeswoman Ms Hanan Ashrawi said all 28 members turned back from the Allenby Bridge in protest after Israeli border guards prevented the five from crossing into Jordan from the occupied West Bank. She said the Palestinian delegation would refuse to leave for Washington until it received guarantees its members would be treated with dignity, even if this meant delaying the start of the talks set for Monday. Israeli authorities prevented the five from crossing because they were under age 35 and did not have a special permit allowing them to return immediately.</p>

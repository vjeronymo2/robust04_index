			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / DoE sets Pounds 400 council tax goal THE Department of the Environment is to open its bidding in the public spending round on council tax on the basis that the average bill for a home in the middle property band should be at the Pounds 400 figure produced by the department last year, Alison Smith writes. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has estimated that meeting this target would cost an extra Pounds 2.3bn in government grants to local authorities. That is calculated without the further cost of a transitional relief scheme to help those worst affected by the change from the poll tax to the property-based tax. The department will call for the bulk of the extra money to come as government grants to authorities rather than being spent on transitional relief. Ministers are keen for the new tax to avoid the unpopularity of the poll tax. They believe that there is more political mileage from a lower overall level of bills than from a generous scheme which will help only those especially badly affected and for only a limited period. The department will also argue that providing additional funds as grants instead of transitional relief will ease the potential problem of London and the south-east having a higher relative tax base than other parts of the UK, and therefore getting a smaller proportion of grant. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will return to the department this week and will assemble the initial bid in the next few days.</p>

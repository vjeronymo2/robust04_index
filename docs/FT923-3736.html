			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Metamorphosis for theatre BOVIS CONSTRUCTION (SCOTLAND) has brought the house down at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre (formerly the Empire Theatre) as part of a Pounds 12m refurbishment programme to create a world-class opera house in Edinburgh. Bovis, a P&amp;O company, has started work on the two-year project and is on schedule for completion in time for the 1994 Edinburgh Festival. A new front-of-house is to be created to replace the existing facade on Nicolson Street. Set back from the street, it will feature a 400 ft long glass enclosure more than three storeys high. The ground floor will provide an entrance forecourt, box office, cafe bar and shop. A staircase is to be constructed to take audiences up to further foyer levels, each with their own bars. Although one of Bovis' prime tasks is to retain the architectural integrity of the Victorian theatre, an increased stage area of 9,700 sq ft is to be created to accommodate international touring companies. Providing more performing space than any other theatre in Scotland, the stage will be comparable to that of the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. The auditorium is of exceptional design and gives the theatre its Grade B listed building status. Although it has been out of use as a theatre for almost 30 years, the circle and balcony remain reasonably intact. The seating in this area will be restored, while the stalls will be reinstated and remodelled. Overall the audience seating capacity will be around 1,900 when the theatre re-opens in August 1994.</p>

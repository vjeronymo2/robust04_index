			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that HOPE 2 grantees not be required to wait for notification of termination of HOPE 2 grant before applying for a technical assistance (resident capacity or predevelopment) grant because there might be HUD delays. Because an owner cannot file a Notice of Intent (NOI) until HOPE 2 is terminated, the criterion for previous HOPE selectees should be an owner's filing of a NOI. The Department has adopted this suggestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that existing owner/sellers (including nonprofits) should not be able to apply for Resident Capacity grants. In general, this is the Department's requirement, with the exception of nonprofit general partners seeking to buy out their limited partners. Substantive objections from residents in the case of an application from a nonprofit general partner, however, will be considered by intermediaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter was concerned that grantees under the 1992 NOFA may not be eligible to apply for additional funds under this NOFA because they are not Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers. The Department considers the statute clear and finds no reason to change the statutory requirement or the NOFA. Community-Based Nonprofit Organizations funded under the previous NOFA are not necessarily eligible under this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Eligible Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven commenters sought clarification on eligible activities for Resident Capacity grants. Suggestions for additional eligible activities included: providing training on rights and opportunities under LIHPRHA; training on resident issues if an owner is not selling; hiring architect or other consultants to advise residents during the Preservation Capital Needs Assessment (PCNA)/appraisal process; hiring a tenant coordinator or a project manager; expense to cover phone and copying; and legal services to interpret preservation documentation. The Department has made these clarifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven commenters sought clarification on eligible activities for Predevelopment grants. Suggestions for additional eligible activities included: obtaining a financial feasibility analysis; preparing a Plan of Action or Resident Homeownership Plan; preparing a Transfer of Physical Assets package; tenant and board training on ``development'' and the preservation process; legal expenses; and hiring a project manager. The Department has made these clarifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six commenters felt tenant-related expenses, such as child care, bus fare to meetings, and beverages at meetings, should be allowable. The Department has made this clarification. However these expenses are only allowable to the extent that they support residents in their ability to participate in resident meetings and in planning for the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested that newly formed resident groups should be required to ensure a democratic process developed in conjunction with the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, that residents should have oversight authority over recipients, and that tenant input should be a criterion in receiving additional funds. The Department decided that a requirement to work with a specific national organization would be too burdensome on the grantees. The Department is clarifying that residents should be notified of the progress of the grant, but requiring resident oversight will be too burdensome on the grantee and the intermediaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that HUD consider the administrative structure necessary for providing the grants, given that the nonprofit grantees may not end up being purchasers/sponsors. The Department considered this issue and believes the statutory intent is clear. The creation of an eligible Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) purchaser is a requirement of a Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer (CBD) seeking a grant to purchase a property under LIHPRHA. The Department will work with intermediaries to ensure that grant fund release is not delayed due to the creation of a new entity. Funds for activities subsequent to a purchase offer may be released to the new entity. However, that new entity is expected to continue working with the Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer through the term of the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter suggested that the requirement that grantees be in conformance with appropriate program regulations and guidelines is too burdensome on grantees and, rather, should be a requirement of HUD or intermediaries as part of monitoring. The Department believes this requirement is not too burdensome. A grantee may use the grant to fund administrative activities in order to conform with the grant and the preservation programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters felt HUD should spell out a clear priority to maximize grant funds to tenant-controlled coalitions. Two others requested a requirement that all grantees obtain tenant group approval, to ensure maximum tenant control over the eventual purchaser. While the Department has clarified that resident organizations have preference for Resident Capacity grants, the Department believes that the other priorities listed by the commenters are contrary to statutory intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Conflicts of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received six comments on the proposed NOFA's conflict of interest requirements. One commenter believed that the requirements should be stronger. Another felt the requirement should involve disclosure rather than strict guidelines, so groups could continue to work with current consultants. Three commenters believed that the conflict of interest requirements should require grant recipients to certify that there is no violation of the Related Party rule, as defined in 24 CFR 248.101. Further, to prevent ``straw'' buyers, the Related Party Rule should: apply to entities other than individuals (e.g., corporations and partnerships); prohibit an identity of interest with a for-profit owner; not prohibit use of consultants and attorneys who are arms length; and require all related parties to make disclosures. One commenter felt the applicant should also disclose any intent to be involved in management, development, or provision of services for money, but that continued use of architects, management agents, development consultants, etc., should not be prohibited after acquisition. Another felt there should not be a blanket prohibition on a grantee contracting with owner consultants, as long as full disclosure is made and residents, through these disclosures, are able to have a say in personnel decisions. One commenter suggested a requirement that the applicant submit: Forms 2530 for the applicant and all board members; articles of incorporation; statements of officers and directors; financial statements for the last five years; and a listing of properties owned and operated in the last ten years. This commenter felt that conflicts with current management as well as the owner should be disclosed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has decided to tighten the proposed NOFA's conflict of interest requirements. The required certification will state that there has been no conflict of interest relationship during the previous five years, and it will include a requirement that the applicant not seek any financial benefit from project ownership. The Department has further clarified that nonprofit general partners seeking to buy out their limited partners are exempt from this rule. In addition, the NOFA will require disclosure to tenants and to the intermediary to include any relationship with owners, management, or any other parties to the sale. The Department will also require certification by the applicant that it will not interfere with the tenants' right to organize.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

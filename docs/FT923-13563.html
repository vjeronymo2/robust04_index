			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Serbian authorities step up pressure in Kosovo: A look at the persecution of the majority ethnic Albanians in a colonisation programme UNTIL October 26 1990, Dr Alush Gashi was Professor of Anatomy at Pristina University, Kosovo. He has no idea when he will be free to lecture again. 'That morning, three armed Serbian policemen came into my office. They dragged me out in front of the patients. They were angry because, as an ethnic Albanian, I had refused to leave my job,' said 40-year-old Mr Gashi. The former visiting professor at the University at California now spends his time documenting cases of human rights abuses in the southern province of Kosovo, which was forcibly reintegrated into Serbia in 1990. Since March 1990, when Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, issued a decree called 'The programme of the Republic of Serbia to colonise Kosovo', thousands of professional ethnic Albanians have been sacked. According to Belgrade's policy of colonising Kosovo, the decree stipulated how favourable credits would be granted to those Serbs and Montenegrins willing to settle in Kosovo, and how ethnic Albanians would be excluded from holding any positions of influence. 'Last autumn, 25,000 teachers, on all levels, were sacked; 865 lecturers and professors were dismissed; over 2,000 doctors and medical staff now have no jobs. About 85,000 workers have been expelled from the factories,' explains Mr Gashi. 'Serbia wants to reverse the ethnic distribution in Kosovo,' says Mr Ibrahim Rugova, elected president of Kosovo in elections banned by Belgrade two months ago. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 per cent of the province's 2m population. The remainder are Serbian, Montenegrin and ethnic Turkish communities. More recently, human rights organisations in Kosovo reported that Serb authorities last month sacked 60 ethnic Albanian workers from a car parts factory in Istoq, western Kosovo, and 350 ethnic Albanians from an engineering plant in Glogovac, south-west of Pristina, capital of Kosovo In response to the sackings, ethnic Albanians have begun to establish their own parallel society and institutions. Since February, ethnic Albanian children have gathered in private houses to be taught by teachers sacked from the primary, secondary and university schools throughout Kosovo. 'We are determined to educate our children. It is crucial to preserve a continuity in education and in our cultural traditions,' says Mr Rugova. In another extension of this parallel society, sacked doctors are setting up private, charitable clinics throughout the province. Before the medical profession was ethnically cleansed, the main gynaecological centre in Pristina was delivering between 50 and 55 babies a month. 'Now the centre is delivering only five or six infants. Because the ethnic Albanians have been sacked, the women do not trust the Serb doctors. They are now giving birth at home. We try to help as much as possible,' says Mr Gashi. The summary dismissal of so many ethnic Albanians has made life even harder in a province which last year was recording 40 per cent unemployment, the highest throughout the former Yugoslavia. Some ethnic Albanians cope by returning to the land. Some seek help from ethnic Albanians working abroad in Germany or Switzerland. Others rely on a special 'Solidarity Fund' set up by the Democratic League of Kosovo, which won an overwhelming majority in the recent unofficial elections. This fund is financed by the diaspora. Mr Rugova says the parallel society will continue as long as Serbia continues to repress the ethnic Albanians. 'Ethnic Albanians are picked up every day by the police. They are beaten, detained, and held without warrant. Their houses are searched. Intimidation prevails,' he explains. 'It is clear Belgrade is not willing to compromise with the ethnic Albanians at the moment,' a US diplomat says. 'Even if Milosevic, or any other Serb leader, decides to give back autonomy to the ethnic Albanians, it will be too late. The entire province is radicalised as a result of the repression.' Despite the repression, Mr Rugova says ethnic Albanians will not be provoked into rising up against Serbian repression. 'That is exactly what Belgrade wants. It would end up being a massacre because we have no weapons. That is why we need a United Nations presence here before it is too late,' he says. Western diplomats said last week's decision at the Helsinki summit meeting of the 51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to send a mission to Kosovo may be the first, tentative step towards recognising that the war in the former Yugoslavia must be prevented from spreading.</p>

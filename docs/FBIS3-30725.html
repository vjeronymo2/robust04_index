			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we said at the beginning of the newscast, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly is currently meeting in Sarajevo  behind closed doors. President Alija Izetbegovic of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency opened the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly session with the following words:    Esteemed deputies, guests, and friends: I have a somewhat  unpleasant duty to address you again on the issue of the Geneva  negotiations, which have become [word indistinct] at which  Bosnia meets its friends but also its enemies, both open ones  and those concealed. The negotiations have become deadlocked  and they are facing a collapse. That is why we are meeting  today to exchange views and decide what to do. Perhaps some new  ideas will be expressed in this hall today, which will point to  a way out of this standstill and open up some new paths.    I therefore call on the deputies -- since they are the most  informed and called upon as to what the people think -- to tell  us their views and present new ideas that might encourage the  negotiations. Let them do so bravely and freely, as this is a  time of change and everything is (open) to suspicion and  reassessment -- everything, that is, except some basic  principles and the one aim, and that is the salvation of the  people and the country. There are no taboos and nothing is  politically sacred.    During the previous Geneva negotiations, our delegation  consistently represented the views of the Assembly, as  established at the session on 28 September 1993. We asked the  Serb side to return the occupied territories in the Drina River  valley and in western Bosnia. The Serbs made some concessions  in eastern Bosnia, but they also took two steps back when it  came to Brcko and Doboj.    The Croatian side persistently refused to accept the  mutually  satisfactory solution regarding our access to the sea at Neum.  They offered solutions unacceptable to us near Prevlaka and in  Peljesac. The Croats also rejected our proposal for a military  disengagement in central Bosnia. We proposed that the HVO  [Croatian Defense Council] forces pulled out from the region of  Vitez and Novi Travnik, in which case the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army units would also withdraw, and the civilian bodies and the  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] members would take control.  Since they rejected this proposal, the confrontation near Vitez  has continued.    The talks are to continue on 10 February. They are entering  a critical phase. We expect a more active participation by the  United States, which can only have a positive influence on the  course of the negotiations. I believe that our delegation  should be given full freedom to negotiate, but the Assembly  would make the final decision. The delegation should represent  the views of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Assembly of 28 September  1993, but also take into account all the useful ideas and  proposals that will be presented today by the deputies or the  deputies' caucus. The delegation should also be authorized --  if no progress is made, and if it judges that the negotiations  on this basis have become exhausted -- to request that the  entire issue be referred to the UN Security Council. In that  case, we would ask the Council to implement finally all the  relevant resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that is, we would  remind the Council of its duty. I can see no other solution.    I do not think there is need to stress that our position at  the negotiations depends to a large extent on our military  situation, the strength or the weakness of the enemy, the morale  and the limits of endurance of our people, the humanitarian  conditions, and other elements. The state delegation has tried  to be as objectively informed about these facts as possible, and  it has tried within its limits to assess as realistically as  possible these important factors.    Finally I would like to reiterate that our aim is peace but  only just peace. All our efforts are devoted to this end,  President Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency said  today in his opening address at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly  session.</p>

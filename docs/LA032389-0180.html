			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPOUSAL ABUSE: DO RESTRAINING ORDERS HELP?  </P> <P> In the volatile, real-life world of family violence, there are happy endings  and sad endings after one spouse gets a restraining order against the other.  </P> <P> Scott McGuire credits his wife's decision to get an order against him with  awakening him to the seriousness of his plight. He did not violate the order  that was granted last year, and he and his wife say they believe their marriage  now is back on track.  </P> <P> Sandra Melendez was not so lucky. Last month, she got a restraining order  against her husband, Carlos. The order forbade him to come near her residence  or the motel where she worked.  </P> <P> But on Feb. 13, only 10 days after the order was made final, Carlos Melendez,  armed with a revolver, went to the motel near Anaheim Stadium where his wife  was a night desk clerk, engaged her in a brief argument and then fatally shot  her. He then shot himself to death, leaving three orphaned children.  </P> <P> The news was particularly devastating to a group of employees in the county  courthouse who work for the private, nonprofit Community Services Program. They  help women fill out the cumbersome forms for restraining orders and had worked  with Sandra Melendez.  </P> <P> "Anytime you've had contact with someone where something tragic happened,  you're going to feel it a bit more even if it's not someone you're personally  acquainted with," said Maxine Rutkowski, a supervisor in the Domestic Violence  Assistance Program of the Community Services Program.  </P> <P> "When you know they've come into the office, you kind of feel, 'Was there  something more we could have done?' Even when you think back and think you had  done everything possible, you wonder if maybe there wasn't something more you  could have done. You just don't know."  </P> <P> For those like Carlos Melendez who are intent on mayhem, restraining orders are  not worth the paper they're printed on. But the overwhelming consensus of  people who work in the domestic violence field is that restraining orders are  effective.  </P> <P> "We still live in a society where most people are law-abiding," said Jan Shaw,  director of mediation and investigative services for the Orange County Superior  Court. "It's unfortunate that we don't live in a society where everyone is. But  the fact that the court has intervened in the affairs of a family seems to make  the batterer realize that this isn't something society accepts or condones."  </P> <P> While domestic violence is a felony, violating a restraining order is a  misdemeanor. Since that may mean little or no jail time, some experts are  lukewarm about the impact of such an order.  </P> <P> "I have mixed feelings about the orders," said Mary Walton, executive director  of the Interval House shelter in west Orange County. "It gives the woman a  sense that she's able to do something to protect herself. There was a time when  it was the only thing she could do. Until there is a consistent first response  and arrest for family violence, then a restraining order is valuable as the  next best thing we have. But so far in our society, and that filters down to  our county, the notion of arrest being the first response has not caught on."  </P> <P> Figures provided by the Orange County Commission on the Status of Women support  her theory. Of more than 10,000 domestic violence calls reported by police  departments in 1987, only 209 resulted in arrests.  </P> <P> Police departments over the years have made no secret of their dislike for  handling domestic violence calls. "You can take a Caspar Milquetoast and given  stimulus about family, money, children -- it brings out the worst in people,"  said Orange Police Sgt. Timm Browne. "I've been doing this job for 18 years and  from the day I started, this has been the biggest problem -- you just don't  like to handle family fights, because everybody's got their emotions up front.  There are no fuses, just buttons."  </P> <P> Complicating matters for police are the combatants themselves. Many times,  police will be called to a family fight, only to have the abused spouse  suddenly join forces with the other after officers attempt to arrest or subdue  the abuser.  </P> <P> That same pattern can interfere with the intent of the restraining orders. "The  thing you have to understand about family violence is that a woman will  separate six or seven times before she finally separates from him for the final  time," according to Jan Shaw. "So what will happen is, she'll come in and  obtain the restraining order, which is good for 3 years, and during that time  there will be all these reconciliations and it ends up defeating the original  intent of the order."  </P> <P> Because restraining orders require filling out a lot of paper work and  documenting past cases of abuse, some people need help with the forms. Since  1982, the Victim Assistance Center in the county courthouse has provided that  kind of assistance. In the most recent full year of record-keeping, more than  2,300 people have sought help for family violence situations.  </P> <P> While murderous assaults such as that of Carlos Melendez make people wary of  the value of restraining orders, experts say that is a misleading impression.  </P> <P> "Like all of us, abusers come from all walks of life, all educational levels,  all philosophies," said Barbara Clippinger, program director at the Women's  Transitional Living Center shelter in north Orange County.  </P> <P> "Some are very law-abiding citizens who have a cultural or social or family  belief system that says they have the right to beat their wife, but they still  follow the other rules of society, with that exception. Most of the abusers  would be looked at by their neighbors as regular guys, pleasant people to be  with, socially acceptable. Their rage is usually kept within the confines of  the home."  </P></p>

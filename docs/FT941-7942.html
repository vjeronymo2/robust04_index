			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: Feats of clay - When does a work of craft become a work of art? William Packer meets the problem head on in 'The Raw and the Cooked' The debate between the Fine and the Applied Arts is an old and hoary controversy. In the Victoria &amp; Albert or the British Museum we have little difficulty in taking Renaissance gold and silver, Chinese porcelain or Celtic jewellery as true art, singular and beautiful in the particular marriage of the aesthetic with the practical. Going round a workshop or exhibition of contemporary craft, we are not so sure. Objet d'art remains ambiguous and faintly patronising a designation. When, quite, does a work of conventional craft transcend itself to become a work of art? Might it not be a work of art in any case, its transcendence quite unnecessary? Taking new work in clay in Britain as its material subject, The Raw and the Cooked, shown at the Barbican before Christmas and now at Oxford, tackles the issue head-on by the simple expedient of ignoring it. That it should come up with no answer is merely to double the irony. Clay is, or rather was, quite as much the staple of the sculptor's as of the potter's practice, flexible and convenient, yet oddly neglected by sculptors in our century. So it was that 32 assorted sculptors and ceramists were invited to show examples of current work, which are here set up to take their chances indifferently alongside each other, without benefit of category or caveat. The result is intriguing and often delightful in the particular, but frustrating overall. The most directly successful and impressive are those exhibitors who are simply getting on with what we know they do, continuing to develop in their work, and doing it very well. They all fall on the craft side. Such exhibitors as Elizabeth Fritsch, Ken Eastman, Carol McNicol and Alison Britton may all be making pots that have a decidedly sculptural quality to them, but pots nevertheless. Least satisfactory are the acknowledged sculptors, whether showing sculpture as such or decorated pots. Antony Gormley's procession of pinched and blobby mannikins, receding to infinity, is merely silly, the more so for the vast space it neutralises. Tony Cragg's solid jar-and-bottle forms in rough clay, sliced like loaves, are no more than a perfunctory exercise. Bruce McLean has thrown a pot together, and thrown an image onto it. He speaks of an elegance that could be there, if only he gave it a moment to catch its balance. All three artists seem self-conscious, as though to say: here is the chance to make a point, say something significant, do something special. And in between falls the majority, craftsmen by discipline but easing themselves into no-man's-land in the direction of sculpture, producing work that is distinguished in itself but which confronts the issue they know will never be resolved. Gordon Baldwin's ceramic objects, Ewan Henderson's more roughly sophisticated totems, Jacqueline Poncelet's quirky fetishes, Susan Halls's raku beasts like trophies hung in the ancestral hall, Philip Eglin's Madonna and Child - all are authentic and convincing in themselves, beautiful and intriguing. I was particularly taken by Tracey Heyes's stoneware disembodied dresses, active figures without the figure itself. Do these makers all yet accept in their hearts that the old distinction is not to be denied; that what they do is something more than craft, and less than art? It is the very question, perhaps, that is mistaken, and less and more have little to do with it. What this show makes clear is that the integrity of what is done is what matters, and that the tired question of relative status, artist or craftsmen, neither here nor there. Whatever he does, an artist is an artist if he is an artist: it is as simple as that. All very easy to say, of course, but it takes little account of the market and general prejudice and perception. Why should a drawing, pencil on paper, command more, as a matter of course, than a pot? Answer: because it does. Even so, the Fine Crafts in Britain consistently offer us work across the full range of disciplines that is second to none in the world. Its originality and quality, both technical and aesthetic, speak for themselves whenever such work is shown, but its economic success is less well celebrated. The fact is that the Fine Crafts collectively make a financial contribution within the small business sector of the national economy that is quite disproportionate to its size. That this should be so is in part due to the efforts of the Crafts Council, founded some 20 years ago precisely to foster and promote such activity  - and it is sad to see that success still so often ignorantly disparaged, as it was by ITN's News at Ten some weeks ago in one of its special reports on government quangos.

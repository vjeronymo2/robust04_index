			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Clinton Expresses Support for </F> Latvia"]    [Text] Riga, 21 January -- On Thursday [20 January]  evening, President of the United States Bill Clinton called  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and, in a conversation which  lasted half an hour, expressed support for Latvia's conduct  during the 10 January incident [in which two Russian generals  were arrested].    G. Ulmanis conveyed to the U.S. President his view of the  speech recently delivered by Russian Foreign Affairs Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, which showed that the policy of Russia towards  the Baltic States had changed. B. Clinton confirmed that the  United States has already received an explanation of this speech  from Russia -- it says A. Kozyrev was misinterpreted. The  President of the United States maintained that during his  meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, there  was no talk of any changes in Russian policy and there was also  no previous agreement.    B. Clinton stated that there was much talk in Moscow about  the Skrunda radar station. According to G. Ulmanis, B.  Clinton's proposition is that delegations of both countries  continue to negotiate and seek a compromise on a schedule for  the operation of the station on the territory of Latvia.    President B. Clinton pointed out that the issues of human  rights and citizenship are by no means linked with the  withdrawal of the Russian Army. In his opinion, the issues of  human rights and citizenship will be solved by Latvia, in  compliance with CSCE resolutions and recommendations.    G. Ulmanis concluded that his conversation with B. Clinton  allows him to think that there really is no agreement between  the United States and Russia that could contain a threat to the  sovereignty of the Latvian state.    The President of the United States sent his greetings to  Latvia and the Latvian people, and his best wishes for their  future activities.    G. Ulmanis said that with regard to the recent activities of  Russia, he does not foresee any changes for the worse in  relations between Latvians and Russians residing on Latvian  territory.</p>

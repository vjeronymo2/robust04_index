			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEAT BACKS OFF A LITTLE IN COUNTY  </P> <P> The heat wave that has stifled the Southland for 4 days eased off a bit in  Orange County on Friday, with most areas reporting high temperatures hovering  near 100 degrees. And forecasters predicted even more cooling this weekend.  </P> <P> According to the National Weather Service, the temperature climbed to a high in  Orange County of 100 degrees in San Juan Capistrano on Friday, 9 degrees hotter  than the previous record of 91 degrees for an April 7 set in Orange in 1939.  </P> <P> Unofficially, however, the mercury hit 105 degrees in Mission Viejo at about  1:30 p.m., according to Orange County firefighters at the Mission Viejo fire  station, and 101 degrees in Tustin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7 Degrees Cooler  </P> <P> Unofficial or not, it was still 7 degrees cooler than the previous day's record  of 112 degrees set at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which won the  distinction of being the nation's hot spot Thursday.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Orange County, Friday's high temperature was 99 degrees in Santa  Ana, 98 in El Toro, 97 in Fullerton and 85 in Newport Beach, according to the  National Weather Service.  </P> <P> Nights remained warm, too. The overnight lows were 55 degrees in San Juan  Capistrano, 66 degrees in Santa Ana and 77 degrees in El Toro, according to the  National Weather Service.  </P> <P> While the fourth consecutive day of sweltering heat was tough on almost  everyone in the Southland, probably no one had a harder time than the patients  and employees at two Los Angeles area hospitals Friday.  </P> <P> The thermometer peaked at 104 inside the cardiac care unit at the UCLA Medical  Center on Friday afternoon after a cooling-tower fire Thursday night knocked  out the air-conditioning for the entire hospital. And, at Los Angeles  County-USC Medical Center in Lincoln Heights, it was about 100 degrees Friday  afternoon in some of the wards where there is no air conditioning.  </P> <P> Sarah Daniels, a secretary in the UCLA cardiac unit, said she resorted to  fantasizing about a place she has never been just to get through the day.  </P> <P> "If I just keep thinking, 'I'm in Tahiti. I'm in Tahiti,' then this heat  doesn't bother me," she said, gazing wistfully at two lemonade cartons she had  already emptied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hot on Weekend  </P> <P> Pat Cooper, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for  The Times, said the sizzling heat should last through the weekend.  </P> <P> "Saturday will be another hot one for much of the area," she said. But in  Orange County, much cooler days -- with highs in 80s in inland areas and in the  70s along the beach -- were forecast for today and Sunday, with some late night  and morning fog to bring a cooling influence, the National Weather Service  said.  </P> <P> Forecasters said the strong high-pressure systems that have been dominating the  weather patterns over the western United States will begin breaking down late  Sunday, bringing to an end the hot, dry, Santa Ana winds that have been  parching the Southland.  </P> <P> "The real cooling trend won't start until Monday, when we should be back to the  70s and 80s across most of the area," Cooper said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Days Away  </P> <P> But that prospect was still 3 days away for Daniels, one of 4,500 employees who  sweltered through the day Friday along with more than 450 patients at UCLA  Medical Center. Although the air-conditioning was working by noon, it took  until nightfall to cool down the seven-story building.  </P> <P> Paramedic ambulance traffic was diverted to other hospitals until 3 p.m.  Friday, and elective surgeries were postponed until today.  </P> <P> To help those who had to stay inside the hospital, the UCLA center's staff used  some creative methods.  </P> <P> Fans were placed in every room, and windows, which are normally closed, were  opened.  </P> <P> 'We want to catch any breeze we can," said Suzette Cardin, nurse manager in the  cardiac unit.  </P> <P> Non-essential lights, computers and other electrical devices were turned off  and the traditional medical uniforms, which tend to be on the warm side, were  discarded in favor of cooler garb.  </P> <P> "Everyone is especially casual today," Cardin said.  </P> <P> Patients were given cool baths and pitchers of ice water were placed at every  bedside and work station. Brows were sponged with dampened towels.  </P> <P> "Most of the patients are just very lethargic . . . but we are not really  concerned that their conditions will get worse," Cardin said. "We're just going  to keep an extra close eye on them."  </P> <P> For a time, hospital workers were worried about the cardiac unit's computers,  which are used to monitor patients' heartbeats. Clinical engineer Ray Ford said  the computers do not work above 94 degrees and the room temperature was 10  degrees above that.  </P> <P> To cool things down, he used fans blowing over buckets of ice. The makeshift  cooling system worked. The computers kept on monitoring.  </P> <P> Volunteers such as Berthe Lyons roamed the UCLA center's sauna-like hallways  offering a cool drink to anyone in need. A cafeteria worker said ice cream was  the best-selling item of the day. Hospital personnel were offered free lunches  and all the juice and lemonade they could consume.  </P> <P> "It's the least they could do," said one nurse, who asked not to be identified.  "It's miserable. I can hardly breathe."  </P> <P> Patients scheduled to be discharged left unusually early, said nursing manager  Veronique Rouillard. "They were in a rush to get out of here," she said.  </P> <P> Across town at County-USC Medical Center, fans were moved from offices to  patient wards, especially those on the south side of the hospital, where the  sun bakes the outer walls during the day. Like their counterparts at UCLA, the  1,440 patients at County-USC were given cooling baths and swabbed with damp  towels, and nurses made sure everyone had plenty of cool water to drink.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at a high school in Claremont, some students staged a walkout to  protest the heat and lack of air conditioning in their classrooms.  </P> <P> "It was steaming in there," said Josh Crowe, a ninth-grade student at Claremont  High. "When the bell rang at 12:40, we decided not to go back to class."  </P> <P> Principal Nancy Krause said some of them "came in and asked me to declare a  minimum day" -- a shortened schedule that would have closed the school for the  rest of the day.  </P> <P> "I told them I didn't have the authority," she said.  </P> <P> After meeting with the protesters -- about 150 of the school's 1,800 students  -- to discuss the problem, Krause said about half of the youngsters went home  and the others returned to class.  </P> <P> Officials at about 20 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District with  limited or no air conditioning released students early Friday, according to  district officials.  </P> <P> "It was simply too warm," said Janet Petersen, office manager at San Jose  Elementary School in Mission Hills, which sent children home an hour early. "I  didn't hear many students complaining, but the staff certainly felt it."  </P> <P> District officials notified schools on Wednesday that they could release  students early if the temperatures topped 95 degrees and parents were notified  24 hours in advance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quake Not Related  </P> <P> And if anyone was wondering, Friday's moderate earthquake in Orange County was  in no way related to the hot spell, according to scientists at the seismology  laboratory at Caltech in Pasadena.  </P> <P> "Whenever there's an unusual weather condition and an earthquake occurs, people  associate it with the weather condition," said Riley Geary, an analyst at the  lab. "The weather had absolutely nothing to do with it."  </P></p>

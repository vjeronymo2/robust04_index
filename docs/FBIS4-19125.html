			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Bundestag </F> in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen; this is a  government statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia,  but you will understand that, first of all, I would like to say  that we are glad all Germans managed to get out of Rwanda  safely, and that we are particularly happy about the fact that  the 11 Deutsche Welle employees were evacuated by Belgian  paratroopers yesterday. [applause] I expressed our cordial  thanks to the Belgian Government, the Belgian foreign minister  yesterday. I think it was appropriate, because the Belgian  paratroopers have done a good, remarkable, and for us most  important, job.    Ladies and Gentlemen; the situation in the former Yugoslavia  cannot be easily reduced to a common denominator. All in all  one can say that it has improved. Bosnians and Croats have  displayed their serious intention to overcome last year's  confrontation on the basis of the Washington agreement, and to  establish a federal state together. For the first time people  in the conflict area at least believe in the possibility of  peace. Sarajevo has been freed -- at least for the moment --  from the suffocating grip of Serbian terrorist attacks, and can  hope for life to normalize in the city with the help of the  United Nations, even though new incidents did, unfortunately,  occur yesterday.    In Mostar, the people are waiting for the United Nations to  set up an administration that is to be headed by Hans Koschnick.  Everything has to be done now to preserve the positive momentum,  and everything has to be done not to frustrate the incipient  hopes.    There is even some light on the horizon in Croatian-Serbian  relations. The 29 March cease-fire is being complied with and  implemented, which means that Dalmatian areas that have so far  been in danger are now no longer within the range of the Serb  artillery. This is of considerable importance for the tourist  trade and, thus, for the entire economy in the region.    The next important step has to be the restoration of  important infrastructure at the level of transportation and the  energy supply. Negotiations on a political solution can be  started on the basis of such a modus vivendi.    The Federal Government welcomes the strong U.S. commitment  in  the peace efforts, which we have repeatedly called for, and the  constructive cooperation of Russia. The role of these two  countries is of vital importance. Russia must be involved in  the efforts to seek a political solution. Without the  participation of Russia there will not be a solution in the  former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, one is also entitled to  expect Russia to continue to support the UN Security Council  resolution.    The contribution of the EU must not be forgotten, either.  Yes, we Europeans did not manage to get this conflict, which is  actually a European conflict, under control on our own. Yet,  the rapprochement between Bosnians and Croats, the demand for a  satisfactory territorial solution in Bosnia, and the idea of a  modus vivendi in the Serb-occupied territories in Croatia --  these concepts have been developed by the EU as a result of the  impetus provided by myself, together with my French colleague  Juppe.    It is true that the negotiations on the cease-fire in  Krajina  took place in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Nevertheless, they  were chaired -- and unfortunately such things tend to be  overlooked -- by a German diplomat on the instructions of the  International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. We are in  constant close contact with the main parties involved; and with  our Foreign Ministry representatives we participated decisively,  of course, also in the Bosnian-Croatian negotiations in  Washington.    At the moment it is of utmost importance that the peace  process remains credible. This means two things: There must be  no more Serb occupations, and the suffering of the people in the  towns besieged by the Serbs must come to an end. [applause]    The combat operation of NATO aircraft is to be seen in this  connection. The operation was justified, necessary, and right.  Over the last two days, the chancellor and myself have discussed  the overall situation in former Yugoslavia and these specific  operations in detail with the secretary general of the United  Nations. The legal basis for the operation is undisputed.  Security Council Resolution 836, which has also been supported  by the Russians, provides for the use of airborne strike forces  to support UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. The Serb move  toward Gorazde and the heavy attack on the city endangered the  security of the UN military observers stationed there. A UN  soldier was wounded. Following this, the UNPROFOR command, with  the permission of the special envoy of the UN secretary general,  asked NATO to provide airborne support. It was granted on 10  April. On 11 April it was repeated. This was in keeping with  the procedure laid down for such cases. On 10 June 1993, NATO  decided on the basis of Security Council Resolution 836 to make  such protection measures possible. For this reason a special  procedure was not necessary within NATO. For reasons of time it  was not possible to inform all the other parties concerned. On  11 April, the UN Security Council unanimously agreed on the  operation, with the exception of Russia. But Russia did not  voice any reservations under international law or any other  legal concerns. It only criticized the lack of consultation  before the operation. But let me say it again: Bringing the  case before the Security Council before every operation would  impair the purpose of Resolution 836 and make it impossible to  provide efficient, swift, immediate protection against such  attacks, especially against UNPROFOR troops.    I would also like to point out again that this was not an  operation equal to the Sarajevo threat, but a specific operation  in response to a specific attack against UNPROFOR troops. We  think that a clear, decisive signal was necessary. The Serb  attack on a UN protection zone is a provocation of the community  of states. And we all know what the capture of a largely Muslim  city by the Serbs would mean for the population. The United  Nations could not allow the protection zones it established to  be disregarded. On 9 April, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  -- he explained this again yesterday -- himself warned the  Bosnian Serbs against continuing their attacks on Gorazde and  instructed UNPROFOR to use all available means to achieve a Serb  withdrawal. After Sarajevo, Gorazde is another symbol for the  suffering of the population in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For months,  some 65,000 people, most of them Muslims, have been trapped  there. Unfortunately, only very few humanitarian aid convoys  have managed to get through to the city. It must now become  clear whether the community of states will manage to extend to  Gorazde what it has achieved in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, there  are a number of Sarajevos, Gorazdes -- a fact that is all too  easily forgotten. We urgently have to try and approach the  other crisis spots as we did in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, this  will be the only possibility. The operation was right, also  with a view to the peace process. The community of states can  only call upon the parties to the conflict to find a political  solution if it remains credible in its own resolutions. The Serb  side is in control of some 70 percent of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The community of states demands that the Serbs should  withdraw from about 20 percent of the Bosnian territory. At an  earlier point, the Serbian side expressed its basic willingness  to do so. Thus, a withdrawal is required and not another  advance. [applause]    One can only recommend to the Serbs in their very own  interest that they take the determination of the community of  states seriously and renounce further military advances.  Instead, they should constructively participate in efforts to  achieve a peaceful solution. Above all, this includes the  submission of a qualitatively satisfactory proposal for the  territory.    As far as Russia is concerned, I would like to stress that,  if a repetition of the situation of the past few days is to be  prevented, the best and most effective method is -- I also  discussed this with Foreign Minister Kozyrev -- for Russia to  continue to exert influence on the Serbian side. In this  respect, I would like to point out that the Russians are  cooperating in an extraordinarily constructive manner. I just  mentioned that. Their influence on the Serbs was decisive for  the withdrawal of the troops in and around Sarajevo, for  ensuring access to Tuzla for UNPROFOR and UN troops, and  hopefully for other peace efforts, too. [applause]    If the Serbian side should take the legitimate intervention  by the United Nations to ensure the resolution adopted by the UN  Security Council as an opportunity to question the whole peace  process -- which I cannot imagine -- doubts would be justified  that they have ever been ready for a peace agreement that is  acceptable to the other parties to the conflict and the  community of states. The Federal Government hopes for the  continuation of the processes that have been initiated in the  past few weeks. Germany will be confronted with high  expectations concerning the stabilization of the relationship  between Muslims and Croats, which is still difficult, and, above  all, concerning the implementation of a peace solution for the  whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which will hopefully be achieved  soon. This applies particularly to our role in the  administration of Mostar by the EU. I explicitly thank Mr.  Koschnick for his readiness to assume the task of the  administrator of the EU, which is not exactly easy. [applause]  I can only say -- he knows that from various conversations we  have held -- that he can be sure of our solidarity and support.  An appointment has rarely been received so positively in the EU  as that of Mr. Koschnick in Greece when we asked him to assume  this position. Good luck! [applause]    The international community will also rely on us regarding  the opening of Tuzla Airport and aid for the reconstruction of  the territories affected by the war, particularly because we  cannot participate in the military elements of the pacification.  Our commitment in the humanitarian sphere, where we have done a  great deal, must be maintained. I would like to thank the  German people once more, who have accepted over 400,000 refugees  from the former Yugoslavia. I would like to repeat proudly that  this is more than twice the number that all other European  countries have accepted together. This is an astonishing  achievement. During the talks in Washington, this was honored  in a special manner, particularly by the Muslim and Croatian  side, and special thanks were conveyed to us -- also for our  humanitarian commitment in general. One should not ignore or  forget that, as far as financial contributions and aid are  concerned, we are in second place. Thus, we need not hide our  light under a bushel.    However, in view of the situation in the former Yugoslavia,  which continuous to be terrible, the world community must not  grow tired and lose interest. This is the biggest danger that  exists in the sphere of humanitarian efforts. I would like to  repeat that, in view of the terrible situation, we must not grow  tired and lame, or lose interest. Today's support by the German  Bundestag for the Federal Government's policy on the former  Yugoslavia should be viewed as a signal in this spirit. Thank  you very much.</p>

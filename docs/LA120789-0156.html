			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> GROSSMONT COACH'S AWARD GIVES SEASON PERFECT END  </P> <P> Colleen Suwara, Grossmont College's women's volleyball coach, was named  national community college coach of the year Tuesday by the American Volleyball  Coaches Assn., punctuating a terrific season in which the Griffins finished  27-1 and won their second state championship in three years.  </P> <P> "I had a tremendous amount of fun with this team this year," Suwara said. "They  were very willing to work hard and it paid off. (The award) was exciting, but  winning the state championship was even better because all the girls got to  participate in the celebration."  </P> <P> The celebration came Sunday afternoon when Grossmont defeated De Anza College,  15-9, 15-7, 7-15, 15-7, in the tournament final at Citrus College in Cerritos.  The Griffins had advanced by beating De Anza Sunday morning in the winner's  bracket final, 10-15, 15-2, 15-12, 15-11.  </P> <P> Grossmont's Suzy Schutz was chosen the tournament's most valuable player,  joining teammates Vicky Cavadias and Eliana Penido on the all-tournament team.  </P> <P> In four tournament matches, including 3-1 and 3-0 victories over Cabrillo and  El Camino Saturday, Schutz led Grossmont with 86 kills, 84 digs and five  service aces. Cavadias, a setter, had 174 assists.  </P> <P> Sophomores Schutz and Cavadias are local players from Grossmont High who Suwara  expects to be heavily recruited. Schutz was voted Grossmont's most valuable  player by her teammates.  </P> <P> Penido, a freshman from Rio de Janeiro, has been a pleasant surprise for  Suwara. About a year ago, Penido called Suwara to ask if she could play at  Grossmont. Suwara told Penido she would have to try out just like everybody  else.  </P> <P> Penido, who had played in clubs in Brazil, not only made the team, but became a  standout and was selected the most valuable player of the Pacific Coast  Conference.  </P> <P> A car accident three weeks ago threatened the remainder of Penido's season  leaving her with an injured shoulder. It wasn't until three days before the  state tournament that Penido was given medical clearance to play.  </P> <P> "The doctors said she wouldn't further damage the shoulder, but she would be  limited in what she could do," Suwara said. "You could tell the shoulder was  hurting her, and she was playing in a lot of pain, but she played great."  </P> <P> Penido wasn't the only ailing Griffin. Cavadias also had a sore shoulder and a  case of the flu.  </P> <P> This was Grossmont's third consecutive state tournament appearance. The  Griffins won the title in 1987 and finished seventh last year. In five years  under Suwara, Grossmont has won five PCC titles and has not lost a conference  match since 1985, a streak of 52 matches.  </P> <P> Grossmont's only loss this year was to Miami Dade, the national champion.  (California teams do not participate in the national tournament.) But Grossmont  avenged that loss defeating Dade in a tournament a few days later.  </P> <P> Is Suwara looking to move on? No, she says, offering praise to five-year  assistants Paul Tucker and Steve Mitchell. "I'm real happy at Grossmont  College."  </P> <P> Tom Dabasinskas, a former football standout at San Pasqual High, completed two  days of interviewing for a Rhodes Scholarship Wednesday at USC.  </P> <P> Dabasinskas, a center with a 3.87 grade-point-average and Trojan swimmer Ray  Looze are trying to become only the second Pac 10 athlete to earn the  distinction. Pat Haden was the first.  </P> <P> Dabasinskas, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound junior who has been hampered by injuries,  said regardless of whether he attends Oxford or not he will skip his senior  year of football to continue his education. Dabasinskas will graduate in May  with a degree in Business Administration.  </P> <P> "I know I can play at this level, but it hasn't worked out," Dabasinskas was  quoted in a press release. "Now I'm glad I didn't put all my eggs in one  basket. I'm glad I emphasized academics as well."  </P> <P> USC's Junior Seau, the section player of the year in 1986 from Oceanside High,  was chosen to the Associated Press' All-America second team. Seau, a linebacker  who was a Prop. 48 his freshman season, was also chosen as USC's most valuable  player leading the Trojans with 18 sacks and 67 tackles.  </P> <P> Who is Mark Kraatz?  </P> <P> Well, the answer can be found in Who's Who in Athletics In American Colleges  and Universities, a new book to be released by the publishers of Who's Who in  America.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Gladson Nwanna, the president of the Athletic Press of  America, its maiden edition is expected to have 1,000 listings.  </P> <P> "It's only criterion is that the student-athletes be outstanding in the various  areas of athletic participation," Nwanna said. "Part of the nomination form  asks for the GPA, but we made that optional."  </P> <P> Now, for those who can't wait and those who did not already know, Kraatz is a  senior guard for Christian Heritage men's basketball team. He is a two-time  National Christian College Athletic Assn. All-American. He led the NCCAA in  assists with a 10.1 average and carries a 3.4 grade-point-average in education  graduate classes.  </P> <P> A fact not listed in the book is that Kraatz, 22, is married to the former  Susan Peschke, who works in the Hawks' athletic department. The two have known  each other since high school.  </P></p>

The United Nations and the UN  Coordination Commission were informed of these developments and  the latter said it was watching the situation.    A statement issued by the "Iraqi Transmitting Corporation"  [ITC] [Hay'at al-Irsal al-'Iraqiyah] from its headquarters in  Salah al-Din in northern Iraq said that the Iraqi Government has  replaced its armed forces deployed along the contact line in  Kurdistan in February. The statement, of which AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT received a copy in London, also said: The 10th Armored  Division of the 1st Corps -- one of the most important divisions  in the Iraqi Armed Forces -- has withdrawn, taking its armored  units and advanced T-72 Russian-made tanks, and headed for the  Tib area in the Maysan Governorate near the Iranian border. Its  command used as headquarters a building opposite the radio and  television premises in the town of al-'Amarah. A week later,  the 1st Mechanized Infantry Division was moved by train to the  north and took up positions in the area of Makhmur. The 24th  Armored Brigade, supplied with T-55 tanks, is its only armored  brigade.    The ITC did not give a clear reason for this change in which  the more advanced tanks withdrew to be replaced by older tanks  to carry out "the expected attack." The explanation is perhaps  that the Iraqi regime wants to protect its wing on the Iranian  border. The ITC also said that the al-'Abid forces of the  Republican Guard, under the command of Staff Brigadier General  Salih al-Hajj and his assistant Staff Colonel Nizar Husayn  al-Husayni, have also moved up to the northern region and taken  up positions near al-Mawsil dam with brigades deployed in  Shaykhan, Fulyfilah, and Fa'idah. The changes also included  withdrawal of the guard units near the contact lines and  deployment of these units in towns. That was confirmed by  Peshmerga forces and also by patrols of the Unified Iraqi  National Congress [UING].    The ITC quoted its correspondent in al-Mawsil as saying  that,  during his visit to the town on 23 February, Saddam Husayn met  with the party leaders and armed forces commanders in the  northern intelligence service building in the town and told them  that "he decided to attack" the region of Kurdistan during the  'Id al-Fitr period. That was accompanied by measures denoting  aggressive intent. The Saddam Hospital in Karkuk was vacated to  be ready to receive the wounded. The town of Karkuk was  fortified and on the night of Monday, 28 February and in the  early hours of Tuesday 1 March some armored units moved toward  the areas of Bardarash and Shaykhan but stopped short of the  contact line.    That prompted the Peshmerga Ministry in northern Iraq to  send  a notification to the UINC, the UN Coordination Commission, and  the United Nations on 2 March warning of an imminent aggression  against Kurdistan.    The statement added: The Peshmerga forces monitored major  Iraqi forces movements including armor and heavy artillery in  the direction of the areas of Fa'idah, Shaykhan, Ba'idrah,  Bardarash, and Faysh Khabur along the contact line. Our  correspondent in al-Mawsil says there is much talk in the Iraqi  Army's officers' circles in the town about the possibility of an  offensive. As a result, the Dahuk [Peshmerga] command requested  a meeting with the UN Coordination Commission.    The ITC correspondent in Dahuk says that officers of that  commission went to the Dahuk command on 2 March and met with  Babakr, the Peshmerga commander in that area, and a number of  Kurdistan Government officials.</p>

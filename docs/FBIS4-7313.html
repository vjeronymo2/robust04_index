			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The International Monetary  Fund (IMF) underestimated the Japanese economy in its recent  economic outlook, a senior Economic Planning Agency (EPA)  official said Friday [22 April].    Tsutomu Tanaka, the EPA's vice minister, said the IMF did  not  sufficiently take into account the effects of Japan's economic  stimulus package and signs of recovery seen lately in  consumption.    "It is difficult to understand why the IMF revised down its  projection for Japanese economy from the previous outlook issued  lastfall," Tanaka said.    The IMF issued an outlook for world economy earlier this  week, saying Japan's economy is expected to stay sluggish in  1994, with the annual growth rate remaining weak at 0.7 percent,  revised down from a 2.0 percent growth forecast by itself last  September.    Asked about a drop in the nation's February household  spending, Tanaka admitted that the recovery is not yet strong.    "Because the recovery momentum is still weak, it is easily  affected by such things as unfavorable weather," he said.    On Thursday, the government announced the February household  spending dropped by 0.5 percent from a year earlier, ending a  four- month streak of rise on year. It attributed the drop  partly to snowfalls that prevented consumers from shopping.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, former Yugoslav president and </F> current president of the Croat Lower House, and Josip Manolic,  president of the Croat Upper House, by Erich Rathfelder; place  and date not given: "`Tudjman Must Resign'"]    [Text] [Rathfelder] Mr. Manolic, Mr. Mesic, you were  founding members of the present Croatian government party, the  Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ), and now you want to form a  new party. Why?    [Manolic] We can no longer work in a party that approves of  the policy conducted by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. We  have been following this president's deficiencies with great  concern for a year now. What was crucial to our decision is the  disagreement over policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is once  again making sad headlines, but we have also been concerned  about the development of democracy in our country.    [Rathfelder] What mistakes has Tudjman made in Bosnia?    [Manolic] We were both in favor of a single  Bosnia-Herzegovina within its acknowledged borders. The three  nations were to have equal rights there. But even before the  war started, Tudjman agreed with Serb President Milosevic to  split up Bosnia-Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia. Neither  Milosevic nor Tudjman had, however, expected the Muslims to  resist this plan so vigorously. When the plans for division  failed, the Croatian president, in agreement with the lobby of  Croatian Western Herzegovina, decided more than a year ago to  start a war against the Muslims. This was a destructive act for  Croatian politics.    [Mesic] The war in Bosnia is a truly absurd situation that  is unprecedented in history. Croatia fought its only ally, the  Bosnian Muslims, although we are still inferior to our main  adversary. Thank goodness the Washington Agreement, which we  warmly welcome, has changed the parameters of policy. What  particularly pleases me is that reconciliation is going  comparatively smoothly. This shows that the hatred between the  two nations was artificially created. There should never have  been a war between the two.    [Rathfelder] How can you explain Tudjman's sudden change of  opinion?    [Mesic] We do not know whether Tudjman has changed his  personal view. The fact is that after the Washington Agreement  all those who were in power before in Herceg-Bosna are still  there; this means all those who wanted to divide Bosnia, who  promoted the war, and who are only interested in establishing  the state of Herceg-Bosna in spite of the agreed federation.    [Manolic] This touches on the second reason we want to  disassociate ourselves from Tudjman. We want Croatia to become  a constitutional state where human rights and democratic freedom  are observed. Undemocratic practices have also been noticeable  in the government party HDZ. We wanted to democratize it.    [Rathfelder] Does forming a new party mean that you have  given up hope that the HDZ can be reformed?    [Manolic] Not only that. A new party will strengthen the  democratic opposition in Croatia. A strong opposition could  make various institutions more democratic. This is the first  step. The second step would be to prevent the president from  conducting his dishonest policy.    [Rathfelder] Will you manage to pull enough HDZ  parliamentarians over to your side to make their absolute  majority in parliament totter?    [Manolic] There have, of course, been intense discussions.  This is why Tudjman is getting nervous; they are trying to  pressure us. All government party deputies have been urged to  declare their loyalty to Tudjman. Our telephones are being  monitored, and police measures are reminiscent of those taken  against dissidents during the communist era.    When we formed the HDZ, we wanted to break the one-party  rule  of the old regime. In this respect, there were no differences  between myself and Tudjman. Like Tudjman, I was a communist; we  wanted to continue the tradition of the Croatian Spring of 1971  and create a democratic Croatia. But Tudjman has kept the old  leadership principles, he makes all decisions autocratically.    [Rathfelder] Tudjman still has plenty of support. And he is  backed by the powerful clan of the Herzegovinians.    [Mesic] These politicians from western Herzegovina are not  powerful. The majority of Croatians and the entire church have  spoken out against the policy of dividing Bosnia. Certain  people are responsible for establishing concentration camps.  There was hope of finding a reason to accuse the Bosnian Army  of driving Croats out by withdrawing Croat forces from several  areas in central Bosnia. They have destroyed a large part of  Mostar. And this dishonest policy was supported by Zagreb.    [Rathfelder] This is a harsh attack on Tudjman! Does this  mean he has to resign?    [Mesic] He must, indeed, draw the conclusions.    [Rathfelder] Why did you not act a year ago? You might  have been able to prevent the catastrophe then.    [Manolic] If we had been more firm at that time, we would  have been eliminated. Croatian paramilitary forces were  established in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their crimes were supported  by Defense Minister Gojko Susak. And these people would not  even have survived for a month, if Tudjman had not supported  this course.    [Rathfelder] Is the public in Croatia aware of the Croatian  crimes?    [Mesic] I do not think so. There is a media blockade;  Croatian television has played the worst role in this war. But  the war criminals will be persecuted. They must be convicted by  the courts. We know who killed Muslims in Stupni Do, Ahmici,  and Prozor. Some murderers have changed their names, others are  living here in Zagreb, in the Intercontinental Hotel, protected  by Minister Susak (Bosnian-Croat leader Mate Boban, E.R.).    [Rathfelder] Is all this digging Tudjman's political grave?    [Mesic] This policy was exclusively his choice. But you  cannot ignore international responsibility in this context. The  international community has had its share in the war in Bosnia.  Feeding the victims before they are killed is simply not enough.  Lord Owen promoted a division of Bosnia rather than safeguarding  the unity of the state. Serbia was encouraged to continue its  aggression, and Croatia was tempted with the prospect of gaining  27 percent of the Bosnian territory. But the resistance of the  Bosnian Muslims has confused the international scene.</p>

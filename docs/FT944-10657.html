			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (10): Success stimulates - The gold sector, from ore to earrings Gold crops up in some of Bolivia's most unlikely-looking settings. The promising Don Mario deposit, jointly owned by Billiton of the US and Bolivia's Emusa, juts out starkly bare above the lush surrounding vegetation of the eastern jungle. The rich Inti Raymi gold mine, Bolivian-run but now majority owned by Battle Mountain of the US, lies on the barren plains of the Altiplano, lifeless but for a few small herds of vicuna. Inti Raymi claims to be South America's most modern and technically advanced gold mine. It is also one of the largest, with 1994 output expected to top 300,000 ounces. 'It's acting as a magnet for other prospective investors,' says Mr Charles Bruce of Mintec, a private mining consultancy which operates in Bolivia in association with Minproc. Mr Bruce has been evaluating for clients more than 150 claims in Bolivia's western cordillera, hitherto neglected by miners. He is 'convinced we'll see at least eight gold mines developed in this area.' Bolivia's gold output, an estimated four tonnes in 1991, is already about three times that now - 'and likely to triple again in another five years,' says Mr Bruce. Inti Raymi started back in 1982 as Bolivia's first small open-pit operation, leaching oxides for gold and silver. By 1986, it was producing a relatively modest 30,000 ounces of gold a year. But for Bolivians, accustomed to traditional underground mining, Inti Raymi's technology already represented a quantum leap. Just two years ago, Battle Mountain increased its stake to 88 per cent. An investment of Dollars 160m (including Dollars 40m each from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Opic, plus Dollars 15m from CAF, the Andean Development Corporation) permitted construction of an agitation leaching plant and a vast 2.5km-diameter tailings dam designed by Knight Piesold. With 2.3 grams of gold per tonne of ore and production costs at Dollars 220 an ounce, Inti Raymi is attractive business. In this, its first full year of operation, sales are expected to top Dollars 105m. Next year, a new recovery plant will boost output to some 320,000 ounces. Inti Raymi's success has helped stimulate investor interest in Bolivian gold. In early October, three foreign companies won concessions for a total of 175,000ha of potentially attractive gold deposits, owned but never developed by state mining company Comibol, in Bolivia's western cordillera. One section went to American Barrick, another to La Barca (a Battle Mountain joint venture with Emusa) and the third to Samex, a new Canadian-Bolivian joint venture. The three beat off bids from Auspac of Australia, and Orvana, Echo Bay and Teck, all of Canada. The other facet of Bolivia's incipient gold bonanza is hundreds of kilometres from the ore deposits. Perched above the modern city of La Paz lies a sprawling, often ramshackle town known simply as 'El Alto': the heights. Most of El Alto's inhabitants are country folk, escaping the crushing poverty of the barren Altiplano.  Many of them are miners and their families, refugees from the mid-1980s tin crisis which threw tens of thousands out of work. Set amidst tyre repair shops and small grocery stores, down an unsurfaced side-road, is El Alto's response to the unemployment problem: a collection of buildings where 400 youngsters make gold jewellery for export. This year, this company, Orbol, will export bracelets, earrings and gold chains worth nearly Dollars 100m. Located in the nearby industrial free zone of El Alto is Christies, a joint venture between Bolivian entrepreneur Ms Christina Leon and Italian jewellery makers Gori &amp; Zucchi. Christies employs some 600 in its main factory with another 1,400 outworkers in surrounding villages who painstakingly thread tiny links for gold chain necklaces. 'Gold jewellery has been an enormous success story,' says Mr Carlos Morales, trade and industry minister. In the first half of 1994 alone, exports in this category earned Bolivia Dollars 53.8m, more than three times the revenue for the same period last year. And most of that comes from a handful of factories and small workshops in La Paz. Orbol started operations almost six years ago. The initial stimulus came from the 'Ritex' law which allows temporary duty-free import of goods to be re-exported under the 'maquila' process. 'At first, we imported 100 per cent of our gold as wire from the US, transformed it into jewellery and re-exported,' says Mr Jesus Sillerico, general manager. 'Now we're buying 85 per cent of our gold locally from small producers and co-operatives. Most of that used to leave Bolivia as contraband with no benefit to the country.' Orbol's gold jewellery is aimed at mass market, distributed through some 40 wholesalers mostly within the US. The gold is lightweight and hollow but workmanship is good quality. At start-up, Orbol brought in craftsmen from Mexico and Peru to train locals. Orbol and a handful of similar outfits now employ thousands of Bolivians, almost all young, often straight from the countryside and in their first jobs. Working conditions are unsophisticated but relaxed and workers are apparently content with the Dollars 100-Dollars 120 they can take home each month. Mr Sillerico says that even at these wages, profit margins are slim. The tax drawback system, he says, returns to exporters the equivalent of 5.4 per cent of sales; profits are maybe 1.5 per cent. 'We're doing what the country needs most - providing work and earning foreign exchange,' he says. 'But we couldn't survive without incentives. The jewellery export business will continue as long as the government doesn't change the rules of the game.'</p>

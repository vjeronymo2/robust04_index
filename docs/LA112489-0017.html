			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BASKETBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> MARYMOUNT HAS A NEW OFFENSE, 12 NEW PLAYERS AND MORE TALENT  </P> <P> A powerful inside offense isn't the only new thing on the Marymount Palos  Verdes basketball team.  </P> <P> The Mariners have 12 fresh faces and they'll have to do without last year's  stars -- guards James Anderson and Ernie Woods -- who almost single-handedly  carried the team as the state's third- and sixth-leading scorers.  </P> <P> Coach Jim Masterson isn't overly concerned, though. He says that although this  team doesn't have stars, it's got more talent. For the fifth-year coach, that  means improvement over last year's dismal 7-21 record (3-11 in the Southern  California Athletic Conference).  </P> <P> "We're better balanced," he said. "We're going to have a lot of people  contributing this year."  </P> <P> Like last season, the Mariners' three-guard offense will do a lot of fast  breaking and apply pressure defensively. Three consistent inside scorers have  shifted last year's strength from the outside to the inside.  </P> <P> Center Warren Cox has been the most effective. The 6-foot-6, 205-pound freshman  from the Bahamas averages 20 points and 11 rebounds in the Mariners' three  games.  </P> <P> "He's a beast," Masterson said. "He's one of the strongest players I've ever  coached. He's fast, and he's an incredible leaper."  </P> <P> Power forward Kevin Johnson (6-5, 235) is the team's second leading scorer with  a 12.7 average. The freshman is battling with sophomore Kelly Black (6-6, 190),  for that starting position.  </P> <P> The three starting guards are freshman Lenny Kai (Kamehameha High School in  Hawaii) and sophomores Bryon Flournoy and Brian Martin. Flournoy, the point  guard, averaged 6.5 assists as a part-time starter last year.  </P> <P> Martin and Kai have two strong competitors striving for their spots. Freshman  Kerry Baker (R. M. Bailey High School in the Bahamas) is a solid contender for  Martin's swing guard position and freshman Ron Dinnel (Rolling Hills High) for  Kai's off-guard spot.  </P> <P> "It's really nice to have so many players working out," said Masterson, who has  a roster of 14. "Even with injuries and the flu, we can still scrimmage. Last  year, even when all showed up, we couldn't scrimmage."  </P> <P> A coaches' poll voted Marymount fourth in the seven-member SCAC. L.A. City was  first, Harbor second and Compton third.  </P></p>

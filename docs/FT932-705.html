			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: The Baghdad Butcher The Butcher of Baghdad by John Spurling at the Grace Theatre (Latchmere) is a series of stories beautifully angled at President Saddam Hussein. It amounts to a combination of 1001 Nights and the last hours of the Gulf War in February 1991. This is no play for revisiting, but it makes thoughtful arresting theatre. The scene opens with a cleaver swinging like a pendulum. We are in Saddam's command bunker, waiting for reports from the front. The play never names Saddam, but refers to him as President or by titles like 'Commander of the Faithful, Vice-Regent of Allah.' The President's mistress, Shahrazad, beguiles the hours with tales of the Caliph and his poet-buffoon Ishak. A skein of stories unwinds, beginning with a tangle over a lamb cutlet in 'The Poet and The Butcher' and continuing with short homilies on power and fate in 'The Story of the Indispensable Wasir' and 'The Story of the Death of Abdullah The Food Taster.' Each illustrates the implacable face of Islam where the Caliph's whim is law, his power infinite and his decrees absolute. Each calls up memories of the September 1980 offensive against Iran, and of how insignificant the 400,000 losses then and the 100,000 losses now seemed to be in the eye of Allah. And each recognises the demographic diversity of a country not much bigger than Sweden filled with Shiite Moslems, Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Christians living uneasily together. The contemporary scenes are researched, and Spurling makes a blustering encounter as the President hears of the Scud missile which hit the Daharan air base in Saudi Arabia, killing 28 Americans. Eventually, the President broadcasts his satisfaction with his army's great victory, and settles on a ceasefire. Shahrazad has poisoned herself in attempting to kill him, and as she dies, it means nothing more than a speck of sand on the beach. The acting, particularly from the opal-voiced Mary Keegan and the gravelly David Acton as Shahrazad and the President, makes the most of the small stage. Director Andrew Visnevski and designer Katrina Lindsay manage the movement and lighting to keep the action flowing and lucid. Grace Theatre at the Latchmere (071 228 2620) until July 10</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Cheers as Dow holds its nerve above 3,000 THE Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the psychologically important level of 3,000 points for the first time yesterday. When Mr Richard Grasso, president and executive vice-chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, rang the closing bell to a volley of cheers from the floor, the Dow was up 17.58 at 3,004.46, eclipsing the previous record close of 2,999.75, achieved on July 16 and 17 1990. Investors had rushed to buy stocks in expectation of a brisk recovery in the US economy, and in celebration of some unexpectedly good quarterly results from US companies. Turnover on the NYSE for the day, buoyed by heavy computer program trading, was exceptionally heavy at 248.9m shares, the biggest volume since March 5. The Dow, which has risen 14 per cent since the beginning of the year, had climbed over 3,000 on five previous occasions - March 6 being the most recent - but each time lost its nerve by close of trading. The index first appeared in the Wall Street Journal on October 8 1896, reaching 100 in 1906. On November 14 1972, 66 years later, it had scaled the heights of 1,000. On January 8 1987 the index closed above 2,000. Set against this leisurely background, the Dow has positively raced through its third thousand. The surge in US share prices this week, which has spurred shares in London and the rest of Europe to near record levels, reflects growing confidence in the country's economic outlook. It also confounds the predictions that the market would react badly to the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Analysts said investors believe the Fed's decision should create the conditions for a sustained, inflation-free recovery. Two other main stock indices also finished at record levels. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.84 to 390.46 and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter shares climbed 4.55 to 511.30. World stocks, Page 41 London stocks, Page 44</p>

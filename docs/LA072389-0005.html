			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: THE PURR-FECT VOICE  </P> <P> When MGM-UA's "Pink Panther" series debuts next year on CBS -- mixing animation  and live action -- don't expect the quality of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."  MGM-UA TV chief David Gerber tells us the animation will be several cuts above  typical Saturday morning fare, "but I don't think any TV show could emulate the  technique of 'Roger Rabbit' . . . without going bankrupt. We're going to  concentrate on the character."  </P> <P> The series had been in the planning stages for nearly two years, without a  green light. Then "Roger Rabbit" hit the big screen, said co-producer George  Schenck, and its blockbuster success "helped make this possible. Before, no one  thought it could be done."  </P> <P> The comic series about a feline that helps out a young reporter (Charlie  Schlatter) could be a late-season replacement.  </P> <P> But first, Gerber said, the producers must find a vocal talent who can provide  a sound for the clever cat. After hundreds of taped auditions, they're still  waiting to hear "the voice with the right texture." Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Tory rebels wait to test public mood IT WAS UNCERTAIN last night whether Mr Michael Heseltine's statement on the future of the coal industry will be enough to bring Conservative rebels into line by the end of tomorrow's debate. Most MPs seemed to believe that, barring further upsets, the trade and industry secretary's apologium will prove just sufficient to confine the rebellion to a half-dozen MPs. If so, his compromise package will win a narrow vote in the Commons. Clearly, a significant number of potential rebels have swung back behind the government. Mr Tim Devlin, MP for South Stockton, revealed that he had planned to resign as parliamentary private secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, over the pit closures. But he now had decided to vote, albeit reluctantly, with the government. 'We have at least had some progress with this statement,' he said. Similar conversions were announced by Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mr Robert Adley (Christchurch), and Mr James Cran (Beverley) who described the statement as a 'climbdown'. Nonetheless, the verdict among some Conservative backbenchers last night was that much may depend on the public's reaction. Several MPs expressed dissatisfaction that Mr Heseltine had not included all 31 pits in the moratorium on closures and that the inquiry to be held into the industry does not look set to examine an alternative energy policy. Mr Winston Churchill and Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, two of the most prominent protestors, indicated that they would continue to vote against the plan as they were unsatisfied by the scale of the review and the decision to press on with the shutdown of 10 pits. Mrs Peacock (Batley and Spen) said that an initial judgment suggested that the review would result in a slight delay of the closure programme and not a thorough re-evaluation of policy. 'I don't think it goes far enough,' she said. Mr Churchill (Davyhulme) said that the review was inadequate as it failed to take a strategic look at Britain's energy needs in the decades ahead. On the Commons vote, he added: 'I believe the government will be running a very great risk if they go ahead.' Disquiet at the anger expressed in MPs bulging postbags means there will be no complacency in the whips' office until the vote is harvested at 10pm tomorrow. Furthermore, the outcome will only be clearer after the detail is unravelled. Yesterday many Tory MPs remained confused as to what shape Mr Heseltine's review would take. It was clear that some MPs are exploiting the government's vulnerability to press for still more concessions. If Mr Heseltine's compromise clearly fails to mollify the fury of the public, now inundating MPs with up to 50 letters a day, then the current could turn against the government again. 'Forty-eight hours,' said one government whip last night, 'is proving a long time in politics.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president  of the republic of Serb Krajina, said today that the objective  of his visit to Geneva was to find a solution for the  continuation of negotiations with Croatia.    "Prior to my departure, we in the inner leadership of the  republic of Serb Krajina had agreed to display flexibility and  agree to discuss economic relations on the territory of Serb  Krajina with the Croatian delegation," Martic said in a  statement carried by Radio Belgrade.    "Repeated Croatian media claims that the republic of Serb  Krajina is an integral part of Croatia should not irritate us,  because it is clear here in Geneva and to the whole world that  this is not the case. We were received at the highest level  here, and I could safely say that this was a diplomatic victory  for us, victory in the sense that cochairmen Owen and  Stoltenberg provided certain guarantees that they would be  absolutely in favor of unprecedented sanctions being introduced  against Croatia in the case of fresh aggression by Croatia  against the republic of Serb Krajina. We were told the same by  Akashi," Martic said.    According to him, the talks to be held in Plitvice on 16 and  17 June will not prejudice political solutions. This, Martic  believes, "will be an opportunity for the whole world and the  reporters gathered in Plitvica to find out to whom Plitvice  really belongs."    Likewise, he said that he had also received assurances from  the cochairmen, as well as Mr. Akashi, that they would do  everything to ensure that Croatia honored the first stage of the  agreement on the cessation of hostilities concerning those  articles it had not honored in the past. "Therefore, this is a  great step forward, and I personally believe that Akashi will  stand by his word and that this will be carried out  immediately," Martic said. Martic also said that the Serb  Krajina delegation had been received in Geneva "at the highest  level" and that "an important diplomatic move" had been made,  which "opened the front door in international relations where  the republic of Serb Krajina is concerned."</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The future of school education THE EDUCATION white paper due to be published next month will set out the government's plans for state schools in England and Wales for the next 25 years. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is determined that it should enhance parental choice by increasing the number of schools opting out of local education authority control. But opting-out is raising questions over the future of school education to which the white paper will need to find convincing answers. So far fewer than 250 of the 25,000 schools in England and Wales have become grant-maintained - funded from Whitehall, with their governors enjoying almost unfettered control over management, budgets and recruitment. But with the Conservative election victory, the trickle is turning into a flood, as 150 requests for information now pour in every day. By the next election, most of the 4,000 secondary schools are likely to have opted out. The white paper will include measures to allow the smaller primary schools to opt out in consortia. Such growth is likely to increase the sort of problems of access which have appeared in areas where schools have already opted out. In the London borough of Bromley, for example, several hundred parents recently found that there was no place for their children next autumn at the nearest secondary schools, as opted-out schools cast their nets more widely. Similar problems have emerged in the London borough of Hillingdon. Local education authorities may find themselves hard-pressed to ensure school places for all as opting-out becomes the norm. Parents could find that their choice has diminished rather than increased. Progress indicators These problems will be exacerbated once information about examination results, truancy rates and other indicators of schools' progress is published in league tables. It is entirely right that such information should be collected and disseminated - but it is clear what the consequences will be. Middle class and highly motivated parents will gravitate towards schools with the best results, while those at the bottom of the league tables will find it harder to attract able children. A rational headteacher  -whose salary reflects the size of the school roll - will try to select entrants who are less likely to depress performance. Serious deficiencies Two consequences follow from this. The first is that there will be a group of pupils no grant-maintained school will wish to accept - including those with poor attendance records or a history of disturbance. Yesterday's Audit Commission report has highlighted serious deficiencies which already exist in provision for the one in five children with special educational needs. These will be harder to tackle if schools become fussier about their entrants. The second is that such pupils will be concentrated in schools remaining in local authority control, which will become the educator of the last resort. This will increase, rather than decrease, the number of inner-city sink schools which the government hopes to tackle. The creation of a series of 'sin bins' is a policy no government should contemplate. One solution which the white paper might consider is a funding incentive to encourage grant-maintained schools to accept a fair share of children with special needs. Such pupils could attract additional per capita grants, for example. The local education authority might also be given the right to nominate a proportion of pupils to grant-maintained schools to ensure that all schools accept a cross-section of abilities and backgrounds. Whatever the solution, it is clear that there remains a role for an elected local education authority even after opting out has become the norm. Rather than providing school education, the local education authorities would then assume a new purchaser role, ensuring that all children have equal access to education and planning local provision. The white paper should resist the temptation to abolish them in favour of some quango or Whitehall control. If it does, it will rue the day - and, as with the poll tax, virtually every independent voice will have told it so.</p>

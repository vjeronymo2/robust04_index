			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: EBRD: striking a wrong chord and reluctant to lend (2) Sir, We refer to your timely article drawing attention to the low level of lending by the EBRD. Many of our contacts in the Ukraine are convinced that the EBRD does not really wish to assist the Ukraine to develop its economy. Their conclusions are based on: The reluctance of the EBRD to allow this republic to sell the products where it has a real economic advantage - eg agricultural produce and steel - in the EC; The extreme difficulty in obtaining loans from EBRD. We have already had meetings with the director of two Ukrainian factories which have had dealings with the EBRD and which feel that the bank has not given them any assistance. Indeed, in the case of the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolaev, according to your article 'Old ways dull the call to a new Ukraine' (January 5), the EBRD justified its refusal to make loans to the shipyard on the grounds that Mr Yuri Makarov, the yard's director general, did not wish to build oil tankers instead of aircraft carriers; this cannot be true as the yard was already building oil tankers of 45,000 tonne dead weight and Mr Makarov pointed this out to us on our subsequent visit to his yard. It appears that the EBRD is insisting on unrealistic conditions in particular on total privatisation at breakneck speed, before agreeing to make loans. If it maintains its present inflexible and bureaucratic approach, we fear that its overheads will exceed its loans for many years to come.

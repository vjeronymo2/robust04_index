			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Panamanian presidential candidate Ernesto </F> Perez Balladares of the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD)  during the final presidential "debate" sponsored by the Latin  American Institute of Advanced Study and the Media Presidential  Debate Committee; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] My fellow countrymen, the presidential campaign is  nearly over. To me, this has not been simply a three-month-long  campaign but, rather, a campaign of many years that included  frequent journeys throughout the country. It began by sharing  the country's problems; later, by examining its most pressing  needs; and now, by presenting government proposals that  originate from an unwavering, firm, and sincere premise that  there will be no hatred, no settling of scores, no retaliation,  and no persecution. I am committed to conducting an all-out and  unwavering war against unemployment, because, to me, economic  growth means nothing if, at the same time, the population is not  able to satisfy its most basic needs. What use is there in  honoring international commitments if there are thousands of  Panamanians who at one time enjoyed potable water but today are  deprived of it, or only have access to it during the early  morning hours?    It is impossible for me to agree that everything has  improved  in Panama simply because a number of skyscrapers have been  built, especially if at the same time there is an increase in  the number of homeless children begging for money at every  streetlight, dropping out of schools, or getting involved in  crime. I am unmoved by figures that only reflect the opulence  of the few, when the majority of people are blocked from any  advancement.    We have prepared an integrated, coherent, and ambitious  program. Moreover, not one sector of the population has been  left out. The program includes a respectable retirement for  those who have already fulfilled their share of sacrifice and  service. It also includes hope for members of the younger  generation who are about to enter the workforce, for those who  live in turbulent and chaotic urban centers, and for those who  prefer to live in the countryside. This program is intended to  once again return the nation to all of us, without exclusion,  retaliation, and discrimination, allowing the best and brightest  find a place in government service without first having to pass  through the appalling bureaucratic quota screening and political  party distribution system.    I feel very sad when a youngster has to drop out of school  to  help his mother support his younger brothers. I would prefer  that this did not happen. Also, I do not want to see parents  sacrificing everything -- recreation, enjoyment, and, in many  instances, food itself -- just to be able to send their children  to school, knowing beforehand that when they graduate they will  not find a job.    I feel very sad when I read that Panama has become a country  with ever-increasing violent crime, or that, as a nation, we are  being linked to corruption. This situation cannot be resolved  by merely strengthening the police, because the problem does not  lie there. Panamanians turn to crime because they have lost all  hope of finding a good job, or because corruption pays better  than honest work. I am a firm believer in punishing criminals,  but I am also a believer in their rehabilitation. Nevertheless,  I believe in combating crime by combating the roots of crime.  Therefore, we must treat those youngsters on drugs, while drug  traffickers and money launderers must be punished without  flinching. At the same time, we must prevent Panamanian  households from disintegrating and prevent others from following  the same course.    I am also seeking to have all Panamanians once again feel  proud of having the country represented in a dignified manner in  all international forums. We have been the object of ridicule  for too many years, as if in Panama we fall short of being  reputable. My wife and I would like to lift the Presidency of  the Republic to a place of responsibility and reliability -- a  place the country demands and deserves. We would like to see  all Panamanians measured by the maturity of our society and not  by our politicians' whims.    My fellow countrymen, in countering my proposals my  adversaries have spared no slander or insults. As part of that  mudslinging campaign, they have not even left my wife,  daughters, or my elderly parents unscathed. Nevertheless, I  said it at the beginning of the campaign, and I can again say it  proudly at the end: Not one single insult against any candidate  will be heard from me. Consistent with this conduct, you can be  sure that my family and I have forgiven our detractors. We have  turned away from that black cloud of politics, and we are  preparing to build a better future for all Panamanians.    The past -- the distant as well as the recent past -- must  stay behind us forever. There is no possibility whatsoever of  returning to militarism. On this, I have given my word, and all  of those who accompanied me during the campaign are committed to  this. Most of all, those who will accompany me as part of the  government are committed to this. The Panama of the future, the  Panama of hope, cannot be built on the swamps of recrimination  and hatred. We seek to build it on the solid ground of harmony  and respect for the opinions of others. We are seeking to build  it with a team completely divorced from political affiliation or  party quotas -- a team comprising men and women committed only  to the country and of whom we demand just two things: honesty  and efficiency. That is why all -- I repeat -- all Panamanians  know who represents their final hope.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The outgoing prime minister and the HSP  [Hungarian Socialist Party] and SZDSZ [Alliance of Free  Democrats] leaders have agreed that the current economic  directors of Hungarian Television and Hungarian Radio should be  entrusted with the management of the two bodies on a temporary  basis. The HSP and the SZDSZ are preparing to form a government  coalition. The three politicians' explain their decision by the  need to avoid a leaderless state of affairs in the two national  media institutions.    This is contained, among other things, in the government  communique published after the morning meeting of Peter Boross  [outgoing prime minister], Gyula Horn [HSP candidate for the  post of prime minister] and SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe.

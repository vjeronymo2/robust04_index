			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / French trade gap widens FRANCE'S foreign trade deficit widened slightly in March, according to provisional figures published yesterday, writes Ian Davidson in Paris. The slowdown in demand in France and abroad led to unchanged levels of exports, while imports increased very slightly. The underlying trend points to a further gentle deterioration ahead. The seasonally adjusted deficit in March grew to FFr4.7bn (Pounds 460m), compared with FFr3.5bn in February and FFr5.7bn in January. The deficit in industrial goods grew to FFr4.5bn, compared with FFr1.9bn in February.</p>

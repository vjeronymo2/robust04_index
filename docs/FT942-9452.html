			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Time is money Airport shoppers are to be courted even more aggressively by the British Airports Authority, in its effort to turn the time that travellers spend at airports into revenues for BAA. For travellers in two minds over making impulse purchases, BAA has announced a Worldwide Guarantee scheme. This offers 'no quibble' refunds on products bought at any of BAA's seven UK airports, whether they are faulty or simply unwanted. Advice on how to spend money and fill shopping time will also be available from help desks at all BAA airport terminals. And for the forward planner, BAA has introduced a Freephone shopping line (0800 844844) to allow travellers to check on items in stock and reserve or order goods. A freepost address for the Worldwide Guarantee, and postage refunds to users outside the UK, will give travellers 'the confidence to buy goods in the knowledge that if they are not satisfied for any reason they will get their money back, no questions asked', according to Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive. And why is BAA so keen to win shoppers' confidence - even at the price of making refunds later? 'The money we make from people shopping at the airports is ploughed back into providing new facilities for all our customers,' says Sir John. 'This means that passengers win both ways.' As so, presumably, does BAA.</p>

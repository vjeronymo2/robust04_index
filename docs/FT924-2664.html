			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Gissing's 'Odd Women' - Theatre A nostalgic batch of old Remington typewriters appear as part of the setting at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, for Michael Meyer's adaptation of George Gissing's feminist novel The Odd Women. At least one sturdy machine is still in good working-order as we see when Sorcha Cusack, playing Mary Barfoot, bashes out a letter on it. Mary and her colleague Rhoda Nunn (Lorraine Ashbourne) run an establishment where young women are taught how to type. These are 'the odd women' of the title - women who have failed to find husbands to keep them. Barfoot and Nunn aim to give their pupils a better deal in the harsh economic climate of Victorian London than to become nursemaids or shop-assistants - or just wither away as invalids and/or alcoholics among the genteel poor. It was a remarkably prescient book when it first appeared in 1893, and in spite of its period flavour still seems topical. It would be hard to think of anyone better qualified than Michael Meyer, the translator of Ibsen, to bring it to the stage. Gissing had indeed read Ibsen in German and much admired him, sharing his view of the plight of many contemporary women but not, alas, his sense of dramatic economy. Meyer has to be content with a loose episodic narrative broken up into short scenes, with the stage-crew working over-time hauling sofas and sideboards on and off. But once this gradual build-up is accepted, the piece - in Braham Murray's production in the round - has considerable fascination. We observe one of the budding stenographers, Monica Madden (Lucy Scott), settle instead for the domestic life in the shape of marriage to an exceptionally dreary middle-aged man, Edmund Widdowson (Sean Arnold) whose only virtue is his bank balance, more than enough to keep her in the style to which she has hitherto been unaccustomed. As soon as they are married he reveals a nasty possessiveness precipitating her into an affair with an artist she meets at the Royal Academy Summer exhibition. The pace now quickens as Widdowson rejects his erring wife. Meanwhile her lover's friend Everard Barfoot (Paul Higgins) becomes enamoured of Rhoda Nunn, the dedicated female emancipator and typing instructress. Will his well-born masculine confidence and virility succeed in shattering her idealistic defences? The conflict anticipates the dramas of Shaw. Lorriane Ashbourne has too simplistically negative a view of her complex role for these scenes to work with maximum effectiveness. Lucy Scott is more successful in developing Monica's potential and there is good work by Susan Tordoff and Tilly Tremayne as her spinster sisters. The whole production should gain the Gissing cult some more converts. As a brilliant classics scholar of Owens College (Manchester University) Gissing was expelled, part of the over-harsh punishment for a theft of which he was convicted. This production helps to make amends. At the Royal Exchange Manchester until December 12</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SWEATSHOP BILL APPROVED, AWAITS GOVERNOR'S DECISION; L.A. UNION RALLY PLANNED  </P> <P> A bill aimed at cracking down on the latest proliferation of garment sweatshops  in the Orange and Los Angeles counties is heading to Gov. George Deukmejian's  desk.  </P> <P> The International Ladies' Garment Workers Union announced Friday that it would  stage a rally in the Los Angeles garment district next week calling on the  governor to approve the bill.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the Senate approved the bill 21 to 12, the minimum required for  passage. The measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles),  would make designer-name, garment-industry sweatshops, which employ underage  children and immigrants at sub-minimum wages, responsible for labor abuses  committed by their independent suppliers.  </P> <P> The bill was introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times  revealed that many independent contractors still run sweatshops paying as  little as $1.45 an hour to children and immigrants, including Southeast Asians  relocating to such Orange County communities as Garden Grove, Santa Ana and  Westminster.  </P> <P> Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held  "jointly liable" for labor and safety violations committed by their  subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of  clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops.  </P> <P> Depending on the complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece  rate often translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an  hour.  </P> <P> Hayden had predicted that his bill would pass the Legislature and said the  biggest test would be whether Deukmejian would sign it into law.  </P> <P> Linda Kerrigan, a spokesman for the Department of Industrial Relations, which  is responsible for state labor-law enforcement, said the agency has remained  neutral through the legislative debate and has not yet decided whether to  recommend that the governor sign or veto the bill.  </P> <P> Steve Nutter, regional director for the garment workers' union, on Friday  called the bill "more of a human rights issue than a labor issue." He said the  union will seek a meeting with the governor to urge him to approve the measure.  </P> <P> The bill's passage comes as the Industrial Relations Department, whose budget  for labor-law enforcement has already been slashed, faces another $7-million  shortfall as a result of the current budget crisis, a situation, Nutter said,  that opens the door to rampant abuses.  </P> <P> "I would imagine the amount of time actually spent doing garment industry  enforcement is small indeed, much smaller than 10 years ago," Nutter added.  </P></p>

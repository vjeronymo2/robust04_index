			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Mixed picture on inflation prospects poses problem for Clarke The old British problem of inflation will face Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, at their monthly monetary meeting today. At their last meeting they agreed a  1/4 percentage-point cut in base rates, to coincide with the publication of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report. But when that report forecast that underlying inflation would end 1995 at more than 3 per cent, in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range, and warned of an 'asymmetric' risk that inflation might be even higher than that, analysts started to question the authorities' judgment. Since then falls in bond markets around the world have indicated that investors are concerned about inflation. But analysts are divided on the prospects for prices. Some argue that economic growth is too weak to prompt inflation, especially with the impact of April's tax rises yet to be felt. The headline rate of inflation - the annual rise in the retail prices index  -was 2.5 per cent in in January compared with 1.9 per cent in December. But this was a statistical quirk. When calculating an annual rate, the monthly figure that falls out of the comparison is as important as the new figure. In January 1993 a round of mortgage cuts caused the RPI to fall 0.9 per cent. So even though the RPI fell 0.4 per cent in January 1994, the net effect was a rise in the annual rate. The index has fallen in three of the past four months and is only 0.1 per cent higher than its level last May. This figure disguises sharp price falls in sectors such as clothing. The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage movements, rose only slightly from 2.7 per cent in December to 2.8 per cent in January, mainly due to the effect of the Budget on excise duties. It looks set to stay much closer to the headline rate because of the disappearance of the effects of mortgage rate cuts after Black Wednesday. The Bank of England is not looking at the past, however, but trying to monitor price pressures two years ahead. The factors which will determine future inflation depend, in part, on which economic school one believes. But the main indicators are: Money supply. M0 (mainly notes and coins) has been growing well outside its zero to 4 per cent monitoring range but the government points to low interest rates, which reduce the cost of holding cash, as the main reason. Growth in M4 (broad money) is still at the low end of its 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range. Producer prices. Manufacturers' costs are still falling. Input prices fell 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to February, but output prices rose 3.7 per cent over the same period, showing that manufacturers have been widening margins. Wage rises. The rate of growth in wages is much slower than when Britain last emerged from recession in the early 1980s. Average earnings grew at only 3 per cent in the year to December. But there is concern that recent sharp falls in unemployment (January excepted), and the jump in headline inflation, might cause the level of pay settlements to increase. Commodities. The resurgence of enthusiasm for gold is cited by some, including the US Federal Reserve, as an indicator of inflationary expectations. But the price of oil remains subdued at about Dollars 13.50 a barrel. It is hard to see much inflationary pressure in this area. The immediate future for the headline rate is quite promising. In the months about to drop out of the annual comparison - February and March 1993 - the RPI rose 0.7 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively. The bigger unknown is April, when the index will gain from the lack of a Budget, but will lose from the imposition of value added tax on fuel, the restriction of tax relief on mortgages, and the dropping out of an April 1993 mortgage rate cut. So the governor and the chancellor have a mixed picture to discuss. The balance of inflationary indicators is probably positive but the reaction to last month's base rate cut might persuade them that caution is needed.</p>

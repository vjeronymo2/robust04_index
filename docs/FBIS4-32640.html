			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zeljko Buksa on speech of Army General Janko </F> Bobetko in Zagreb on 16 June: "We Will Probably Have to Force  the Occupying Forces Out!"]    [Text] The beginning of the education of the fourth  generation to attend officers school at the Petar Zrinski  Croatian Military College in Crnomerec, Zagreb, was celebrated  on Thursday [16 June]. According to Brigadier Miroslav  Jezercic, the college commander, this generation includes 400  soldiers who have proven their abilities in the homeland war and  will broaden their knowledge acquired in the war so as to  discharge their future tasks with even more success.    The college cadets were addressed by Army General Janko  Bobetko, the-Croatian Army chief of staff. He first remarked  that among those attending the college there were members of the  HVO [Croatian Defense Council], which is now part of the Army of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation.    Then he pointed out that the members of the Croatian Army  had  caused several incidents in small towns, which sometimes even  the directly responsible commanding officers had tried to cover  up.    "Nothing will make the Croatian people as angry as  impertinent and violent behavior by Croatian officers, because  they do not expect it from them. Such actions will not get us  very far. We should understand that many people have lost  relatives and friends in the war, which is why they are  sometimes depressed. However, the Croatian people have  entrusted you with their sons, and you are responsible for them,  and every wrong move that you make ruins the image of the  Croatian Army. This is why discipline should constantly be  increased and everything should be done to avoid such  incidents," General Bobetko emphasized.    Speaking about the present situation in Croatia, the chief  of  staff said that the war was not over yet. "There are several  hundred thousand people who are still not in their homes, and  they have been demanding increasingly often to return to their  towns, so we will probably have to force the occupying forces  out of Croatian territory. What we attack we absolutely must  occupy, because there can be no more excuses. Therefore, learn  as much as possible so that you can carry out all the tasks that  you will be assigned," General Bobetko told the cadets at the  officers school.    "No one has the right to a position for which they are not  qualified any longer, and there will be no more cheating as  there was at the beginning of the war, when the Croatian Army  consisted of volunteers. There will be no more leniency or  arbitrariness. The enemy, with whom we will square our  accounts, must know that the Croatian Army is capable of  carrying out anything that it is asked to. We have a lot of  work ahead of us," said General Bobetko at the end of his speech.</p>

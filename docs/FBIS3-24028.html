			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Danylovych Dumanskyy, head of the </F> Laboratory of Environmental Electromagnetic Factors: "Radar  Stations Are Especially Dangerous to Children"; time and place  not given]    [Text] In our special "Land of Khaki" edition we  described how the Greens blocked the construction of a  superpowerful radar station. Reactions to the Greens' success  varied, including "We've found someone to fight--and it's not  nuclear power plants; they pose no danger." "The Greens are only  hurting Ukraine's defense." To get to the bottom of things we  had our correspondent interview Professor Yuriy Danylovych  Dumanskyy, head of the Laboratory of Environmental  Electromagnetic Factors, Ukrainian Scientific-Hygienic  Center.    [Correspondent] Professor, do radar stations really pose a  danger to health?    [Dumanskyy] Radar stations are a big source of environmental  radiation, producing superhigh-frequency electromagnetic fields.  An electromagnetic field is very damaging to living organisms.  In human beings, for example, the central nervous system suffers  (memory is impaired and reactions slow down). It is especially  harmful to children, as we know from studies in Odessa. At high  levels a person suffers from headaches, fatigue, and  nervousness. Men's potency is reduced and women's menstrual  cycle is disrupted. The effect of the exposure accumulates, but  if it stops, the person recovers and the complaints stop.  Especially high levels (more than 10 milliwats per square  centimeter) cause clouding of the eye lens, the heat effect, and  hallucinations. Plant tissues die and, at high levels, burn.    [Correspondent] Is anybody watching over people's safety in  that regard?    [Dumanskyy] Hygienic normatives have been worked out to  ensure safe conditions for people living in the vicinity of  radar stations. On their basis the Health Ministry issued a  number of requirements to radar station owners involving  relocation, and certification of these units is underway.  However, responses to the requirements have been slow. For  example, the Defense Ministry pleads lack of funds. Moreover,  not all units are covered yet--for example, over-the-horizon  stations.    [Correspondent] Who are the owners, and where are the units  located?    [Dumanskyy] Primarily the Defense Ministry, which has  guidance stations, superpowerful space observation antennas, and  PTO [technical service point] stations. The rest are divided  into long-range and high-range (which are especially dangerous  because their rays often "cling" to the earth). Radar stations  are also used in civil aviation, maritime operations, and the  weather service.    Radar stations are located in population centers or (more  often) not far away. As a result, worrisome situations have  developed in Lvov, Mukachevo, Ivano-Frankovsk, Dnepropetrovsk,  Nikolayev, Odessa, Yevpatoriya, and Kiev. In Sevastopol the  field is so strong that in some places it makes neon lights go  on.    [Correspondent] What is to be done?    [Dumanskyy] Measures to prevent harmful effects of radar  stations include 1) Moving stations outside of populated areas;  2) Resettling the inhabitants; 3) Changing the stations'  operating modes; 4) Changing the angle of radiation; 5) Setting  up restricted radiation zones; 6) Planting woods; 7) Raising the  station above the locality; 8) Protective structures (banks,  fences, dikes, and so on.</p>

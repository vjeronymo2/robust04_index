			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Asean ministers agree free trade programme ECONOMIC ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) yesterday reached agreement on the main elements of a programme to turn the six-nation regional group into a free trade area by the year 2008. The six - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - will implement a common effective preferential tariff (CEPT) scheme on January 1, which will reduce over the next 15 years tariff rates on a range of manufactured and processed agricultural products traded among themselves. Tariff rates on these products are to be brought down to 20 per cent by the year 2003, and to 0-5 per cent by 2008, when the Asean free trade area (Afta) is formally created. Asean's senior economic officials still need to thrash out 'some minor technicalities' prior to the Afta launch in 70 days' time. Afta is designed to stimulate more intra-regional trade and attract foreign investment to the area, as a way to counteract the rise of regional trading blocs in North America and Europe. Asean economic ministers are to meet Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's trade minister, this weekend to discuss prospects for increased co-operation.</p>

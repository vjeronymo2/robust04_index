			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "State Keeps Tight Hold on Telecoms"] </F>   [Text] It has become a routine in China -- when a product  becomes popular, local authorities and enterprises scramble to  buy foreign production equipment.    In the 1980s, it was colour television sets and  refrigerators. Now in the 1990s, it is programme-controlled  telephone exchanges.    China is regarded as the last huge market for digital  telephone exchanges, and foreign and domestic electronics  manufacturers are all hungry for a piece of the pie.    But the Chinese Government is determined to avoid a  repetition of what happened to colour TVs.    It is estimated China will need about 13 million lines of  digital telephone exchanges in each of the next six years.    There are more than 120 manufacturers in the country, and  their annual capacity exceeds 10 million lines.    Experts believe that capacity will reach 23 million lines by  1996, of which 18 million will be for branch use.    Although capacity will soon exceed demand, many domestic  firms are eager to set up new production lines.    Experts and government officials worry that excessive  investment in foreign equipment wastes capital, and few  manufacturers can maintain efficient production scales.    To curb the zeal of new producers, the government has worked  out several regulations restricting such projects.    Only five large joint ventures will be allowed in China to  produce digital telephone exchanges for branch use.    Three are already in operation. The foreign partners are  Alcatel of Belgium, Siemens AG of Germany and NEC Corp of Japan.    China is negotiating with AT&amp;T of the United States and  Northern Telecom of Canada to establish two other joint ventures.    Officials stipulate that foreign companies must bring  advanced development and production technology if they are to  co-operate with China.    Some foreign electronics giants anxious about losing the  potentially massive market in China, are secretly looking for  local co-operative partners, trying to set up joint ventures  without approval from the central government.    Officials said that the government will adopt strict  measures  to stop such subterfuge.    A new regulation governing the use of foreign capital in  making programme-controlled telephone exchanges will soon be  published.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Tougher investor protection urged SELF-REGULATION of the financial services industry has failed the consumer and should be replaced by a statutory Office of Investor Protection, the Consumers' Association said yesterday. The group, in a review of the six-year-old Financial Services Act, said the present system was 'far too deeply flawed' to be remedied easily and the entire act should be scrapped. While acknowledging that the act had made some improvements in protecting investors, particularly in the provision of a compensation scheme for those who suffered losses, it said there were far more shortcomings. The association, a voluntary organisation with more than 800,000 members, said: 'There is considerable evidence that the regulatory system has delivered inadequate standards of monitoring and enforcement, resulting in unacceptably high levels of fraud and widespread mis-selling.' The association estimated that the annual loss to consumers in the first year of contracts being signed was about Pounds 250m. Charges are deducted in the first few years of a policy's life. As a result those who surrender early lose most or all of their premium payments. The association said the Financial Services Act, which allows many businesses to choose between several self-regulatory bodies, had created 'regulatory arbitrage', allowing large integrated groups to shop around for the most sympathetic regulator. In citing evidence of widespread mis-selling, the association noted that during the 1988-89 tax year, personal pensions were sold to 63,000 women with no earnings who did not even qualify for such plans. The association recommended that a regulator be established similar to those overseeing public utilities.</p>

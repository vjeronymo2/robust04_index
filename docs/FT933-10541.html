			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - United Kingdom The unwinding of the ERM is likely to give Britain the opportunity to cut interest rates earlier and deeper than expected, writes Emma Tucker. Although the base lending rate has dropped from 10 per cent to 6 per cent since September when sterling was forced out of the mechanism, many economists argue that the economy, on its way out of recession, would benefit from further monetary easing. The Treasury may choose to cut rates to cap the rise in sterling that is expected to follow an easing of interest rates across Europe. This would help keep the pound competitive, but might prompt nervousness at the Treasury and Bank of England about inflation. At present, inflation risks from low interest rates and a weak exchange rate are minimal. The headline inflation rate of 1.2 per cent is the lowest for 30 years with upward pressure on prices extremely weak after two years of recession. The possibility of lower interest rates, combined with stronger exports in a faster growing Europe, would boost the economy, but the effect would probably not be felt before next year. So far economists have been reluctant to upgrade their 1994 growth forecasts by more than  1/4 of a point. Nonetheless, a more robust recovery, aided by growth in Europe, would help the government reduce its budget deficit more quickly than anticipated. In March, the Treasury forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn this financial year. This may be downgraded in the November forecasts. A boost to UK manufacturing exports would also be good news for the jobless. The official count of unemployment has fallen for five successive months, but the total remains high at just under 3m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Railroad Administration [NRA] decided  to deprive locomotive engineers who belong to the National  Council of Locomotive Engineers of their public service official  status if they do not report to work by 1000 AM on 25 June,  considering that they have no intention to work for the railroad  any longer if they do not return to work by that time.    Some railroad workers left their work sites and as a result,  railroad operations have been repeatedly crippled, thus causing  confusion in society and to the national economy. In view of  the fact that this has a serious impact on overall national  affairs, the NRA issued "an emergency service directive" on the  morning of 24 June, and made a decision for such deprivation.    The NRA has estimated that the number of workers who belong  to the council and will not return to work by the deadline will  reach approximately 400.    [The newspaper adds in another article, that the NRA reports  trains are operating at 12 percent capacity as of the morning of  24 June.]</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Drayton Asia Trust restates net asset value FOLLOWING A request for clarification from the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, Drayton Asia Trust, the target of a bid from EFM Dragon, has accepted that the use of third-party estimates - the Financial Times - for its net asset value was inappropriate. On February 23 Drayton said its undiluted net asset value of 128.19p for February 22 was calculated from the (FT-derived) diluted net asset value of 123.5p, adjusted to reflect the non-exercise of the Drayton Asia warrants. Drayton has subsequently revised its estimate of the diluted net asset value for February 22 to 123.19p, giving an undiluted estimate of 127.82p after adjustment. Further, it said that if the unconditional offer date had been February 22 the share offer would have been 6.7 Dragon shares for each Drayton. On this basis Drayton's NAV would have been 121.27p, or 94.9 per cent of its undiluted value at February 22. 'Based on the middle market price of the EFM Dragon ordinary shares of 17.75p on February 22 1993,' Drayton added, 'the market value of the share offer was 118.93p, representing 93 per cent of Drayton Asia's undiluted NAV.'</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two Turkish merchant ships collided in thick fog in the Adriatic Sea, sinking  one of the vessels and leaving 14 sailors missing and believed dead, Italian  port officials said. Ubaldo Scarpati, head of the port authority in  Manfredonia, in southern Italy, said the 1,700-ton Deval and the 1,713-ton  Selin, both based in Istanbul, Turkey, collided off the Yugoslav island of  Palagruza. The island is about halfway between Italy and Yugoslavia. The  missing crew members were all from the Deval, which sank almost immediately  after the collision.  </P></p>

He will appear Tuesday at Bon Appetit in Westwood.  </P> <P> Cunliffe won the competition over 20 semi-finalists from nine countries,  eventually edging out second-place finisher Michael Weiss, who has appeared in  Los Angeles with saxophonist Johnny Griffin. An Eastman School of Music  graduate, Cunliffe has played with Buddy Rich, Joe Henderson, George Coleman,  Shorty Rogers and Art Blakey. Between the occasional jazz performance, he keeps  busy writing soundtracks for such daytime dramas as "As the World Turns" and  "Guiding Light."  </P> <P> Saxophonist Dick Houlgate, who died recently of cancer, will be honored with a  memorial music session by the Ace Lane Band from 1-4 this afternoon at  Alfonse's Restaurant in North Hollywood.

			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Text] Beginning with Fujitsu, six leading electronics  firms plan to implement the Ground Self Defense Force Command  System. Partial operation will begin next March at the Northern  District Supervisory Office (Sapporo). The system uses the  latest computer and communication technology and allows the  commander to rapidly transmit precise commands. Given the  constraints on the primary facilities budget, defense sales at  each company are falling. Since contracts for the Ground Self  Defense Force Command System project long-term, stable income at  the scale of several billion yen annually, this will probably  become a valuable source of earnings in the industry.    The Ground Self Defense Force Command System will be  introduced as one link in information and communication system  facilities known as C[.sup]3[/]I (Command, Control,  Communication, and Intelligence). Fujitsu is the main  contractor. In addition, NEC, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Denki, Hitachi  Seiyakusho, and Oki Electric Installation Ltd. are participating  in the development. About 10 billion yen is budgeted for fiscal  years 1991 through 1993. The start of operation at the Northern  District Supervisory Office will be the first shot at its  implementation.    The initial plan forecasted an annual budget of 20 billion  yen up to the 100 billion yen needed to complete the system.  However, due to constraints on the defense budget, this is  expected to drop dramatically in scale. Nevertheless, orders of  several billion yen per year will support defense-related  electronics firms.    Although the Air Self Defense Force and Maritime Self  Defense  Force already operate command systems that use computers, the  Ground Self Defense Force that has bases scattered throughout  the country was late in establishing facilities. Since a reason  stated for the victory in the Gulf War was the C[.sup]3[/]I  system of the United States, this is one more field the Defense  Agency regards as important. After 1994, the objective is to  continue to expand the system to the Eastern District  Supervisory Office.    In the future, the plan is to set up computers in the Army  and in occupied regions and to connect operations by light  communications. General-purpose products are used for the  hardware, but the performance features like transmission speed  and maintaining security will become important in the software.    The Fujitsu's Defense Division manages the charged  electronic  devices for P3C anti-submarine devices and P3C ground support  system equipment. Total contracts for 1991 reached &yen;38  billion. However, cutbacks are expected in the primary equipment  budget to hold the 1993 budget to around &yen;33 billion. While  the Ground Self Defense Force System that belongs to the Rear  Division is expected to be stabilized in future budgets and will  become the core of defense-related business at Fujitsu.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aarticle by Arteria-REPUBLIKA-mad: "We Are Going To Be </F> Ltd."]    [Text] Bratislava--Dusan Kleiman, director general of the  Press Agency of the Slovak Republic [TA SR] confirmed to the  ARTERIA-STA [Slovak Press Agency] that the REPUBLIKA daily is in  debt and, by extension, the TA SR is in debt to Danubiaprint.  He refused to specify the size of the debt. According to our  source, however, who does not wish to be named but comes  directly from the TA SR, this debt exceeds 18 million korunas.  He says that the debt exists because the daily has not used any  funds from the government subsidy for its operation. "Everybody  reproaches us for publishing REPUBLIKA for government money, but  it has financed itself," he emphasized. So far, however,  circulation has not been large enough, he says, to cover all of  the expenditure.    As Kleiman also said, the TA SR management reached an  agreement with certain entities to pay all of the outstanding  debts by surrendering the REPUBLIKA banner and all concomitant  rights. "They are prominent entities, with a certain political  position on the Slovak political scene," he said. He  categorically refused the idea that state treasury funds would  be used to pay the debt. According to Jan Comaj, deputy chief  editor of REPUBLIKA, the new publisher of the daily will be  REPUBLIKA Ltd.    Dusan Kleiman said that REPUBLIKA, which was supposed to be  a  news-oriented daily, has gradually become an opinion-forming  popular daily, and, thereby, it transgressed the publisher's  original concept. "We meant to make it into a newspaper version  of CNN, but it ended the way it did," the TA SR director said.</p>

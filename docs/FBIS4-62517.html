			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    The mediation effort by Russia and the CSCE to restore peace  in the region has begun to yield positive results. The  cease-fire agreement, which will be signed at the talks between  the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the  representatives of the NKR Defense Army to be held in Moscow  today, will be a step in that direction. However, several  forces, establishments, and organizations opposed to the leading  officials in Azerbaijan have seriously criticized that  republic's signing of the Bishkek protocol.    It is no coincidence that, compared with the situation of a  few days ago, the number of intensive combat operations in the  region has considerably decreased. However, exchanges of fire  have not completely ended. Undoubtedly, many military officials  in Azerbaijan support the opposition forces in that republic.    We stressed earlier that the Armenian side is trying not to  return fire in order to avoid worsening the present situation.  In fact, it is trying to counter any activity that may violate  the Bishkek protocol. However, the Azerbaijani forces have  maintained intensive operations. Nevertheless, to be fair we  must note that the present operations are in the form of  positional fighting. The situation is complex.    The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has  disclosed  that the NKR positions in Mardakertskiy, Agdamskiy, and  Askeranskiy Rayons were fired by various types or arms last  night and this morning. Two NKR freedom fighters were wounded.  The NKR defense forces remained committed to the NKR Defense  Army Headquarters' order to refrain from opening fire. They  refrained from launching retaliatory operations.    Meanwhile, intelligence units have reported that Azerbaijan  is presently massing reinforcements and military vehicles in the  northern part of Mardakertskiy Rayon.    No incidents occurred on the border between Armenia and  Azerbaijan last night and this morning. Nevertheless, the  situation is tense.</p>

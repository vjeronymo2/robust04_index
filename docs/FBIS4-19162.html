			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkey has declared that the NATO intervention  against Serbian positions is an appropriate and welcome  development, even though it is a belated move. It was stated  that Turkey's insistent attitude played a significant role in  the realization of this intervention.    In his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said that Gorazde is one of the Serbs' main  targets in their policy to gain territory and carry out ethnic  cleansing. This is why Gorazde was included among the six safe  areas declared by the UN Security Council and was placed under  international protection, Ataman recalled.    Although it was a belated move, Ataman declared, the NATO  intervention against Serbian positions was an appropriate and  welcome development. He added that Turkey's insistent attitude  constituted one of the significant factors in the realization of  this intervention.    Ataman stated: It is important to closely observe the Serbs'  every move and behavior and to give the necessary response to  every attack. The international community should have realized  by now that the Serbs understand only determined stands.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAIL INITIATIVE  </P> <P> Measure A, the so-called Centralized Jail Initiative, would mandate that all  new jails be built in the county seat, Santa Ana. It is questionable that this  measure, if passed, would withstand a legal challenge.  </P> <P> Nevertheless it poses a serious threat to efforts that have already been made  to plan a remote jail site.  </P> <P> We're all concerned about crime, and we all want to ensure that criminals are  expeditiously tried, convicted and incarcerated. Measure A proponents would  like all this to take place in Santa Ana. Let's be reasonable; Santa Ana simply  isn't the place for all jails. The city is densely populated and has the most  rapidly growing school population in the county. Both are adequate reasons to  disqualify Santa Ana as a potential site.  </P> <P> Please vote no on Measure A and make it clear to the County Board of  Supervisors and Measure A proponents that a remote jail site is the appropriate  solution to a pressing need.  </P> <P> KEITH SWAYNE  </P> <P> Case-Swayne Co.

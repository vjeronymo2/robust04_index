			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / SBC in scrip deal for BICC and Redland SWISS Bank Corporation has reached an agreement with Barclays de Zoete Wedd under which SBC will pay shareholders in BICC and Redland a higher cash alternative for the enhanced scrip dividends announced by both companies. BZW, which devised the scrip dividend scheme, had planned to buy shares from investors at a 5 per cent discount. SBC's offer is similar to one it made for the additional scrip dividends issued by BAT, in which it offered to pay shareholders 2 per cent less than the market price. The higher price offered for the shares increases the likelihood that investors who opt for the scrip option - and 91 per cent of BAT's shareholders have done so - will choose to sell their extra shares. Some 21 per cent of BAT shareholders have sold their extra shares, compared with 18 per cent of shareholders in the mining group RTZ, for which there was no additional cash offer. RTZ announced its enhanced scrip dividend in April. SBC, which made its offer after the less attractive one from BZW had been announced, has agreed to make some compensatory payments to its competitor to cover marketing, promotion and printing costs. No compensatory payments are to be made in the Redland or BICC deals. In the case of BICC, SBC is offering to pay 19.47p per ordinary share compared with the 18.87p offered by BZW. In the case of Redland, SBC is offering 24.62p per share against the 23.87p offered by BZW. So far, six UK corporations have issued enhanced scrip dividends, offering shares worth 50 per cent more than the alternative cash dividend, to minimise the amount of unrecoverable Advance Corporation Tax they must pay. Scrip dividends do not incur tax charges and several issuers have saved substantial amounts by making the offering. Mr Brian Keelan, executive director of corporate finance at SBC, said the offer followed an analysis of documents issued by BZW in connection with the BAT deal. SBC concluded that the underwriters exposed themselves to three days of market risk in their offer to repurchase the shares, and a discount of 5 per cent was excessive. In typical rights offerings, underwriters expose themselves to market risk for longer for a discount of 2 per cent. SBC job cuts, Page 17</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Israel and PLO join in bid to halt violence Israeli generals last night held an extraordinary meeting with leaders of Mr Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO in the occupied Gaza Strip, in an effort to halt violence threatening the scheduled start of Palestinian autonomy. At the same time Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reiterated that autonomy in Gaza and the Jericho area of the West Bank might be delayed 'one or two weeks' after the December 13 target date while details were finalised. On a visit to Rome, he appealed to 'responsible' Palestinian leaders to help end the spreading violence. Guerrillas from the Fatah Hawks, a military wing of the PLO, are openly rebelling against Mr Arafat's commitment to a renunciation of violence. They are angry at the killing of one of their members by Israeli troops on Sunday and the arrest of several of their leaders on Monday. In clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip yesterday, Palestinians said more than 60 people were wounded. The Israeli army put the number at 24. The latest surge in violence is causing deep concern both in Jerusalem and at PLO headquarters in Tunis. Last night's meeting broke up with both sides promising to try to calm tension. But the Israeli generals rejected the Fatah leaders' request for the immediate release of Fatah Hawks commander Taisir Bardini. They said Mr Bardini, captured in a shootout with undercover troops on Monday night, was wanted for murder. Before approving the meeting, Brig Gen Ehud Barak, Israel's army chief of staff, took the equally unusual step of publicly apologising for the killing of Fatah Hawk member Ahmed Abu-Rish in a Gaza refugee camp on Sunday. He said an Israeli undercover unit had come under fire and had returned fire, but had not intended to hit Abu-Rish. The deputy commander of Israel's forces in Gaza stressed in a radio interview 'Israel is not at war' with Fatah and other supporters of the autonomy deal. He said Israel stood by its promise to free 'wanted' Fatah Hawks who turn in their weapons.</p>

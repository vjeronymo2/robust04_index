			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / When the best of friends turn to foes ON APRIL 10 the editors of the Tory tabloids were invited to celebrate Mr John Major's election victory at a party in 10 Downing Street. Just three months later the newspapers' fury over the prime minister's support for new legal curbs on their reporting has sparked a state of virtual war. It was Lord MacAlpine, a long-time Conservative fund raiser, who declared that Sir David English of the Daily Mail, Sir Nicholas Lloyd of the Daily Express and Mr Kelvin MacKenzie of The Sun were the real heroes of Mr Major's campaign. Few who saw the bouts of panic that had gripped officials at central office as polling day approached doubted his judgment. The three tabloids were relentless in selling the central Tory message: that Labour would preside over a big increase in taxes and that Mr Neil Kinnock could not be trusted to run the country. Lurid front pages provided daily advertisements for the Conservative cause. Each of the editors was in constant touch with the senior ministers running Mr Major's campaign. On more than one occasion the message the newspapers delivered to Mr Major was that his strategy was a shambles. But they remained fiercely loyal. If Mr Major thought the tabloids' performance up to April 9 guaranteed him an easy ride once he returned to Downing Street, he was soon disabused of the idea. Within a matter of weeks the tabloids were reminding him that the rules which operated during election campaigns did not apply in the long intervals between them. The Express and London's Evening Standard, another staunch supporter, infuriated the prime minister by taking up the cause of the Tory Euro-sceptics after the Danish voters had rejected the Maastricht treaty. The Standard, and to a lesser extent, The Sun, joined a campaign against Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, over his failure to pull the economy from recession. But it is the issue of press privacy - now entangled with the allegations about Mr David Mellor's personal life - which has sparked the most serious rift. The seeds were planted last month when a book about the marriage difficulties of the Prince and Princess of Wales provoked a flood of speculative stories in the tabloids. Mr Major, whose frequent contacts with the royal family are often overlooked, was furious. The revelation a few weeks later that the first child of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, had been born before she married added to his anger. The result was a decision to refer again the issue of personal privacy to an inquiry headed by Sir David Calcutt QC. But Mr Major made clear that he had decided in his own mind that the tabloids' excesses should be curbed by legislation to prohibit intrusions into the personal lives of the royals and other public figures. That message - delivered in an informal chat with a political correspondent during an overseas visit - infuriated the editors who had backed him during the election. Mr Paul Dacre, the newly appointed editor of the Daily Mail, sought to warn off the prime minister in a full page editorial. The Sun emblazoned its pages with the same message. Scandals sell newspapers and editors are judged on their circulation figures. But no one at Westminster guessed that Mr MacKenzie would respond to Mr Major's anger over the publicity surrounding Mr Mellor with quite such a devastating charge against an unnamed cabinet minister. If the allegation is proved - and the editor has so far said he will not name names - then the culprit will be forced to resign. The message for Mr Major is that best friends can often make the worst enemies.</p>

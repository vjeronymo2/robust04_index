			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Observer: Rugby balls The appointment of Dalgety marketing whiz Jack Rowell - who also finds time to manage England's rugby team - to the board of biotechnology company Celsis reminds Observer of a bruising tale of corporate hospitality. Celsis was founded by Ferrari-driving biotechnology mogul Chris Evans, whose other passion is rugby. So devoted to the sport is Evans that he loses no opportunity to take large groups of fund managers, investment analysts and even journalists to a game. He also invites old chums from his home town of Port Talbot, as well as a sprinkling of retired rugby stars. The scheme backfired last season, when a party of 30 or so City types and steel-workers descended on Cardiff for a match. Unfortunately their tickets were dud; faces were as red as the Ferrari's paintwork as they were turned away.</p>

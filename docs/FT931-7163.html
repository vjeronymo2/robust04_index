			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Moves on Danish impeachment Impeachment proceedings are being prepared by the Danish parliament against a former minister of justice, Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, for his part in the visa scandal which brought down the Conservative-Liberal coalition government last month, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Mr Ninn-Hansen, as minister of justice in 1987, ordered civil servants to delay issuing entry visas to the families of Tamil refugees, who had a right in Danish law to be admitted to the country. He will face charges of maladministration of the law, obstructing the work of the parliamentary ombudsman and misinforming parliament.</p>

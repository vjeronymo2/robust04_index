			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LIST THAT MATTERS  </P> <P> Robert Hilburn's "20 Bands That Matter" (Dec. 2) was a brave attempt at the  impossible.  </P> <P> However, I feel one band in particular was served a major injustice by its  exclusion: the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Faith No More are the new media darlings,  and on their own are a powerful band, but anyone familiar with the 'Peppers'  knows they are the true innovators of this style of music.  </P> <P> I feel the R.H.C.P., who have taken so many chances musically over such a long  period of time bringing together diverse musical influences were insulted by  the inclusion of a band that blatantly rips them off.  </P> <P> TOM FITZPATRICK  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

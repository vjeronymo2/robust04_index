			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> PLACES;  </P> <P> FAMILY BUSINESS  </P> <P> IT'S THE MARMALADE that's kept the Ward ranch going for nearly 100 years.  Located in Sierra Madre, the Ward Ranch is a slice of country hidden away in  the midst of a bustling city.  </P> <P> From the dirt driveway, you can catch a glimpse of an authentic old red barn  flanked by orange groves. The old-fashioned store represents the  four-generations-old family business: marmalade.  </P> <P> All the cooking is done on-site, and although "some companies use corn syrup,"  says E. Waldo Ward Jr., "we use only sugar." Orange marmalade ($2.55 for a  10-ounce jar) is the ranch specialty, but for the adventurous palate, there's  ginger marmalade, port-wine jelly, guava jam and kiwi preserves as well as such  condiments as seafood sauce, chili sauce and zucchini relish. Tours are  conducted by appointment.  </P> <P>  E. Waldo Ward &amp; Son, 273 E. Highland Ave., Sierra Madre; (818) 355-1218.  DIANE BAILEY  </P></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Indocement ahead 6% after Dollars 1bn acquisitions INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's dominant cement producer and largest listed company, yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in net profits to Rp327.4bn (Dollars 180m) in the first results following nearly Dollars 1bn in food and property acquisitions last July. The results were in line with brokers' estimates and include 12-month operating figures from Indofood, in which Indocement acquired a 51 per cent stake, and five-month operating results from Bogasari Flour Mills and the Wisma Indocement office tower. Brokers estimate Indofood contributed about Rp58bn to net profits, which may appease some minority shareholders who considered the Rp777bn purchase price as too high. Until last July, all the acquisitions were privately-owned by the Salim group, Indocement's principal shareholder. The purchases included Rp719bn in goodwill, and brokers say a similar amount has now been booked as an asset in Indocement's accounts. 'It seems a very generous figure given the market's reservations over the acquisitions,' noted one foreign broker. Brokers expect Indofood to be floated by the end of next year, with Indocement possibly reducing its stake to lower debt, which increased to Rp2,974bn last year from Rp634bn in 1991. There was a corresponding rise in the company's debt-to-equity gearing from 11 per cent to 143 per cent in 1992. Cash and time deposits dropped from Rp409bn to Rp120bn and net interest income moved from a Rp44bn gain in 1991 to a Rp120bn loss. Net revenues rose from Rp771bn to Rp2,137bn and the company's operating profit increased from Rp310bn to Rp562bn year-on-year. Earnings per share were raised from Rp515 to Rp547. Brokers expect improved prospects for the cement operations in 1993 following a recent rise in the government-controlled price of cement.</p>

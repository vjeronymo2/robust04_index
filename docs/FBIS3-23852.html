			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Samoylov, creator of the Ispolin </F> Concern, by Viktor Andriyanov and Vladislav Boyarkin; place and  date not given: "Everything Will Come Through for Ispolin"]    [Text] At exactly 1100, as agreed, a plain Zhiguli  drove up to the entrance of the Lenin Order Recipient Space  Research Institute (copied from the plaque). A young man of the  Pierre Bezukhov type emerged from the car. In an unbuttoned,  loose-hanging coat.    "They are with me," he told the guard, and the  turnstile turned three times, letting us into one of the most  secret institutes.    We walked past a winter garden, where mock-up space  craft were scattered amidst the palm trees, past doors with  combination locks and the nameplates of scientists known  throughout the world. But the topic we were going to write about  was not space research. Under this cosmic roof--uncrowded--lives  Ispolin.    It is time to introduce its creator--Oleg Albertovich  Samoylov.  <H5>  Life Itself Turned Us Toward Production and High Technology </H5>   [Samoylov] I was born in 1964 in Sverdlovsk--nowadays called  Yekaterinburg. I was a young child when my parents took me to  the then closed city of Krasnoyarsk-45, where enriched uranium  was produced. My father worked there. Several years later we  moved to Naberezhnyye Chelny. So I spent my youth at the KamAZ  [Kama Auto Works].    I did my army service in Mongolia and returned to the plant.  I worked in the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth  League] committee, trade union committee, and studied at the  Imeni Plekhanova Institute of National Economy, specializing in  finance and credit.    When perestroyka began, I worked for a while in a  cooperative  producing construction materials, and in 1989 I opened my own  company--Intercom. A spare parts supplier.    At approximately the same time my current partners and  colleagues Vladimir Rybakov and Aleksey Potapkin started their  own business in Moscow. Their company, P&amp;R (Potapkin and  Rybakov), sold spare parts for trucks. We combined our efforts  and capital; the result was the Avtokomplekt company. I and four  other guys who worked with me in Naberezhnyye Chelny became  Muscovites.    [Question] Just like that? Only recently one could only get  transferred to Moscow, as they used to say, in keeping with a  decision of directive organs. This required lots of paperwork.    [Samoylov] "Different times--different songs..." In the fall  of 1991 one could already buy both an apartment and a residence  permit, which is what we did. We opened a number of other  enterprises in addition to Avtokomplekt, and gradually arrived  at the idea of a holding company. In the summer of last year  Ispolin was registered as a Russian industrial-financial concern.    [Question] It appears that the word "Russian" in the company  name is not accidental.    [Samoylov] Of course. We are patriotically-minded people.  There is a German Bank, French Bank. Why should there not be a  Russian Concern?    Today Ispolin has 22 companies under its umbrella and 37  representations in Russia, the CIS, and foreign countries.    [Question] Oleg Albertovich, do you count yourself among  what  is called the new Russians?    [Samoylov] First of all, simply Russians. As to new,  actually  we are the second wave.    The first wave are those who started with some foundation.  Someone transferred a state enterprise in his name in time, or  buildings, or received free credit. We, on the other hand,  started from scratch, with bare enthusiasm and enterprise. It  took time to get on our feet. We worked in very difficult  conditions, risking everything. And only now are we beginning to  get ahead.    I am convinced that the future belongs to the second wave.  They are people who came in too late to grab profitable and  sweet positions in trade and the financial sphere. But on the  other hand, this is good. Life itself turned us toward  production and high technology. Some people are just beginning  to contemplate it, while we are already working with it.    [Question] Where did you start in production?    [Samoylov] We worked with the Yakutalmaz Association,  supplying them--and continue to supply them--with spare parts,  and working with them in a broad range of areas. In turn, we  were asked to evaluate a number of designs. Among them was a  very promising one--a special additive that replaces lubricant  oil.    [Question] RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA reported on this invention.    [Samoylov] Yes, I read it. They are continuing the  experiments in Yakutia. The results are generally good, but  there are still a number of unresolved problems.    Gradually we established contacts with a number of  institutes; they got to know us; serious proposals started  coming in. You are well aware that in many technologies we are  ahead of the West. But the authors of this development  work--scientific research institutes and design bureaus--subsist  in poverty; they do not have enough money to pay for heating and  communications, let alone salaries.    Ispolin AO [joint-stock company] experts carefully evaluate  proposed designs. Some of them have already gone through  production testing and been put into commercial production. I  will mention, for instance, laser grinding of ball-bearings, air  conditioners that operate without freon--practically all African  countries have placed orders for them. In Tarusa we backed the  production of synthetic emeralds and rubies that are used  primarily in microelectronics.    [Question] What if after this interview is published you get  flooded with proposals from RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers?    [Samoylov] They will be most welcome.    [Question] What type of development work are you interested  in?    [Samoylov] A rather broad spectrum. But it has to be  innovative, breakthrough technology. The air conditioners I  mentioned are far superior to any foreign analogues. They are  built by a domestically developed technology that was used in  the defense industry. These air conditioners also will be  installed on KamAZ trucks intended for tropical countries. We  put a system of filters in it, and you can fill them with any  water, even from a puddle.    [Question] The second part of this question. As a rule,  after  such materials are published, the editors are contacted by  directors of enterprises that have unused capacities, most often  undergoing conversion. Are you interested in such contacts?    [Samoylov] Without question! Why build a new plant if the  capacity already exists, as well as skilled cadres. Just take it  and set up production.    Here is another design that was brought to me: an automatic  nail-making machine. You put wire into it, punch in the program,  and that is all! There are good heads in the country, but it  hurts when foreigners buy up our talents for peanuts. They give  you two or three trips a year and some pocket money. For our  people this is crazy money, but the result is that developments  and technologies stay abroad for nothing.  <H3>  I Took Gaydar's Resignation in Stride. I Liked Ryzhkov's  Program More, For All the Criticism Heaped on It </H3>   [Question] You invest money in production, applications of  high technology. But many of your colleagues still see only  trading and middleman activities as the source of quick and  reliable income.    [Samoylov] To the best of my knowledge they are afraid to  invest money in long-term projects because of political  instability.    Nevertheless, I think that production should now be the  foundation of Russian business. Politicians come and go, but  industry remains. I hope that those in the Kremlin and the  government will understand this and stop strangling producers  with taxes.    I have to confess that I took Gaydar's resignation in  stride.  I see his strong points. But as a person involved in concrete  entrepreneurial activities, I believe that for a head of  government it is not enough to know theory, thorough as that  knowledge may be.    [Question] This is the opinion of an entrepreneur. What is  dear to you as a citizen and a person?    [Samoylov] I have already partially answered this question.  I  am against the kind of society that is ascending on our country,  that we are trying to copy from the United States. It is a  society oriented toward money, profit; an extremely cruel world.  I am for the spirituality that has always existed in Russia.    I am a patriotically-minded person, although there are  attempts now to slander and distort this notion. Let the jeers  against patriotism remain on the conscience of people without  kith or kin. Look at how America worships its flag, how an  Englishman, German, or Frenchman loves his country. Why are  Russians being deprived of this right? There is no shame in  being a son of the fatherland, which is the literal translation  of the word "patriot" from French. On the contrary, one should  be proud of it.    No, I do not accept everything new. I disagree with many  things that are being done now. My credo is that we have to work  hard. Very hard. So that Russia may prosper and ourselves along  with it. Because prosperity of the state is tied directly with  our prosperity.    I am not a cosmopolitan. I do not reject everything of the  past just because it is declared old. Conscience does not grow  old. Neither does truth, loyalty, and duty. I cannot agree with  those who dismiss the entire history of my country, even the  post-October one. Does it mean we have to start on a blank page  again? Does it mean I have to also dismiss the life of my  father, Albert Vasilyevich? But I saw for myself how hard he  worked, earned three higher degrees. Everything that is best in  me is from him.    Now the country has jumped into another extreme. I, on the  other hand, am for forward motion. And in general I am an  adherent of the plan Nikolay Ivanovich Ryzhkov was fighting to  implement. I am a supporter of his programs, his actions,  although they have been discredited to a large extent. Ryzhkov's  program is much closer to my liking than Gaydar's program.  Because the entire world has arrived at a regulated market  instead of the bazaar we are being saddled with.    A country must choose its priorities during difficult times.  On the other hand, one day we want to replace the roof over  Luzhniki, the next day we begin to build an underground city  under Manezh Square. As if there are no other concerns left, as  if everything has been put right in Moscow, everybody lives  well--there is enough housing for everyone, for instance.    What is the foundation of a society? The economy. Science.  Culture, education, art. In the economy we are getting an  alternating cold-and-hot water shower. Science and culture have  been neglected altogether. One gets the impression that the next  step is to leave the country without culture. A young actor gets  paid 20,000 rubles [R]; how he survives is a mystery! The  greatest actors are paid R80,000. This is simply cruel.  <H5>  Russian Benefactors Are a Thread From the Past to the Future </H5>   [Question] But what can you do?    [Samoylov] Entrepreneurs can do a lot. Have you heard about  icon painting on birch bark? I would not be surprised if you  have not--this ancient type of art has all but disappeared  thanks to the many years of "loving care" extended to the church  and master icon painters. Until recently only three icons on  birch bark have been known to exist, all of them in private  collections. Now there are about 15 such icons in Russia: the  secrets of the old masters have been found and are being  revitalized, and the Ispolin Concern is financing this work.    Or take Khokhloma wood-painting. It is familiar to  practically every citizen of Russia, but how many people know  that entry into the free market did not work well for Khokhloma  craftsmen? Learning of the problems this craft was experiencing,  we decided to help the artists and organized our own studio. The  result: a collection created in this studio has been invited to  a Sotheby auction in England.    [Question] Well, since it has got to the point of Sotheby,  this means that you will come out a winner, too.    [Samoylov] Excuse me, but I have not finished. Fortunately,  not everything in this world is measured by the "profit or loss"  formula. I, for instance, care a lot about the theater. This  truly is an inalienable part of my life. I could not possibly  live in any other country--if for no other reason than because,  in my opinion, Russia is the only country where the theater as  the highest achievement of human civilization is not yet dead.  Of course, in this there is no notion of "profit or loss"--if I  can help, I do. We finance the "Modern" theater, and have  established awards for young actors.    In the past I dreamt of becoming a theatrical director.  Friends sometimes joke: All right, since you did not get to be a  theatrical director, you became a concern president--same thing,  your directorial talent still comes through. Speaking seriously,  I am indeed tied to the theater in an official way now: I have  been elected vice president of the Moscow Charitable Actors  Fund, where I came with my program "Young Benefactors for Young  Actors."    [Question] There is a book "Russian Benefactors" on your  desk. Is this the example you are trying to emulate?    [Samoylov] If you wish. There is a man I would like to  emulate spiritually--Savva Morozov. Unfortunately, little is  known about him in Russia, mainly at the level of school  textbooks. He was a great man. Many people know that he built  the Moscow Art Theater, that he helped actors. But practically  nobody knows that he helped science, established scholarships in  St. Petersburg University. That he applied the latest inventions  in the theater and was himself an inventor.  <H5>  Only Very Rich People Can Afford Two Days Off a Week </H5>   [Samoylov] I understand that to come close to the image of  this man, one has to work very hard.    [Question] Very hard--how hard is that? Today is Saturday,  but your colleagues are at work.    [Samoylov] Good observation--for us Saturday is a regular  work day. Once a director of a South Korean firm--our  partner--remarked with certain sarcasm that Russians must be  very rich people if they can afford two days off a week. We had  to explain to him that workers in our concern, for instance,  make do with only one day off. Generally speaking, we work as  much as is needed.    The state has shrugged off science and culture. All right,  but at least allow entrepreneurs to take over. Provide  incentives, as in the United States. They have zillions of  different foundations. If you use some of your money for  charitable activities, the same amount is exempt from taxation.  If a farmer invests more than 40 percent of his income in new  technologies, he is exempt from taxes altogether. This is a  policy.    We, on the other hand... I understand, they are fighting for  those cozy jobs and have no time to think of other things. So  they measure everyone with the same yardstick and issue a  regulation. It does not matter what you do--trade or production.    Because there are too many nonprofessionals in the upper  echelons. Maybe they knew how to do something before, in the  rallies, but in the new situation they cannot find their  bearings. The situation will change when new people rise to the  top--those who are 30 to 40 today.    [Question] The second wave?    [Samoylov] Yes. The richest people are those who are in  trade, but they were not the ones who built America. America was  built by Ford, Chrysler, General Motors... We are not yet as  strong as the first wave, those who have made millions, billions  of dollars. But to the extent of our ability we are helping to  rebuild Russia.    [Question] What do you value in life?    [Samoylov] Books. I like reading the classics most. My  favorite writers are Dreiser and Dostoyevskiy. Whenever I have  free time, I read. I do not spend time at health resorts, do not  travel to the Canary Islands for recreation, and do not take  vacations in general. I do not have a dacha or a foreign-made  car. Of course, we are not poor, but neither are we super-rich.    [Question] What things do you not accept?    [Samoylov] Meanness and betrayal.    [Question] Have you had encounters with them?    [Samoylov] Both in life and in business. Generally, I am a  gentle, kind man, even sentimental. I have been cheated many  times, and many times had to start from scratch.    [Question] What are you counting on?    [Samoylov] The common sense of the people.    [Question] We wish you success.</p>

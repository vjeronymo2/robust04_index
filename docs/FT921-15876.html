			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Germany allows contract workers GERMANY and Russia signed an agreement yesterday to allow up to 11,000 Russian contract workers to find jobs on the German labour market every year, as well as offering training for a further 2,000 young labourers and apprentices, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. At the same time Germany has agreed to provide advice and training in a range of areas, including labour relations and labour law. The deal is the most comprehensive yet signed by the Russian government since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the speed with which it has been agreed underlines German concern to give practical support to the economic reform process under way there. The agreement to take up to 11,000 contract workers - the second largest number from eastern Europe after Poland, with 40,000 - is an indication of German concern to have a legal framework for Russian workers, at a time when there are fears of a potential new influx of unofficial migrant workers.</p>

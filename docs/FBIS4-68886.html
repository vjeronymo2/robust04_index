			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the </F> government: "We Have Entered the Most Difficult Phase of the  Transformations"]    [Text] The establishment of market relations is continuing  in Russia's economy and measures are being taken to reduce the  social costs of the transition period. Measures have been taken  to curb inflation. The process of privatization is going  relatively dynamically. The nonstate sector of the economy is  gathering speed. The rates of decline of investment activity  have slowed up. The consumer market is being restored. The  country's foreign trade balance has been reduced to a positive  total.    Nonetheless, in spite of certain successes, the situation in  the economy remains unstable. Last year crisis processes were  not halted. The gross domestic product decreased by 13 percent,  industrial production--by more than 16 percent, agricultural  production--by 4 percent, capital investments--by 16 percent,  and foreign trade turnover--by 13 percent. Prices of goods and  services increased more than ninefold.    The socioeconomic situation that developed during the first  quarter of this year is characterized by a continuing decline of  the volumes of industrial production and a lowering of the level  of capital investments with a simultaneous increase in prices of  industrial products and consumer goods. Measures taken by the  government are still not producing the desired results. The  greatest decline in the first quarter of this year occurred in  the machine-building, chemical, metallurgical, and wood  processing industries. The production of consumer goods and  foodstuffs continues to decrease. For certain goods in light  industry--from 15 to 54 percent. In February alone as a result  of the closing down of 4,500 enterprises, 22 million man-days of  work time were lost. Production has come to a complete halt at  428 enterprises, including such large ones as the "Kirovskiy  Zavod," LOMO, the Baltic plant, "Rostselmash," and many others.    This is occurring because of the lack of funds and because  of  difficulties with product sales. This accounts for up to 60  percent of the losses. Practically all branches and sectors of  the national economy have come up against this strict limitation  of demand. There is no possibility and sometimes even no hope of  selling products that are produced. Inflation is exacerbating  the economic crisis.    As usual, nonpayments are still problem number one. While  during the first half of last year monetary funds available to  the enterprises exceeded the defaulted indebtedness to the  suppliers, during the second half they amounted to only half the  sum of indebtedness. During the first months of this year we  came right up to the indicators of the summer of 1992. Now,  however, commodity producers are tightening the strings: If  there is no money, there will be no deliveries. As a result,  indebtedness on wages has become worse. Today it amounts to more  than 2 trillion rubles [R].    The problem of nonpayments has been tormenting the Russian  economy for two years now. There is the widespread opinion that  nonpayments arise as a result of the government's severe  financial-credit policy. Perhaps this might have been fair  regarding 1992, but now the situation is completely different.  In my view nonpayments today are brought about primarily by  debts of the budget and the CIS countries to the Russian  commodity producers, particularly the fuel and energy complex.  In the second place is the lack of control of monetary flows and  the concealed redistribution of funds among various enterprises  and entire sectors of the economy. Frequently money that is  supposed to be used for settlements with suppliers and for  augmenting circulating capital is used to increase wages, to  cover notes, and so forth. Nonpayments are increasing because of  the lack of demandingness on the part of those who extend credit  to the debtors. For some reason they all apply to the government  for money but they are in no hurry to file charges for  reimbursement of losses from the debtors. A third reason I would  call the inability on the part of many enterprise managers to  engage in increasing production effectiveness, reducing outlays,  updating output, and expanding the sales network. We would like  the enterprises, banks, and financial institutions themselves to  find a way out of the situation that has developed. Many  interesting plans are being suggested. For example,  "Tveruniversalbank" has developed and is implementing a system  for straightening out nonpayments with the emission of their own  notes. So it is not mandatory to wait for financial support from  the government, they can act on their own. The state, of course,  settles debts, but its debts make up no more than 20 percent.  The remaining 80 percent are debts of enterprises to one  another. The government cannot take responsibility for them.    The Russian economy has entered the most difficult phase of  its structural transformations. It is necessary to exert every  effort so that these transformations bring the country not the  usual problems but signs of improvement.    The government has begun to revise the list of projects to  be  supported by the budget. Existing legislation on bankruptcy is  beginning to be enforced taking into account the priorities of  the structural policy and its concrete objectives this year. It  is proposed to shut down a number of branches that are operating  at a loss or are ineffective and to adopt measures for social  adaptation of discharged workers. Next in line is the adoption  of measures necessary for creating conditions for development of  the activity of Russian commodity producers in markets of the  CIS countries. It is necessary to find ways of restoring  investment activity and providing for an influx of capital into  industry from other sectors of the economy by attracting free  financial funds of the banks and the population.    In the near future the government intends to take a number  of  additional measures to stabilize the situation in the Russian  economy. It has been decided to render state support to  enterprises of the coal industry. During the first half year  alone, in keeping with the developed schedules, R3.4 trillion is  to be paid from the budget to them. A decree has been adopted  concerning repayment during the first quarter of mutual  indebtedness for a number of members of the defense industry and  the agro-industrial and fuel-energy complexes. In order to  increase the effectiveness of utilization of investments, a  provision has been established concerning financing and granting  credit for capital construction. Proposals have been prepared  for stabilizing the work of enterprises of the fuel and energy  complex. The government has taken a stand in questions of quotas  for shipping strategic raw material resources, import customs  duties, and a list of federal target programs financed this year  from the budget. Next in line are proposals concerning state  regulation and control of railroad rates and also rates for  electric and thermal energy. In order to provide for payment of  wages in the fuel and energy complex and the timber and wood  processing industry it is permitted to leave up to 50 percent of  the funds from product sales in the accounts of the enterprises.  I would say that not all of the aforementioned measures can be  called 100 percent market measures, but the government has been  forced to resort to them.</p>

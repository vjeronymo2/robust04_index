			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 3 May (AFP) -- AFP correspondents have  reported the Bomb Squad the Political Police [as received]  (Disip) [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services]  and agents of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) today at 1600  (2000 GMT) defused a small bomb some 50 meters away from the AFP  office in Caracas.    A police source told AFP the explosive device was planted  inside a briefcase full of blank sheets of paper left in a  building located on Urdaneta Ave. The officer added: "We have  not ruled out that this is an action similar to the one that  occurred in the Caracas subway on 2 May."    On the morning of 2 May, a homemade bomb exploded in a  Caracas subway car, wounding five people. An unknown group, the  Popular Liberation Front Urban Command [Comando Urbano del  Frente de Liberacion Nacional], claimed responsibility for the  attack.    In the early afternoon of 2 May, the Political Police  reported it had identified two minors as the suspected  perpetrators of the Caracas subway attack. The Attorney  General's Office will prosecute their cases.    Anonymous calls to the PTJ on 3 May reported the planting of  explosive devices in at least four places in Caracas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The United States  will be dispatching three Navy ships to South Korea to bolster  U.S. military forces there, the Defense Department said here  today.    "Two mine countermeasure ships, the Guardian and the  Patriot,  accompanied by an amphibious ship, Juneau, will be heading for  the vicinity of South Korea," spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski told  reporters at a news briefing.    She said that the minesweeping capability of the U.S.  military forces in the area "was felt to be deficient" and "it  would be foolish not to try and improve that capability."    "We're not going to stop the kinds of prudent measures that  we've been taking over the past six months," Delaski said.    However, the United States has announced it would resume  high- level talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) in Geneva on July 8.    "We're not going to stop those because the diplomatic  efforts  seem to be moving in a positive direction," she said, "we would  continue to take those steps which are prudent, which are  common- sense oriented."    The spokeswoman called those measures "purely defensive" and  "should in no way be taken as provocative."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The latest Geneva declaration and the division of  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina into two parts is acceptable for  the Serbian side in principle, but there will be many  difficulties concerning the envisaged percentages. This was  stated for SRNA by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the people's  assembly of the Serbian republic. I do not want to prejudice  any solutions, but at this moment I do not see any way of  satisfying Croatian-Muslim demands, Krajisnik said.    The Serbs do not want anyone else's land. We are defending  our ethnic regions in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  following this principle, the Serbian side is prepared to give  up part of the territory that is holding at present, even some  land that it owns, which amounts to 64 percent, for the benefit  of creating the compactness of the state, Krajisnik said.    For the principle, the Serbs will give up parts of the  territory, but only up to the percent that will not endanger the  vital interests of the Serbian people. These interests are the  definitive separation from the Croats and the Muslims and a  compact state territory, which above all means a corridor  through the Posavina region, the chairman of the Serbian  republic assembly explained, adding that other strategic  interests of the Serbian people, which cannot be given up at any  cost, are the ethnic regions along the Una, Drina, and Neretva  Rivers.    The Serbian side has many objections to the Geneva  declaration, but we are currently ignoring them for the benefit  of the positive shifts, thus leaving room for ending hostilities  and searching for a mutually agreed solution, Momcilo Krajisnik  stressed in his interview with SRNA.</p>

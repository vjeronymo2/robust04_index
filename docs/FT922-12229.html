			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Bells and balloons greet Expo in Seville THE BELLS of the city of Seville rang out in unison just after midday yesterday as King Juan Carlos of Spain officially opened the Expo 92 Universal Exposition, which he called 'the greatest exposition in history'. There was a nervous cheer from the 1,800 invited guests as two huge plumes of red smoke billowed from the kilns of the 15th-century Cartuja monastery at the Expo site to signal the start of the six-month exhibition. Balloons carrying flags of all the 110 participating countries rose into the sky. The nerves were understandable. Expo has been plagued by a series of fires - the last destroying the thatched pavilion of the South Pacific islands late last week - as workers hurried to complete the Pounds 1.1bn site. More than 18m people, organisers say, will visit the futuristic steel, glass, bronze and wood pavilions between now and October 12. Expo 92 is the first big spectacle of Spain's 1992 celebrations to mark the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World. The Olympic Games in Barcelona in July and August will be the other big international event. The exhibition, which has generated investment worth some Pounds 5.6bn on the site and in infrastructure around the Andalucian capital, is the biggest ever staged. Not even the shooting and wounding by police of three people demonstrating against the fair in Seville on Sunday, and 20 more arrests yesterday, managed to dispel the general air of relief that the giant exhibition was finally under way. Some 10,000 police and 3,000 private security men were on duty in and around Seville and on the Expo site.</p>

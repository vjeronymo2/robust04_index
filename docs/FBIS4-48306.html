			<p>BFN     [Text] An economic upsurge in the next 2 years, a drop in  the interest rates, and the retention of the current monetary  policy are three of the main forecasts in the latest report by  the Bureau for Economic Research at the Universityy of  Stellenbosch, which has just been released.    The bureau said that a good performance could be expected  from the economy, both this year and next year, and that the  expected upswing would be based solidly on politics. Long-term  investment rates were expected to begin showing a downward trend  this year, because of the anticipated low inflation and money  market rates. Monetary policy was expected to remain unchanged.    The bureau said it would require exceptional negotiating  skills from the government of national unity, as a government of  freedom, to meet the high expectations created among the masses  during the elections. The bureau said it would be difficult to  avert a further increase in the budget deficit in a  non-inflationary way without sacrificing economic growth.  Proposed expenditure and possible state loans next year would  probably lead to tax increases, and to a rise in long-term  interest rates.</p>

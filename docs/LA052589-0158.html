			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE TEACHERS TO DECIDE BETWEEN CONTRACT, STRIKE  </P> <P> Glendale teachers will be asked next week to ratify a contract that provides  for 22.7% in pay raises over three years or face a possible strike in the fall,  union representatives said.  </P> <P> A union council Tuesday set a vote for Tuesday and Wednesday on the contract  after action was delayed two weeks to give teachers more time to study the  proposal.  </P> <P> Brent Noyes, one of three elementary school representatives on the union's  executive council, said he is urging members to accept the contract. "A no vote  on the contract is a strike vote," said Noyes, a former union president and  member of the negotiating team. "I see more problems instead of solutions."  </P> <P> Terms of the contract, which gives larger raises to teachers who are the best  trained and have served the longest, have caused division in the union, members  said.  </P> <P> The union in March declared an impasse in negotiations but agreed this month to  put the district's offer to a vote of its members. The union has taken no  official stand on the contract, said Mark Desetti, president of the Glendale  Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> Maria Leinenweber, a union teacher representative at Crescenta Valley High  School, said the salary restructuring will leave two-thirds of the teachers in  the district with lower increases in the second and third years of the  contract.  </P> <P> Only teachers who have earned a master's degree are eligible for the highest  raises. "They are forcing many of us to go back to school to get a master's  degree," Leinenweber said. "We are paying for this restructuring."  </P> <P> Charles Duncan, district director of personnel and employee relations, said  union representatives sought the restructuring option rather than  across-the-board raises for all teachers.  </P> <P> Under terms of the proposed contract, all teachers would be granted an 8% raise  this year, retroactive to Sept. 1. Raises next year would range from 6.5% to  11.2% and, in the following year, from 5.75% to 11.93%. Teachers now are not  eligible for raises after 12 years with the district. The new contract would  grant raises after 18 and 22 years, providing a top salary of $54,301 by  September, 1990 -- a 34.7% jump over the present maximum of $40,312.  </P> <P> Starting salaries would increase from $22,536 to $27,411 during the same  period. The average salary of $33,117 would climb to $41,000, placing Glendale  salaries in the top third of the county's 43 unified school districts, Duncan  said.  </P> <P> Teachers would lose the raise this year if a contract is not approved by June  30, he said.  </P></p>

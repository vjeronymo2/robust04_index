			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--The Higher State Security  Court-Emergency today resumed its session of the trial of  defendants accused of participating in mob events in al-Fayyum.  The case is trying 48 defendants including Dr. 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman. The court heard the remarks of State Security  Chief Prosecutor Usamah Qandil on the defense's presentation of  the case.    The court decided to postpone the trial until Tuesday to  hear  the comments of the defense on prosecution remarks.    Usamah Qandil said the judiciary in Egypt is free and  independent and that there is no intervention in its work and no  influence on the judges in trials.    He said the defense was interested in defending 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman, who absconded, despite it having no right to  defend him without paying the same attention to the jailed  defendants. The defendants have thus become the victims of  their crimes and their defense. According to Egyptian law, a  defendant who has absconded cannot be defended in court.    He said that 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was subpoenaed correctly.  He was subpoenaed to appear before the prosecution, but he  cannot be subpoenaed in the State of New Jersey, as the defense  claimed, because it is a very big state, not a small village  where a person can easily be discovered.    Chief Prosecutor Usamah Qandil said the case is not one of  politics or opinion, as the defense claimed. It is a case of  defendants who have committed crimes for which the Egyptian  penal code will punish them.    He affirmed that the emergency law is constitutional. He  said there is no truth in defense remarks that it is  unconstitutional, especially as the Higher Constitutional Court  issued a verdict confirming that it was constitutional to apply  this law.    He clarified that the republican decree on declaring a state  of emergency is a supreme decision. The courts cannot oppose  it, since it falls within the scope of state action as part of  its duty to keep social peace.    He noted that the defendants in this case can be tried  before  the Higher State Security Court-Emergency. He said the State  Security Courts organized by the law form part of the natural  judicial system, while the State Security Courts-Emergency were  formed according to the emergency law. These are extraordinary  courts linked with the state of emergency.    The state security chief prosecutor said that the first  defendant in the case, Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, practices local  and international terrorism and continues to incite youths. He  has misled them and made them join the convoy of destruction and  sabotage, which moves toward a sea of blood amid the dismembered  parts of Muslim and non-Muslim victims.    He noted that there is no text in the Constitution the  articles of which contradict the process of approving the  rulings of the Higher State Security Court-Emergency. He  clarified that when the law stipulated approval of the rulings,  it defined the limits for the signing authority according to its  speciality. It stipulated that before approval, the rulings  must be reviewed by the approval office, which consists of  judges who review the rulings before approving them.    The representative of the prosecution concluded his comment  by asking for the maximum sentence for the defendants. He noted  in this regard that the crimes they have been accused of have  been confirmed by the prosecution's eyewitnesses and  investigation.</p>

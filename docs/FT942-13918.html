			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Pitman confident takeover will not be his final flourish as bank chief On Wednesday night at a cocktail party in the City, a finance director of one of Britain's largest banks was musing about the last few years of Mr Brian Pitman as chief executive of Lloyds. 'Has he left it too late to buy something? Would he have time to make an acquisition work now?' he asked. They have been the most asked questions at gatherings of British bankers in the last year. As Mr Pitman's retirement looms, speculation has grown about how he will finish his career at the helm of the UK's most successful bank. Mr Pitman's strategy of concentrating on using his bank's UK branch network to sell financial products which undercut rivals on price has led to increasing questions over what his next step will be. He has done little to dampen speculation that he needed an acquisition to maintain momentum. Mr Pitman took over as Lloyds' chief executive in 1983 after spending nearly all his career in the bank. Together with Sir Jeremy Morse, the previous chairman, he set a strategy of narrowing the range of the bank's business. The strategy was noticeably successful in avoiding some of the traps encountered by other banks in areas such as lending to large companies and operating retail banks in the US. But Lloyds' share price has under-performed in the past 18 months as questions have grown about the next stage. The questions have surfaced with renewed urgency since Lloyds declared pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.01bn last year, and strengthened its tier 1 ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets to 6.6 per cent. The bank appeared to be starting to generate cash for which it had no obvious use. Analysts and bankers started to ask whether Mr Pitman might make an error in rushing into the wrong acquisition before 1995, the year he is due to retire. Mr Pitman expressed some satisfaction yesterday that he had not done so, and the rise in the bank's share price showed others agreed. 'We are not throwing money down the drain, which is what everyone feared,' he said. But although the purchase would leave Lloyds with little spare cash, Mr Pitman was careful to quash the notion this was definitely his last flourish. 'I have got another opportunity on my desk today which came out of the blue. I'm not telling you what it is,' he said. It seems there is plenty of room for speculation yet.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Observer: Down the line Can it be that Toyota Motor is about to loosen up culturally by passing on the presidency from 67-year-old Soichiro Toyoda to his younger brother Tatsuro? After all, with Dollars 13bn in the bank, it could perhaps afford to add a touch of cosmopolitan leavening to its almost paradigmatically Japanese style of management. Its achievement in emerging from turbulent times as the world's richest automobile company owes much to the 10-year reign of the elder Toyoda, son of the founder Kiichiro. But the buzz is that Soichiro now wants to devote his considerable energies to the influential Federation of Industrial Organisations, where he is vice-chairman. Although his younger brother is also an engineer by training, the hand-over would bring more international experience to Toyota's driving seat. Now 63, Tatsuro has an MBA degree from New York University and has been looking after the business outside Japan. In the end, though, whether the change takes place depends not on the two brothers, but on the company's 79-year-old chairman. Needless to say, he's their uncle Eiji who made his name pioneering the super-efficient Toyota production system in the 1950s.</p>

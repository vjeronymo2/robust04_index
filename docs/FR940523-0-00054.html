			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Response to Public Comments on the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's proposed rule was published on August 9, 1993 (58 FR 42450). A public hearing was held on September 14, 1993 in Denver, Colorado. A total of 16 written comments were received, of which four identical comments were also presented orally at the public hearing. Most of the comments concerned eligibility for reimbursement, reimbursable costs, determination of the Federal reimbursement ratio, definition of byproduct material, and claim documentation requirements. These and all other comments to the proposed rule are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Eligibility for Reimbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subject to certain specific limitations set forth in section 1001(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296(a)(b)), Title X requires the Department to reimburse licensees of active uranium or thorium processing sites for that portion of remedial action costs that may be attributed to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Parties eligible for reimbursement must be, or have been, licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, and must have incurred costs of ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, or other remedial action'' at an ``active uranium or thorium processing site,'' as those terms are defined by Title X, sections 1004(3) and 1004(1), respectively (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(3) and 2296a&hyph;3(1)). A number of comments were received requesting clarification or revision of the proposed rule's requirements concerning eligibility for reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that the proposed rule's definition of ``licensee'' be changed to specifically include entities licensed by an Agreement State. Sections 1001(a) and (b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(a) and (b)) require that the Department reimburse ``persons licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.'' Both section 62 and section 81 confer licensing authority to AEC and its successor agency, the NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, NRC and a state may enter into an agreement pursuant to section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act which provides for discontinuance of the regulatory authority of the NRC under Chapters 6, 7, and 8, and section 161 of the Atomic Energy Act when the NRC finds, upon certification by the Governor, that the state's program is in all respects compatible with the NRC's program for the regulation of byproduct and source material. The discontinuance of NRC authority is coupled with the Agreement State's issuance of licenses pursuant to a counterpart to section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, under state law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an Agreement State has received authority pursuant to a discontinuance agreement to issue licenses under either section 62 or section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, recipients of an Agreement State-issued license, that was in effect or pending on January 1, 1978, are eligible to apply for reimbursement under Title X. In addition, some active site licensees have been subject to remedial action requirements established both by NRC and an Agreement State. Accordingly, the definition of ``licensee'' in the proposed rule has been revised to clarify that a person licensed under the authority of either section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, by NRC, or under state law by an Agreement State, or both, is eligible to apply for reimbursement of costs of remedial action. This approach is consistent with, and reflected by, the definition of ``active uranium or thorium processing site'' in section 1004(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(1)), which specifies that the license for the production of uranium or thorium derived from ore may be issued by NRC, AEC, or by an Agreement State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments were also received concerning the proposed eligibility requirement that a licensee also be a ``site owner'' of an active processing site. These commenters pointed out that land ownership was not intended by Congress to be a requirement for reimbursement. One commenter indicated that ownership of the property on which its processing site is located is divided between private, Federal, and state parties. Other commenters were concerned that the intent of Title X would be contravened if land ownership was a condition of eligibility for reimbursement. These commenters suggested that land ownership could also be difficult to define and determine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;1) appears to contemplate that applications for reimbursements will be made by ``a site owner,'' section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(A)) specifically refers to reimbursements paid ``to any licensee,'' and the remainder of Title X is also drafted in terms of payments to licensees. The term site owner, as used in section 1002 (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;1), is not defined nor is there any legislative history that sheds light on the single reference to ``site owner'' in section 1002. Consistent with apparent Congressional intent, the Department has interpreted the term ``site owner'' to include any person that currently holds, or held in the past, any interest in land, including but not limited to a fee simple absolute, surface or subsurface ownership of mining claims, easements, or a right of access for the purposes of remediation, or any other legal or equitable interest. The Department has concluded that this definition will encompass all eligible current and former licensees. To avoid unnecessary confusion, the term ``site owner'' is not used in the rule and the term ``licensee'' is used instead.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

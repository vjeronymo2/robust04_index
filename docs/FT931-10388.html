			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Karadzic under growing pressure to accept plan THE BOSNIAN Serb leader, Dr Radovan Karadzic, came under pressure yesterday from Russia, Serbia and the Yugoslav federal government, to make concessions over the proposed map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. As the United Nations Security Council met for its first review of negotiations on the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, both the Russian and Yugoslav governments made clear they fully supported the plan. Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton's new US administration, which has criticised it for allegedly being too favourable to the Bosnian Serbs, was still working on its own proposals. These are expected later this week and are thought unlikely to be as radically different as was first thought. The public support given by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, to the Vance-Owen plan will complicate the task of the US administration, which has made clear it wants the Russians to be closely associated with any US initiative. Mr Ilija Djukic, the federal Yugoslav foreign minister, issued a special statement here yesterday saying his government supported the mediators' plan 'as the most complete and realistic framework for establishing just and lasting peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina'. Mr Djukic told the FT that he had made clear to Dr Karadzic that 'this is the time when he should say 'yes''. However, it is the Bosnian Moslems who are currently deemed the biggest obstacle to a settlement. Confident the US will not force them to accept an agreement they oppose, they are refusing to discuss the map altogether. Mr Vance, in his report to the Security Council, said the mediators had constantly sought to maintain and reinforce the status of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a sovereign, independent, integral and multi-ethnic state. He stressed the map the mediators proposed would require Bosnian Serbs to give up large areas of territory. The UN yesterday resumed its humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo amid heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia and western Croatia.</p>

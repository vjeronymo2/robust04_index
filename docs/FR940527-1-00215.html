			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current depreciation expenses represent the summed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation charges for all past purchases of fixed capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets that are still depreciable in the current period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The input prices associated with these depreciation expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are the purchase prices attached to all past and current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital purchases for capital still depreciable in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current period. A weighted average of these purchase prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus represents the input price associated with depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses in the current period. Thus, the depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input price for the current period measures price aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current depreciation expenses for capital just as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating input price index for the current period measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price aspects of current operating expenses for labor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-capital goods and services. The depreciation input  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price differs from the operating input price in that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation input price is a composite of all past capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase prices while the operating index input price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures purchase prices for current periods only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current interest expenses represent the total interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges for all still-active past debt instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the purchase of fixed capital assets. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input prices associated with these interest expenses are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest rates attached to all past debt instruments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are still active in the current period. A weighted average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these interest rates thus represents the input price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with interest expenses in the current period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the interest input price for the current period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures price aspects of current interest expenses just as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operating input price index for the current period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures price aspects of current operating expenses for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor and non-capital goods and services. The interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input price differs from the operating input price in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the depreciation input price is a composite of all past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest rates for debt instruments still active while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating index input price measures purchase prices for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current periods only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current year capital-related expenses for taxes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance have an annual time dimension and, therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices associated with these expenses are, like operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input prices, current year prices only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Revisions to the Depreciation Component of the CIPI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter on a previous version of the CIPI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that constant annual weights for capital price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proxies be replaced by variable annual weights that reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vintage purchases of capital. The commenter pointed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that annual purchases of real capital tend to increase over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. As annual purchases of capital increase, the later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years in the moving average of depreciation costs should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighted more heavily than the earlier years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with this comment. Accordingly, a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data base was prepared to provide appropriate historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weights for depreciation and interest input prices. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data base starts with financial variables from the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital Association (AHA) Panel Survey. These are enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with data from Medicare cost reports and from the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Commerce Capital Expenditure Survey. The data base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides annual estimates of nominal purchases for building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fixed equipment and for movable equipment. Leasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts were converted to nominal purchases using the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships as appear for owner-operated capital. Nominal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases were then converted to annual real (that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant dollar) purchases by dividing nominal expenditures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an appropriate purchase price proxy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Expected life for building and fixed equipment and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> movable equipment were derived from Medicare cost reports by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dividing book value of assets by current year depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts. The relative distribution of real capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases within the respective life for building and fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment (25 years) and for movable equipment (10 years)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were derived from the special data base. These relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributions are shown in Table 1. Relative distributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a number of different time periods were averaged to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the distributions in Table 1. These distributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were all very similar regardless of the periods chosen and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, we selected an average of the distributions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to simplify the calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

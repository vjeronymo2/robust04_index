			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft Metallgesellschaft has developed into the OJ Simpson saga of the German corporate world, with each new lurid development subject to fascinated media attention. Damaging headlines this week include a clash with a Nobel prize-winning economist over the handling of last year's derivatives crisis and a sharp profits downgrading from Deutsche Bank's research arm. The shares revived yesterday but at DM134 they have fallen by more than a third since the beginning of the month. This performance reflects profound doubts about the pace of MG's recovery. Nine months after his appointment as chief executive, Mr Kajo Neukirchen is still fire-fighting. Recent deals, notably the unscrambling of MG's bizarre ties to Castle Energy Corporation in the US and the sale of the group's mining operations, have capped potential liabilities and raised cash. But, as the group hinted earlier this month, a fresh injection of equity capital is likely to be required before too long. That is not the only concern. What is left after the succession of disposals in the past nine months is an unexciting collection of low-margin businesses, in sectors such as metals smelting, trading, plant engineering and specialty chemicals. The modest returns will hardly allow a speedy restoration of the dividend, especially given the need for further rationalisation in smelting. It is small wonder investors are losing patience.</p>

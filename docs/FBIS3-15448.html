The situation has  somewhat evened on Sunday morning.    There were positional battles there throughout Saturday with  no substantial gains made by either side.    At the same time, the spokesman denied the Azeri defence  ministry's report saying that up to 100 Armenian soldiers were  killed following an abortive Armenian advance. Three Armenian  tanks were also destroyed.    Reports from Stepanakert say that 120 Azeri soldiers have  been killed in two days of fighting. Two Azeri tanks and one  APC were hit. Nine Armenian soldiers were also killed and 35  others injured.</p>

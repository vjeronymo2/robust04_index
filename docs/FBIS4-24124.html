			<p>BFN     [Text] The process of confining and demobilizing troops  from the government and the Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] continues slowly. According to figures supplied by the  UN Operations in Mozambique, over the past two days the  government only confined 421 troops, while Renamo confined  seven. During the same period, the government demobilized 373  soldiers, while Renamo demobilized 264 soldiers. So far, the  government has demobilized about 19,000 troops, while Renamo has  demobilized more than 3,000. The government still has to  demobilize about 49 [figure as heard] soldiers and Renamo about  6,000. International members of the Supervision and Control  Commission [CSC] in Maputo have expressed the fear that the  government may not conclude the confinement and demobilization  of its troops within the deadline.</p>

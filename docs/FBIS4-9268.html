			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- The directors of the  district offices consider the decision by the Slovak Government  to dismiss 26 of them an "awkward governmental farce," Frantisek  Gaulieder, director of Galanta, South Slovakia, district office,  told journalists today.    On March 19, the Slovak Government decided to remove 26 out  of 38 directors of district offices for having signed a  statement against the parliamentary speech by President Michal  Kovac who criticised former Premier Vladimir Meciar.    The statement accused Kovac of gross offences against  parliamentary democracy, malicious and false accusation against  Meciar, expedient destabilisation of the political situation and  discredit to the previous government.    The directors hold the view that Deputy Premier Roman Kovac  proved by his arguments and positive attitude to their dismissal  that he was incompetent to perform his post. As a result, he  should contemplate his resignation from Moravcik's cabinet.    The directors consider their dismissal to be a political  step. Some of them claim that the Interior Ministry attempted  "moral corruption" because the state secretary, Roman Vavrik,  who participated in appointing them, offered in private  conversation that they can remain in their positions provided  they resign from the HZDS (Meciar's Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia).    The director hold the view that if Slovakia's interests are  jeopardised, they can make a statement. A director stated that  Slovakia was not yet a stable democracy and the directors did  not break any law by their criticism of Kovac's speech. "What is  not forbidden, is allowed," he said.</p>

Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs  Research Council, said the draft shows that the issue of a  budget for construction of new bullet train lines and other  difficult problems has been sidestepped and left unsettled. The  chief LDP policy-maker said his party will press the government  in the Diet to meet its budget demands.    Noriaki Sasaki, chairman of the JCP Economic Policy  Committee, said it is unacceptable that the budget limits income  tax cuts to one year. He said the draft shows that if income  tax cuts are to be on a permanent basis, there would have to be  a major raise in the consumption tax rate and such an increase  is quite unacceptable.</p>

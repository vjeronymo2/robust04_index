			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY TROOPS FIRE ON BEIJING CROWDS  </P> <P> I am a student from China attending a university here. Twenty-four hours after  the Communist Party in China began its massacre, I called my family in Beijing.  Here is what my uncle, a factory manager, told me:  </P> <P> "It was even worse than what you have been hearing. The death toll is not just  in the thousands, but in the tens of thousands. The army did not confine its  murderous action only to Tian An Men and the students there, but began the  killing on its march into the central square, firing directly at innocent  people wherever they happened to be gathered, as if all of us were the enemy.  Stay there in America. We are all revolutionaries now. Please ask the American  government and the American people to support us."  </P> <P> Please, people of America, help us in our hour of need.  </P> <P> ZHANG XIAO PING  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

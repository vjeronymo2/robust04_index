			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Romie Evangelista] </F>   [Excerpts] The chief government peace negotiator with the  local communist movement said yesterday the communist New  People's Army's (NPA) Alex Boncayao Brigade's (ABB) threat to  resume terrorist operations in the country will not derail the  peace talks.    Howard Dee, former ambassador to the Vatican and chief of  the  government panel holding preliminary talks with the National  Democratic Front (NDF) said the planned peace talks will  continue despite the ABB threat.    The ABB over the weekend threatened to assassinate criminals  and corrupt government, police and military officers allegedly  involved or members of crime syndicates.    According to Dee, the ABB, which belongs to the CPP  [Communist Party of the Philippines] breakaway group  Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee, had already declared  autonomy from the Netherlands- based NDF leadership headed by  Jose Maria Sison.    He however hinted that the government is ready to talk with  the "revisionist faction [breakaway groups]" of the local  communist movement should the talks with the Sison faction of  the NDF collapse.    The ABB threat "will not affect the peace talks in itself  but  it could be a subject that will come out in the course of the  peace talks," Dee said. [passage omitted]    Dee said the exploratory talks in Vietnam, should they push  through, will only lay the grounds for the formal talks.    He said the exploratory talks in Vietnam are expected to  take  place within the first quarter of the year while the formal  talks are expected to last for about three to six months.    "If the exploratory talks will not take place in the first  quarter, we have to consider other options like opening up to  the revisionist faction in the communist movement," Dee said.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / People: Sir Archibald Forster retires from Esso Sir Archibald Forster is to retire as chairman and chief executive of oil company Esso next February, when he reaches the age of 65. His successor - subject to election by the Esso board - is expected to be Keith Taylor, currently managing director of Esso Exploration and Production. Sir Archibald was described by one Esso insider as a 'thoroughly professional oilman, who was probably never more comfortable than when he was out on the ground, talking to employees'. He has been in the top job since 1979, and so has guided the company through the peak of North Sea production, the oil price crash of 1986, and the transition of the North Sea into a mature oil and gas province. He is said to have been instrumental in persuading Geoffrey Howe, then chancellor of the exchequer, to ease, in the 1983 Budget, what was considered to be the 'penal' fiscal regime under which the UK oil industry was operating. He will also be remembered for the skilful way in which he put Esso's case to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into petrol pricing in 1989, which concluded that the petrol market was fully competitive. He joined Esso in 1951 at the Fawley refinery in Hampshire, and became refinery manager at Milford Haven, Wales, before returning to Fawley as refinery manager in 1964. After a spell as logistics director of Esso UK he left for the US where he filled a variety of posts at Exxon, the parent corporation. He returned to London as vice-president of Esso Europe in 1975, and became managing director of Esso UK three years later. Sir Archibald is a former president of the Institute of Chemical Engineers and of the Institute of Petroleum. He is a non-executive director of Midland Bank and, recently, of Trafalgar House.</p>

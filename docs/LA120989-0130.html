			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS STOPS MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> Los Alamitos High School scored 13 consecutive points in the fourth quarter in  a 62-61 victory over Mission Viejo in a Trabuco Hills tournament semifinal game  Friday.  </P> <P> El Dorado, like Los Alamitos from the Empire League, advanced to the  championship game by beating Trabuco Hills, 82-78. The championship game is at  8:15 tonight at Trabuco Hills High School.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo (2-1) led Los Alamitos (3-0), 49-43, when Robert Conlisk scored.  He was fouled on the play and his free throw narrowed the Diablos' lead to  49-47.  </P> <P> "That play was the game," Mission Viejo Coach Bob Minier said. He also cited  Los Alamitos' fourth-quarter steals and his team's late-game fatigue as  factors.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's first basket of the fourth quarter, a Tom Merk field goal  followed by a free throw, moved the Diablos to within five. Mark Wright's field  goal in the final six seconds cut the Los Alamitos lead to three points. Then,  Eric Cramer fouled Los Alamitos' Bryan Hakala on the inbound pass with five  seconds to play. Hakala made the first, 62-58, but missed the second. Mission  Viejo's Greg Amaya made a three-pointer before time ran out.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said the keys to victory were "sealing off  their rebounds and limiting them to one shot."  </P> <P> In other Trabuco Hills tournament games:  </P> <P> El Dorado 82, Trabuco Hills 78 -- Jerome Facione made a pair of free throws  with 10 seconds left to give El Dorado (4-0) a four-point lead. Facione scored  15 points. El Dorado was led in scoring by guard Mike Bradach who scored 33  points. Trabuco Hills led, 46-42, at the half but El Dorado outscored the  Mustangs, 21-15, in the third quarter to take a 63-61 lead. Trabuco Hills plays  Mission Viejo for third place today at 6:30.  </P> <P> Foothill 91, University 69 -- Mark Wilkinson scored 24 of his 32 points in the  third quarter to lead Foothill over University.  </P> <P> University (1-3) trailing Foothill (1-3) by 10, penetrated the Knights' zone  defense and got the ball to Klaus Perwas to pull to within two, 35-33, at  halftime. Perwas scored 14 of his 23 points in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Foothill switched to a man-to-man defense in the third quarter and held Perwas  to nine points in the second half.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, </F> "South Yemen's defense minister," in "his office at the Defense  Ministry in Aden," by Zaki Shihab; date not given]    [Text] [Shihab] How do you assess the military situation  on the fronts four weeks after the start of the fighting?    [Tahir] You know well that this all-out war in our country  started, in effect, on 27 April 1994 with President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's famous speech in which he declared war. Less  than two hours after that speech, the 3d Armored Brigade, one of  the brigades we moved to the northern governorates immediately  after unity, was attacked. A few days later, the Ba Suhayb  Brigade came under a treacherous attack in Dhamar. 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih then pushed his troops on various fronts,  including Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, Kirsh, al-Bayda',  Mukayris, and Hurayb-Bayhan, and Bab el-Mandeb-Kharaz; that is,  on the borders between the former North and South Yemens.  Battles continue now for the fourth consecutive week. This  war, which started in effect on 27 April, was prepared and  planned in advance and many rehearsals were made. On the eve of  signing the "Pledge and Accord Document" in Amman on 21  February, units from the al-'Amaliqah Brigade attacked our units  in Abyan. We, however, exercised self-restraint and did not  retaliate. The same thing happened again when the 1st Armored  Division of the Republican Guard attacked the 5th Infantry  Brigade in Sufyan area in the Sanaa suburbs. That brigade was  destroyed completely and its soldiers who survived were  displaced. The final rehearsal was the attack against the 3d  Armored Brigade in 'Amran on the same day (President) 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih declared war.    It thus became apparent to us that the northern president  wants to exterminate not only his political opponents, but also  every officer and soldier from the southern governorates. This  was confirmed practically by the all-out war he launched on the  various fronts and in which he made the villages, towns, and  civilian installations a target for barbaric and random  artillery, rocket, and air attacks.    [Shihab] How able are the southern forces to stand fast in  the face of the northern troops, despite the other side's  superiority in number and military equipment?    [Tahir] It is sufficient to say that (President) 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and his advisers planned to settle the matter  within hours, and at maximum in one or two days. This was  frequently stated either by their president or his advisers,  such as (Dr.) Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, (Dr.) 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, and (Foreign Minister) Basindwah. This was an  illusion and a fantasy. The war has entered its second month  now and our troops are still standing fast against the invading  and aggressive forces that (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has  thrown in. He has taken advantage of the numerical superiority,  not only of his regular troops but also of the thousands of  citizens from the central areas. He used these citizens for two  purposes: To serve as human shields in his aggressive war on  the one hand, and on the other, to get these citizens killed  and, consequently, to weaken these areas so that they will not  pose any threat against him in the future.    Despite their smaller number, our Armed Forces have managed  not only to confront and stand fast, but also to deal fatal  blows to the aggressive troops and force them to retreat in more  than one battle and on more than one front. This has actually  happened on the Kharaz front, where three reinforced brigades --  the 1st 'Urubah Brigade, the 4th 'Urubah Brigade, and Khalid  Barracks -- were defeated in a battle against one of our  brigades. I can confirm that our Armed Forces are capable of  defense and can stand fast.    [Shihab] As a former defense minister in united Yemen, how  do you view the northern forces' capability of continuing the  war?    [Tahir] I believe that the combat capabilities of the  regular  forces, dominated by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's family, have been  exhausted. Thousands of civilians mobilized by tribal men ran  away from the battles, were killed, or surrendered after they  discovered the falseness of the slogans raised by al-Ahmar's  clan -- slogans claiming that unity and legitimacy are being  defended and that the south and the central regions are  secessionists.    [Shihab] Battles are now raging in the southern regions, and  your role is defensive. Will you launch an attack to expel the  northern forces from your territories?    [Tahir] It is quite natural that battles are raging in  southern regions as you have described them, because 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's forces have been preparing for this  comprehensive war against the sons of the southern governorates  by massing and mobilizing all forces and means, at a time when  we dealt with the unity in an emotional and innocent manner as  if it were an irrevocable issue. Therefore, our combat  operations are defensive. In other words, we are defending the  sons of the southern and eastern governorates. At the same  time, our forces dealt crushing blows to the hostile forces,  inflicted on them huge losses in life and equipment, and forced  them to retreat and withdraw on several fronts.    [Shihab] Do you have any idea of when the battle will be  decided?    [Tahir] Our cause is just because we did not attack anybody.  We are defending our people, who will support us regardless of  circumstances or the duration of the war.    [Shihab] Aden seems to be besieged on three sides. Are there  any plans to break the siege and link Aden again with other  governorates in the near future?    [Tahir] Aden, as well as the southern and eastern  governorates, suffered from the central government in Sanaa,  which tried to impose the system of the Republic of Yemen. Aden  also has suffered from the presence of the Sanaa regime's forces  in Abyan and Lahij in the north and the east since the  establishment of the unity.    State institutions in Aden, along with its honest and  cooperative citizens, enabled Aden to rise again to carry out  its duties as a capital of our young republic and even as a  capital of all Yemen. It is the one that hosted the National  Political Forces Dialogue and it was a venue for the national  conference.    We are not only defending Aden, but also all the territories  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. All the sons of the  northern governorates are taking part in this effort, especially  the sons of the central regions who are impatiently waiting for  the day of salvation from the domination of al-Ahmar's clan.    [Shihab] Some circles talk about northern penetrations in  southern ranks, and some others say that commanders of some  units were executed in the battlefield. Is this true?    [Tahir] It is quite natural that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will  find supporters within our units because we believed we had one  state and one army. But the northern president and his  supporters behaved in a conspiratorial and opportunist way. I  can assure you that these elements are very few and do not  affect at all our forces' defensive position.    [Shihab] In your opinion, was this breakthrough the cause  of the northern Yemeni forces' success in penetrating deep into  the southern territory?    [Tahir] The so-called northern forces' success in  penetrating  deep in the southern territory was first caused by the element  of surprise in war; that is, the method of treachery followed by  the forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, in addition to the numerical  superiority and the mobilization of thousands of tribal men. In  view of all this, our forces had to absorb the surprise attacks,  deal crushing blows to the attacking forces, and reorganize.    [Shihab] It was observed recently that your forces possessed  new weapons and equipment. Did you obtain new weapons from  abroad?    [Tahir] We have not obtained any weapons or equipment from  abroad. The most important weapon we have is the well-trained  Yemeni individual who is aware of the just cause he is adhering  to; namely, the cause of defending his land and honor.    [Shihab] Southern military communiques say that your forces  fired surface-to-air missiles that intercepted northern missiles  and destroyed them over Aden. Does this mean that your forces  possess enough of these missiles to ward off any heavy missile  attacks on Aden?    [Tahir] The firing of surface-to-surface missiles by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's forces against homes of innocents citizens is  a sign of bankruptcy in this losing war. These forces believed  that they would be able to decide the course of this war within  one or two days. Indeed, or defense units shot down a number of  these missiles.    [Shihab] You have been quoted as saying that the northern  forces employed chemical weapons in the Shabwah Governorate. Do  you intend to retaliate by employing similar weapons? Do you  have proof of your accusations?    [Tahir] What we have said were justifiable suspicions. Those  who began this destructive war against an entire people and used  savage shelling by all means of heavy weapons, including  missiles, will not hesitate to employ whatever they lay their  hand on. Our suspicions are strengthened by the relationship  between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn,  who is known for his longstanding hostility to our people.  Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid's description  of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih as a "little Saddam" is not without  significance.</p>

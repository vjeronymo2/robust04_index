			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Consistency Rules for Consolidated and Controlled Groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide consistency rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporations that are members of consolidated groups or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled groups. These consistency rules are based on proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations applying section 382 to consolidated and controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups. The consistency rules contained in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have been revised in the final regulations because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed consolidated and controlled group regulations have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been finalized yet. The final regulations provide that if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing-of-the-books election is made with respect to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ownership change occurring during a consolidated return year, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations with respect to that ownership change must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the election. Further consideration will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given to consistency rules for consolidated groups in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of final regulations applying section 382 to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Limitation Increase Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Notice 87&hyph;79, 1987&hyph;2 C.B. 387, the IRS announced its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intention to issue regulations that would allow taxpayers to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a closing-of-the-books election. The Notice stated that, prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the issuance of regulations, taxpayers would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the statutory ratable allocation method unless they obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a private letter ruling allowing them to use a different method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Notice 87&hyph;79, the IRS issued a number of private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter rulings that authorized allocations based on a closing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayers' books. Some of these rulings allowed taxpayers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in their section 382 limitation to the extent that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net pre-change income was offset by net post-change loss in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computing taxable income or loss for the change year. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of the increased limitation was to put the taxpayer in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position similar to the position it would have been in had its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year ended on the change date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interest of simplicity, the proposed regulations do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not include a rule providing for increases in the annual section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 382 limitation in cases in which net post-change loss offsets net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-change income. Several commentators questioned the failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include a limitation increase rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations retain the approach of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, in which change year income and losses may be netted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together without limitation. This approach may be either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favorable or unfavorable to taxpayers, depending on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. This approach is disadvantageous when it results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the netting of a post-change loss against pre-change income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversely, the approach is advantageous to taxpayers that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to net a pre-change loss against post-change income without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation. In these cases, if the taxpayers' year had ended on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the change date, the loss so used would have been subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 382 limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adoption of a limitation increase rule would add significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity to the regulations. If taxpayers were protected from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disadvantages of netting a post-change loss against pre-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change income, consistency would require that taxpayers not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed the benefit of netting pre-change loss against post-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change income without limitation. In other words, detailed rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for applying the section 382 limitation within the change year to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit the use of a loss in the pre-change portion of the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against income in the post-change period would be necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concomitants of a limitation increase rule. To avoid this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity, the final regulations allow change year losses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset change year income without limitation and do not include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation increase rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Additional Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the interaction of the ratable allocation rules under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations and the built-in gain and loss rules under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 382(h), particularly with respect to extraordinary items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  an asset sale not made in the ordinary course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business). A commentator recommended that the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include both a rule for extraordinary items and the limitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase rule (described in paragraph B above). After due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration, the IRS and the Treasury Department decided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules relating to extraordinary items would add unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity to the final regulations. Thus, the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not contain special rules with respect to the allocation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary items. The IRS and the Treasury Department may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give further consideration to the desirability of rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing extraordinary items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

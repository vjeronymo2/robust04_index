Impact of the SOES Interim Changes on the Quality of The Nasdaq Stock Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In SEC Release No. 34&hyph;33377 <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  (the ``Release''), the SEC approved certain changes to the NASD's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') on a pilot basis. Specifically, the SEC approved the following changes to SOES: (1) A reduction in the maximum size order eligible for SOES execution to 500 shares from 1,000 shares; <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  (2) a reduction in the minimum exposure limit for ``unpreferenced'' SOES orders to two times the maximum exposure limit from five times the maximum exposure; (3) the elimination of exposure limits for ``preferenced'' orders; (4) the implementation of an automated function for updating market maker quotations when the market maker's exposure limit has been exhausted; and (5) the prohibition of short sale transactions through SOES. These changes, collectively referred to hereinafter as the ``SOES changes,'' went into effect on January 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33377 (Dec. 23, 1993), 58 FR 69419 (Dec. 30, 1993) (approval of File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;16 on a one-year pilot basis). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Thus with this change, the SOES maximum order size for Nasdaq National Market (NNM) securities is 200 shares or 500 shares, depending upon the trading characteristics of the particular security. All Nasdaq SmallCap securities are subject to a SOES maximum order size of 500 shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the pilot nature of these changes, the Commission stated that ``[a]ny further action the NASD seeks with respect to SOES_extension of these modifications upon expiration, or introduction of other changes_will require independent consideration under Section 19 of the Act.'' In addition, the SEC stated that, should the NASD desire to extend these SOES changes or modify SOES, the Commission would expect, ``the NASD to monitor the quality of its markets and assess the effects of the approved SOES changes on market quality for Nasdaq securities.'' Also, if feasible, the SEC instructed the NASD to provide a quantitative and statistical assessment of the effects of the SOES changes on market quality; or, if an assessment is not feasible, the SEC stated that the NASD should provide a reasoned explanation supporting that determination. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The SEC also expressed the view that it is not possible to determine from the correlation and regression analyses submitted in support of the SOES changes whether increased stock price volatility definitely leads to trading by SOES active trading (SAT) firms or trading by SAT firms results in additional stock price volatility. The SEC further determined that it is not possible to differentiate between the effects on spreads and stock price volatility attributable to active SOES trading and the effects attributable to other factors such as stock-specific news or volatility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, in order to facilitate and support approval of the Nasdaq Stock Market's Nasdaq Primary Order View and Execution (NPROVE) system, or an extension of the SOES changes, should the Commission not approve NPROVE before termination of the SOES changes, the NASD is submitting this economic study conducted by the NASD's Economic Research Department on the impacts of the SOES changes on the quality of the markets for Nasdaq securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, the study found that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Since the SOES changes went into effect in January 1994, quoted spreads in Nasdaq securities experienced a decline in the immediate period following implementation of the changes and have continued to decline since then. In particular, quoted spreads for the 500 largest Nasdaq National Market securities experienced a sharp decline from April 28 to May 12 and from June 23 to July 18. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some press reports have attributed the recent decline in spreads for Nasdaq stocks to the publication, on May 26 and 27, 1994, of newspaper articles in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  and other publications reporting the results of an economic study conducted by two academicians that illustrated the lack of odd-eighth quotes for active Nasdaq stocks. Contrary to these press reports, this study shows that spreads had indeed narrowed before publication of these articles (from April 28 to May 12), stabilized at these narrower levels from mid-May until June 23, and declined again from June 23 to July 18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;With the exception of a brief, market-wide period of volatility experienced by stocks traded on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, and the America Stock Exchange during the Spring, the volatility of Nasdaq securities appears to be unchanged in the period following implementation of the changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SOES changes were designed to correct a major market quality problem caused by the establishment in mid-1988 of: (1) a requirement that market makers in NNM securities must participate in SOES and (2) minimum market maker exposure limits of 5000 shares for the most active group of NNM securities (1988 SOES changes). While the 1988 SOES changes were intended to ensure that order entry firms could obtain executions for their customers in volatile markets, the changes also had the unintended consequence of dramatically changing the dynamics and economics of intra-day trading by investors in Nasdaq. Specifically, the assurance of automatic order execution afforded investors through SOES spawned trading by SAT firms that resulted in market makers receiving multiple executions in brief periods of time without the ability to update their quotes. This rapid-fire, intra-day trading by SAT firms increased the cost of market making and, in turn, resulted in a dramatic widening of displayed quotation spreads as market makers avoided the trading risks associated with the mandated 5,000-share exposure limit in SOES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SOES changes noted above were an attempt by the NASD to preserve the benefits of SOES for small retail investors and eliminate the negative market impacts created by abuses of SOES. As detailed below, the NASD's analysis illustrates that the SOES changes have been associated with substantive improvements in the quality of the markets for Nasdaq securities and that these positive improvements have become more pronounced the longer the changes have been in effect, as market makers have adjusted their trading practices to reflect the lower costs and risks associated with SOES trading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the SEC stated in the release, market factors other than SOES changes may be jointly or singly responsible for changes in market quality. However, market quality measures are useful in indicating whether the SOES changes have been associated with non-negative or positive changes in market quality. Even though cause and effect cannot be statistically proven, as pointed out succinctly in the Release, the absence of negative market developments associated with the implementation of the SOES changes, coupled with the apparent positive market improvements associated with the SOES changes, provides useful support for the SEC's evaluation of its decision to approve the SOES changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift waters The utilities areas of the market, always viewed as safe havens when the wider market comes under pressure, gave a strong performance yesterday, led by the water stocks. These were driven sharply higher, helped by general optimism over the forthcoming interim reporting season that commences on November 1 with results from Thames Water, which vies with North West as the sector leader. Dealers said the surge by the water issues was largely triggered by Smith New Court, whose analyst was said to have highlighted the potential for good increases in interim payments. Most analysts are looking for interim dividend rises in the region of 7 to 11 per cent for the individual companies. Specialists also pointed out that the government's golden share in all 10 water companies will be abolished on December 31, opening the way for takeover moves. The best individual performance came from Welsh Water, up 13 at 657p, while Anglian, 549p, Northumbrian, 687p, and Wessex, 631p, were all 12 ahead.</p>

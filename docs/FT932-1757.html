			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Ignoring Germany SEVERAL European central banks took advantage of the D-Mark's weakness in the exchange rate mechanism yesterday and cut their official interest rates, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank has not lowered any of its official interest rates for nearly six weeks. But as the D-Mark comes under pressure because of Germany's growing economic and budgetary problems, European central banks have taken the opportunity to push short-term rates below German levels. By far the most important round of policy easing has UK clearing bank base lending rate 6 per cent from January 26, 1993 been by the authorities in France, who must have been especially concerned by yesterday's news that French industrial production dropped 5.2 per cent in the year to April. The Bank of France yesterday pushed its intervention rate below the level of the German discount rate floor, cutting it by 25 basis points to 7 per cent. The central bank's 5 to 10-day lending rate came down by a similar amount to 8 per cent. The move helped to push French three-month money down some 20 basis points on the bid side from 7.05 per cent to 6.85 per cent. This in turn widened the spread between German and French cash to some 50 basis points, as German rates remained more or less unchanged. Similar cuts occurred across Europe yesterday. The Dutch and Belgian central banks trimmed their advances rate and central rate respectively by 10 basis points to 6.90 per cent. The guilder had been threatening to fall outside the Dutch central bank's self-imposed 50 basis points fluctuation band against the D-Mark in the ERM. Portugal also reduced its intervention rate, by 0.25 percentage points to 11 per cent. Dealers in sterling markets were rather more bullish about the prospects for a base rate cut in the UK following newspaper speculation at the weekend that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor, would reduce base rates by 1/2 percentage point this summer. The September short sterling contract rose 10 basis points to close at 94.19 on fairly heavy volume. In the cash market, three-month money was about  1/8 percentage point lower at 5 13/16 per cent. This was in spite of some difficulty removing a Pounds 1.45bn shortage, which left some Pounds 310m of late assistance.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Britain and China to hold HK airport talks: High-level negotiations will attempt to break deadlock over financing plans BRITAIN and China have agreed to high-level talks in an attempt to break the deadlock over the financing plans for Hong Kong's new multi-billion dollar airport. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, agreed in Rio de Janeiro over the weekend that the issue should be pushed forward in talks between London and Beijing. Mr Alastair Goodlad, a junior foreign office minister, is likely to lead the UK team when a time and venue have been agreed. Mr Major is understood to have impressed on Li the need for a speedy resolution of differences between China and Britain. The plan to build a new airport in Hong Kong has become a bellwether for confidence in the colony's future. Doubts over its acceptability to the Chinese last year caused a bout of damaging uncertainty and stock market jitters; it took a visit to Beijing by Mr Major to obtain a go-ahead for the project, subject to continuing consultation with China over its details. In recent weeks, however, fresh doubts have been raised as to whether the airport and its related projects can be started as soon as the Hong Kong government would like, following apparent foot-dragging by Beijing. The colonial government presented China with detailed plans for the financing of the integrated road, rail and airport project at the beginning of April. But the Chinese have called for more detail and have expressed concerns over the escalation in the cost of the overall project as well as individual parts of it. Beijing appears particularly concerned over the level of possible debts on the project the post-1997 government may inherit. These are currently estimated to amount to more than HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in the form of undertakings to support the project if it runs into difficulties, known as contingent liabilities. The Chinese also question the viability of a planned railway which will link the airport to urban areas in Hong Kong. These concerns have not been helped by the confusing way in which the local administration has publicised the financial details of the project. It started by releasing figures in real terms which estimated the cost at HKDollars 114bn, then gave out 'money of the day' figures which showed the cost at HKDollars 163.7bn. More recently it was revealed that if financing charges and fees were included the cost would be HKDollars 175bn. Further delays risk upsetting a very tight construction schedule and do nothing for those charged with selling the project to private financiers. The protracted nature of the negotiations has already begun to take its toll on the colony's support for the project. Conservative members of Hong Kong's local legislature have drawn up a plan to cut the cost of the airport railway from HKDollars 22.3bn to HKDollars 18bn. Business leaders have also criticised the government's handling of the negotiations. There are also worries in some quarters that China may be delaying its approval for financing of the airport as a way of pressuring Britain over other aspects of policy, notably the pace of democratic reform in the colony  -a subject raised by Mr Goodlad on a recent visit. China's sensitivity over future political arrangements in the colony has increased since the appointment of the first political governor of Hong Kong, Mr Chris Patten.</p>

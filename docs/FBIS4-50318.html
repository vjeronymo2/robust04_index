			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tonny Chan] </F>   [Text] The government would still be able to function even  if China fired all 14 top officials after 1997, Secretary for  the Civil Service Michael Sze said. He made it clear that the  government would move alone to appoint people to the top posts  if the worst happened and relations between Hong Kong and China  broke down.    Mr Sze's defiant remarks came after Chinese official Wang  Fengchao, deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, said the Special Administrative Region  (SAR) government would select its own officials to head the  future Hong Kong administration.    "If there's no communication (with China) in the runup to  1997, there'd still be the need to have people to do the job,"  Mr Sze said. "If the chief executive of the Special  Administrative Region thinks he should change those officials, I  believe the impact would not be great," he told a media  reception. "This is because our civil service structure is  stable and healthy. Every department knows its job."    He pointed out that department heads had been reshuffled  regularly and deputies took over a top post until an appointment  was made. "After Mrs Anson Chan was appointed Chief Secretary,  deputy Secretary for the Civil Service, Stuart Harbinson, acted  as the secretary until I took over the post," he said. It would  be irresponsible for the future chief executive to sack senior  officials for political reasons even though he had the authority  to do so as the SAR's chief, he said.    Nine of the 14 secretary posts were occupied by locals  without the right of abode in other countries and the remaining  five--including the Secretary for Security--should be localised  by 1996, Mr Sze said. He said the government would choose  people who complied with the Basic Law requirements "on the  surface".    "The expression `on the surface' is a responsible remark.    "I won't be able to know whether or not they will apply for  a  foreign passport in the future," Mr Sze said. When asked if he  was referring to people hired on local terms, he said: "I mean  people who look like you and me (ethnic Chinese)."    But he said it remained the government's wish to discuss the  transition of senior civil servants with the Chinese authority.  Mr Sze said he knew that many civil servants had fears about  the future. "They are not worried that they may lose their jobs  but they are worried about the future as an ordinary person in  the street," he said. "The worry is understandable.    "They are also concerned whether there would be changes  within the government."</p>

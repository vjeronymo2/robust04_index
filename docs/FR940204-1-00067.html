			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar in appearance to two other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subspecies of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria zerene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Hammond 1980, Howe 1975, McCorkle and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hammond 1988). The threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zerene hippolyta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) has lighter basal suffusion on the upper sides of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wings than Behren's silverspot butterfly. Another related taxon, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered Myrtle's silverspot butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria zerene myrtleae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger in size and also lighter in color than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria zerene behrensii. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Behren's silverspot butterfly inhabits coastal terrace prairie  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat. The life history of Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the callippe silverspot butterfly. The females lay their eggs in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debris and dried stems of the larval foodplant, violet ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Viola adunca <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (McCorkle 1980, McCorkle and Hammond 1988). Upon hatching, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caterpillars wander a short distance and spin a silk pad upon which they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass the fall and winter. The larvae are dark-colored with many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> branching sharp spines on the back. The caterpillars immediately seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out the foodplant upon termination of diapause in the spring. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larva then forms a pupa within a chamber of leaves that they have drawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together with silk. The adults emerge in about 2 weeks and live for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 3 weeks. Depending upon environmental conditions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flight period of this single brooded butterfly ranges from July to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August. Adult males patrol open areas in search of newly emerged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> females.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The historic range of Behren's silverspot butterfly extends from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mouth of the Russian River in Sonoma County northward along the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate coast to southern Mendocino County in the vicinity of Point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arena (Mattoon,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1989). The six historic populations were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to occur in coastal terrace prairie and adjacent habitats. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single extant population, which was recently discovered, occurs on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privately owned land near Point Arena in Mendocino County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alameda whipsnake ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member of the Colubridae family (Morey and Bioassay 1988). It was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described by William Reimer (1954) from a specimen collected in Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hills, Alameda County, California. The common name ``Alameda whipsnake''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is utilized in this proposed rule instead of ``Alameda striped racer''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was used in the November 21, 1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58804). ``Whipsnake'' is a widely recognized common name for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Masticophis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Stebbins 1985). The Alameda whipsnake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a slender, fast moving diurnal snake with a narrow neck and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively broad head with large eyes. The dorsal surface is colored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sooty black or dark brown with a distinct yellow-orange stripe down each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> side. The anterior portions of the ventral surface are orange-rufous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colored, the midsection is cream colored, and the posterior and tail are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pinkish. The adults reach a length of 91 to 122 centimeters (3 to 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feet). This subspecies is distinguished from the more common California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whipsnake ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. l. lateralis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) by its comparatively wide orange stripes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which run laterally down each side.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alameda whipsnake inhabits the inner coast range in western and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central Contra Costa and Alameda Counties (McGinnis 1992). One of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two major populations extends from approximately El Sorbante south to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about Hayward. The second is found from Clayton/Mount Diablo southeast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Vasco Road area. It occurs mostly on privately owned land, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also occurs on State and county land.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alameda whipsnake usually is found in northern coastal scrub or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chaparral, but it also may occur in adjacent habitats. This extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fast-moving, lizard-eating specialist holds its head high off the ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a cobra-like manner to peer over grass or rocks at potential prey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alameda whipsnake has been found to exhibit territorial behavior,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possessing home ranges varying in size from 2 to 8.7 hectares (5.0 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21.5 acres). Some animals have been recorded to have moved over 1 mile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while traversing their areas (McGinnis 1992). The life history of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alameda whipsnake is not well understood (Goldberg 1975, Hammerson  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot butterfly as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered with critical habitat was published on July 3, 1978 (43 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28938). The critical habitat portion of that proposal was withdrawn by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service on March 6, 1979 (44 FR 12382), because of procedural and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other substantive changes in the Endangered Species Act by the 1978  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments. The Service again published a proposed rule to designate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat for the callippe silverspot butterfly on March 28, 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (45 FR 20503). The proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfly was withdrawn on September 30, 1980 (45 FR 64607), because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978 Endangered Species Act amendments required that the final rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species be completed within 2 years after the date of publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to list it as endangered or threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The callippe silverspot butterfly was listed as a category 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and January 6, 1989  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. This category includes species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be appropriate to list as endangered or threatened, but for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which conclusive data on their biological vulnerability is not currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to support proposed rules. The species was listed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category 1 candidate species in the November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animal Notice of Review because of increased threats from overcollecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section). This category includes taxa for which the Service has on file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to propose listing them as endangered or threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

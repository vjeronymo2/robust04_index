			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> THE SOUTH;  </P> <P> BALTIMORE TO TAKE TRAINLOAD OF SEWAGE  </P> <P> Baltimore officials have agreed to take back a trainload of sewage sludge after  authorities in Louisiana and Mississippi refused to let a disposal company  unload the waste in their states. The first of 63 carloads of the nonhazardous  waste will begin arriving in about nine days at the Back River waste treatment  plant that produced the sludge, city officials said. The 5,000 tons of sludge  will be treated with lime and then transferred to a facility that will mix the  waste with leaves and sell it as compost, George Balog, the city's public works  director said.  </P></p>

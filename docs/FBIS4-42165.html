			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic will not  attach agreements on good relations which it has concluded with  its neighbors to the future stability pact in Europe, Czech  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told CTK today.    Zieleniec, currently in Paris attending a two-day conference  on the stability pact which opened today, said that the  conference's final resolution would call on Central and East  European states to do so tomorrow.    Zieleniec explained that the Czech Republic had similar  agreements will all its neighboring countries and their  inclusion in the pact was voluntary.    He protested against the Western countries' apparent  tendency  to present the crisis in the former Yugoslavia as the reason for  holding the conference. "I see it as a great simplification  where Sarajevo serves as an argument and simultaneously the talk  is about the Czech Republic. This logic has no place in Central  European political thinking," Zieleniec said. However, the  wording of the final resolution is generally acceptable, he told  journalists.    Positive changes were to a great extent initiated by the  Czech Republic which emphasized that "economic cooperation was a  pillar of good relations and roundtable discussions should  include economic cooperation," Zieleniec said.    Regional roundtable discussions should follow up the Paris  conference resolutions and result in the conclusion of bilateral  and multilateral agreements on good neighborly relations in  different regions, Zieleniec said. So far six regions have been  proposed, among them Central Europe and the Baltic.    Zieleniec said discussions should embrace not only borders  and ethnic groups but also regional cooperation, economic  cooperation and free trade.    Attempts were apparent at the conference that  representatives  of minorities participate in these discussions as well. This  demand was raised by Hungarians living in Romania and Hungary  supported it, Zieleniec said, considering it unlikely that the  conference would agree with this.    He went on to say that the stability pact was not a pact in  the legal sense or an international norm, but a "political  process which is acceptable and natural."    The Czech Republic's attitude is reflected to a great extent  in the words of the former presidential office head Karel  Schwarzenberg published by today's French paper LE FIGARO who  said that in the part of Europe to which the stability pact  would apply "prejudices are deeply rooted and feelings have deep  historical connections."    The conference organizers are not familiar with the problems  in this part of Europe, Schwarzenberg said. They did not  realize either that discussing "our intimate problems" could  result in the "opening of new Pandora's box."    "Can you imagine a roundtable discussion in a  Basque-inhabited region in France dealing with Basque and Irish  problems in France, Spain, Britain and Ireland indulgently  observed by Czechs and Americans?" asks Schwarzenberg in the  paper, and replies with a definite "No."</p>

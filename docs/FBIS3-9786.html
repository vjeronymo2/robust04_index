Walesa, asked whether there is a chance of a compromise in  the Rosati affair, replied, "Do they want me to desert?" He  added that it is necessary to find a new candidate for that post  as quickly as possible.    The president referring to the 1994 budget bill, passed by  the Senate and the Sejm and waiting for the signature of the  president, said that "for today" he would not sign the budget.  In his opinion "the nation has been once again cheated, it was  to be better." He added that he is in despair "from the economic  point of view" as he knows that apart from minor shifts, nothing  much can be changed in the budget.</p>

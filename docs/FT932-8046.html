			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Santander faces fresh tax inquiry BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish banking group, faces renewed investigations over a tax avoidance scheme it allegedly pioneered, and has been ordered to put up Pta3.5bn (Dollars 28.6m) as surety against possible fraud charges by the senior judge of Madrid's monetary court. The fresh embarrassment for Santander coincides with its launch of Dollars 195m preferential shares issue in the US. This is the fourth such issue in 18 months and completes a programme which will have raised a total of Dollars 750m for the group. The ruling by a senior judge of Madrid's monetary court reverses a decision in January when the court revoked a Pta8bn bond order against the bank in connection with the same charges. Santander said yesterday it would deposit the bond but would appeal against the new ruling. In January, the court accepted Santander's appeal that the bank could not be investigated over possible irregularities unless prior charges were brought against persons who had sought to avoid taxes by using the bank's services.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Iraqis 'start dismantling police posts to obey UN demand' THE IRAQIS last night began dismantling six of their police posts lying within Kuwaiti territory in belated accordance with United Nations demands, Sheikh Nasser al-Saud, the Kuwait information minister said. The minister, speaking during a hastily convened press conference following news of the allied attack on Iraq, also said that Kuwait police had returned fire at three Iraqis he described as intelligence officers who had crossed at least 5km into Kuwait. The Kuwait police had killed one of the men, arrested another and injured a third who escaped back into Iraq, he added. Sheikh Nasser did not indicate if Iraq had begun dismantling the police posts before last night's allied raid on Iraq, but said: 'We hope that by tomorrow they will be removed altogether.' The six posts, which were manned by 46 Iraqi policemen, lay within what since last November's UN border demarcation is now Kuwaiti territory. Iraq had previously ignored a UN Security Council demand to dismantle and evacuate the six posts by January 15. Iraq's dismantling of the posts would amount to the country's first acknowledgment of the UN-demarcated border. This was drawn up by a special UN commission under the terms of Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687. Baghdad has previously rejected the border commission's findings, which moved the frontier north into what had become accepted as Iraqi territory, embracing five Iraqi oilfields and naval installations at Iraq's Umm Qasr port. Sheikh Nasser said that earlier yesterday morning, three Iraqis dressed in civilian clothing had fired at Kuwaiti police south of the demilitarised zone which extends 5km into Kuwaiti territory. The Iraqis, he said, were 'intelligence officers coming in to see positions taken by the Kuwaiti forces'. Since Kuwait's forces were put on high alert earlier this week, a line of tanks has dug in just south of the demilitarised zone. Sheikh Nasser said that the detained Iraqi had identified himself as 'a military person with a military rank'. Sheikh Nasser said he was confident Kuwait had nothing to fear from any potential Iraqi retaliation against the Gulf state after last night's raid on Iraq and, clearly conscious of charges that the Kuwait government was unprepared for the 1990 invasion, added: 'All necessary precautions have been taken.' However, the minister said that he believed the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission should be reinforced from its present level of 249 unarmed officers. Sheikh Nasser expressed 'disgust' at President Saddam Hussein's 1 1/2 -hour speech earlier in the day. He called on the Iraqi people to overthrow their leader. 'We hope the Iraqi people will come to their senses and take things into their own hands,' he said.</p>

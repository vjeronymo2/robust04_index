			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Bosnia says partition talks have reached new impasse The Bosnian government yesterday said fresh partition talks had reached an impasse and accused their Serbian adversaries of hijacking the agenda from the European Union only hours after the resumption of negotiations among the republic's three warring parties. Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, warned that the Geneva talks were in danger of collapse because the Serbs had insisted on reopening negotiations on Sarajevo. Before the collapse of peace talks in September, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international envoys, had won endorsement from Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders to place the Bosnian capital under UN administration for two years. 'Owen is trying to focus on the division of Sarajevo, which is unfortunate, shameful and counter-productive,' Mr Sacirbey told reporters at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said there had been 'no progress' after the close of the first round of talks with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader. Despite the slim hope of reaching a settlement to end 19 months of war, Mr Sacirbey said the Bosnian government would not abandon peace talks. But he said the Bosnian delegation had raised a complaint with unnamed parties in the EU about deviating from the plan proposed by foreign ministers on Monday. Lord Owen on Monday said Sarajevo and access to the sea from the Croats remained the biggest issues, echoing Mr Milosevic's earlier comments. In recent bilateral meetings, Serb leaders have pushed a 'quality land for quantity' line in pressing for the exchange of Serb-held districts of Sarajevo for Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia.</p>

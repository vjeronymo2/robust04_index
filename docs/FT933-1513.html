			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Banks vie for Argentaria 2 mandate MR FRANCISCO Luzon, chairman of Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish banking group, will decide within two weeks which international investment house will receive the mandate for the bank's second issue of shares. In May, Argentaria raised Pta120bn (Dollars 927.6m) when it issued 24.9 per cent of its shares. The government has given it the go-ahead to float a similar volume of its capital in an issue that is likely to raise more than Dollars 1bn and reduce state ownership of the group to 50.2 per cent. Mr Luzon indicated yesterday that he had an open mind about which team should organise the issue of Argentaria 2 and the structure of the flotation. 'The first issue was a success and worked very well,' Mr Luzon said, 'but that does not mean it has to be repeated in the same way. There is a lot of competition for the mandate,' for which the fees alone could be more than Dollars 10m. Front-runners for Argentaria 2 are Morgan Stanley (which was global co-ordinator of Argentaria 1 and lead manager for its US tranche) and SG Warburg (which, with the Spanish bank Banco Santander de Negocios, was co-leader of the UK tranche). Morgan Stanley appears confident that since the two issues are so close  - Argentaria 2 could be floated as early as November 7 - broad market practices will dictate an unchanged team and structure. SG Warburg appears just as confident that its experience as co-ordinator of last July's third issue of British Telecommunications shares will count in its favour. Mr Luzon believes that the simultaneous trading pioneered by BT is an attractive option. 'BT was very bold and the tendency now for big share issues is clearly to globalise. Banks are much more localised than telecommunications, but if we cannot be wholly global like BT in our flotation, we should at least reduce the geography of the tranches.' Argentaria 1 had five tranches which covered Spain, the US, the UK, continental Europe and the rest of the world. Mr Luzon believes that this structure could be altered for Argentaria 2. 'We have to have a domestic tranche and my minimum hypothesis is that there should be the Spain issue and an international one, just two tranches.' It is likely that 50 per cent of the Argentaria 2 issue will be aimed at the domestic retail market and the other 50 per cent at international institutions. Argentaria 1 was heavily over-subscribed, particularly in the US, where demand was 11 times the amount floated, and in the the UK, where it was 12 times. Whoever wins the mandate will have to share the role with the Spanish banking community. This was the case in Argentaria 1 when, in addition to the co-lead mandate with SG Warburg that was awarded to Banco Santander de Negocios, Argentaria itself acted as co-global co-ordinator with with Morgan Stanley. 'I very much want Spanish banks to be active in the share issue,' Mr Luzon said. 'They now distribute well, especially in Europe, and they have the capacity to do a lot more.' In his promotion of the domestic banks, and in particular of Argentaria, Mr Luzon has his eye on the forthcoming European privatisations, where he believes Spanish institutions could become a strong force.</p>

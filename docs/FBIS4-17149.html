			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- The Russian Security Council  discussed on Wednesday Russia's policy in the Caucasus and the  implementation of previous decisions calling for support for  Russian Cossacks, the presidential press service said.    Participants in the meeting which was chaired by President  Boris Yeltsin stressed that Russia's policy in the Caucasus  should aim at expanding mutually beneficial cooperation with all  countries of the region, promoting their social and economic  development, reaching civic accord and restoring stability in  the region.    On the question of state support for Cossacks, the council  called for working out as soon as possible a federal programme  for their support. At present, the implementation of decisions  in this sphere is being hindered by the passivity of federal and  local bodies of power, lack of coordination and ineffective  legislation.    Yeltsin urged the government, concerned ministries and  departments to take practical measures to work out and realise  Russia's policy in the Caucasus and provide state support for  Russian Cossacks.    The press service said that the council also discussed the  situation in Bosnia and Gorazde. Its members expressed the hope  that there is still a possibility of resolving the crisis by  peaceful means.</p>

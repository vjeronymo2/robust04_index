			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has declared that if the  promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side in Vienna are  incorporated into the 21 March document, the Turkish Cypriots  can make a healthier and more positive decision on the subject.  The Council of Ministers met in an extraordinary session under  the chairmanship of Denktas last night and discussed the  confidence-building measures package and the nondocument  document of 21 March. Denktas issued a statement at the end of  the meeting, which began at 2015 and lasted two hours and 40  minutes.    In his statement, Denktas reported that he briefed the  Council of Ministers on his contacts in Turkey and said that a  good discussion was held at the meeting. Noting that he must  call and meet with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  assistant special envoy in Cyprus, Denktas said: We have now  reached the point of whether the United Nations will incorporate  the promises made to us in Vienna into the 21 March document by  editing the document.    Denktas stated that the Turkish Cypriot side will be able to  see the future in a clearer way after the meeting with Feissel.    Answering a question on what will happen if the UN secretary  general issues his report, Denktas said this is also a matter of  luck. Asked if the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to negotiate  should the document be edited, Denktas responded: We have never  been the side avoiding talks. Therefore, if the document is  edited and the promises made to us are realized, our people and  our government will naturally be able to make a healthier and  more positive decision.    In reply to another question, the president remarked that a  special Republican Assembly meeting may be held in the next  stage. The answers to various questions may be supplied after  today, Denktas noted.</p>

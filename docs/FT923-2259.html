			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: LVMH up to FFr1.29bnin spite of downturn LVMH, the French luxury goods group which owns a string of high prestige brand names ranging from Louis Vuitton luggage to Hennessy cognac, saw net profits rise by 7 per cent to FFr1.29bn (Dollars 239m) from FFr1.21bn in the first half of the year in spite of the downturn in the luxury products industry. The global market for luxury goods, which benefited from buoyant growth for most of the 1980s, has slowed. It has suffered from the economic instability of its markets, notably the US and Japan, and from changing consumer attitudes in western Europe. These problems have affected some of LVMH's activities, particularly wine and spirits. The company said yesterday that the weakness of the Japanese economy had hit sales of luggage and cognac in that country. LVMH, one of the big players in the champagne industry, has also suffered from the sluggish state of the champagne market in western Europe. Overall group sales in the first six months of this year rose by 4.5 per cent to FFr9.68bn from FFr9.26bn in the same period last year. Operating income showed a marginal increase to FFr2.35bn from FFr2.34bn Wines and spirits suffered a fall in sales to FFr4.44bn from FFr4.76bn while operating profits slipped to FFr1.26bn from FFr1.51bn. LVMH, which has refused to comment on speculation that it has extended its drinks interests by buying a 7 per cent stake in Grand Marnier liqueur, said that cognac sales in Japan have shown a slight recovery. Luggage and leather products were also affected by Japan's instability, but managed to increase operating profits to FFr890m from FFr827m on sales up to FFr2.33bn from FFr2.15bn. Perfumes and cosmetics benefited from the launch of new fragrances. Sales rose to FFr2.54bn from FFr2.05bn and operating profits to FFr330m from FFr121m.</p>

He added that a date had been given for  the first kw to be supplied by Cernavoda, namely December 24,  1994. Unit one will have 700 kw installed power, of which 660  kw for the national network and 40 kw for its own consumption.  Dragomirescu mentioned that according to foreign partners the  Cernavoda Nuclear Station met all the IAEA requirements, so that  a Chernobyl-like accident is out of question.    The whole complex at Cernavoda, the biggest investment in  Romania so far, will finally have five groups of reactors of  Candu-type (Canada Deuterium Uranium), apt to yield about 30  percent of Romania's energy necessities.    Official demarches were made in Romania as early as 1965 for  the construction of an atomic station. Economic-technical  studies were drafted starting 1968 and offers compared from the  Soviet Union, Germany and Canada. Political "reasons" and  especially the shortage of funds made the conclusion of a  contract with the atomic energy of Canada, AEC, possible only in  1978. The Canadians were chosen as Romania could produce  Uranium-based fuel at Pitesti and heavy water at Drobeta Turnu  Severin. In addition, Candu reactors have proved a high  security level in keeping with international requirements.  According to schedule, the power station should have started  production in 1985, but it was again the shortage of funds that  was responsible for the delay. The contract with AECL and  ANSALDO -- an Italian partner for the installation of the  classical parts of the station -- expired. The investment was  halted soon after December 1989.    A new contract between the power utility RENEL and the  AECL-ANSALDO consortium was concluded in 1991, stipulating  supervision of the building of reactor one, re-building of  reactor two, preservation of units 3,4 and 5. A new stage will  be December 1994 when unit one starts operation, to be followed  by the commercial exploitation of the station for 18 months.  All this is going to be paralleled by the training of Romanian  personnel in Canada. The contract was accompanied by two  credits, by a Canadian Bank and an Italian one respectively,  totalling $410 million.    It is worth mentioning that a change has been made in the  atomic programme, with efforts concentrated on unit one, with  unit two scheduled to be completed in 1995 and the other three  between 1997 and 1999, while the groups under operation supply  money necessary for construction.</p>

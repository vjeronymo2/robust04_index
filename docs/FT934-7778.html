			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting drive puts Daihatsu back in black DAIHATSU Motor, the Japanese carmaker belonging to the Toyota Motor group, returned to the black during the first six months to September, due to cost-cutting efforts, including the reduction of seasonal workers. The company posted pre-tax profits of Y551m (Dollars 5.15m) against an interim loss of Y4.9bn a year earlier. Operating profits totalled Y643bn, up from a loss of Y4.3bn, while after-tax profits totalled Y536m against a loss of Y4.9bn. Half-year sales, however, fell 7.2 per cent to Y362.8bn. Daihatsu said it lost Y7.2bn in profits through foreign exchange losses and the fall in sales, but managed to generate profits of Y12.1bn by cutting 1,000 seasonal employees. Vehicle sales during the April to September term fell 6 per cent to 383,067 units. Domestic sales fell 8.8 per cent while exports rose 5.1 per cent. Domestic sales fell in all vehicle categories, with sales of agricultural machinery especially weak due to cold summer weather and typhoons. For the full year to March, Daihatsu expects sales to fall 8.3 per cent to Y720bn. Pre-tax profits of Y2bn are expected against a loss of Y4.4bn, while after-tax profits are forecast at Y2bn, up from a loss of Y3.5bn last year.</p>

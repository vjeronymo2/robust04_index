			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China has widened the scope of its united-front  campaign by enlisting prominent liberals, more professionals and  sons and daughters of local billionaires to serve as Hong Kong  affairs advisers. Among the 50 advisers announced yesterday  were leading banker Sir Quo-wei Lee, veteran legislator Elsie  Tu, appointed legislator Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen and celebrity  and writer James Wong.    Yesterday's third round of invitations took to 141 the  number  of Hong Kong affairs advisers to Beijing. The appointment  ceremony will be held in Beijing next month. Beijing officials  said they would consider inviting even more to give their views  on territory affairs. "We are also considering ways to  strengthen the participation of advisers in the work of the  Preliminary Working Committee," a mainland official said.    Eight of the latest batch are Legislative Councillors. They  are Mrs Tu, James Tien Pei-chun, Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja, Hui  Yin-fat, Frederick Fung Kin-kee, Henry Tang Ying-yen, Vincent  Cheng and Tang Siu-tong. About a quarter of the lawmaking body  -- 15 legislators -- now also serve as Beijing advisers.    Unlike the previous rounds of appointments, leaders of minor  liberal parties have been invited. As expected, the liberal  flagship -- the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) -- has been  snubbed again. However, Lau Kong-wah, a former core member of  the UDHK who later quit the party, is on the list. As well as  Mr Fung, Chang Kamun, who is the council chairman of the  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), joins  the group. Mr Fung is the ADPL's chairman. The Meeting Point's  chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung and two founding members, Dr  Thomas Chan Man-hung and Dr Tsang Shu-ki, accepted invitations.  Dr Chan and Dr Tsang are economists at post-secondary  institutes.    A mainland official said the time was ripe to canvass the  views of liberal elements. "They are invited because we want to  have a wider spectrum of views," he said. "The closer the  changeover of sovereignty, the greater the need for a wide range  of views... We have no fundamental difference with the  liberals. They just want a faster pace of democracy." The  official, who was involved in the selection process, said it  would be impossible to bring in members of the UDHK who were  connected with "subversive" activities against China.    In a move that could undermine the authority of the British  administration in the countdown to 1997, Beijing offered seats  to some political figures with close ties to the Hong Kong  Government in the past. They include Mr Cheng, Hong Kong Bank's  chief economist and former member of the Government think-tank;  Sir Quo-wei, chairman of Hang Seng Bank; and Nicky Chan  Nai-keung, formerly secretary for lands and works.    In this round, younger members of the territory's richest  families have been offered the opportunity to join politics.  Among them are Richard Li Tzar-kuoi, elder son of tycoon Li  Ka-shing; Anna Pao Pui-hing, eldest daughter of the late  shipping magnate Sir Yue-kong Pao, and Ian Fok Chun-wan, son of  Henry Fok Ying-tung. The senior Fok is now vice-chairman of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, ranking as a  vice-minister under the Chinese hierarchy. The three are less  well-known in the political arena. Asked if their appointment  was connected with their family ties, the mainland official  said: "It's hard for me to answer this question."</p>

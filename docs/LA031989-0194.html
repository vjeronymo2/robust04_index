			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> A LOOK AT MAN RAY IN L.A.;  </P> <P> FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES PAINT A PERSONAL REMEMBRANCE OF THE ARTIST  </P> <P> "Perpetual Motif," the retrospective of seminal surrealist Man Ray, opens today  at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Encompassing every aspect of his long and  varied career, a portion of the exhibition is given over to work done during  the years of 1940 to 1951, when he lived in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Born in Philadelphia the son of a Jewish tailor, Man Ray was forced to flee his  adopted home of Paris -- a city which revered him -- during World War II. Like  many European artists, he was attracted to Southern California's film industry.  However, the 11 years he spent in Los Angeles -- whose art audience was  minuscule and unsophisticated at the time -- were disappointing for him. His  work as a painter went largely ignored, and though he socialized with the film  industry, he never succeeded in getting any of his film projects off the  ground. As Merry Foresta, curator of the MOCA show, points out, "the L.A. art  audience felt more comfortable with Man Ray as a historical figure than with  his interruptive presence."  </P> <P> Herewith, reminiscences from some of Man Ray's friends and acquaintances during  his years in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> JAMES B. BYRNES was curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from 1946  to 1950 and subsequently held directorial positions at several American  museums. Retired from the museum field, he presently works as an art consultant  and an appraiser of fine art.  </P> <P> During the '40s I gave a course at USC on 20th-Century art, and when it came  time for the session on Dadaism I asked Man to do it. I knew he could use the  money, so I told him "you take the $15 for the night." He did a marvelous job  and brought in many of the objects of his affection, and also held a kind of  raffle. He gave out little slips of paper, and at the end of his lecture he  asked, "Who has No. 8?" Somebody raised their hand, and he said, "Now, who  doesn't have No. 8?" Somebody else raised their hand and he said, "You win." He  then brought out a large inner tube, which he deflated and cut into pieces,  then handed the pieces out to the students -- none of whom were familiar with  his work, by the way.  </P> <P> His distinguishing garb was quite noteworthy. He always wore a black shoestring  for a tie, and on occasion would affect a paper mustache. He loved costume  parties and fantasy, and had quite a bit of theater in him.  </P> <P> He was rather flirtatious and women seemed to find him attractive, despite the  fact that he was a small man and somewhat furtive in his demeanor. His charm  had a lot to do with the fact that he was rather mysterious in many respects.  </P> <P> He had a very droll, biting sense of humor that could be a bit antagonistic on  occasion. One must remember that he was an enthusiast of the Marquis de Sade,  so there was a certain harshness about him.  </P> <P> He belonged to a group of people in L.A. who came to know each other primarily  because they'd all come here from somewhere else. At that time the local  population was described as "the Okies and the Arkies," and L.A. was referred  to as "the buckle of the Bible Belt." There was no interest in modern art here  at all, so these sophisticated outsiders stuck together. The way of life Man  had known in Paris -- the cafes and so forth -- was absolutely unknown here,  and I think he missed it a great deal. He lived across the street from what was  then the Hollywood Ranch Market, which was open 24 hours a day, and Man thought  that was extraordinary for L.A. I remember him exclaiming, "I can buy a bottle  of good wine in the middle of the night for 99 cents that's the equal of  anything I can buy in Paris!"  </P> <P> He had a great ego -- he said so himself.  </P> <P> The L.A. art community was very small during the years Man lived here and the  only thing we had for local artists was an annual competition. I talked with  Man about entering, but he refused -- he was vehemently opposed to competition  of any sort. He wasn't interested in critics, believed everybody was an artist,  and thought there should be no jurors or process of selection. He was basically  an anarchist.  </P> <P> He was generally kind of a grumpy guy. He believed in himself and it upset him  that his work didn't provide him with a comfortable way of life, but he never  considered compromising his work in any way for money. I remember one time when  he was at a very low point financially and a woman tried to commission him to  do a portrait of her. He rather disliked the person who'd asked and he  announced that he wanted $250 for the project. She said, "Anybody else would  charge $50! I can't believe that price!" He replied, "Believe it."  </P> <P> KEVIN WHITE is Man Ray's nephew. He is a writer.  </P> <P> I was just a kid -- maybe 10 or 12 -- when I used to see him, and I remember  him as a very funny man. I'd bring pieces of paper to him and he'd draw funny  faces for me. I don't think he was crazy about kids -- he never wanted any of  his own as far as I know -- but he never gave me the impression I was being  shunned or patronized.  </P> <P> He seemed to enjoy life quite a bit. He liked good food and drink, good  conversation and a challenging chess game. He didn't fit the prototype of the  tortured artist as far as I could see.  </P> <P> JOHN WHITNEY SR. is a pioneering avant-garde film maker who presently works  with computer graphics and music.  </P> <P> In the '40s, I was in my early 20s and was making abstract animated films. I  read in the paper that Man Ray was living in L.A. and, being aware of the film  making he'd done, I wanted to show him my work. He was fairly accessible to  artists such as myself who wanted to meet and talk with him, so I called him  up. He was quite cordial and invited me to come by. I showed him my films and  he was very generous in his response. He pointed out -- and this is an obvious  comment coming from him -- that there must be an element of surprise in any  artwork. He said the word surprise in French.  </P> <P> The first day I met him I was knocked out by some of the novelties in his  apartment. There was a lamp made out of a Ford steering wheel, and though I  could be mistaken about this, it seems he had a sofa shaped like the lips in  his famous painting, "The Lovers."  </P> <P> He had very delicate hands and unusually graceful body language. He was a very  relaxed man, very easygoing.  </P> <P> Man had two lives and I was totally barred from one of them. He moved in very  wealthy circles and in fact, his films might not have been made were it not for  the generosity of an extremely wealthy French count who gave him a camera and  several thousands of dollars worth of film. Today, people might consider it a  conflict of interest that Man, who espoused a philosophy of anarchy, was so  chummy with the aristocratic element of society, but in those days no one  worried about such things. The wealthy class -- and this was particularly true  in Europe -- was enthralled with anarchists and the grubbiest members of the  avant-garde.  </P> <P> WILLIAM COPLEY's Copley Galleries presented Man Ray's only one-man show during  his years in Los Angeles (the show was presented in 1948). Copley currently  works as a painter.  </P> <P> Hollywood didn't treat Man like a celebrity and I think he resented that. He  expected more recognition than was forthcoming, but at that time most people  dismissed Surrealism as something very nutty. That bothered him, but only to a  point; he was too intelligent to be ambitious as far as his standing in the  community.  </P> <P> He was not a voracious reader. I don't think he read any more than he had to.  </P> <P> PHIL STERN lived next door to Man and Juliet Ray on Vine Street in the St.  George Apartments (now called the Villa Elaine.) He is presently working on a  book of his photographs of Hollywood from the '40s, '50s and '60s, to be  published next year by Alfred Knopf.  </P> <P> The apartments were really quite nice -- two floors, huge windows and maid  service for $65 a month. The maid service came once a week and Man's biggest  challenge in life was to prevent the maids from cleaning the windows. Man did  his work in the apartment and he never cleaned the windows because the patina  of dust on them created a diffuse light that was perfect for what he wanted to  do photographically. I can remember him coming home one day and going  absolutely berserk when he discovered that a new maid had washed the windows.  He spent the next six months trying to cultivate the dirt on the  window1931506799them with dirty water, went to an empty lot and got some dirt  and tossed it at the windows -- he was a bit obsessed with those windows.  </P> <P> He used to give talks and went on these strange lecture tours. His delight in  life was to talk to Pasadena ladies and say things that shocked the hell out of  them. In appearance and demeanor he was very much a Mr. Milquetoast, and I  think he had a little Walter Mitty thing going.  </P> <P> You know those animals called the sloth? Well, I never saw Man move faster than  a quarter of a mile an hour. He was a slow, methodical man and was constantly  puttering. He kept a very irregular schedule and sometimes he'd stay up all  night working on his little projects. I rarely knew what he was working on --  he tended to be secretive about his work.  </P> <P> During the '40s there was a group of bohemians living in a commune in Big Sur  and the patriarchal head of the group was Henry Miller, who was a friend of  Man's. Henry convinced Man to visit the commune but Man didn't enjoy the place  at all. I can remember him talking about how crudely these people were living  and exclaiming, "They didn't have any amenities!" Man was a bit effete and he  liked comfort and cosmopolitan living.  </P> <P> EMERSON WOELFFER is a Los Angeles painter.  </P> <P> The first time I met Man was in Chicago. He was on his way to L.A. and I was  studying with Moholy-Nagy at the Chicago Institute of Design. Man visited  Moholy at the school one night when we were having a dance, and I can remember  him complaining about how much he disliked Chicago. In those days people took  the train to get from New York to L.A., and the trip included a one night  stop-over in Chicago. Man grumbled that that was the only reason he was in  Chicago.  </P> <P> He was a modest, sweet man and wasn't at all ambitious. People would tell him  he was a success and he'd reply, "What do you mean by success? Money? I don't  call that success." He was avidly against those kinds of attitudes.  </P> <P> JULES ENGEL was a pioneering experimental film maker. He currently teaches film  at California Institute of the Arts.  </P> <P> Man took an interest in my films and was very generous with help and  encouragement. I remember I once had a screening of my films where the audience  didn't like what they'd seen and booed quite loudly. Man began screaming "Don't  listen to those bastards; they don't know what they're seeing!" He took on the  whole damn movie house!  </P> <P> He wasn't much of a drinker. A little wine, but nothing excessive.  </P> <P> He was never pushy about his career and wasn't the sort to arrange and  manipulate things the way artists often do. Man had the stuff in his gut and  you either bought it or you didn't.  </P></p>

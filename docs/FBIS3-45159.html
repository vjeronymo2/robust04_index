			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fanny Wong and Doreen Cheung] </F>   [Text] Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday  urged China to engage in early direct meetings to resolve the  Chek Lap Kok airport issue instead of negotiating through press  statements.    The director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, this week criticised the  Government for seeking extra funding from the Legislative  Council for the airport project. He accused officials of  sitting on huge reserves and refusing to inject more capital to  fund the infrastructure development. He also rejected the plan  to develop land along the airport railway and raised queries  about the Airport Corporation Bill unveiled for consultation.    Sir Hamish said Britain had tried many times to arrange  expert meetings on such issues. He pointed out that Britain had  informed China's JLG [Joint Liaison Group] team on December 15  that the Government would approach Legco [Legislative Council]  for more airport money and had invited their comments. Then had  been no reply.    On January 5 the Government gave China an advance copy of  the  funding plans which were later published, again without  response. The draft Airport Corporation Bill was also sent to  the Chinese side on July 21 for comment. "We received no formal  response till the end of November when the Chinese side  confirmed that they would have no objection to publication of a  White Bill," Sir Hamish said, adding there was no comment on the  bill's contents.    The vice-director of the local XINHUA (the New China News  Agency), Zhang Junsheng, said the piecemeal approach in seeking  funds could not help resolve the problem. "They submit one  report today and another report tomorrow. We want to solve the  entire financial arrangements (for the airport and the rail  link). They can't put forward requests like that," he said.</p>

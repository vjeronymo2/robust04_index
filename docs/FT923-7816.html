			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Wagner contra Wagner - Dramas both on and off the stage at Bayreuth IT HAS been an oddly unsettling summer at Bayreuth. The 'younger' generation of the Wagner family (most of them now comfortably middle-aged) launched an attack of unprecedented vehemence on Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's 72-year old grandson who has run the festival single-handed since the death of his brother Wieland in 1966. By opening its doors to Placido Domingo, Bayreuth succumbed to star fever, prompting questions about how far the festival is moving down the road of commercialism. Otherwise this year's performances failed to generate much heat (notwithstanding baking temperatures in the Festspielhaus), largely because for the second year in a row there were no new productions. And yet the artistic balance sheet has been unexpectedly positive - not just in Der Ring des Nibelungen and Der fliegende Hollander, the relative merits of which have been extensively discussed on this page in past summers, but in the more unlikely area of Wolfgang's own productions of Tannhauser and Parsifal. Originally staged in 1985, Tannhauser returned with a new cast and conductor, and some modifications to the decor. The Parsifal staging has matured since its rocky debut in 1989, and has been transformed by Poul Elming, singing the title role for the first time at Bayreuth (before being shunted aside by Domingo for the final two performances). It has become fashionable to dismiss Wolfgang's productions as out-of-date, a pale imitation of the New Bayreuth style pioneered by Wieland. His approach certainly has not changed much since the 1960s. The decor for both works - neither abstract nor naturalistic - is austerely geometrical, with dim lighting and a thin wash of colour; the static (and sometimes wooden) poses adopted by the cast make a stark contrast to the current German vogue for extreme mobility, exemplified by the Kupfer Ring; and the choreography of the flower-maidens and Venusberg scene is banal. But what these productions lack in novel interpretation, they gain in their focus on timeless symbolism. There is no gimmickry, no ideological baggage. They have a kind of pre-ordained logic, achieving their goal by simplified understatement. This works especially well in the Grail scenes of Parsifal, which are set in a gloomy hexagonal mausoleum and benefit from a strong sense of communal ceremony. The knights' silent ritual, married to Wagner's serene music and the unique Bayreuth acoustic, seems to inhabit its own time-world, generating a glow which is not easily dismissed or analysed  - even after the audience has spilled out of the side-doors for the first interval. No other theatre (nor Gotz Friedrich's anti-traditional Bayreuth production of the 1980s) offers a comparable experience. Some sequences in the production have been profitably reworked since it was new, but the main improvement comes in the casting of Poul Elming as Parsifal. The Danish tenor brings to the part the same qualities of musicianship and stagecraft which have so distinguished his Siegmund. Tall and lanky in stature, he showed just the right kind of disingenuous pleasure at the flower maidens, swarming round him like the tentacles of a sea anemone. He met Waltraud Meier's radiant Kundry on equal terms in Act 2, and carried off the last act with dignity. The voice never sounded less than fresh and free, while his diction and phrasing were exemplary. With a Parsifal as natural as this, who needs Domingo? And yet it is the Spanish tenor's face - with the identical furrowed look that invariably graces the covers of his opera recordings  - which is plastered around Bayreuth's shop windows, and will no doubt form the centrepiece of the video of this production. Manfred Schenk was the other newcomer - an experienced and reliable Bayreuth performer who made a more sympathetic Gurnemanz than Hans Sotin, but was still far from ideal. Bernd Weikl repeated his noble Amfortas and James Levine was once again the conductor. The self-conscious slowness of previous years has disappeared, the music was spaciously, seamlessly unfolded but never becalmed. And the orchestral playing was faultlessly clean. With the Bayreuth chorus at its glorious best, the performance had many solid virtues. So too did Tannhauser. Donald Runnicles, in his festival debut, offered a characteristically dynamic account of the score, whipping up the Act 2 choral procession into a frenzy, turning the Act 3 prelude into a soft, world-weary lament, emphasising the music's brilliance and extreme contrasts of mood: a young man's Wagner. The focus on episodic pleasures, however, tended to overshadow the wider span. The new Tannhauser was a little-known tenor from Dusseldorf, Wolfgang Schmidt, a capable actor with the right vocal stamina. His singing was secure and stentorian but lacked elegance. Tina Kiberg's tall and slender Elisabeth was a pale substitute for Cheryl Studer when the production was new. Eike Wilm Schulte, one of Germany's most eloquent baritones, proved a curiously ineffective Wolfram. The other Minnesingers, including Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Biterolf, were handsomely cast, and the chorus again played an outstanding role. So it has been a year for appreciating Bayreuth's traditional strengths. But the debate about the festival's long-term direction - and particularly what will happen after Wolfgang goes - has begun in earnest, with the German press stirring the issue like a British royal scandal. The immediate future is clear: the east German dramatist Heiner Muller, who has never staged an opera before, will produce Tristan und Isolde at the 1993 festival, and Domingo will sing all Parsifal performances (with Deborah Polaski as Kundry). The following year, when Wolfgang turns 75, will see a new Ring conducted by Levine and staged by the radical producer Alfred Kirchner. This summer may well have been the calm before the storm.</p>

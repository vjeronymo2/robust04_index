			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Portuguese bank curb eased Portugal's central bank said yesterday it would lower the compulsory cash reserve requirement for banks from 17 per cent of customer liabilities to 2 per cent from November 1. The high reserve requirement was introduced in the 1980s as a means of draining liquidity from the banking system and holding down inflation. The reduction will equate Portuguese banks with their EU counterparts. But existing reserves, estimated at Es2,200bn (Pounds 8.9bn), will be converted into special bonds with maturities of 2-13 years to prevent money markets being swamped by newly released funds. Bankers said the immediate effect would be neutral in terms of both remuneration and costs, but banks would be able to employ their funds more profitably over the medium term as the bonds matured. Banks will also be able to use the bonds as contributions to a planned deposit guarantee fund.</p>

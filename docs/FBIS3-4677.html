			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Relations Between Japan and the United States </F> Must Be Seen From a Broad Perspective"]    [Text] Relations between Japan and the United States have  again become stormy. In view of their importance to the people  of the two countries, that is a worrying and regrettable fact.    The immediate cause of the situation is the rupture of the  recent talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Clinton on the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations.  Some argued that the breakdown of the talks was a sign of  "maturing relations" between the two countries.    Given the subsequent chorus of criticism of Japan by the  U.S.  Government and Congress, as well as the fact that Japanese  Government officials were upset by that criticism, however, it  is difficult to see the "mature relations" between the two  countries that the prime minister talked about.    It is also of concern that arguments hailing Japan's saying  "No" to U.S. demands are tinged with nationalism.    Nobody will deny that the relations between Japan and the  United States must mature further. That is all the more reason  why we must have a sense of balance and think of the current  trade frictions in the context of the total Japan-U.S.  relationship. We must be coolheaded and not lose sight of the  mid-and long-term trends.    Both the Japanese and the U.S. Governments consider the  partnership of the two countries on three levels: "political  and security matters," "economy," and "cooperation in tackling  worldwide problems." They have also agreed that the economic  link is the weakest among the three. The economic framework  talks were arranged precisely for the purpose of strengthening  such a weak link in bilateral relations.    Many Japanese and American people who had expected the two  leaders to have talks from the broad perspective of turning  point in world history -- even though the talks were part of new  economic consultations -- must have been bewildered that their  talks were like trade negotiations.    Nor can it be overlooked that the present Japan-U.S.  relations reflect the nature of the U.S. administration. The  Clinton administration gives the highest priority to putting the  U.S. domestic economy on track and has no qualms in targeting  American diplomacy at creating jobs in the United States and  promoting its exports. It has also been pointed out that the  American President does not have insightful and influential  advisers who make up for his inexperience in diplomacy.    After the end of the Cold War, the Americans became inward-  looking, and Congress, trade unions, and the industry tend to be  protectionist-minded. Under such circumstances, the President  may have thought he would lose nothing in domestic politics by  adopting a strong attitude against Japan, which racked up a  trade surplus with the United States amounting to nearly $60  billion a year.    On the other hand, Prime Minister Hosokawa did not show any  willingness to rise to the occasion by implementing deregulation  and economic pump-priming measures to meet the wishes of the  people here and abroad. The rupture in the talks, which at  first glance looked as if it were the outcome of hard decisions  made by the two leaders, really resulted from Clinton and  Hosokawa evading the more difficult choice of exercising  leadership from a broad perspective in their respective domestic  politics.    To open the domestic market, put the economy on a road  toward  growth driven by domestic demand, and build a consumer-oriented  nation are policy options that were not adopted to please the  Americans or any other people. Those are choices made to usher  in a brighter future for the Japanese themselves and are aimed  at building the "nation with substance" that the prime minister  propounded.    What is important is not to make a fuss over responses to  immediate problems, but to steadfastly take measures that are  meaningful in the medium and long-term.    If we take a little broader view, we find the Americans have  begun to regain confidence in themselves as the economy has  started to recover. At the state level, Japanese investment in  the United States has been favorably evaluated. The Americans'  understanding of the mutual dependence between Japan and the  United States has gradually been gaining ground, though the  trend is slowing.    Immediately before and after the summit talks between the  Japanese and U.S. leaders, there were noticeably levelheaded  arguments in the U.S. media that "the Japanese had a good case."  And an opinion poll published by the Prime Minister's Office in  Japan showed that the Japanese who thought that "the Americans  were also partly right" in the trade frictions between the two  countries outnumbered those who thought the friction resulted  from the Americans' emotional response.    Signs of "maturity" should be sought in such aspects of  Japanese and American opinion.    What is most needed now is a reasonable attitude so that the  mutual mistrust and impatience exhibited by political leaders  and bureaucrats will not widen and create mutual distrust at the  grass- roots level.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU'S FOSTER STILL SLOWED  </P> <P> Linebacker Lou Foster returned to practice Monday, but San Diego State Coach Al  Luginbill said he is not yet at full speed and may not go to Oregon for the  Aztecs' season opener Saturday.  </P> <P> Foster, a 5-feet-11, 230-pound transfer from DeAnza Community College (near San  Jose), came out of spring practice as the No. 1 inside linebacker but pulled a  hamstring during conditioning drills before two-a-day practices began Aug. 19  and did not practice until Monday.  </P> <P> "He's got to get his confidence back," Luginbill said. "His strength and  everything tests out right. We worked out with him on the field and then took  him into the pool and did some hard work with him there. He's got to get his  confidence back that the (hamstring) is not going to go on him. How long that's  going to take, I don't know. That's pretty well up to him."  </P> <P> With Foster out, freshman Jamal Duff (6-7, 225) has earned the starting inside  linebacker job. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

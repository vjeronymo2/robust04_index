			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ONE COUNT AGAINST CAPTAIN DROPPED  </P> <P> A U.S. Navy judge today dismissed one of three charges against the captain of a  Navy vessel who is accused of abandoning Vietnamese refugees who later resorted  to cannibalism to survive.  </P> <P> Capt. James A. Freyer, the presiding judge, said there was not enough evidence  to support the charge that the USS Dubuque skipper, Capt. Alexander G. Balian,  failed "to render assistance" to a Vietnamese refugee who allegedly drowned  while trying to swim to the ship.  </P> <P> Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, also is charged with ordering crewmen to prevent  refugees from climbing aboard the Dubuque. In a third charge containing 11  specifications, the judge today dropped one that alleged failure to provide  necessary medical supplies.  </P></p>

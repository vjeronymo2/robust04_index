A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the South Korean  Government deeply regrets that the U.S. Government revives the  Super 301 provision through administrative means, at a time when  the Uruguay Round of talks is almost bringing about a worldwide  free trade system after seven years of negotiations.    U.S. President Bill Clinton reinstated Thursday [3 March]  the  lapsed trade measure that gives Washington the right to impose  sanctions if a trading nation with the U.S. fails to meet the  U.S. demand on greater market access.    South Korea always considers that international trade  disputes should not be solved by the domestic law of one  country, but through the process decided by the World Trade  Organization.    The 301 provision was first made in 1974 to impose sanctions  on the countries that had unfair trade practice with the U.S.    In 1988, the U.S. Government created the Super 301  provision,  which strengthened and quickened the imposition process of such  sanctions.    The U.S. decided to revive Super 301 after U.S.-Japan trade  talks broke down.</p>

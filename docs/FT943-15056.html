			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Lloyds drops opposition to PIA watchdog Lloyds Bank, one of the largest organisations to make public its reservations about the personal investment authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, is to join the PIA after all. The Lloyds' decision, taken at the end of last week, is a boost for the PIA which is due to become operational on Monday. The regulator has been the subject of controversy within the life industry, but gained from the lack of a consensus about what should replace it. Lloyds, which sells life insurance through its Lloyds Abbey Life arm, entered the argument publicly in March when it said the new regulator offered 'neither the merits of genuine self-regulation nor the settled framework and clear accountability of regulation by a statutory body'. The bank said yesterday that its concerns about the new regulator had not been met, but that it felt it had no choice about joining. It is currently regulated by Imro, the regulator for the investment management industry. Last week, however, Imro announced a change in its remit, aimed at excluding organisations which deal mainly with private investors. Lloyds' decision leaves Allied Dunbar, the life insurance subsidiary of BAT industries, and Halifax building society, which is to set up a life subsidiary next year, among the most high-profile organisations yet to apply. Allied Dunbar has had a number of discussions with the regulators, and though there are no signs of a change in the company's direction it seems conscious of the possible disadvantages from refusing to join the PIA. So far only Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has insisted on its right to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial watchdog, and has not applied to the PIA. The PIA said yesterday that it had received almost 3,500 applications, from a total potential membership of 5,500 to 6,000.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Microchip harvest: Truth of the Matter CHURCH congregations will witness an event of mass self deception this weekend. In churches across Britain, hundreds of thousands, most with uncalloused hands and genteel voices, will launch themselves into that seasonally resonant chorus, We plough the fields and scatter. It will be sung with enthusiasm, yet that enthusiasm will not hide the fact that probably none of the congregation has ever ploughed a single clod, and only allotment holders and keen gardeners know what it is to scatter seed. Once upon a time the church faced the problem of integrating heathen rituals into the rhythms of the Christian year. Harvest festivals proved a successful example of adaptation, a satisfying ceremony in most church calendars, where quaint paganisms - the making of corn dollies, or the offering of first fruits - translated easily into a context of Christian thanksgiving. But the festival has been sabotaged in two ways. First, the global failure to co-ordinate food supply and demand has obliged western Christians to divert pieties of thanksgiving into pieties of guilt. Second, the Christian symbolism has itself become quaint and looks, to many, outmoded. The ploughmen, if they are there, look to Brussels for their blessing, not heaven; and Brussels, if it is listening, has probably just commanded them not to plough at all. It seems clear that the church has failed to keep up with the times. This is not necessarily an accusation. Quite apart from the religious consolation it already provides, the traditional harvest festival could be said to perform a useful social function. So many people have been atrophied from contact with the food chain that there is some value in preserving primal concerns about rain, sunshine, germination and yield. For, however it is packaged, the micro-waveable lasagne has not shed its dependence on those elemental factors. The Church Times is buzzing with debate about the survival of rituals. An impartial judge would probably decide that a harvest festival is one of those romantic occasions which are the quintessence of most churchgoers' beliefs. But still there are clergy prepared to have their cake and eat it: maintain domestic structure, and give it a contemporary gloss. The Rev Peter Hayler is one. He is the chaplain attached to the Science Park, at Cambridge. He styles his own forthcoming harvest festival as a church public relations event. The celebration is explicitly aimed at creating a new opportunity for collective gratitude, for the 'harvest' there is taken to mean products, services, and even ideas. There will be no piles of marrows at the altar, but rather a display along the aisles, featuring companies based at and around the science park. It remains to be seen just how the microchip specialists and ink-jet printers will rise to the challenge Hayler has laid down, but one thing is certain: their representatives will not be asked to sing We plough the fields and scatter. Most vicars will admit that it is a thankless effort, to get the congregation to sing new hymns. We cling to the melodies and phrases of our past. So Peter Hayler has compromised his service, and inserted hymns which feature words modern but tunes ancient. And he has even adapted one of these modern hymns for his own particular science park flock. It goes to the tune of All through the night and then: For the fruits of his creation, thanks be to God, For the life of innovation, thanks be to God For the planning, buying, dealing, formulations full of meaning, All that research is revealing, thanks be to God. As its author would agree, this is not classic hymnnology, nor likely to become so. But it makes a change from ploughing and scattering; and he may rightly claim that change is better than decay.</p>

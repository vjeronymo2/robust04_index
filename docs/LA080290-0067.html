			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE DROPS CIVIL RIGHTS PROBE OF ELKS  LODGE  </P> <P> A state civil rights investigation into allegations that the Van Nuys Elks  Lodge discriminated against black applicants has been dropped.  </P> <P> The attorney general's nine-month investigation found no evidence of racial  discrimination, Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo said Wednesday. Officers of the  260-member lodge claim that the result vindicated the lodge, but Verdugo said  the probe was hampered by the organization's secretiveness.  </P> <P> "They take an oath of secrecy as to what goes on when those doors are closed.  That's part and parcel of who they are," Verdugo said.  </P> <P> Also, the lodge admitted two black men recently, making it difficult to prove  "a pattern of discrimination," he said.  </P></p>

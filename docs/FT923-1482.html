			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Labour calls for review of banking regulations THE LABOUR party yesterday called for a thorough review of banking regulations once the results of the inquiries into last year's collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International are published, Alison Smith writes. A 600-page US Senate report on the BCCI affair is due to be published today and is expected to be sharply critical of the role of the Bank of England. A report by Lord Bingham into whether BCCI was supervised properly by the Bank and the government is now likely to be published in the week beginning October 19, when parliament reassembles for normal sittings.</p>

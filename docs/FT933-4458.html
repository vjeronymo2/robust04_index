			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Deal will prise open German power sector AN Anglo-American consortium is poised to break into east Germany's highly regulated energy structure, which will open up the region to more competition. The consortium - led by Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho - is buying Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle (Mibrag), the large lignite open cast mines straddling the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. It is also buying a 44 per cent stake, or the equivalent of 400MW capacity, in a power generating plant being built at Schkopau, near Leipzig. The deal, expected to be signed later this month, follows 18 months of negotiations with the Treuhand agency charged with privatising east German industry. The purchase of Schkopau is the main prize. Besides paying DM800m (Pounds 320m) for its stake, the consortium will have access to the power grid. The grid is controlled by Veag, eastern Germany's big utility company, and effectively monopolised by west Germany's eight utilities. This structure restricts participation by outsiders. However, a spokesman for Veag confirmed yesterday that Veag would buy 400MW from Schkopau, which will give the Anglo-Americans indirect access to the grid. The consortium will also have authority to build or buy into more power blocks and sell its energy via the Veag grid. 'This is the beginning of the breaching of the energy monopoly in eastern Germany,' an energy expert said yesterday. He added the group was well placed to exploit the potential of Buna, large chemical works in Saxony-Anhalt which the Treuhand is due to privatise, and Leuna, the oil refinery in which Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, holds a stake. The deal's two-tiered price arrangement will be based on a down-payment and will be linked to the amount of lignite mined over several years. It is crucial for the Treuhand, as the sale of Mibrag sets a precedent for privatising the giant Laubag lignite fields in Brandenburg.</p>

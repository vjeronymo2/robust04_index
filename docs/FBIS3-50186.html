The  Javornik Community Council has therefore rejected the recent  agreement between the Czech and Slovak interior ministers, under  which the "U Sabotu" hamlet and the Javornik railway station  (altogether 140 hectares of Czech territory and 37 houses) are  to be ceded to the Slovak Republic.    As Javornik Mayor Martin Kruzica told SME, the situation is  rather tense, in his opinion. He would not yet want to  characterize the situation as dramatic [vyhrocena], although  verbal assaults are not a rarity. Their main target are the 20  locals who applied for Czech citizenship, thereby exposing  themselves to ridicule from the Slovak side, especially in the  local pub. The agreement reached by the interior ministers was  based on a petition asking for the territory to be annexed to  Slovakia. However, the petition was signed by only 46 of the  126 residents of the hamlet. By means of a different petition,  300 Javornik residents communicated to the Ministry of Interior  and border commission the complete reverse position, however.    As Martin Kruzica told us, the Community Council is now  studying the possibility and effectiveness of a referendum that  would involve all 860 Javornik residents. If everything goes  smoothly, the referendum could be held as early as next week. "I  expect the outcome to be nearly 50-50, but more than one-half  could in fact opt for annexation to Slovakia," the Javornik  mayor added.    On the one hand, Martin Kruzica understands the problems of  Slovak citizens who commute from the hamlet to Slovakia for work  and school. The motives of the protests against surrendering  the area to the Slovak Republic are, however, just as serious,  in his opinion. Many private plots would find themselves on the  territory of another state, which would complicate access for  their owners. Overall, the border change would render impossible  access to 45 hectares of meadows and 209 hectares of forests. A  protest over a possible modification of the border has also been  submitted by 150 Czech owners of land from Velka nad Velickou.  According to Jiri Psurny, mayor of this community, their  protest has been addressed to the Ministry of Interior of the  Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies, President Vaclav Havel,  and government representatives. Other problems that must not be  neglected concern timber cutting and harvesting, for which the  border would have to be crossed. The question of all kinds of  fees and tax conditions would also inevitably arise in this  context.    The Czech and Slovak interior ministers will recommend their  solution to the governments, but it must be approved by the  parliaments of both countries. "We have contacted deputies  representing southern Moravia and would like to assert through  them our present interests. The issue of small border traffic,  in particular, should be resolved at long last. I am seriously  worried that otherwise, the verbal clashes might evolve into  something we do not want," the mayor of Javornik conceded in his  interview for SME. "We have in our community written records  that are 200 years old. The borders in these records are  virtually identical to the present borders. There is no need to  deal with the problem of the border, it is people's problems  that require solutions."</p>

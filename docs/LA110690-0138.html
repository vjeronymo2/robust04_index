			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FOUR WORKS BY CONSTANTINIDES MAKE UP NORTHRIDGE PROGRAM  </P> <P> Four compositions from three decades by Dinos Constantinides made up a mildly  interesting concert by the Cal State Northridge New Music Ensemble conducted by  Daniel Kessner Sunday night. The Louisiana-based composer attended the event in  Northridge's Recital Hall, offering introductory comments before most of the  pieces.  </P> <P> Constantinides, a 61-year-old native of Greece, writes in a simple, tonal  language that explores folk music and lyricism without pretense or showy  virtuosity. His work emphasizes carefully lucid melodic lines, though sometimes  in ways unadventurous and woodenly pedagogic.  </P> <P> In "Listenings and Silences for Voice Alone" (1988), he sets three texts by  Pinkie Gordon Lane -- a black poet from Baton Rouge, where Constantinides has  taught composition for the past 24 years. Predictable word-painting, with of  humming, spoken words and melismatic singing accompany descriptions of  whispering, descending light and the passage of time.  </P> <P> Throughout, a tonal, tuneful quality handsomely suggests a traditional  spiritual style without patronizing or satirizing it. Soprano Theresa Villa  gave a poised, dramatic performance that captivated the listener.  </P> <P> The composer's "Antitheses" (1975) for chamber orchestra utilizes a  sentimental, less-convincing neo-Romanticism seasoned with frequent percussive  bursts.  </P> <P> The ensemble of 14 players gave a timid reading of the work, with specific  players consistently out of sync.  </P> <P> Constantinides opened the program himself ruggedly performing his serial Sonata  No. 1 (1968) for violin solo. A three-movement, jazzy study, "Homage: A Folk  Concerto for Flute"(1988) for flute and piano, closed the program pleasantly.  GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

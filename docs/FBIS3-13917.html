They said the bank, whose headquarters are in Cairo,  received  the licenses from the Bank of Israel last week after the Central  Bank of Jordan (CBJ) issued preliminary licences.    The bank is seeking to reopen up to five branches in the  West  Bank and Gaza Strip but it received Israeli approvals for only  one branch in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and the other in  the Gaza Strip, they said.    The Arab Land Bank became the second known Jordanian Bank to  get Israeli licenses in line with a memorandum of understanding  signed by Jordan and Israel in December.    The Bank of Jordan got an Israeli license last week to  reopen  a branch in Ramallah in the West Bank.    Other Jordanian banks which have received preliminary  licenses from the CBJ include the Arab Bank, Jordan's largest  commercial bank, the Jordan-Gulf Bank and the Jordan National  Bank. The CBJ is known to have issued preliminary licenses for  a total of eight branches of the five banks. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / 'Spectacular incompetence' alleged at Lloyd's Lloyd's underwriters were guilty of 'incompetence on a spectacular scale' it was alleged yesterday on the opening day of the UK's biggest legal action to date, brought by loss-making Lloyd's Names. Mr Geoffrey Vos QC, representing 3,095 lossmaking Gooda Walker Names, told Mr Justice Phillips that underwriters had 'wholly ignored the basic, obvious and accepted principles of the reinsurance market'. The Gooda Names are seeking compensation of some Pounds 629m from 71 members' agents who placed them with four syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency. The syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance business, reinsuring other reinsurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates. The underwriters either 'didn't know the scale of their likely exposures' or had 'wholly ignored it', alleged Mr Vos. They bought 'inadequate' reinsurance protection and were overwhelmed by losses from a series of catastrophes - ranging from the Piper oil rig explosion to hurricane Hugo - between 1987 and 1990. Total losses of the four syndicates - 164, 290, 298 and 299 - in seven separate years of account amount to more than Pounds 850m. The outcome of the case, likely to last three months, is expected to be a pointer to the prospects of thousands more Names planning similar action. A case by nearly 2,000 Feltrim Names, who were also placed on reinsurance syndicates, is scheduled to begin in the autumn. Lloyd's losses since 1988 amount to more than Pounds 7bn. The market expects next month to report a loss of more than Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of account. 'The claim is simple,' explained Mr Vos. 'The plaintiffs allege that each of the underwriters fell below the standards to be expected of a reasonably competent underwriter.' The losses of each of the four syndicates were wholly 'disproportionate' both in relation to the profits received by Names in earlier years and the rest of the market. In 1989 the four syndicates' total losses of Pounds 685m accounted for about 30 per cent of the market's overall loss. 'The aim of reinsurance is to spread the loss. The Gooda Walker syndicates succeeded in concentrating a large part of the market's losses on their Names,' added Mr Vos. 'It would be charitable to describe these underwriting methods as gambling, (but) a roulette player at least knows how much he has put on the table and how much he can lose.'</p>

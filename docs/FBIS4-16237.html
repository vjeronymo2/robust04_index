			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- On the eve of the CIS summit  due to open on Friday, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord Sergey Shakhray called upon its participants to set up an  international working group to draw up a draft agreement to  create a confederation of Eurasian states.    Speaking in a radio programme of the international  broadcasting company "Mir", Shakhray said, in particular, that  it would be expedient to first build within the CIS a  confederation of two or three states prepared for closer  relations, according to a spokesman for the Russian Party of  Unity and Accord. All countries entering the confederation will  certainly preserve their political sovereignty, the party leader  stressed. Among the the main spheres for integration he listed  be economics, defence and foreign policy. [sentence as received]    Shakhray pointed to a substantial difference in legislations  of former Soviet republics and suggested an effective mechanism  to bring in line economic and other laws in the common interests  of all states uniting into a confederation. Thus, he proposed  drawing up detailed agreements in various spheres of economic  activities, which, after being signed and ratified, be granted  the status of international treaties superior to national  legislation. This mechanism is much more effective that the  usual parliamentary procedure, Shakhray believes. Furthermore,  the legislative basis thus built would make it possible to  surmount the difficulties caused by upset economic ties and to  facilitate contacts among millions of people adding their voices  to the call for political, economic and spiritual re-integration.</p>

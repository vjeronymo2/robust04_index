			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Italian markets react positively to results of local elections Italy's financial markets reacted favourably yesterday to the clear victory of left-wing alliances in large cities in Sunday's second round of local elections, writes Robert Graham. The Milan stock market rose by 3.3 per cent and the lira strengthened compared with its Friday close against the D-Mark from L998 to L988. Dealers said the market took a positive view of earlier commitments by Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, to ensure the 1994 austerity budget passed through parliament.</p>

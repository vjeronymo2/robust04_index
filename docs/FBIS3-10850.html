This is  the announcement that might have been expected, but it was never  uttered. The lack of money said everything, and therefore the  airplanes did not fly yesterday, operations being suspended  until the company is privatized. If the airline had continued  to operate it would have lost $4.3 million this month. A quick  decision by Congress is expected for its privatization. The  bill will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on 10 March.    Yesterday at noon, the LAPSA Board of Directors suspended  the  DC-10 flight to Miami. Then the Privatization Council announced  to the Board of Directors the suspension of all flights. The  operations were suspended because without state aid the company  had no funds to continue operating. The president of the  Bicameral Privatization Committee said if operations continued  the company would lose $4.3 million in March alone. [passage  omitted]</p>

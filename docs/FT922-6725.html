			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Letter: Not so bad a defeat Sir, Ivo Dawnay's article ('Shadow boxing in the Labour ring', May 13) continues your paper's tendency to see Labour's results in the recent general election as a 'humiliating' defeat. Yet, the Labour party: increased its number of MPs and percentage of the vote for the third consecutive election; reduced the government's previously large majority; cut into the Liberal Democrat vote; came within 1,000 votes of victory in 17 seats. While, obviously, Labour lost the election, some analysis of the real losers  -the continuing post-1983 decline of the Lib Dems and Paddy Ashdown's strategy of replacing Labour by the Lib Dems, is needed. This will then give a more balanced presentation. C Rowley, lecturer, Cardiff Business School, Aberconway Building, Colum Drive, Cardiff CF1 3EU</p>

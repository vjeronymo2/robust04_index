The studies were  performed on free bronze consisting of copper plus 13 weight  percent tin and 0.2 weight percent titanium after homogenization  at 700C for 20 hours and on multifilament composites  consisting of Nb/Cu plus 13 weight percent Sn and 0.2 weight  percent titanium (each composite contained 7,225 1-mm-diameter  filaments) after diffusion annealing at 700C for 72 hours.  The fine structure of the composites and bronze were studied  under a JEM-200 CX electron microscope, and the distribution of  their elements was studied on a JCXA-733 scanning  microscope/microanalyzer. The studies established that during  the annealing process, the titanium diffuses from the bronze  matrix through the Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn layer into the niobium  filaments. During the course of this process, the growth rate of  the diffusion layer increased along with its thickness, and the  anisotropy of the grains' shape decreased. No reduction in grain  size was observed, however. The thermodynamics and kinetics of  this redistribution of titanium in the composite were explained  in terms of previously published mathematical studies of the  partial free energy of titanium in solid solutions, the change  in free energy during the face-centered crystal lattice  body-centered crystal lattice transition, and the condition of  local equilibrium on the interface between solid solutions. The  mechanism of the diffusion of titanium from the bronze into the  filaments was shown to be more complicated but was also  explained. Figures 7; references 14: 5 Russian, 9 Western.</p>

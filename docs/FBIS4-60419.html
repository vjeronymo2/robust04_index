			<p>BFN     [Text] Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, today  rejected the demand that the PLO head present a letter in which  he pledges to honor the agreement with Israel. He also lashed  at the demand that Prime Minister Rabin send the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] into the Gaza Strip. Dr. al-Tibi demanded that  the interim period be shortened because he believes five years  is too long a period during which to form the permanent  solution. According to him, circumstances on the ground will  force the parties to immediately begin negotiating the permanent  solution.    Speaking at a seminar on the peace process at the Ben-Gurion  University in Beersheba, Dr. al-Tibi said that the Palestinian  goal is to establish an independent state, the capital of which  will be East Jerusalem. According to him, there are cabinet  ministers who support the establishment of an independent  Palestinian state. He believes that the settlements can be kept  in place and, after they are evacuated by the settlers, they  could be populated by the Palestinian refugees.</p>

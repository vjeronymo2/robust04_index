			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Kai </F> Diekmann; place and date not given: "Mr. Kohl, How Important Is  Friendship in Politics?"]    [Text] [Diekmann] Mr. Kohl, how important is friendship  in world politics?    [Kohl] It would be a mistake to expect personal friendships  to remedy real political problems.    But, if the chemistry is right, if you get on with each  other  right away, if you have walked a common path, and if a personal  relationship has developed, everything gets much easier. Then  you can say: "Listen, there is no way I will do that. I could  not make my people at home understand that."    [Diekmann] Who among the heads of state do you count as your  friends?    [Kohl] Francois Mitterrand of course, and certainly Felipe  Gonzalez; also Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. But there is a  number of others as well.    [Diekmann] How did French President Mitterrand become your  friend?    [Kohl] What is important in our relationship is that, like  me, Francois Mitterrand tends to break through the rigid  framework of protocol. When I am in Paris and the official part  is over, we sometimes get away, go for a meal together. To  ordinary places, restaurants where students go.    We talk to each other on the phone frequently, even if it is  not about politics. I will never forget how he immediately  called me at the hospital when my son Peter had a serious  accident. They called me out of the intensive care unit,  because Francois Mitterrand was on the phone next door,  comforting me.    [Diekmann] What was it like with U.S. President Bill  Clinton, who is a whole generation younger than you?    [Kohl] The ice was broken during our first meeting. I  simply told him: Before talking about politics we should talk a  little about ourselves, who we are, what our family backgrounds  are. He told me about his parents, I told him about mine.    My father worked for the inland revenue, we were not  wealthy.  I paid for most of my university education myself. With Bill  Clinton things were very similar.    We obviously got along, for, as the official talks ended he  went for his mother. And the three of us sat together talking  for a long time.    In my experience, the relationships with their wives, but  also with their mothers, are among the most important things in  men's lives.    [Diekmann] What was your reaction when Russian President  Boris Yeltsin first suggested that you go to the sauna together?    [Kohl] We found out on an earlier occasion that we both like  going to the sauna. When I was in Moscow last time I did not  have much time, I was only passing through. No way did I want  to go to the sauna. It was a very, very chilly evening, we met  at a chalet near the airport. Boris Yeltsin was already there  saying: "Let us go to the sauna right away."    I replied: "Just a moment, I am not at all in the mood for  that."    But he was determined to go. So we went to the sauna, went  swimming, and talked about all our affairs.    [Diekmann] Boris Yeltsin also visited you at your home at  Oggersheim....    [Kohl] In private life it is quite normal to invite  colleagues, who are also friends, to your home. In world  politics it is the greatest gesture you can make. Boris Yeltsin  enjoyed very much seeing what my home country, my home, is like.    Boris Yeltsin and I have a very friendly relationship. He is  a very sensitive man. The great big frame must not blind you to  that. He has a distinct feeling for moods.    There is another thing, which also goes for Bill Clinton,  Boris Yeltsin, and Francois Mitterrand: We all like our food,  myself maybe most.    [Diekmann] Do you sometimes phone up Yeltsin and Clinton  even if you do not have any important business to discuss?    [Kohl] Yes. It is the same as in private life: When I see  that the other person has problems I call them and say: I just  wanted to tell you, keep your chin up, I will keep my fingers  crossed....    My mother always told us: When people are doing fine you  need not go and see them, because then everyone is going there.  But it is when they are having problems that you need to go.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A reception was held  here this evening to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the  establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia.    Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese  National People's Congress (NPC) Buhe and Malaysian Ambassador  to China Dato Noor Adlan attended the gathering, which was  jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for  Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and the  China-Malaysian Friendship Association (CMFA).    In his speech, CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said that over  the past 20 years, friendly bilateral ties and cooperation in  political, economic, cultural and other fields have been  steadily expanding and the friendly exchanges between the two  peoples have increased with each passing day.    He noted that in recent years, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed has visited China three times and that Chinese  Premier Li Peng and Chairman Qiao Shi of the NPC Standing  Committee have both visited Malaysia.    These visits have enhanced the mutual understanding and  trust, ushering in a new period of all-round development in  Sino-Malaysian ties, Qi said.    The CPAFFC and the CMFA are willing to join the  Malaysia-China Friendship Association and friends from all walks  of life in malaysia and do their part in enhancing the mutual  understanding, in consolidating and furthering the traditional  friendship between the two peoples, and in promoting the  continuous expansion and development of Sino-Malaysian ties of  friendly cooperation in various fields, he said.    The establishment of diplomatic ties between Malaysia and  China on May 31, 1974, "not only marked the milestone on the  road to the development of the relations but brought back  contacts which had once flourished between our two countries,"  Ambassador Adlan said.    "At no time in the history of the relations between our two  countries have those relations been higher than they presently  are," he said. "I cannot but draw great satisfaction and pride  over the significant progress made in our relations."    He expressed the hope that the two countries grasp the  determination of the destiny of the region in their own hands,  build their national resilience and contribute to the progress,  peace and security of this region and the rest of the world.</p>

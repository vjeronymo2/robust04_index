			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPEROR VOICES JAPAN'S 'REGRET' FOR KOREA ROLE  </P> <P> The leaders of Japan and South Korea staged an elaborate show of historical  reflection -- and Japanese contrition -- on Thursday, making tense and  carefully measured remarks aimed at putting an unhappy past behind the two East  Asian neighbors.  </P> <P> The occasion may go down in the history books as the "apology summit." South  Korean President Roh Tae Woo began an emotionally charged visit after weeks of  controversy over whether the Tokyo government would meet his demands that  Emperor Akihito offer a clear apology for Japan's brutal colonization of the  Korean Peninsula earlier this century.  </P> <P> Akihito made a tightly restrained expression of "regret" during a state banquet  in Roh's honor.  </P> <P> "I think of the sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate  period, which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest  regret," Akihito said, reading a text prepared by government officials.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen how well the emperor's statement will be received in  South Korea, where bitterness about the 1910-45 period of Japanese colonization  remains strong.  </P> <P> Thousands of students demonstrated in three South Korean cities Thursday,  shouting anti-Japanese slogans, burning Japanese flags and denouncing Roh's  trip as a sellout of national pride, news agencies reported. Some students  charged that Roh's visit is intended to deepen South Korea's economic  dependence on Japan and strengthen military ties among South Korea, Japan and  the United States.  </P> <P> Although the emperor did not utter the word apology, his remarks were somewhat  more vigorous than those made by his father, Hirohito -- known since his death  early last year as Emperor Showa -- when former President Chun Doo Hwan visited  Japan in 1984.  </P> <P> Akihito cited Hirohito's statement to Roh: "It is indeed regrettable that there  was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this century, and I believe  that it should not be repeated again."  </P> <P> The Japanese government went to great pains to avoid giving the impression that  Akihito's okotoba, or "august words," would somehow render those of his father  obsolete, or suggest that the late emperor was less than sincere in expressing  his regret. Hirohito reigned from 1926 until his death at age 87; Koreans were  forced into subservience, for the most part, under his name.  </P> <P> Hard-line officials in Tokyo also resisted the idea of Akihito making a lucid  apology that might arouse Japan's right wing or violate what one government  official described as the mystique surrounding the imperial institution. They  used the pretext of a "constitutional constraint" on the emperor's "political  role" to dampen the tone of his statement.  </P> <P> Roh, in response to Akihito's banquet speech, also read from a prepared text:  </P> <P> "It is not possible to erase or forget historical facts," he said.  "Nevertheless, we must not remain bound up in memories. Our two nations must  now forge a new era of friendship and cooperation based on proper historical  perspective, putting the unfortunate past truly behind us.  </P> <P> "It is significant," Roh continued, "that your majesty, the symbol of Japanese  history and the new Japanese nation, has shown deep concern about this matter."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Roh met with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who had an  apology of his own to make.  </P> <P> "It is necessary to clearly and honestly articulate the realities of events  that have so regrettably marred our past relations," Kaifu said. "I would  therefore like to express my feeling of sincere remorse and honest apology for  the fact that there was a period in our history in which Japanese actions  inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the Korean  Peninsula."  </P> <P> Kaifu reminded Roh of his government's decision to expand legal rights for new  generations of Korean residents in Japan, and he said Japan is considering a  plan to donate about $26 million to a fund for medical treatment of Korean  survivors of the atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  </P> <P> Kaifu also told Roh that Japan has allocated about $660,000 in humanitarian  support in this year's fiscal budget for Korean laborers who were left behind  on the island of Sakhalin at the end of World War II -- nearly double the  amount budgeted last year.  </P></p>

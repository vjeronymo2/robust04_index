			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BODY-FAT CALCULATORS WEIGH IN  </P> <P> Southern Californians are hooking up to some unusual machines these days in the  name of fitness.  </P> <P> They are shooting beams of infrared light into their biceps or allowing  electrodes to be attached to their hands and feet. They are plunging underwater  on a cadaver scale or enduring the humiliation of having their "love handles"  squeezed by a stranger wielding calipers.  </P> <P> All of these procedures measure body fat, and they have become popular  offerings in some Southern California health clubs, weight-control centers and  wellness clinics.  </P> <P> "When I do fitness testing, (body fat) is the issue that everyone wants to talk  about," said Ellen Turkel, a consultant for corporate wellness programs and  health clubs. "You can talk about flexibility until you're blue in the face,  but when you start talking about body fat, they're on the edge of their seats."  </P> <P> Experts caution, however, that as testing and new machinery proliferate, so  does the chance of getting inaccurate or misleading results. They urge anyone  undergoing body-fat tests to consider the skill of the test-givers, pretest  conditions and equipment limitations for each of the five most common  techniques.  </P> <P> "I think that high-tech gets a lot of publicity because it looks exciting and  because people who are trying to sell products are pushing them," said Paul  Schmidt, a fitness specialist with the city of San Diego. "But things are  misused quite often."  </P> <P> Body fat isn't all evil. Layered under the skin and packed around organs, fat  insulates the body from cold, cushions it against injury and supplies it with  essential everyday fuel.  </P> <P> Too much body fat, however, increases a person's risk of hypertension, diabetes  and high cholesterol, among other problems.  </P> <P> A study done at San Diego's Naval Health Research Center, to be published this  year, concluded that men with more than 22% fat and women with more than 33%  fat are at significant health risk.  </P> <P> Beyond that, "ideal" body fat percentages vary. Depending on whom you ask, a  healthy rate for men ranges anywhere from 6% to 25%, while a healthy woman's  body fat can range from 9% to as high as 32%.  </P> <P> Health clubs and wellness centers that test body fat typically use one of five  procedures: the old standards of underwater weighing, skin-fold calipers and  circumference equations and the newer infrared technology and bio-electrical  impedance machines, which conduct low-level electricity through the body.  </P> <P> Last summer, Schmidt compared the five procedures in a study on 75 police  officer trainees -- a primarily young and relatively fit test population. His  results rated skin-fold calipers as the second most accurate method behind  underwater weighing, the "gold standard" of body-fat testing. Circumference  equations came in next, followed by the infrared technique and, finally, the  bio-electrical impedance.  </P> <P> Tim Lohman, a professor and researcher in the University of Arizona's  department of exercise and sports sciences, ranks the methods differently,  based on studies with participants more typical of the average population.  </P> <P> He says impedance, "if the machine is reliable," and skin-fold calipers, if the  tester is well-trained, come in second to underwater weighing. Circumference  measurements are third. Infrared, which is so new that it hasn't been widely  tested in independent studies, is the least reliable, he said.  </P> <P> What follows is a rundown on each of the five testing methods.  </P> <P> * INFRARED: The infrared machine, marketed under the name Futrex 5000, is an  outgrowth of U.S. Department of Agriculture research on pig fat. It operates on  the premise that fat refracts light differently than muscle and bone do.  </P> <P> Using a wand attached to a small hand-held microprocessor, the instrument  shoots a beam of infrared light into the body halfway between the shoulder and  elbow on the biceps of the person's dominant arm. Manufacturer Futrex Inc., of  Gaithersburg, Md., claims that fat measured here is directly proportional to  total body fat.  </P> <P> The infrared light beam passes quickly through fat, then bends as it hits  muscle and bone. The machine calculates percent body fat as it measures that  bend.  </P> <P> The Futrex machine costs about $2,000, according to Tori Tunnell, sales manager  for the company. He said that individual tests, while most often included in a  comprehensive body-composition analysis and wellness screening package, can  cost as little as $15.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Rams have included the machine in their body-fat testing  equipment. But the team uses the machine for spot checking all over the body,  according to Garrett Giemont, the team's strength trainer.  </P> <P> Operators of the Futrex 5000 liken it to a blood pressure test. There is no  need to remove clothes, lie down, be dunked under water or meet pretest  conditions, they say. The instrument also allows for self-testing.  </P> <P> But Anita Jones, health promotion director for Accents on Health, a San Diego  wellness clinic, said the machine isn't nearly as easy to operate as its  instructions indicate. To find the right spot at the "belly" of the biceps  takes a lot of practice, she said.  </P> <P> Lohman said that although he hasn't yet tested the machine, one of its  limitations is that, unlike the other methods, the manufacturer suggests only  one measurement location to determine total percent body fat.  </P> <P> Another concern, exercise physiologists say, is that the infrared light beam  shoots only a limited distance into the body, and that could affect the  accuracy of measurements on obese people.  </P> <P> But a company spokesman says the depth of the light beam is accounted for in  the machine's software and that the beam is but one of the variables entered  into the software's equation that determines percent body fat. Other variables  include activity level, height, weight, gender and body frame.  </P> <P> * BIO-ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE: The bio-impedance method, out for about four years,  measures resistance to electricity to determine percent body fat. Operators  attach two electrodes each to specific locations on the foot and hand through  which they introduce a low-energy, high-frequency electrical current.  </P> <P> Lean muscle, which has high water content, easily conducts the electricity,  while fat resists. Measurement of that resistance predicts the body fat  percentage.  </P> <P> Valhalla Scientific, a San Diego-based company, is one of the industry's top  two manufacturers of the machines, which cost between $2,500 and $5,000.  </P> <P> Some exercise physiologists point out that many variables can affect body fat  measured with this equipment. When a person last ate, drank and exercised can  influence results of the test, which costs from $40 to $100.  </P> <P> "It's hard to get reliable measurements," said Turkel, the corporate wellness  consultant.  </P> <P> But, she added, "I think they're on the cutting edge, and in the next few  years, people will be considering it more seriously."  </P> <P> Valhalla's operation manual cautions that to ensure accurate test results, the  following conditions should be avoided: participation in heavy exercise within  eight hours of the test; water loss or dehydration due to hot weather, exercise  or inadequate fluid intake; consumption of excessive quantities of food within  six hours of the test, of water within four hours, of caffeine within three  hours, or of alcohol within 48 hours; fasting within 72 hours of the test;  using the bathroom more than an hour before the test, and excessive water  retention during the three days before a woman's menstrual period and seven  days afterward.  </P> <P> Valhalla trains anyone who buys the equipment to observe the pretest  conditions, Clark said. "Proper medical procedure is like any other test."  </P> <P> * SKIN-FOLD CALIPERS: Skin-fold calipers, developed in the 1930s to measure the  fat content of pigs on their way to market, are perhaps the best known devices  used to measure body fat.  </P> <P> Operators use a plier-shaped apparatus -- one of a dozen types -- to pinch  flesh in three or more body locations. Readings are correlated with an equation  that takes into consideration a person's gender, height, weight and age. The  equations are particular to specific calipers.  </P> <P> "I'm not old-fashioned, but the old-fashioned calipers really seem to work,"  Turkel said. "It's done on so many people that they're quite reliable."  </P> <P> Nationally, the YMCA has used calipers to measure body fat for several decades,  said Don Hanna, who sits on the organization's national program development  committee. Though the Y recently has been "deluged" by companies selling newer  machines, corporate researchers have decided to stick with calipers for the  foreseeable future, he said.  </P> <P> Although the test is simple enough for the recipient, experts say the procedure  is frequently mishandled by untrained or inexperienced operators. When that  happens, the average error rate can rise to as much as 10%.  </P> <P> * CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS: After considering the use of skin-fold calipers  to test its personnel nationwide, the Navy went with circumference  measurements. According to Jim Hodgdon, a Naval Health Research Center program  director, results are generally as good as skin folds and the method is much  more easily taught to operators.  </P> <P> Simple, tape-measured dimensions -- such as a man's neck, abdomen and height --  are plugged into equations similar to those for calipers. Results have  generally been on a par with skin folds, often with less of an error margin,  said Schmidt.  </P> <P> "It's as accurate as anything else," he said. "These are numbers that are very  practical, and people can relate to them. I strongly suggest a move back toward  use of circumference measurements."  </P> <P> * UNDERWATER WEIGHING: Using the principal that fat floats, while muscle and  bone sink, underwater weighing actually measures the amount of water your  submerged body displaces. That figure helps estimate body density, which in  turn predicts percent body fat.  </P> <P> Underwater weighing is certainly the most inconvenient of techniques.  Typically, only a few hospitals, universities and athletic teams have the  equipment. (Tests cost about $50 to the public.) To be tested, a person must  don a bathing suit, balance on what has traditionally been a cadaver scale,  exhale all of his or her breath and hold it out for as long as possible  underwater, repeating the procedure six or seven times.  </P> <P> "It is not practical for most settings," Turkel said.  </P> <P> Though other methods gauge their accuracy by hydrostatic body-fat measurements,  the technique isn't without its own errors, fitness experts say. Consider the  results logged for several world-class athletes: less than 1% body fat.  </P> <P> Researchers say that occurs because the method assumes the same muscle and bone  density for everyone, regardless of ethnic, gender and age differences.  </P> <P> "That can't possibly be true," Carter said.  </P> <P> For most accurate results, residual air volume -- or the air left in your lungs  and esophagus also must be measured.  </P> <P> Regardless of the method chosen, experts urge common sense in dealing with  body-fat test results.  </P> <P> Caloric restrictions and aerobic exercise are the only ways to reduce body fat,  though weight reduction doesn't automatically mean a reduction in fat.  </P> <P> And there's no such thing as spot reducing.  </P> <P> "Can I lose it off my thighs or off my tummy?" Carter said. "The answer is, in  general, no. You lose it overall."  </P> <P> Carter and other experts also counsel those rushing to measure body fat not to  place too much emphasis on a small aspect of overall wellness.  </P> <P> "People are taking these things very seriously these days -- a little too  seriously," Lohman said. "So many people are so dissatisfied with their  (results) but are in a very healthy range."  </P> <P> Said Schmidt: "We get too hung up on our body-fat assessment versus looking at  the big picture of health and wellness and life style. When body fat preempts  that, we're missing the point."  </P></p>

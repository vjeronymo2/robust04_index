			<p>BFN     [Text] Plock, June 10 -- Asked by journalists whether  President Lech Walesa's positive assessment of the "Strategy for  Poland" programme means that the conflict between the government  and the president came to an end, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  said that never there was such a conflict but there were only  differences of opinion. The prime minister told journalists  during his visit to the Plock petrochemical combine SA that the  "Strategy for Poland" document was an example of agreement.</p>

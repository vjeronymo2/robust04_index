The Cuban  position was reaffirmed before the 50th UN Human Rights Session  at the UN Palace where the economic, social, and cultural rights  and those related to development are being debated.    According to Cuban representative to the United Nations,  Jorge Lago Silva, the UN Human Rights Commission must make the  U.S. Government understand that a dignified, heroic country  cannot be subdued by force, nor can it be deprived of its  subsistence and development. This was the second appeal made by  the Cuban delegation to that commission during the two-day  session on economic rights.    Speaking before the 50th session of the Human Rights  Commission at the UN Palace, Jorge Lago Silva said that the U.S.  blockade, as a coercive measure against a small country, seeks  to prevent its access to essential goods, whether they are  called food or medicine, in an effort to destroy the political,  economic, and social system chosen by the Cubans.    Lagos Silva said before the plenary session that Washington  ignores decisions made by the international community. It does  not respect the UN resolutions, but on the contrary, tries to  impose its own unilateral concessions.    Within the specific structure of international politics,  Lago  Silva stressed the lack of political willingness by countries of  the North, namely the United States, to promote measures that  seek to achieve increasing development levels in the Third World.</p>

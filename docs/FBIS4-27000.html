			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] On 26 June, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, member of the CPC Central Committee  Secretariat, and president of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions [ACDTU], attended the third presidum meeting of the 12th  ACFTU in Hebei. He stressed the need for those who are involved  in trade union work to persist in arming themselves with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to guide trade union work. Wei Jianxing pointed  out the need for those who are involved in trade union work to  have a good understanding of the nation's general interests when  engaging in trade union work. He called on all levels of trade  unions organizations to concentrate their tasks on promoting the  nation's general interests -- that is, seize the opportunity,  deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain  stability. He urged them to proceed from reality and to  actively involve themselves in helping solve prominent problems  which could affect reform, development, and stability. The  prominent issues which have a direct bearing on the personal  interests of staff members and workers, according to him, are  employment, distribution, social security and establishment of  trade unions at foreign-funded enterprises.</p>

Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, a key party in  the coalition, told reporters the coalition has accepted the  SDP's offer to meet.    The SDP, which is the second largest opposition party, faces  a crucial choice of whether it would return to the coalition or  forge an alliance with the boggest opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), SDP's archrival so far. The LDP was ousted from  government last August after 38 years in power.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles disposes of US sports goods chain ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent company of the Gateway food retail group trying to renegotiate its debt, has finally agreed the sale of Herman's Sporting Goods, its US chain of 259 sports shops. The price agreed with the purchaser, an investor group led by the Taggart/Fasola Group, a US management firm which specialises in turnround situations, was not disclosed. However, it is thought that Isosceles will receive about Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) for the chain. Isosceles has been trying to sell Herman's since it succeeded with a Pounds 2.1bn leveraged buy-out of Gateway in 1989. The sale of Herman's is expected to close in early March. Mr William Taggart, chairman of the Taggart/Fasola Group, said 'in order to grow in the 1990s Herman's will need fresh capital and fresh ideas'. Dee Corporation, the former incarnation of Gateway, paid Pounds 278m for Herman's in 1986 and then expanded it by acquiring another chain for Pounds 45m. Even before Isosceles' bid for Gateway, Herman's was proving an unhappy investment. Soon after Isosceles bought Gateway it is thought to have received an offer for Herman's of about Dollars 300m (then about Pounds 200m), but this fell through when the buyer was unable to assemble the necessary funds. Another possible purchase fell through in October last year. In Isosceles' last accounts, for the year to April 25 1992, the investment in Herman's was written down by Pounds 144.8m. It was shown in the balance sheet under 'investments held for disposal' and was thought to make up the bulk of the Pounds 57.7m value put on these. Another write-down is therefore expected in the next accounts. Isosceles is currently in talks with its lenders over a refinancing of Pounds 1.4bn debt. It has a standstill agreement with its banks until May 28 this year. It has yet to publish interim results, and these may not appear until agreement on the refinancing is reached.</p>

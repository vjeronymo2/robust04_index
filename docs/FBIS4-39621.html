			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by (Anatoliy Botakov) from the "Today's World" </F> program]    [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA]  letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is being  discussed by the UN Security Council.    The United States, Japan, and the ROK are vigorously trying  to impose economic sanctions against Pyongyang. Considering  that the PRC might veto the decision, the United States is  evaluating the possibility of so-called sanction measures to  apply economic pressure. First, the measure bans all contracts  related to weapon sales. The embargo does not include coal and  petroleum. The economic sanction measures are another means to  obtain UN Security Council approval.    Russia reminds them of the fact that gradual and phased  sanctions by an international organ would not be opposed when  all other measures have failed. Considering the PRC position, I  think making a decision on an embargo by the UN Security Council  would be impossible at the moment.    Therefore, it is urgent to convene an international  conference for the security and denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula as proposed by Russia. The conference may be attended  by the representatives of the DPRK, South Korea, Russia, the  United States, the PRC, Japan, the United Nations, and the IAEA.  The conference should be an authoritative conference that  contributes to ending the dangerous confrontation on the  peninsula and enables the DPRK to express its concerns during  the progress.    U.S. President Clinton had a telephone conversation with  Boris Yeltsin last week and said that the conference may be  appropriate at a certain time. I would like to ask him what is  the appropriate time? Is it after sanctions are imposed? I  doubt anything could be achieved at that point.    In addition to its proposal, Moscow is prepared to evaluate  other coordination measures. However, all possible political  measures should be taken.    There are reports that the United States, Japan, and South  Korea are preparing three-party sanctions against Pyongyang  without a UN decision. They should not forget that Russia has  great economic and trading interests in the DPRK.    When independent three-party sanctions are imposed, Russia  will be in a position to consider its own legal interests.</p>

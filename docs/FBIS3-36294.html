			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 23 (513)] </F>   [Text] A draft constitutional law on power which was  considered by the Ukrainian parliament on Thursday morning  attributes more representative functions to the post of the  president.    As a member of the parliamentary commission on legislature  and law Sergey Sobolev told the news agency Interfax-Ukraine,  "the president becomes the head of state and represents Ukraine  in international affairs, signs international treaties, and is  entitled to cancel decisions of the Cabinet and implement a  number of other duties."    The supreme body of the executive power in the republic is  the Cabinet, which is confirmed by the parliament. As a result,  Sobolev said, "Ukraine actually becomes a parliamentary  republic."    The draft law on power also envisages that all authorities  in  regions are transferred to chairmen of local executive bodies,  which should be elected popularly. The institution of  presidential representatives in this case is eliminated.    Speaking at a session of the Supreme Soviet the day before,  its Chairman, Ivan Plyushch, spoke against holding a referendum  on basic constitutional provisions about power in Ukraine on  March 27. Earlier, this proposal was made by President Leonid  Kravchuk.    Plyushch believes that amendments to the organization of  state power in Ukraine "should be made not through a referendum,  but through the adoption of a constitutional law."</p>

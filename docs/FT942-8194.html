			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Currency and bond weakness upsets equities - Market report Another nervous and erratic session in UK equities yesterday saw share prices quickly shedding early gains towards the close as weakness in the US dollar unsettled sterling and impacted on British government bonds. By the close, an early gain of nearly 17 points on the FT-SE Index had been cut to only 4.5 for a final reading of 3,127.3. The session had started well, with the Footsie moving up to 3,139.7 on the back of Wall Street's strength overnight and the continued hopes that this week's determined action on US interest rates by the Federal Reserve would reinvigorate global bond markets. Although sterling was unsettled by the announcement that domestic M4 money supply had risen by Pounds 500m in April, stock markets made no initial response. But London securities markets were quickly upset later in the session when US markets began to turn off. By the close of trading in the London market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a fall of more than 7 points. While there was no great selling pressure in London - Friday afternoons often see cautious movements in share prices rather than activity by fund managers - the weakness in bonds was received badly. Market strategists, having at first given a favourable response to this week's sharp rises in US Federal funds and discount rates, had become increasingly unhappy with the easier trend in the US dollar which should, by normal market criteria, have responded favourably to higher rates in the US. The London market, in particular, has shown itself vulnerable to adverse moves in the UK Treasury financing sectors, and there are now fears that lower interest rates in Europe may not help UK stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, having given ground for the past fortnight, against the trend of the FT-SE 100 Index, made little progress yesterday, closing a mere 1.1 ahead at 3,714.6. Seaq volume increased to 708.2m shares from Thursday's 621.9m, which was worth Pounds 1.52bn in retail business. By the close of trading last night, the FT-SE 100 Index was showing a gain of only 8 points on the week, an unimpressive response to the widely-predicted rate hikes from the Federal Reserve which had been seen as a potential saviour for global bond markets and, therefore, for equities. UK share prices have found it difficult to follow Wall Street higher because dollar weakness has undermined optimism in the bond market. Once again, share prices found difficulty in establishing a firm trend yesterday and by the close the picture was more irregular than the Footsie Index suggested. Pharmaceuticals and banks closed easier and the blue chip sectors were boosted by gains in a handful of special situations including BT and British Gas, both still responding to trading statements on the previous day. However, store and retail stocks continued to respond well to the view of the independent Treasury advisers on Thursday that there was no need for domestic interest rates to rise at present. Profit-taking in the engineering and motor industry sectors suggested that this week's gains had been insecurely based and may have reflected little more than bargain hunting by small investors rather than investment decisions by the managers of the big pension funds.</p>

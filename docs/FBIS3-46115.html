			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, January 25 (XINHUA) -- A legion of  well-trained personnel is one explanation for the increasing  inflow of overseas investment into this largest port city of  north China.    Many big-name companies and financial groups worldwide have  come to do business in Tianjin because of the ample supply of  talented people here.    Statistics show that in 1993 the city approved the setting  up  of a record 3,500 overseas-funded ventures, with a large  proportion of them engaging in technology- or capital-intensive  projects.    City officials said a healthy cycle of supply and demand,  and  transfer and management of talented people has formed in the  city, as there is a steadily increasing supply of and demand for  such persons.    At a talent fare on January 18 this year more than 30  overseas-funded enterprises were among hundreds of firms  recruiting specialized technical and managerial personnel as  well as skilled workers.    At one counter a solely Japanese-funded firm specializing in  electronics in the city's high-tech development zone was visited  by more than 100 high-grade personnel though the company wanted  to hire only 20 management professionals.    Qin Huilin, personnel manager of the firm, said, "we have  plenty of room to maneuver and pick out the best."    She also said that in just one month before the firm went  into business in August 1992, the company had recruited over 200  people skilled in management, finance and technical maintenance  to fill all the vacancies.    After a short period of training all of them were well  adapted to their respective work, Qin said, adding that the  firm's product quality has reached the Japanese standard.    "A major reason that we have progressed so far and so fast  is  that we have a qualified staff," she said, noting that all the  500 employees of her company were recruited from talent centers.    Zhou Jiazhu, chief executive of the Tianjin Municipal Talent  Exchange Center, said more than 1,000 overseas-funded ventures  hired over 20,000 well-trained professionals from his center  last year but the overall situation of the city's labor market  is that supply far surpasses demand.    He said world-renowned companies like Coca-Cola, Motorola  and  Yamaha can be choosy, as they are besieged by hundreds of  applicants every day.    According to Zhou, Tianjin has a large bank of talent, with  personnel specializing in all fields. No company in Tianjin  will have difficulty employing any kind of high-level  professional, he assured.    In one case, Zhou said, a joint venture unsure whether it  could find several first-class technicians at a talent fare  received more than 70 well-qualified applicants in only three  hours.    An official with the municipal personnel bureau said the  city  has over 600,000 specialized professionals and technicians, and  200,000 of them are of superior grade. He added that, overall,  more than 80 percent of the city's nine million-strong  population are well-educated.    He further pointed out that the city's talent reserve will  keep growing, as Tianjin has 26 universities, around 1,000  technical schools and more than 140 natural science research  institutes.    As a result, the official said, the municipal economy is  growing robustly and overseas-funded ventures are springing up  ever faster.    The city's flourishing talent market is also attracting  flocks of talented people in north China to Tianjin, he said,  citing Beijing as one of the major sources.    The official said the on-going reform in the country's  personnel and employment systems will push more people onto the  market for job opportunities and transfers, which is sure to  benefit overseas-funded ventures.    Meanwhile he said the Tianjin Municipal Government is to  launch a series of projects, such as "The Rising Sun Project"  and "The Cross-Century Talent Project", to tackle problems such  as the aging of professional talents and knowledge structure as  well as to train more people for its modernization drive in the  long run.</p>

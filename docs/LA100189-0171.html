			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GLENDALE DEFEATS PIERCE, 43-15  </P> <P> Excuse the Pierce College football team if it is a little gun-shy about finding  out who this week's opponent is.  </P> <P> It's not more of those Vaqueros, is it?  </P> <P> Give Pierce some Lions, Tigers or Bears -- anything but Vaqueros. They've  already caused enough damage this season.  </P> <P> Pierce lost its second consecutive Western State Conference game to a team  nicknamed Vaqueros, falling, 43-15, Saturday night to the Glendale Vaqueros at  Glendale High.  </P> <P> Last week, the Brahmas (1-2 overall, 0-2 in conference play) lost to the Santa  Barbara Vaqueros, 28-20.  </P> <P> Pierce, which was allowing an average of 512 yards to opponents going into the  game, gave up 469 to Glendale.  </P> <P> It was a night for former Brahmas to shine.  </P> <P> Ex-Pierce quarterback Ronnie Lopez passed for one touchdown and ran for  another. Lopez completed seven of eight passes for 131 yards. And former Brahma  Wes Bender scored touchdowns on runs of one and 14 yards.  </P> <P> Dominic Mustin scored both Pierce touchdowns on second-half runs of 13 and two  yards.  </P> <P> Glendale (1-1-1, 1-0-1) led, 21-0, at halftime and tacked on two third-quarter  touchdowns -- one a 68-yard pass from quarterback Darren Fitzgerald to Pat  Lynch -- to turn the game into a runaway. Fitzgerald was five of seven for 130  yards and one touchdown. Lynch caught four passes for 137 yards.  </P> <P> Glendale scored on its first three offensive series. Bender, who transferred to  Glendale this season, scored the first two Vaquero touchdowns. Glendale, which  stayed primarily on the ground in the first half, increased its advantage to  three touchdowns early in the second period when Doug Dragomer went three yards  for a touchdown and David Bowen added his third conversion kick.  </P> <P> Pierce was competitive from a statistical standpoint in the first half, gaining  144 yards -- 92 from quarterback Jamie Grossman, who completed 10 of 18 passes  with one interception in the half. Grossman finished 14 of 26 for 148 yards.  </P> <P> Glendale had 192 first-half yards, 137 on the ground. Sean Hampton led all  first-half rushers with 75 yards in five carries for the Vaqueros. He finished  with a game-leading 92 yards in seven carries.  </P> <P> Pierce twice hurt itself in the first half by committing turnovers on drives  inside Glendale territory. Louis Vann fumbled the ball away at the Vaquero 40  in the first period, and a Grossman pass was intercepted at the Glendale 13 by  Ron Morgan late in the second quarter. JIM COLEMAN  </P></p>

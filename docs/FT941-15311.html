			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats in demand Leading textile group Coats Viyella was one of the strongest performers in the FT-SE 100 index yesterday as Smith New Court reiterated a buy recommendation on the company. The shares rose 9 1/2 to 273 1/2 p. Analyst Mr Mark Puleikis said the shares had been dragged down by recent downgrades on Courtaulds Textiles, William Baird and Dawson International. But while those three companies had recovered Coats had been left behind. 'On our profit forecast of Pounds 192m for this year the shares had fallen to a market rating after being at a 30 per cent premium,' said Mr Puleikis. Courtaulds Textiles eased 5 to 519p, Dawson firmed a penny to 148p and William Baird was flat at 262p. Smaller companies attracted keen interest with activity helped by an upbeat investment seminar at Kleinwort Benson. The Kleinwort team was especially bullish on the television stocks, which made good progress yesterday. Other stocks to respond included Bostrum, 12 higher at 202p, Microgen, which moved up 6 to 151p and Ricardo and Sidlaw, which rose 2 apiece to 192p and 328p. TSB's preliminary figures continued to trigger support for other high street banks ahead of their results season, which gets under way in February. Abbey National was a big beneficiary of straight buying and big switching that saw Lloyds heavily sold, and the shares spurted a further 13 to a peak 520p. Lloyds closed 4 off at 523p. The Hong Kong market's strong rally left HSBC 28 up at 911p. Standard Chartered put on 14 to 1168p with dealers expecting a significant profits upgrade from a top broker next week. Building stocks continued to attract big buying interest as recent strong sales figures released by the Builders Merchants Federation triggered numerous profits upgrades. RMC shares were further stimulated by improved hopes for lower German interest rates and climbed 17 to a record 1027p. Rugby was a lone weak performer in the sector, the shares slipping 4 to 319p after Kleinwort Benson took the stock off its buy list. Forte was up 13p to 283 on further consideration of the possible Ciga bid. Eurocamp rose 22p to 285 after good results. Leisure group Granada fell 11 to 551p on concern that its bid for television group LWT might prove tougher than expected. There is speculation that LWT is talking to an unnamed North American company, which might take around 30 per cent of LWT in an effort to block Granada's hostile offer. LWT shares closed 6 higher at 667p. Advertiser WPP International and newspaper Mirror Group received encouragement from SG Warburg, which once again selected the two companies as their picks in the sector in its outlook for the year. Warburg's media specialist, Ms Lorna Tilbian, said recovery in advertising spending, strong cash flows resulting in higher dividends and the growth of multi media would ensure the sector remained attractive. She said that WPP and Mirror offered above average growth prospects. WPP rose 3 to 107p while Mirror gained 1 1/2 to 187 1/2 p. Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott improved 10 to 256p making a rise of nearly 25 per cent over the week. The company has acquired control over its joint venture with Amsterdam based group GGK. Further consideration of the deal by Reuters Holdings to acquire the loss-making Quotron equity dealing business in the US sent Reuters shares up 49 to 1902p, a record high. Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham attracted heavy buying on the back of Thursday's official launch of the company's new shingles treatment and the shares jumped 17 to 424p. Meanwhile, Wellcome shares, which had suffered from the competitive threat posed by the new drug, appeared to have hit bottom and good two-way business pulled the stock back up 5 to 655p on hefty volume of 8.9m. Engineering group Clayton raced 33 ahead to 103p, after it said it was in talks that could lead to a bid. British Aerospace was among a handful of FT-SE 100 stocks that bucked the market trend with Credit Lyonnais urging investors to sell the stock. The shares retreated 9 to 424p, after analysts at the broker said 'there are fears of negative surprises at next month's results'. There were whispers that long time bull of the stock Henderson Crosthwaite had been among the day's main sellers. Nervousness about 1994 prospects brought a few surprises among stores. Encouraging Christmas figures from Argos, up 18 per cent on last year, were not enough to lift its share price, which held at 379p. Dixons, down 3 to 228p, and WH Smith, down 7 to 504p, suffered from the announcement of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the video games industry. Speculative buying of Lucas Industries saw the shares put on 4 to 209p. Total volume of 3.9m, included a block of 1m done at 210p.</p>

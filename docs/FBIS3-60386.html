The Government's radioactive waste advisers have received  urgent instructions to review alarming new estimates by  Government and independent scientists of likely worldwide deaths  from the Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria.    The move follows meetings between Environment and Health  Ministers who fear the health risks from Thorp may scupper  Government plans to approve the plant's operation within the  next few weeks.    A senior Government source said last week that the issue of  public dose levels was now regarded as `very serious' and  'potentially fatal' to the plant's future.    The effects of discharges from Thorp into the air and sea is  causing increasing concern among both the British public and  foreign governments. Last week, the Health and Safety Executive  confirmed that childhood leukemia levels 10 times the national  average found in the village of Seascale nearby could be partly  caused by radiation from Sellafield.    Environment Minister Tim Yeo last week instructed the  Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee to advise the  Government on the validity of calculation methods for radiation  doses and subsequent worldwide deaths.    The move follows the forwarding to Ministers this month of  an  alarming new report by the Government's official radiation  watchdog, the National Radiological Protection Board.    The report estimates that radiation doses afflicting the  global population from the nuclear complex will almost quadruple  after Thorp begins operating.    The new worldwide levels, which would cause around 200  deaths  for every year of Thorp's operation, are also more than three  times greater than the previous highest totals, reached in 1975.  Ministers have repeatedly stated that public radiation doses  will not be allowed to return to such levels.    These official figures are much higher than recent estimates  produced for Greenpeace by radiological expert Dr David Sumner  of Glasgow University that provoked widespread public concern.  He estimated that the first 10 years of Thorp's operation would  sow the seeds of 600 cancer deaths worldwide from Sellafield.    The protection board report partly blames the steep rise in  worldwide doses on proposed Thorp emissions of two very  long-lived cancer-causing radionuclides, iodine-129 and  krypton-85, which `circulate globally and therefore irradiate  large numbers of people.'    However, the report claims less than a quarter of future  total Sellafield doses will originate from Thorp. And it  stresses that the accuracy of its dose estimates are  `questionable' as they are based on radiation effects over  10,000 years, during which new technology may greatly reduce  risks.    Nevertheless, the protection board figures will boost  opponents' demands for a wide-ranging public inquiry before  Thorp is allowed to operate.    `However small the doses may be, people will die as a result  and it will be very hard to justify allowing the 1970s levels to  be breached,' said Dr Sumner.    Officials fear these new concerns over Thorp's health  effects  could unravel the Government's entire case for approving the  plant. Under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, every new  radioactive discharge must be justified by demonstrating that  economic gains will outweigh the damage to human health.    But the original economic justifications for Thorp have now  largely disappeared. Not only will the plutonium it will produce  be largely redundant because the new generation of fast-breeder  reactors it was meant to fuel have never been built, but foreign  customers are now expressing doubts about the plant's viability.

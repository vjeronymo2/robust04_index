			<p>BFN     [Text] Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation [ZNBC]  acting director general Mr. Dunken Mbazima has confirmed that  ZNBC is to introduce a pay channel on television. Mr. Mbazima  said he has received many queries today about the pay channel  following the announcement published in today's TIMES OF ZAMBIA  by the minister of information of broadcasting and services, Mr.  Keli Walubita. The government has already approved the project  and other formalities are now being worked out. Mr. Mbazima  said ZNBC has been strapped for cash and this venture is  expected to improve the corporation's financial standing.  Viewers who will subscribe to the channel in areas outside  Lusaka, the Copperbelt, and Livingstone transmitter coverage  range will be serviced through the cellular network.</p>

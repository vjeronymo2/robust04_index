			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 26 SAPA -- The joint working group  established to break the impasse over the allocation of  ministerial portfolios in KwaZulu/Natal began its first meeting  in Durban on Thursday. "We are here to look for solutions,  otherwise I wouldn't be here," said the leader of the African  National Congress delegation Jacob Zuma.    He declined to pre-empt the meeting's outcome, saying it was  merely one of many possible meetings, and that it might take  some time before a final solution was reached.    The joint working group was established on Tuesday by  KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose to resolve outstanding  differences in the provincial legislature.    Disputes surfaced last week over the allocation of  ministerial portfolios to the three ANC MECs [member Executive  Committee], S'bu Ndebele, Zweli Mkhize and Mr Zuma.    The re-allocation of portfolios is believed to be the main  issue on the agenda.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Oil exporters study western energy taxes OIL exporters are considering practical measures to counter US and European moves to impose energy taxes, including the possibility of an oil export tax, Gulf sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. Foreign ministers of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) will consider the western taxes in a meeting on April 4. The taxes will also be high on the agenda of an April 13 meeting in Oman between Opec and non-Opec oil ministers, the sources said. Analysts believe a co-ordinated response would be difficult to achieve and the GCC, composed of pro-western countries, does not want to trigger a trade war. 'They are not in a position to take strong counter-measures that could escalate a trade war or confrontation with their major trading partners,' said a Gulf Arab official source.</p>

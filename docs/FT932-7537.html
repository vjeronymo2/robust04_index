			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Travel Focus (Touring Europe): Slow up, and drink at the journey's end - How to take the wrinkles out of a touring holiday in Europe FOR MOST people, touring in Europe starts with driving in France because that is where all the best ferry routes go to. In fact, one doesn't really need to go further than France because it is a super country to tour provided you remember a few simple rules. The first is to use the autoroute only for getting to the area where you are going to enjoy your driving as well as the scenery, food and drink. Compared with British motorways, French autoroutes - except for the main north-south A1-A6 - are usually so uncrowded you wonder where all the other cars have gone. It may have something to do with the tolls. They are not cheap, and the network of N and D roads (roughly equivalent to Britain's A and D roads) are an agreeable slower alternative. Paying tolls to use a motorway comes as a shock to many British drivers accustomed only to the moderate charge made for using the Severn bridge or Dartford tunnel. But most of Europe, except for the Low Countries and Germany, has toll motorways. Switzerland imposes a one-off autoroute charge at the frontier; Germany plans to do so next year. Make the most of them while they are free. The French autoroute restaurants are good. Try one of the l'Arche chain, but not if several tourist coaches have just decanted their hungry hordes. A thick, steaming slice of baked ham with Madeira sauce and a choice of vegetables in a l'Arche will keep the wolf from the door for hours. With a bottle of Badoit and coffee, it costs about Pounds 8. And an agreeable four-course luncheon with a little wine and waiter service at a French autoroute restaurant near Bourg-en-Bresse a few weeks ago cost under Pounds 12. A word about drink. The French take a relaxed view about having a glass or two (not more) of wine and then continuing your autoroute journey, although you cannot have an alcoholic drink at all unless you have a hot meal. But do not even think about going over the top. The penalties for drink driving all over Europe are, quite properly, at least as severe as they are in Britain. Anyway, the best time for serious eating and drinking is at the end of the day, not in the middle of it. Germany's autobahnen are still free of a speed limit though a 130 kph (81 mph) maximum is recommended. That is the legal limit on French autoroutes. It is lower in other European countries - as low as 90 kph in Norway. Do not be tempted by a lightly-trafficked motorway (unless it be an autobahn) to put your foot down and see what the car will do. Getting nicked for speeding in Europe is more expensive than in Britain and can be time consuming. In France the drill, according to people who have been caught, goes like this. You are radar-ed, stopped, automatically breathalysed and then taken to one of those police vans that look like corrugated iron chicken houses. You are questioned at length ('and where was your maternal grandmother born, monsieur?') by a policeman who bangs it all down slowly with two fingers on an antique typewriter. This takes at least half-an-hour, more if you are one of several offenders. Then you are relieved of anything up to Pounds 100 in cash. Credit cards will not do nicely for French speeding penalties, though they will for autoroute tolls and virtually everything else in France. If you are going to speed, keep a wad of money under the carpet. You will need it. Should you be speeding on a continental motorway or normal road and drivers coming toward you flash their lights, lift your foot off the pedal at once. There are police about. Off the motorways, most speed traps are where you enter or leave towns and villages or on narrow, straight country roads. But why speed at all? You are on a touring holiday. Slow down. The idea is for you and your passengers to have a nice, relaxing time. Germany built its first autobahns before the first world war, and some are still in use, like the awful two-lane stretch going east from Aachen toward Cologne. It became so crowded that a 100 kph limit was imposed. Some of Italy's oldest autostrade are not much better. Now, more than 30 years on, almost the only popular touring area in France without an autoroute pointing at its heart is the Dordogne. And, unless you are heading for Paris, you no longer have to face its dreaded boulevard peripherique. This mini-M25 is inhabited by demented drivers and even madder motor-cyclists. Avoid it by going east from Calais - the best point of entry from the UK by P&amp;O or Stena Sealink super-ferry from Dover - on the A26 autoroute. Starting at Calais docks, the A26 opens the door to eastern and southern France and beyond. At Reims, an easy two-and-a-half hours from Calais, you can continue to Metz and southern Germany or head south for Troyes and Dijon. From Macon (about an hour further on from Dijon) there are autoroute branches to Geneva and Italy. Continue south from Macon and you by-pass Lyon en route for the Mediterranean coast. For a great touring holiday, there is no need to go further than France It is a big and thinly populated country in which you can find every kind of scenery as well as the best in wines and food. Leave the main N-roads and follow the D-roads - the most important ones are marked in yellow, the lesser ones in white - in Michelin's invaluable large-scale motoring atlas of France. You will have the freedom of a countryside little touched by time, where the villages are not filling up with retired townies making trouble with the locals about their cocks crowing, cows lowing and pigs smelling. Where to stay? I would not think of leaving home for France without my Michelin Red Guide, which is worth its Pounds 12.50 for the town plans, let alone the restaurants and hotels. Michelin is for referring to, while French Leave Encore by Richard Binns (Pounds 9.99) is good bedside reading - an idiosyncratic treatise on the habits, food, drink and sights of rural France as well as a useful source of places in which to stay and eat. A final thought. A car that packs up on the other side of the Channel can make one feel totally helpless. If yours is coming up for a service, get it done before you go. Remember that an insurance Green Card is still needed for full accident cover. Think, too, about subscribing to a breakdown recovery scheme like those run by the AA and RAC, Mondial, Europ-Assistance and similar organisations with English-speaking helplines. It is much easier than trying to explain to a garageman in fractured French or non-existent German that you heard this funny noise and suddenly the car would not go any more.</p>

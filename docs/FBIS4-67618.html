			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gloria Santos: "Authorities Acknowledge </F> Meningitis Epidemic"]    [Text] Health authorities admitted yesterday that  meningococcal meningitis has become epidemic in Rio de Janeiro  State, and they are now talking to the Ministry of Health about  importing Cuban vaccine for a mass immunization drive during the  early months of 1994. According to the experts, Rio de Janeiro  is the municipality where the situation is most disturbing, but  the state's superintendent of community health, Jorge Mixo, is  now studying the need for immunization in other municipalities  in the Rio de Janeiro Lowlands, where there is also a high  incidence of the disease.    The conclusion that an epidemic exists was presented to the  Ministry of Health at a meeting the day before yesterday in the  afternoon, at which time the state's figures since 1990 were  analyzed. This week the state is going to provide an emergency  budget of 6 million cruzeiros, without going through the bidding  process, to reequip the laboratory at the Sao Sebastiao Hospital  in Caju, which is responsible for the tests that classify the  disease by type. Next Monday the Municipal Secretariat of Health  will provide the ministry with a review of the incidence of the  disease this year [1993] and recommend that immunization be  extended to adults up to 20 years of age.    Mary Baran, the municipality's coordinator of epidemiology,  says that although the disease is more prevalent among children,  it is necessary to immunize adults so as to "break the chain of  infection," since the bacterium is harbored in the throats of  from 10 to 15 percent of the population. The two secretariats  have not yet decided how many doses must be imported, but the  experts already know that the 5 million doses ordered by the  Ministry of Health from Cuba (that being the remaining amount in  a contract signed in 1990) will only be enough to immunize the  municipality of Rio de Janeiro.  <H5>  Situation Worse This Year </H5>   From January through 24 November 1993, 2,209 cases of  meningitis and 499 deaths were recorded in Rio de Janeiro State.  Of that total, 725 individuals (32.5 percent) had meningococcal  meningitis and 148 of those (29.6 percent) died. That situation  exceeds the maximum limits as estimated at least four years ago  -- the average had been 800 cases since 1990. But according to  experts, the situation has been disturbing since 1986, when a  significant increase in cases of type B meningococcal meningitis  began showing up. In the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, the  situation is more serious this year because of the lightning  speed with which the disease has been developing, according to  Mary Baran, an epidemiologist in the municipal secretariat.    "The disease has been developing at lightning speed. Whereas  we used to have up to 72 hours in which to treat the patient and  prevent aftereffects, people this year have been dying within 24  hours," Mary says. The experts cannot yet explain the reason for  that phenomenon. No cases were recorded in the municipality  yesterday. Jorge Mixo, state superintendent of community health,  acknowledged that the secretariat was having difficulty  monitoring the state because the municipal secretariats were not  sending in data daily.    Jorge also announced that he had sent a circular to the 82  municipalities asking for a situation report on an urgent basis  so as to be able to evaluate the need for immunization and the  target population and order the doses from the Ministry of  Health. The vaccine must be administered in two doses to ensure  immunization.  <H5>  Cremerj Private Clinics Charged With Selling Vaccines </H5>   The Rio de Janeiro Regional Council of Medicine (Cremerj)  has  begun an investigation into charges that private clinics are  selling Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines that have expired  and storing the medicine improperly. The investigation will also  determine who is responsible for publication in the newspapers  last week of an advertisement which, according to council  director Abdu Kexfe, is confusing the public regarding the type  of meningitis vaccine available in the clinics.    Yesterday Cremerj notified clinic owners and sales  representatives for the vaccine against the type of meningitis  caused by the Haemophilus influenza type B bacterium to make  depositions on the 8th. The council is publishing in today's  newspapers a notice explaining the types of meningitis and the  available vaccines. In surprise inspections conducted by the  Noel Nutels Laboratory on Monday, irregularities were found in  two clinics.    The Urgil immunization clinic in Lagoa was ordered closed,  and Climuno in Copacabana will have to prove that it was  authorized to import the vaccine and that conditions in the  clinic are sterile. At Urgil, vaccines that had expired were  found, and the medicine was not being stored properly.  <H5>  Controversial Experiment </H5>   The Cuban vaccine against type B and type C meningococcal  meningitis is the only one in the world with effectiveness  levels exceeding 75 percent. Even so, use of the vaccine in  Brazil has caused divided opinions among experts in the public  health field. It was tested in our country for the first time in  1989, when there was an outbreak of the disease in Sao Paulo and  2 million children were immunized. Studies of the immunizing  capability of the medicine were started after that, with the  vaccine being tested in seven states: Espirito Santo, Minas  Gerais, Santa Catarina, Parana, Sergipe, Amapa, and Rio de  Janeiro.    There is disagreement among the institutions that analyzed  those studies. Whereas the Brazil-Cuba Commission concluded that  the estimated effectiveness was 82 percent for all types of  meningococci and 79 percent in the case of type B, other  institutions questioned the vaccine's immunizing capability. One  member of the commission, physician Eduardo Azeredo Costa,  explains that the controversy arose because of the different  conditions under which each state used the vaccine.</p>

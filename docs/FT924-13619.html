			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Letter: An unequal VAT advantage Sir, From January 1 1993 a VAT-registered trader who purchases goods from a company registered for VAT in France or elsewhere in the EC need no longer pay the value added tax on importation. This tax will now be called acquisition tax and will be declared on his next VAT return and instantly cancelled by deducting it as input tax. However, if he purchases the same goods from a UK company in, say, Birmingham he will continue to have to pay the input value added tax on his supplier's invoices and claim it back later, thus suffering a cash-flow disadvantage. The prime minister in his speech to the party conference expressed determination to hack through the jungle of red tape. Might I suggest that he commences by levelling the commercial playing field with the rest of Europe and allow VAT-registered traders to zero-rate supplies to other VAT-registered traders in the UK. Robert Howes, 7 Claremont, 16 St Johns Avenue, London SW15 2AB</p>

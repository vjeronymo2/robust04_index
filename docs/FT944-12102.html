			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Market to get one's teeth into - Taiwan's Gatt quest puts betel-nuts on agenda Taiwan's quest to become a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has invited demands by its trading partners that it first open its relatively closed economy to more cars, beef, fruit, fish and, of course, rice. No one has yet mentioned betel-nuts. Yet Taiwan's market for this mild stimulant, chewed in many countries throughout east and south-east Asia, is believed to be worth more than that for rice. And as with rice, imports are banned. Indeed, the Taiwanese appetite for betel-nut has led to environmental, health and even criminal problems in small, crowded Taiwan as farmers across much of the island have converted paddy fields into betel-palm groves. Of 21m Taiwanese, some 2.5m chew the nut, whose total street value is estimated at USDollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year. 'It's much more profitable than rice, and cheap and easy to grow - no hard work, no fertiliser,' says Mr Antonio Chiang, publisher of The Journalist, Taiwan's leading weekly political magazine. It was Mr Chiang who coined the now widely used appellation 'Taiwanese chewing gum' for the much-maligned betel-nut, called binglang in Chinese, some 10 years ago. His family grows betel-nut in their paddy fields near Taichung in central Taiwan. 'If you drive a truck, you must chew binglang. . . the only alternative is amphetamines,' says Mr Chiang. 'But binglang is much better, because amphetamines are stronger and addictive.' The market for betel-nut has grown in the last decade and now rivals rice, which has declined in importance, as Taiwan's biggest cash crop. In 1993, the total value of betel-nut production sold by farmers was TDollars 10.3bn (Dollars 396m), compared with TDollars 40.5bn for rice, according to official figures. But officials concede that those figures may be misleading, not only because it is difficult to monitor betel plantings. 'If you take the farm price, then rice is a bigger market. But the street value of betel-nuts is much higher than rice because of the huge mark-up,' says Mr Tai Teh-fang, a researcher in the economics and planning department of the agriculture ministry. Betel-nut chewing has become increasingly popular in recent years, in part due to rising income but also because it is seen as an emblem of ethnic Taiwanese consciousness. Chinese who came to the island from mainland China in 1949 as a rule do not chew. Mr Wu Hui-lung, chief of the soil conservation division in Taiwan's agriculture ministry, says: 'Because the price of betel-nut is getting higher and higher, farmers are now illegally cutting down forest to grow betel-palms. On the flat land there is no problem, but in the mountain areas it is causing severe erosion and problems for water conservation.' Officials say farmers could earn at least USDollars 25,000 a hectare each year from betel-palm plantings, far more than USDollars 2,000 a hectare for rice. 'Those betel-nut farmers are very rich,' says Mr Tai from the agriculture ministry. 'Some of them even drive Mercedes-Benzes.' The country's health authorities are concerned about the medical effects of betel chewing which include a high incidence of oral cancer. The government is also worried about gangster control of the wholesale industry, smuggling and road-side betel-nut stands that have proliferated across the island. Mr Wu says the ministry is studying the possibility of legalising betel-nut imports to reduce the economic benefit to farmers in the hopes of stemming cultivation, but no decision has yet been made. Such imports have been banned by the ruling Nationalist government for more than four decades but in recent years smuggling from Thailand, the Philippines and China has become rampant. Mr Lan Min-chuan, a trade specialist in the agriculture ministry's economics and planning department, says that in any case Taiwan would be obliged to open its market to imports of all agricultural products once the island signs up to Gatt. 'The market will not be opened all at once to imports, but when it is we will definitely impose an import duty,' he says.</p>

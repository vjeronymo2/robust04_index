			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bremen in talks to find buyer for Klockner-Werke steel mill BREMEN, the German city-state, yesterday confirmed it was holding talks with domestic and international steel companies in an attempt to find a buyer for the integrated steel mill of Klockner-Werke, the ailing German steel group. Mr Claus Jager, the state economics minister, said that Sidma, a subsidiary of the Arbed steelmaker in Luxembourg, was among those in the discussions. The talks form part of the state's strategy to fend off a rival offer made by Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steelmakers. The state, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in Germany, is concerned about he future of the 4,600 jobs at the Klockner-Werke plant. It says the Thyssen's proposal would only keep 1,000 employees. Thyssen yesterday said it had no intention of closing down any part of the mill. It said it was only interested in buying the cold-rolling mill and not the whole integrated mill. Mr Jager said Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch wanted to acquire the Klockner-Werke plant to partially close it and eliminate a competitor in the German steel market. 'We are instead trying to find a solution with other companies who know the steel market.' Sidma, which is 67 per cent owned by Arbed, said that it had an interest in the future of Klockner-Werke's plant because of its co-operation with the German group in Belgium. Klockner-Werke owns 25 per cent of Allegheny Ludlum Corporation (ALZ), a subsidiary of Sidma in Gent which produces stainless steel. It also has a 30 per cent stake in Sikel, a subsidiary producing metal sheets for household goods. Sidma said: 'We are investigating the possibility of some co-operation between Sidma and Klockner-Werke. But it is too early to say what form this co-operation will take.' In Luxembourg, Arbed yesterday denied any intention to acquire a stake in the Klockner-Werke steel plant. It confirmed that talks were taking place, but stressed that they had focused mostly on the future of the German group's joint ventures in Belgium. Klockner-Werke's shares on the Frankfurt stock market rose to a 1993 high, up DM7 at DM91.50. Traders said the rise was fuelled by speculation that Bremen may put in a bid for the plant on behalf of an industry consortium. Mr Jager said that the Bremen state would rather avoid taking a stake in the steel plant and was seeking private investors.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Russia's backyard AS THE political and economic situation in Russia worsens, the responses of President Boris Yeltsin grow more unpredictable. Already struggling to maintain his political authority at home, he has now touched off alarm bells abroad with careless talk concerning Russia's role in its immediate neighbourhood. In a speech to the centrist Civic Union grouping on Sunday, Mr Yeltsin said that given its 'heartfelt interest' in suppressing conflicts around its borders, Russia should be granted 'special powers' by the United Nations to act as guarantor of peace and stability in the former Soviet Union. It is not clear whether even Mr Yeltsin knows what precisely he has in mind. But if - as Russia's wary neighbours and former subjects were bound to suspect - he is demanding some sort of international carte blanche to intervene beyond his country's borders, either in defence of Russian interests or in the more general cause of containing instability, he deserves a dusty response from the west. If he is attempting to appease hardliners in his armed forces by promising them a new extra-territorial role, then he is playing a dangerous game which, far from creating a 'belt of good-neighbourly, friendly states' around Russia as he says he wants, could merely fan the flames of conflict. Russia undoubtedly has an overriding interest in preventing the spread of conflict to its south and west: its troops are already in combat in Georgia and Tajikistan, and keeping a fragile peace in Moldova; refugees from these wars represent a further burden on its resources; and fissiparous tendencies abroad could easily infect the Russian federation itself. It also has reasons for concern about the internal arrangements of some of its peers in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Some 25m ethnic Russians live in other parts of the former Soviet Union, and in some cases - Latvia, Kazakhstan and eastern Ukraine - they constitute nearly half the population. Such communities are a target for anti-Russian sentiment at a time when relations between governments are coming under increasing strain over energy prices, currency links and trade. In Latvia and Estonia, discrimination against Russian minorities represents a flash-point waiting to ignite. But to acknowledge such interests is one thing; to give Russia a free hand in dealing with them unilaterally quite another. In some of the conflicts on its borders, Russia could conceivably play a useful mediating role. But in many of them, its status as honest broker is not undisputed - and is likely to be further tarnished if it arrogates to itself an open-ended right to intervene in other sovereign states. The west should tell Russia that it can only hope to resolve such disputes, and take its place in the community of civilised nations, by playing the fullest role in the international body set up to deal with them, the UN. Attempts to bypass that machinery will only make matters worse.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTH COAST;  </P> <P> STATE QUARANTINE ON MUSSELS ENDS  </P> <P> The state Department of Health Services has announced an end to the quarantine  on mussels from the California coastline between the Oregon state line and  Bodega Head in Sonoma County. The state's annual quarantine on the  sport-harvesting of mussels typically runs from May through October. But it was  extended this year in the North Coast because samples revealed high levels of a  toxin which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Two non-fatal illnesses  from mussels were reported in September in southern Mendocino County.  </P></p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Installations up again: FT Satellite Monitor MORE THAN 1m homes have acquired satellite television in the past year bringing the total for those able to receive multi-channel television to just over 3m according to the FT Satellite Monitor. It estimates that 73,000 satellite TV systems were sold or rented last month compared with 58,000 in July. Sales and rentals in August last year ran at about 12,000 a week. There are 2.54m homes in the UK in which a satellite dish is owned or rented according to the monitor. Moreover, Independent Television Commission figures show satellite channels are received in 552,000 homes through cable networks and communal aerials. Since 1989 satellite availability has grown from one in 50 homes to one in seven. The increase in sales last month is likely to have been linked with an offer on Sky Sports which has exclusive rights to Premier League football games and which has become a subscription channel. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake in British Sky Broadcasting, which shows Sky television channels.</p>

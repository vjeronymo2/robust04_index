On Tuesday the court dropped criminal charges against the  defendants following the Duma-proclaimed amnesty.    "The prosecution believes that the court decision  contradicts  the criminal-procedural code of the Russian Federation,  according to which any court investigation which is underway  should be carried out to the end and a guilty or non-guilty  verdict passed", the office of the prosecutor general said in a  statement received by TASS on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 18 April "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- "BSP Wants More Than  Half of Ministries for Itself" (OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK), "BSP  Expects Prime Minister To Make Personnel and Structural Changes"  (DUMA), "Communists Give Week to Prime Minister Berov"  (DEMOKRATSIYA), "BSP Gives Prime Minister Berov 7 Days To  Overhaul Cabinet" (24 CHASA), "Socialists Demand From Prime  Minister Berov Scapegoats for Corridor" (TRUD) -- these are  samples of the headlines capping reports on yesterday's  extraordinary sitting of the former Communists' Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP) Executive Bureau.    The Socialists gave Prime Minister Berov a week's time to  make his proposals for structural and personnel changes in the  cabinet, BSP's DUMA daily says. This is the deadline given the  principled differences displayed and unpopular action taken by  the cabinet during the prime minister's sick leave, this daily  goes on to say quoting BSP spokesman Nikolay Kamov. Yesterday's  conference was "another reminder that what the Socialists look  for is more pragmatism and a stronger political instinct", DUMA  says in a signed commentary. The demand for replacing 70  percent of the ministers comes to show that the Socialists are  well aware of the incumbent cabinet's inefficiency, the private  OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK says commenting on this matter. "Even the  unprejudiced can now see that the Socialists played a political  action about the convoy issue (the request for transit of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]-bound UN  equipment via Bulgaria,)" reads a signed commentary in this  daily. "The Socialists are now about to play their trump-card  and push Prime Minister Berov to the wall where he should either  accept the condition for cabinet changes or step down," the  commentary goes.    A protest rally yesterday in Sofia burned Uncle Sam's  top-hat  taken as a symbol of the U.S. foreign policy, DUMA reports.  Several hundred people chanted "Peace in the Balkans!" and  "Yankees out!" in protest against the cabinet and parliament's  decisions to grant a Bulgarian corridor for UN military  equipment and against the Balkan policy of the United States,  NATO and the United Nations. "BSP once again showed that the  national concern is nothing but a mask covering its commitment  to Moscow and to Moscow's servants in Belgrade," DEMOKRATSIYA  says commenting on the BSP leaders' decision to demand that the  cabinet make detailed account for its decision to endorse the  transit of UN equipment and that President Zhelyu Zhelev offer  an explanation for his failure to inform the Consultative  Council on National Security about the UN request. After the  attempt at ruling this country without a cabinet, the only way  out for Bulgaria is the salvage policy of the Union of the  Democratic Forces (SDS), this commentary says further. A story  on this matter in STANDART NEWS quotes Defence Minister Valentin  Aleksandrov as saying "a greater number of blue helmets in  Macedonia gives more guarantees for Bulgaria's security". The  dissent on the transit seriously damaged confidence within the  cabinet and the parties of the parliamentary majority, TRUD  says. BSP's demands were coordinated with other parliamentary  factions, this daily says quoting the BSP spokesman. [passage  omitted]</p>

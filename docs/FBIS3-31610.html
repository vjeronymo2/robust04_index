			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by FYROM President Kiro Gligorov reprinted from </F> STUDENTSKI ZBOR; place and date not given: "No Solution Without  the Word `Macedonia'"]    [Text] The negotiations can be resumed in a wider  framework that can lead to an agreement encompassing all the  questions, not only those we are now concentrated on -- the  name, the flag, and so on -- which are charged with negative  emotions in advance. In that agreement, we must take reality  into account, which means we must reach a lasting solution for  all problems connected to our economic, political, cultural, and  other links. We must not concentrate only on those matters that  are now seen as problems, and thus exclude far more essential  questions. That is why we followed an example that seems the  most acceptable in this situation; the agreement between Poland  and Germany, solving all the questions between these two  countries that have had great disputes throughout history. All  of a sudden, different relations were created between these two  countries, which is a good example of how Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece should solve  the outstanding questions. Regarding the name, the Republic of  Macedonia is the most suitable solution and is not only in our  interests, but also in the interests of Greece. Here are the  reasons for that: If our neighbor cools its emotions and starts  thinking more realistically, it will see that all the other  solutions proposed so far were deemed unsuitable by the  negotiators, and therefore they were not accepted. The name  "Northern Macedonia" was launched. Later, they said it was not  adequate because it implied other situations leading to a desire  for unification. "Vardar Macedonia" was the hit name for some  time. Nevertheless, they dropped it because the Vardar River  flows through Salonika. The name "Slav Macedonia" was very  attractive to the Greek side. However, we were categorically  against it because we have to take into account all the citizens  of this country. The citizens must feel the country is their  own. That is one aspect we have not discussed very much --  stability and a better future for this republic. After a number  of proposals, I think our arguments are now being taken into  consideration, and they are of a very simple nature. After it  became clear in Edinburgh that there can be no solution without  the word Macedonia, and yet a suffix is needed, the best suffix  to our name is Republic, because Republic Macedonia is a legal  and state entity and, as such, has its constitution and borders  defined precisely by the constitution, which makes a clear  distinction between the geographic name Macedonia and Republic  Macedonia as a state. Any other solution will imply certain  suspicions. The question of the flag and some other questions  are matters that we are ready to debate. It is impossible to  look for an outcome of this situation without open dialogue,  which must normally be based on the force of argument. There  will be no outcome if one side or the other imposes selective  solutions. That is why we see the solution in a broader  discussion that will provide prosperity to our relations. After  all the events that have taken place in the north, it is now the  moment to look at these matters with open eyes, with a defined  vision in looking for a solution to the problems, without  entrenching ourselves in our Balkan positions, which could make  the lives of this and future generations uncertain.</p>

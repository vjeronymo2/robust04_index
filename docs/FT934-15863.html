			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Independent raises prices and expands in face of Times cut NEWSPAPER Publishing, owners of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday yesterday took the decision to raise its prices in the face of the price-cutting campaign by The Times. The Independent on Sunday, which is being expanded tomorrow to a four-section paper with colour, will raise its price from 90p to Pounds 1. From Tuesday the daily paper, which will move to two sections with colour, will go from 45p to 50p making it 20p more than The Times. Mr Patrick Morrissey, the new chief executive of Newspaper Publishing, said that readers were being offered considerable added value. 'We believe our readers will recognise this and will be prepared to pay a realistic price for continuing improvement in quality and the continuing independence of their newspapers,' he said. The Times' 15p price cut has added around 100,000 copies to the previous total of around 360,000. The official circulation figures for the six months to August show The Independent at 339,602 and The Independent on Sunday at 373,427. The Newspaper Publishing strategy, complete with price rise, seems to be to try to occupy the slot at the top of the general broadsheet market that it believes is being vacated by The Times. All efforts at Newspaper Publishing will now be concentrated on the re-launch and a major marketing exercise to try to increase circulation. A planned re-financing, possibly with the introduction of a new shareholder has in effect been postponed until early next year. The pressure has been eased because The Independent's circulation has apparently not been hit by The Times. The Independent's sales are slightly up although not by as much as normal in the autumn. Mr Morrissey, who joined the company at the beginning of this month, wants to see how the business performs this autumn. There is even a hope that, if the re-launch is a success, significant re-financing can be delayed for some time - as long as the government does not decide to impose value added tax on newspapers in next month's Budget.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING TIES THAT BIND;  </P> <P> GANGS: FOUR FORMER MEMBERS RECALL THE DIFFICULTIES THEY OVERCAME IN GETTING  AWAY TO START NEW AND INDEPENDENT LIVES.  </P> <P> Why do young men and women join groups of apparently aimless, often angry and  violent neighborhood youths? Because for many, the penalty for not becoming a  "homeboy" or "homegirl" can mean anything from ostracism to death. And it is  not an alliance one simply walks away from when one has had enough. The bonds  are often blood bonds and such disloyalty is often considered the greatest sin.  </P> <P>  The consequences of this passion can be tragic. There were more homicides in  Orange County that were attributed to gangs by May of this year than in all of  1989.  </P> <P>  But it is possible to leave that frightful world and succeed, sometimes  grandly. Here are four people who have done it:  </P> <P>  When 33-year-old Gus Frias goes to visit the friends of his youth, he knows  exactly where to find them -- close together on the same Montebello hillside,  their likenesses, etched in gray marble, staring up at him from their  gravestones.  </P> <P> There's Miguel Garcia, the leader of the old neighborhood who saved his life  several times, and the brothers Ronnie and Bobby Figueroa, and Frias' best  friend of all, Paul Guerrero.  </P> <P> They were victims of what Frias calls "the madness," the deadly cycle of  internecine warfare in the gritty East Los Angeles barrio of Maravilla. They  weren't gangsters, says Frias. They hadn't banded together with criminal  intentions. They became an identifiable group because they came from the same  barrio and they were engulfed by ancient blood feuds between rival families and  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "It's like a fraternity," he says. "Fraternities at universities are formed for  the purpose of giving support, guidance, identity to every single brother and  when a brother needs something, you have all these other brothers who come to  the rescue. In the barrio, it's the same thing, but it's taken a step further  in that all of us are willing to give our lives for each other."  </P> <P> And, he says, you never truly stop being a homeboy, even if you get a pair of  degrees from USC, even if you become a cop or an author, even if you become a  teacher or a community activist. Even if you become a national finalist for a  White House Fellowship.  </P> <P> Frias has done all that. Today he is the manager of Operation Safe Schools, a  program against drugs and gangs that is affiliated with the Orange County  Department of Education. He also teaches a course at UC Irvine intended to  instruct educators about gangs.  </P> <P> He also used to pack a gun to school and became known as an "arsenal man" in  his barrio, one who always knew how to obtain weapons. He was a homeboy, he  says, because he had to be, because it was the only way to survive.  </P> <P> "You live in those projects," he says, "and automatically you have to learn to  survive. You're bred to believe that you're not going to become a victim. If  that meant packing a gun to school, so be it."  </P> <P> He never shot anyone. Instead, he says, he became more and more horrified as,  one by one, his friends were cut down around him.  </P> <P> His family, he says, had instilled strong positive values in him, but when his  best friend was shot to death during Frias' junior year in high school, he  began to look for a way out.  </P> <P> "The majority of my friends were killed," he says, "and that was enough to make  me think. I was losing my childhood friends to the madness."  </P> <P> Also, one of his teachers at Garfield High School convinced him that he had the  potential to go on to college. He became the school's student body president  and later was accepted not only at USC, but at Harvard and Stanford. He chose  USC, where he was offered work-study scholarships and fellowships, because it  was close to his barrio.  </P> <P> He made high grades at USC, where he found the academic challenge did not  compare to the challenge of growing up as an "arsenal man" in the barrio.  </P> <P> "What were the consequences for failing at USC, a letter grade of F?" he said.  "The consequence for failing in the barrio was death."  </P> <P> With his bachelor's degree in political science and his master's degree in  public administration, he took jobs first as a special assistant to the West  Covina chief of police and later as an area adjutant in the Hollywood division  of the Los Angeles Police Department. He expects that his current job with the  Orange County Department of Education will not satisfy him forever. He says he  wants to be elected to national public office someday.  </P> <P> "I'm a dreamer," says Frias, "and a person who dreams, fights like hell for the  rest of his life to achieve them. I think the best of me is yet to come."  </P> <P> Still, his past occasionally dogs him. Shortly after he completed his  autobiographical book, "Barrio Warriors," in the early 1980s, he says he was  threatened with death by veteranos -- Maravilla locals whom Frias called "adult  thugs who perpetuate the self-destruction" -- because he had heaped scorn on  them, and they felt he had made public "things that were considered secret,  part of the nether world."  </P> <P> Shots have been fired at his car and his house, he says, and two years ago, on  his way to make a presentation at a school, he was struck by a car in front of  his house in what he says was a deliberate attempt on his life. He spent 36  hours in intensive care as a result.  </P> <P> "It comes with the territory," he says.  </P> <P> Frias says such events have not slowed him. He continues to move forward, but  always takes the time to look back, to visit his many friends who lie in  Resurrection Cemetery, to remember that he is still a homeboy.  </P> <P> "The cemetery tends to remind us a lot of what life is about," he says, looking  around the hill. "We're here temporarily. We have to learn how to live and  survive, to make the best of our days, to help our brothers and sisters who are  lost and confused. I wish I could do more."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DOROTHY CASTILLO  </P> <P> She started out as the kid who was different. She was the one the neighborhood  girls taunted, insulted, beat up almost daily.  </P> <P> She didn't become one of them because she didn't like what she saw, didn't like  the hard-edged world of the girls in the gang jackets with the beehive hair and  false eyelashes and double layers of white eye shadow who hung out on the  corner at night and cruised the streets with their boyfriends in the  hardscrabble Fullerton barrio known as Fullerton Toker's Town, or FTT.  </P> <P> But in junior high school, you can only take so much of being ostracized, only  suffer so many beatings. So, when she was 12 years old, Dorothy Castillo gave  in and joined a group of girls who called themselves the Emeralds.  </P> <P> "I had unbelievable peer pressure," says Castillo, now 36, a college student  and a field representative for the Women in Community Services Job Corps, which  is federally funded through the Department of Labor and provides free job  training for the economically disadvantaged. "It's so intense that it actually  changes your whole life. The kids follow you to school, they make fun of you,  they push you when you're walking, they call you names. And they don't just get  to you, they get to your family, your sisters, your brothers.  </P> <P> "It's like you don't even know you're in class sometimes because you're so  worried about what they're going to do to you next. And when you live in their  area, it makes it worse. You have to claim that area or else."  </P> <P> But when she put on the jacket and met the gang on the corner at night (she  often had to sneak out of her parents' house to do it), everything changed. She  had shown her solidarity with her neighbors, with her barrio.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, her supervision at home was minimal. Her father worked days, her  mother nights. She cut classes often to hang out with her friends. Her grades  plummeted.  </P> <P> But during her last two years of high school, Castillo grew apart from the  Emeralds and disassociated herself with the group. And she suddenly became  worse than invisible. She was not only shunned completely by her former  friends, as well as by a second, similar group of girls (who once again began  jeering and beating her regularly), but no one at the entire school would speak  to her.  </P> <P> Her isolation ended -- and, she realizes now, her life's direction began to  shift -- near the end of her high school years in 1971, when she got into a  fight with a girl who had insulted her family. The police broke up the fight  and took her home to face her parents. It was, she says, the first time her  parents had any idea she had been involved with gang members.  </P> <P> But, she says, "it was the first time I got recognition. I'd shown that I  wasn't going to take anything anymore and I started getting respect. These kids  can torment you to the point where you just explode."  </P> <P> Still, when the opportunity to escape the barrio came, in the form of a  marriage proposal from a Marine stationed at El Toro (where she worked in food  service), she took it and moved to Anaheim. She had a daughter and a son, but  the marriage failed after five years. She and the children moved back with her  parents in FTT.  </P> <P> She was older, wiser and tougher, however, and decided to go back to school at  Fullerton College. She took classes in criminal justice and got As.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," she says. "I couldn't believe I was intelligent. I  never thought I could do it before."  </P> <P> She married a second time, and had another daughter, but after two years that  marriage also failed.  </P> <P> She took a job counseling with the now-defunct Turning Point Gang Project in  Orange County and decided to make a career in the field of human services, in  particular counseling the parents of present or potential gang members. She is  working toward her degree in human services at Rancho Santiago College.  </P> <P> In recent years, Castillo has seen family history repeat itself. Her oldest  daughter, now 16, had felt the relentless pressure to ally herself with  Fullerton gang life since she was a child. The fact that her mother was  counseling gangs in Anaheim, considered by several Fullerton gang members to be  disloyal to her home barrio, only caused the insults and beatings to increase,  and the Castillo house was the target of incessant harassing and threatening  phone calls. And Castillo's daughter, in her early teens, began to take on the  mantle of local gang members.  </P> <P> Castillo and her children have since moved to western Orange County and severed  ties with the gangs. She makes a point of spending time with her children and  knowing about their activities and friends and, through her job, wants to make  sure that other parents do the same.  </P> <P> "I felt what I had to go through was something that I had to learn in order to  help people now," she says. "If I can beat what I went through, and what my  daughter went through, I can help other parents."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMADOR CORONA  </P> <P> Sitting in his Santa Ana law office, Amador Corona can't help thinking of the  film "Stand and Deliver" when he recalls his high school years in the early  1970s.  </P> <P> Corona had allied himself with a gang (the members thought of it as a club)  called Thee Uniters in the west Santa Ana barrio known as Silver Acres. He  partied with them on weekends, cruised in their cars, wore their colors, drank  with them in local parks.  </P> <P> But he had always made good grades in school, and his gang status didn't change  that.  </P> <P> "One thing that I was fortunate about," says Corona, 35, who practices criminal  and personal injury law and has a second office in Corona, "was that school was  easy for me all along. Even though I was in a gang, I was still getting As. I  was taking college prep courses with this club jacket on and that looked  unusual to a lot of teachers. They'd say, 'Are you sure you're supposed to be  in this class?' The jacket implied something to them that was generally  negative. They thought I belonged in wood shop or something like that."  </P> <P> But, like the intelligent but overlooked high school students in "Stand and  Deliver," Corona belonged on the honor roll. Officials at UC Irvine thought so  too, and accepted him as an undergraduate biology student.  </P> <P> This was all but unheard of in his circle of friends.  </P> <P> "There was a cross section of guys," Corona says. "You had the ones who were  the tough guys always looking for trouble, then you had the other guys who were  only interested in going to parties and looking for girls. There were guys who  were interested in cars. For me, it was the parties and the cars.  </P> <P> "Some of us individually would get in trouble with the law for drinking or  fighting, but our rivalries with other gangs were more in terms of who was the  best dressed or the best dancers. We were small and we never would have  survived if we would have tried to be the toughest. There were certainly  neighborhoods where we weren't welcome."  </P> <P> He didn't feel particularly welcome at UCI either. He lived on campus, and the  life there was unlike any he had known.  </P> <P> "I felt like I was on an island out there," he says.  </P> <P> It didn't help that he had chosen a major for which, he later realized, he was  unsuited. His grades in biology were mediocre and, he says, one academic  counselor suggested that he should leave the university.  </P> <P> Instead, he changed his major to social ecology, and obtained his bachelor's  degree. Then UCLA accepted him into its law school. He was the first member of  his family ever to go to college.  </P> <P> During his college years, he became gradually disassociated from his old gang.  </P> <P> "It was kind of like in a marriage where your interests change and you're no  longer compatible," he says. "Part of it was the opportunity to see a different  part of the world and a different lifestyle. That's what I think a lot of  people in gangs and who live in barrios could benefit from."  </P> <P> For other members of the old gang, such a vision never materialized. Corona  remembers one member who became a chiropractor, and others who now drive trucks  or work in construction, but he also remembers several who "got into alcohol  and never got out of that, and others who have been in and out of jail."  </P> <P> For Corona, however, meeting the challenge of living in two worlds propelled  him to success.  </P> <P> "What I liked," he says, "was being able to show the teachers that what they  originally thought about Mexicans was probably wrong and what they thought  about club or gang members wasn't necessarily true. With me, they couldn't say  that all gang members were drive-by shooters or drug dealers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> STEPHANIE LOPEZ  </P> <P> Everybody expected Stephanie Lopez to fail and, for the better part of her  young life, she obliged them.  </P> <P> Her alcoholic stepfather beat her. Her mother repeatedly told her she was  stupid. So did her teachers in Las Vegas, N.M. One of them actually assigned  her to an arbitrary group of supposedly slow students he called "the dumb  bunnies."  </P> <P> "You're stupid at home, you're stupid at school, you're an outcast, you're one  of the dumb bunnies, so you say, 'All right,' " says Lopez. "You have to have  some friends and one of mine was the bottle. I was drunk every weekend. I was  an alcoholic by the time I was in junior high."  </P> <P> She also identified herself with the gang that claimed Las Vegas' Camp Street  as its territory. She took a street name that she often sprayed on walls and  buildings: La Snoopy.  </P> <P> "They called me that," she says, "because I always wanted to know everything.  When I sprayed it on a wall, that was me, that was my identity."  </P> <P> It was a small way to chip away at the deep sense of alienation from the  academic and social world around her, where if you were Latino, "people's  expectations were that you would dig ditches or work at a sewing machine or  raise a family. The schools would socialize you to fail. High school was an  incredible racist experience."  </P> <P> Today, La Snoopy, she of the inquisitive mind, is 38, lives in Irvine, has  bachelor's and master's degrees in speech communications from Cal State  Fullerton, a second master's degree in comparative cultures from UC Irvine, and  is working at UCI toward her Ph.D. in the same subject.  </P> <P> But while she was in high school, her grades seldom rose above Ds, she says.  She hung out with the gang, ratted her hair, got into fights where knives and  razors bristled, "did defiant, malicious things." She became known as a girl  who would never back down when playing "chicken" in a car. Once, while she was  driving drunk, her car and another crashed at an intersection. She was ordered  to report to a probation officer for a year after that.  </P> <P> One New Year's Eve Lopez nearly died after passing out drunk and being taken to  a local hospital.  </P> <P> Then she discovered chess.  </P> <P> "When I was making bad grades in high school," she says, "there was a Chicano  counselor who taught me the game. He really cared. He showed me that I wasn't  stupid."  </P> <P> She quickly became the state junior chess champion.  </P> <P> That success, in part, inspired her to attend the University of New Mexico  after high school. However, "even though I was highly intelligent, I hadn't  been given the skills I needed to survive (in college)," she says, "and I fell  flat on my face the first time out."  </P> <P> She moved to Southern California, where she thought she would have a better  chance at a job. She began working in a drugstore.  </P> <P> Then, in 1979, a friend urged her to try for a degree a second time, at  Cerritos College. This time, more worldly wise, she began making straight As  and obtained an AA degree in fashion. While at Cerritos, however, she competed  on the debate team with such success that she was offered a debate scholarship  to Cal State Fullerton, where she worked for her speech communication degrees.  After four years at UCI, she is nearing completion of her doctorate studies.  She intends to teach courses in comparative cultures at the university level.  </P> <P> She has earned scholarships throughout her college career.  </P> <P> Now, she is trying to make sure other Latino youths are inspired to do the  same. She has been working with various community service projects in the  Orange County barrios since she was an undergraduate at Cal State Fullerton. In  1985, she proposed the idea of a summer camp, funded by private businesses,  where barrio youths could learn, among other things, that there are  alternatives to gangs and a life without self-esteem. The first Camp Escalera  (Spanish for ladder) was held last summer at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> "I want to leave something behind that will make a difference," she says. "We  have to make a moral investment in our system of education and build bridges  rather than walls. These people aren't lazy, they've just been socialized to  poverty. I tell them that there's much more power in a library than there is in  a .45 automatic."  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cuts of GM office staff start GENERAL MOTORS said it would eliminate about 4,725 jobs in the reorganisation of its marketing, corporate communications and other corporate staff functions, Reuter reports. The company said the cuts were part of the 9,000 white collar jobs it had planned to eliminate by the end of 1992. It added that the job cuts and other changes were the latest big management move in the creation of GM's North American Operations (NAO), which now manages GM's North American vehicle and components operations. GM plans to reduce its 13,500-employee central corporate by 70 per cent or 9,450 jobs.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Expedier defers preference dividend EXPEDIER Leisure, the ticketing and box office computer group, yesterday deferred payment of preference dividends and delayed publication of its results for the 1991 year pending the outcome of discussions with its bankers. The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 6p, some 2p below the price at which the group was rescued in a 1-for-1 rights issue last November. Mr Conor O'Brian, chief executive, said trading losses were likely to be Pounds 3.5m. Losses after exceptional and extraordinary items were expected to amount to Pounds 6.3m. The group said it was trying to sell its TV and film production furniture hire business and planned to sell its sports promotions division to a management buy-out. It may also be forced to sell its box office computer systems company (BOCS) to reduce bank facilities of Pounds 2.93m. If all these are sold, Expedier would be left with little more than its 50 per cent stake in The Ticketing Group, a joint venture with Wembley. This venture combines Wembley's Box Office and Keith Prowse ticket retailing services with Expedier's First Call business. Expedier's directors said the interest in the Ticketing Group would provide a firm base for future development. It is, however, difficult to see the justification for such a small company maintaining a public quotation. Mr O'Brian said directors were confident the group's bankers would extend facilities until the disposals. Sales volumes at the Ticketing Group were ahead of budget in the first four months of 1992 and BOCS had been awarded three new contracts this year.</p>

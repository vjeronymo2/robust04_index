During the ceremony to promulgate the new Constitution,  President Alberto Fujimori issued a call to all sectors to reach  an agreement to boost the Peruvian economy in 1994.    The first reaction from the opposition in Congress was one  of  distrust and skepticism. Some said they would participate in  the dialogue without implying agreement, while others  categorically rejected the call.    [Begin recording] [Congressman Ernesto Gamarra] In view of  the fact that Mr. Fujimori has made no signs of wanting a  concerted agreement, I cannot believe in his call to a concerted  agreement.    [Congressman Celso Sotomarino] Ramiro Priale said something  that I have always liked: To have a dialogue is not to agree.  Any civilized person should want to have a dialogue. [end  recording]    Regarding educational reform for the next year, which the  president also announced, members of the Education Committee  made the following comments:    [Begin recording] [Gloria Helfer] One cannot think about  reform if there is no clear proposal to improve the teachers'  situation. [end recording]    The minority parties in the Democratic Constituent Congress  described Fujimori's request that constitutional reforms be  approved by the people as an electoral tactic. The minority  parties said they have been working on just that to present  jointly their respective proposals.    [Begin Henry Pease recording] I want to announce to the  country that my faction and I presented the first draft  constitutional amendment. It is very simple: to abolish the  seventh transitory clause which established that the next  legislature will be chosen based on the single-district concept  [distrito unico]. [end recording]</p>

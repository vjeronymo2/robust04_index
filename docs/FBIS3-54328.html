			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Caroline Faraj] </F>   [Text] Heads of the Arab and Israeli delegations  participating in the bilateral peace negotiations are continuing  their consultations and coordination meetings to discuss the  possibility of holding the next round of talks at the U.S. State  Department.    As State Department Deputy Spokesman Christine Shelly said  on  Monday [24 January], the talks on the level of heads of  delegations will continue over the next few days.    Reached by telephone in Washington, Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah,  Jordanian ambassador to the United States and head of the  Jordanian delegation to the bilateral talks, told AL-RA'Y:  Yesterday's talks were held separately with the head of each  delegation. My meeting with chief Israeli delegate Elyaqim  Rubenstein lasted only 15 minutes. It was a preparation for  what we may discuss in the coming days.    Dr. al-Tarawinah stressed that on the second day of talks  with the Israeli side, which will be held at the U.S. Department  of State, the Jordanian side will concentrate on the clauses of  the joint Jordanian-Israeli agenda, which was signed on 14  September 1993. He said: As heads of delegations, we cannot  discuss the details. Therefore, talks will be confined to the  agenda and to the way we can proceed along the track in the same  past order, that is, in the presence of the three working  groups--the water, environment, and energy group; the refugees  and economy group; and the security and border group. Dr.  al-Tarawinah added: When the Arabs collectively decide to begin  the next round of talks, these groups will discuss topics on the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda all at once and in a manner that will  cover all topics.    Asked if Jordan will prioritize its talks with the Israelis  by beginning with the simple issues and avoiding the  controversial ones, he said: We try to avoid prioritization.  The three joint working groups will discuss all issues  pertaining to each committee. All in all, these issues cover all  topics of the agenda. These discussions will take place at the  same time because all the agenda topics are important for Jordan.    He stressed that the date of the next round has not yet been  discussed between the heads of delegations and the U.S.  Administration, which is sponsoring the talks.    The State Department deputy spokesman had earlier said talks  between the heads of the Arab and Israeli delegations are  informal, but more feasible as the parties can probe each  other's ideas away from pressure.</p>

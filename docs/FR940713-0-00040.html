The authority citation for Part 74 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Secs. 4, 303, 48 Stat. 1066, as amended, 1062, as amended; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, 554. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 74.902 is amended by redesignating paragraph (d) as paragraph (d)(1) and adding paragraph (d)(2) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.902  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Frequency assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An applicant leasing excess capacity and proposing a schedule which complies in all respects with the requirements of Section 74.931(e) will have presumptively demonstrated need, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for no more than four channels, all part of the same Group listed in paragraph (a) of this section. This presumption is rebuttable by demonstrating that the application does not propose to comport with our educational programming requirements, that is, to transmit some formal educational programming, as defined in Section 74.931(a), and to transmit the requisite minimum programming of Section 74.931(e) for genuinely educational purposes and to receive sites when students are there. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 74.931 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(1) and adding paragraph (e)(9) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.931  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose and permissible service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) Instructional television fixed stations are intended primarily to provide a formal educational and cultural development in aural and visual form, to students enrolled in accredited public and private schools, colleges and universities. Authorized instructional television fixed station channels must be used to transmit formal educational programming offered for credit to enrolled students of accredited schools, with limited exceptions as set forth in paragraph (e)(9) of this section and Secs. 74.990 through 74.992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e)&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) A licensee may shift its requisite ITFS programming onto fewer than its authorized number of channels, via channel mapping technology or channel loading, so that it can lease full-time channel capacity to a wireless cable operator, subject to the condition that it provide a total average of at least 20 hours per channel per week of ITFS programming on its authorized channels. The licensee also retains the unabridgeable right to recapture, subject to six months' written notification to the wireless cable operator, an average of an additional 20 hours per channel per week for simultaneous programming on the number of channels for which it is authorized. The licensee may agree to the transmission of this recapture time on channels not authorized to it, but which are included in the wireless system of which it is a part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16879 Filed 7&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

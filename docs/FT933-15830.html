			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government support for councils may move A SHIFT in government support for councils away from inner cities towards rural areas will take place next spring unless ministers act to mitigate its effect, Alison Smith writes. The review of the basis on which the government allocates grant, together with the use of the full information from the 1991 census, suggests that some urban councils could lose up to 20 per cent of their grant. Ministers acknowledge that such a change could not be allowed to happen in a single year. Apart from difficulty for local authorities, the London local elections in May next year are another reason to soften the impact. Figures indicate that some London boroughs, including flagship Tory councils Westminster and Wandsworth, would lose between 10 per cent and 14 per cent of their standard spending assessments.</p>

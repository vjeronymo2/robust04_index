			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Professional controversy remains - The impact of asset liability modelling THERE IS nothing new in the principle that pension fund investments should be selected having regard to the liabilities. However, the emergence of asset liability modelling has enabled this axiom to be quantified, so setting in motion a new debate of vital importance for pension fund health. The average pension fund during the 1980s increased its equity exposure from about 60 per cent to closer to 80 per cent. However, this shift has come in for particularly close scrutiny from many quarters. Some suggest that the growing maturity of pension funds argues for reducing equities and increasing bonds. Pan-European comparisons make the British pension fund distribution stand out as extremely aggressive. On the other hand, many still argue that pension funds should be prepared to commit all their assets to equities, given their long-time horizons. Debates on these issues have been difficult without a clear framework. Until recently, discussions were wholly subjective and firm conclusions were hard to draw. Asset liability modelling has now emerged as a credible, if somewhat controversial, framework to address these questions. Most asset liability modelling work has been carried out by pension fund actuaries. According to the Greenwich Associates 1990 Survey, 30 per cent of funds now use an actuary or consultant to help in their asset allocation policy. This is a proportion that has grown rapidly from a very low base. By starting to give advice on investment policy, the actuary has appeared to encroach on the territory of investment managers. This redrawing of the demarcation lines has created tensions. In the 1988 FT Pension Fund Investment Survey, about the time when asset liability modelling was starting to be debated in earnest, Barry Riley wrote of these professional tensions, suggesting that 'irritation will turn to resentment if actuaries attempt to strip the asset allocation responsibility from balanced managers.' In practice, the involvement of actuaries since then has been confined to setting long-term asset allocation over a horizon of 10 years and longer, leaving balanced managers to get on with the job as before (stock selection and short-term asset allocation), albeit relative to a new benchmark. Over this recent period, the separation of long-term policy decisions from short-term tactical decisions has become better understood and is now widely used. As a result of these developments, the managers' irritation has not, as yet, turned to resentment. The majority of managers have welcomed the clearer objectives that have been derived from this work. The other area of controversy relates to scepticism with the process itself. Asset liability modelling systems are complicated but the principles of their application are straightforward. Modelling involves making projections as to the future financial position of a particular pension fund. The calculations reveal the likely funding position of the scheme (the value of assets in relation to accrued liabilities) and the contribution rate at some future date five years, 10 years or further out. These modelling systems compare the most likely position with the extremes in terms of the worst case expectations and the best case expectations. The latter information is used to gauge the uncertainties implicit in any scenario and therefore the risks the employers and trustees actually face. For example, a projection might show that the current investment policy is most likely to lead to no change in the contribution rate in 10 years' time, but the worst case possible would involve a much higher rate applying. Such information would be used to decide whether the current policy should be changed. Modelling results are used in two respects. First, they illustrate the implications of adopting any particular investment policy. Secondly, they identify superior investment policies that improve the chances of a scheme achieving its particular objectives. Proponents would certainly claim that the process allows higher returns to emerge without a corresponding increase in risk. While the process has improved and matured over the years, professional controversy still remains. Like most long-range modelling processes, there is considerable scope to question the interpretation of results. The principal difficulty lies in setting the assumptions about future market returns with sufficient prescience to obtain robust answers. In practice, assumptions cannot be set with great precision so the results of the process need to be interpreted with care. There are those who believe this difficulty is sufficient to invalidate the whole process. Early models were essentially backward-looking and built largely on the premise that history would repeat itself. Latterly, more forward-looking models have emerged which rely partly on historical evidence and partly on more traditional economic judgments. These appear more credible and answer some of the criticisms. Most converts to modelling tend to believe in the philosophy that 'models are to be used and not believed' and study the results to provide a disciplined quantitative framework for qualitative discussions on investment policies. Perhaps the most important benefit seen from modelling is that funds can become more individualistic using this framework and can fully reflect their own characteristics and ambitions. For example, fast-growing schemes with limited numbers of pensioners can be easily differentiated from declining mature schemes. This means that in practice, the policies that emerge from modelling studies are certainly not identical from one scheme to the next. This begs a number of practical questions about how performance will be measured in future. Some have questioned whether or not the days of performance 'league tables' are numbered if individual objectives start to predominate. This would appear to be very unlikely. The performance league table has fulfilled a very important role for most trustees and is unlikely to be replaced. In trying to anticipate the changing mood of the industry, performance measurers are now hard at work creating a new style of reporting in which sub-groups of funds can be properly compared in a 'peer group' league table. What of the future? Further refinement of asset liability modelling will inevitably occur with both actuaries and investment managers taking active roles. At present, asset liability modelling is carried out by a small minority of funds (albeit influential ones), no more than 100 in total. The way seems clear for it to become a majority practice as natural as performance measurement has become.

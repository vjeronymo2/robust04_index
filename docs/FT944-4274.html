			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Chiapas governor takes office Mr Eduardo Robledo was sworn in as the new governor of the troubled southern Mexican state of Chiapas yesterday, despite threats by armed rebels there to renew their attacks. In a ceremony protected by more than a thousand soldiers and plain-clothes police, and attended by the new Mexican president, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the governor offered to resign, 'if that meant the Zapatistas putting down their arms'. A tense truce between the government and the Zapatista rebels has held in Chiapas since January 12 after several days of fighting had killed more than 150 people. The rebels launched their rebellion on January 1, demanding more scope for indigenous peoples in the state and greater democracy. They claim Mr Robledo, of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), won August's gubernatorial election by fraud. Despite Mr Robledo's offer, the Zapatistas show no sign of giving up their struggle. The masked rebel leader known as Sub-commandante Marcos said late on Tuesday his forces 'recognised Robledo's swearing-in as the formal rupturing of the ceasefire by the federal government'. In a speech immediately following Mr Robledo's inauguration, Mr Zedillo said the government's unilateral ceasefire would remain intact. The president also called for renewed negotiations between the federal government and the Zapatistas. This call was rejected by the rebels, who say Mr Robledo's resignation is a precondition of negotiations. The governor's offer to resign is not seen as a real option for the PRI because, if he were to quit, that would be taken as a precedent for other elected PRI officials in Mexico, many of whom are also accused of fraud at the polls. Soon after Mr Robledo was sworn in, Mr Amado Avendano, who ran for the governorship for the leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary party, also took an oath of office before thousands of peasant supporters in the central square of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez. Mr Avendano, who has the backing of the Zapatistas and claims electoral fraud cheated him of office, said he would set up a parallel government in the nearby city of San Cristobal de las Casas. His supporters say they will pay no taxes to the Robledo government and will continue their civil disobedience. Officials say they will tacitly recognise Mr Avendano's role in the hope of maintaining peace in the state and reopening negotiations with the Zapatistas.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wimpey recovers to Pounds 7.5m - Housebuilding profits increase fourfold as construction stays tough Wimpey, Britain's biggest housebuilder, yesterday confirmed that the housebuilding revival was still on track as it announced a recovery from a restated Pounds 200,000 loss to a Pounds 7.5m pre-tax profit in the first six months of this year. The company, which is paying a maintained interim dividend of 2p, held out the prospect of an increase in the 3.25p final dividend at the end of the year when it said it would review payments to shareholders 'in the light of trading prospects for 1995'. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said these had improved for most of the group's businesses although conditions in construction remained very tough. Earnings per share in the first half rose from a loss of 0.28p to 1.36p, requiring a transfer from reserves of Pounds 2.3m to meet the cost of the interim dividend. The company traditionally earns the bulk of its profits in the second half. Wimpey has changed its policy and now charges interest against discontinued businesses against current profits rather than including them in provisions. This led to last year's Pounds 1.1m first half profit being restated as a Pounds 200,000 loss. Mr Dwyer said that UK house sales, after faltering earlier in the summer, had risen by about a quarter in August compared with the corresponding month last year. 'This gives us confidence that the autumn, the second most important selling season of the year, will be quite reasonable,' he said. Other housebuilders have also reported a revival in sales in August. Mr Dwyer said that a lull in the market had occurred at the same time as the World Cup soccer finals. Even so, UK house sales since May were about 15 per cent higher on average compared with the corresponding period last year. The group expects UK completions for the year to increase to 8,000 from 6,936 in 1993. Housebuilding profits, including the US and Australia, rose fourfold in the first half, from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 10.5m, on turnover increased from Pounds 195m to Pounds 246m. Profits from the UK and US minerals division fell from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 100,000 but this masked an improvement of more than Pounds 2m as last year's profits included Pounds 6.7m of planning fees from the group's former waste business. The performance of the minerals division, boosted by price and volume sales increases in the UK, was even more impressive given that US results were depressed by severe winter weather, said Mr Dwyer. Construction profits, had fallen from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 3.8m. although the bottom may have been reached in this market. COMMENT Margins on UK house sales should reach double figures by the end of this year, leaving little scope for further improvement given the company's emphasis on first time buyers. Wimpey should therefore be regarded as a construction and minerals recovery play, where Tarmac, scores more heavily. Wimpey's strength is in its superior balance sheet, where gearing is expected to be only 15 per cent by the year end. Profits of Pounds 48m and Pounds 68m would put the group on prospective multiples of 17 and almost 13, indicating that it still has much to do before it closes the gap with its rival.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Observer: Questions and answers When it comes to matters of judgment, Britain's clearing bankers have not emerged at all well from the Robert Maxwell disaster. Not only did they lend his empire well over Pounds 1bn but even worse they handed over to him control of their professional organ - Banking World. The big selling point of the magazine is that it provides model answers to bankers' exam questions - which makes it an essential tool for young bankers on the make. Back in 1983, the Chartered Institute of Bankers agreed to merge its own journal with Maxwell's newly-acquired Bankers' Magazine. Maxwell controlled the Banking World title and his printing presses look after the monthly print-run of 130,000 copies. It is a nice little earner and has saved the institute a lot of money and heartache. However, the Maxwell connection is proving an embarrassment and the institute is now wondering how to extricate itself gracefully from the mess. There is talk of a management buy-out of Maxwell's contract publishing interests. Since the Banking World print run is a valuable contract the managers would obviously like to retain it. Not surprisingly, the institute is worried lest its organ falls into the hands of another unsavoury character. Model answers please to Roger Flemington, president of The Chartered Institute of Bankers, 10 Lombard Street.</p>

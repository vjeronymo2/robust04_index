			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Impressionist art spring sale disappoints: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S leading spring sale of Impressionist and Modern art in New York on Tuesday evening was a big disappointment, totalling Dollars 18.24m (Pounds 10.6m), with 20 of the 48 lots failing to find buyers. A year ago the comparable auction at Sotheby's totalled Dollars 286.2m, with Renoir's painting Au Moulin de la Galette selling for Dollars 78.1m. The difference measures the collapse of the market for Impressionist art. By being selective in the works it accepted for sale and by insisting on modest reserve prices, Sotheby's hoped the auction would restore confidence to this important sector of its business. In the event, absence of bids from the Japanese and from overstocked dealers led to thin demand. The only bright point was its success in selling seven paintings from the collection of the Hollywood doyenne, the late Irene Mayer Selznick, for Dollars 7.7m. The highest price was the Dollars 4.51m (Pounds 2.6m) paid by a private European collector for a late Matisse of 1940, La Robe Persane, from the Selznick collection. The estimate had been Dollars 5m-Dollars 7m. A tiny oil by Seurat, a study for his magnum opus Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte, also beat its estimate at Dollars 1.375m. Buste d'Homme, a late Picasso of 1969, went for the same price, well below its forecast, and a European dealer paid Dollars 1.045m, for Le Bain, a pastel by Degas. Mr David Nash, head of the Impressionist department, said he was disappointed at the results of the auction. Attention now switches to London for a similar Sotheby's auction on June 25 when, for the first time for years, the quality of the works on offer is higher than in New York.</p>

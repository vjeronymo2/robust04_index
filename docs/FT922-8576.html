			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Reduction in new bank lending THE international financial system generated Dollars 255bn of new lending last year, less than half of the Dollars 550bn of 1990, according to figures published in the BIS quarterly review, writes Richard Waters. The scarcity of new bank credit was at the root of the contraction, net international lending by banks plummeting from Dollars 465bn to Dollars 85bn. Despite this, the final quarter of last year saw a slight recovery in bank lending. New lending in the last quarter, at Dollars 30bn, was double the previous quarter's. Japanese banks accounted for much of this growth. They put on Dollars 23bn of new international assets, most of it to fund the affiliates of Japanese companies in other Asian centres. Japanese banks also continued to reduce their dependence on foreign finance.</p>

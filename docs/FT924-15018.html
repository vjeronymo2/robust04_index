			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Holding tight on a roller-coaster ride: The currency turmoil since Black Wednesday is unlikely to ease until economic policy is clear FOREIGN EXCHANGE markets do not seem to know what to do with Britain's devalued currency. But Britain's exporters cannot afford simply to wait and see where sterling eventually ends up. Their marketing strategies and expected profits depend on estimates made now about where the pound will be both in three months and three years. So where might the pound end once the excitement dies down? And what kind of rollercoaster ride can sterling expect on the foreign exchanges in the meantime? Economists like to believe that exchange rates are determined according to the predictions of their economic theories. The daily gyrations in the markets may be the result of market speculators and the interventions of central banks. But, in the medium term, all this market noise should wash out leaving economic 'fundamentals' to determine the currency's value. Typically, though, economists disagree about which 'fundamental' forces count. Take two apparently simple questions. Was sterling overvalued in the European exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of DM2.95? Is it now undervalued relative to other European currencies at around DM2.40? Ask a group of economists and you will get at least as many different answers as economists. Those who said that sterling was correctly valued at DM2.95 were using the 'purchasing power parity' valuation method. This says that the correct exchange rate between any two currencies is the one which equalises the price of the same traded item in both countries. If cars are cheaper in one country, then traders should buy them and export them to make a profit. But this will push up that country's exchange rate until price parity is restored. The charts show purchasing power parity exchange rates for the UK, US and Germany over the past decade. They are based on a basket of similar goods compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and use trade-weighted exchange rates. They suggest that sterling was overvalued before Black Wednesday on September 16 - UK exports were, on average slightly more expensive than those of competitors. But the effective 11 per cent devaluation of sterling has more than eliminated this disadvantage - it is now 6 per cent undervalued in trade-weighted terms. And its previous overvaluation was largely due to the undervaluation of the US dollar, as the US chart shows. Calculations by Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, suggest that sterling is now undervalued  -by 14 per cent against the overvalued D-Mark and by 3 per cent against the French franc. Does this mean that sterling must eventually appreciate against European currencies or alternatively that UK inflation must be higher than elsewhere to bring UK export prices into line? The track record of purchasing power parity rates suggests not. They have, in fact, been a very poor guide to actual exchange-rate valuations over the past decade. The reason is that purchasing power parity calculations ignore many other economic 'fundamentals' other than export prices which determine whether a country's exchange rate is sustainably valued. To compete with German manufacturers at DM2.95, UK exporters had to sell their goods at comparable prices. But there were too few UK exporters who were able to do so at that exchange rate. So Britain is left with a relatively small and unprofitable export sector and a trade deficit at the bottom of a recession as a result. The alternative method - called 'fundamental equilibrium exchange rates' to scare off the uninitiated - uses macroeconomic models to estimate the exchange rate at which the economy can return the trade account into rough balance in the medium term. The fundamental equilibrium charts tell a very different tale. They suggest, in direct contradiction to the purchasing power parity figures, that the D-Mark has been consistently undervalued over the past decade, as its large trade surpluses suggested. The US dollar is undervalued in purchasing power parity terms but correctly valued using the fundamental equilibrium method. In fundamental equilibrium terms, sterling was overvalued at DM2.95 - by about 15 per cent according to Mr Ray Barrell at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The institute argued in October 1990 that sterling should enter the ERM at a lower rate. But sterling's subsequent fall since Black Wednesday to around DM2.40 means that it is now correctly valued. Enough British exporters can have a profitable existence to balance the current account so long as the competitive gains are not frittered away in higher inflation. Yet even if the current exchange rate is an acceptable final resting place for sterling, the chances are high that it will have to fall further in the meantime. Why must sterling overshoot? UK interest rates are already lower than in most other European countries and are expected to fall further. Investors will continue to hold sterling only if they can also expect capital gains from an appreciation of the currency. So sterling must fall far enough so that it can both appreciate and arrive back at a reasonable resting place. But how large must this overshoot be? The farther that markets expect sterling interest rates to fall relative to those in continental Europe, the farther traders must push sterling down. That is why the lack of a clearly articulated government economic strategy is destabilising. The chances are that currency analysts have been studying the behaviour of policymakers in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, using charts such as those shown, to gain some clues as to how the Treasury might act. These are the countries which, like the UK, have experienced serious debt-related recessions. They have all responded by cutting short-term interest rates aggressively, in all cases below those in Germany. Far from leading to a build-up of inflationary pressure, they have also seen inflation and long-term interest rates fall relative to those in Germany. The cost has been large exchange-rate depreciations against the D-Mark, in all cases at least twice as large as sterling's fall so far. Will the UK take the same route? The gain would be a relief for hard-pressed consumers and bankers. The risk is that a temporary fall in sterling towards DM2.00 would encourage Britain's famed inflationary tendencies. But unless the government speaks out soon, the markets are likely to anticipate that more cuts in interest rates are coming - and sell sterling accordingly.</p>

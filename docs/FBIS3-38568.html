Those socialists who did not get behind the new course set  by  [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Ottaviano Del Turco  met today at Montecitorio (the parliament building) and forged a  national political executive made up of Socialist MPs and  regional officials, deputy Franco Piro reported in a communique  released here this evening.    Not only had thousands of Socialists backed the new grouping  but even those organized structures which "do not intend to  sacrifice the identity, dignity and prospects of socialists" for  those who have always bucked reforms, the communique continued.    The symbol of new grouping will bear the words "The  Socialists" and the first party congress will be held in May.    The birth of the Federation of Italian Socialists is not in  conflict with the initiative which led last week to the  formation of the Federation of Democratic and Liberal Socialists  which, together with the Liberals and the Social Democrats,  forms a larger grouping with which the new party would continue  to work.    The FSI national leadership includes socialists who did not  follow in Del Turco's train, such as Ugo Intini, Maurizio  Sacconi, Stefano Caldoro, Maria Magnani Noya, Franco Piro (house  caucus leader) and vice-presidents Damiano Poti' and Angelo  Sollazzo.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Dissent at the heart of German forecasting: How one of the six economic research institutes differs on analysis and policy implications of continued stagnation FOR THE first time in more than six years Germany's independent economic research institutes yesterday had to agree to disagree in their economic forecasts. The Berlin-based Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) produced its own figures in an addendum to the report of the majority, suggesting that, far from a recovery in the German economy next year, it will continue to stagnate. The disagreement between the DIW and the other five institutes which jointly produce the biannual economic forecasts goes to the heart of economic, financial and monetary policy in Germany. The five expect an overall economic recovery, with a 1.5 per cent growth rate in the all-German figures - with 1 per cent in the west, and 7 per cent in the east. The DIW opts for a fall of 0.5 per cent in the west, (compared with a fall of 2 per cent this year), and a rise of only 5 per cent in the east (compared with a 5.5 per cent rise in 1993). For Germany as a whole, the DIW forecasts mean zero growth for 1994. Far from expecting a gradual but appreciable recovery fuelled by private investment, the DIW fears that long-term investment will continue to decline, and that the turning point will come - at the earliest - around the middle of the year. The institute concludes that instead of continuing to squeeze public sector spending, the government should switch to an investment stimulation programme. And the Bundesbank, far from continuing its slow but steady reduction in short-term interest rates, should accelerate the pace. At the heart of the DIW argument, presented yesterday by Mr Heiner Flassbeck, the institute's chief economist, is the persistent inverse structure of German interest rates: short-term rates, dictated by the Bundesbank's Lombard and discount rates, have remained stubbornly higher than the long-term capital market rates. That means that short-term financial instruments remain more attractive for investors than long-term investments. The reason is a lack of adequate demand for long-term money. The DIW estimates that a reduction in the gap between short- and long-term rates would not be adequate to revive long-term investment activity. 'Only with a normalisation of the interest rate structure will the economy be given the necessary impetus for growth,' it says. Long-term rates have fallen because overall demand for capital has fallen faster than the supply of capital: industry is looking for less long-term capital to invest, because of depressed profit expectations. As long as those profit expectations remain depressed, Mr Flassbeck argues, there will be no revival in investment, and it is up to the public sector to provide the necessary economic stimulus. Far from concentrating on reducing the public sector share in national income, as urged by the other institutes, the Bundesbank, and the government, it should be providing a stimulus. Structural cuts in public sector spending - such as the social spending cuts proposed by the government - should be carried out as soon as economic recovery is under way, but not before, he says. The other five institutes - from Essen, Halle, Hamburg, Kiel, and Munich - are still critical of the government's financial and economic policy, but their analysis differs. 'For a long time such policy has consisted of no more than ad hoc measures, without any medium-term concept,' they say. 'Financial policy is in an extremely precarious position.' They forecast a 5 per cent growth in public sector spending this year and next, with an increase of only 3.5 per cent in tax and social security revenues. The result will be an increase from DM78bn (Pounds 31.7bn) to DM107bn in this year's public sector deficit (including the federal states as well as the central government). The key reason is the level of transfers to east Germany, rising from DM150.3bn in 1992, to almost DM163bn this year and DM165.5bn in 1994, they say, as well as soaring unemployment benefit as jobless numbers approach 4m. At the same time, revenues will be squeezed by the economic downturn. The five institutes call for a clear medium-term financial strategy, beyond the scope of the immediate social spending plans agreed by the government. They believe that the proportion of state spending must be clearly reduced to allow the attraction of private sector investment to increase. The DIW disagrees. The immediate danger is not of a lasting increase in public spending. Such spending is dictated by the temporary needs of east Germany. But the current recession will only be aggravated by excessive cuts in public spending, before a recovery in private investment is in sight.</p>

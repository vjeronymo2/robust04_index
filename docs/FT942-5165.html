			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Saatchi releases managers in NY shuffle Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the US arm of Britain's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group, is parting company with its most senior managers as part of a shake-up to bring the struggling New York operations back to life. The company said Mr Harvey Hoffenberg, who became chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising only last year, would be leaving at the end of June. Mr Hoffman has been the New York office's chief creative officer for the past five years. The other departure is that of Mr Rich Pounder, the US company's vice-chairman. He had been with the company for 21 years. A reshuffle of the New York office had seemed likely following the decision by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in London to send over Mr Bill Muirhead, previously head of the company's Charlotte Street offices, to become chairman and chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America. While the British parent company has been engulfed by a power struggle between Mr Maurice Saatchi, its chairman, and Mr Charles Scott, its chief executive, many of its financial difficulties are due to the poor performance of its US operations. Several big accounts have been lost, including one from Chrysler's Jeep/Eagle division and for Brown &amp; Williamson's Kool cigarettes. More important, it has been slow to attract new billings. According to Adweek magazine, it won only Dollars 101.5m worth of business last year, leaving it 12th in the rankings. The US company announced its reshuffle late on Friday after the markets had closed, and could not be contacted for comment. But according to its statement, Mr Michael Jeary, chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's San Francisco office, will become chief executive in New York. Mr Muirhead had previously been looking after the job. On the creative side, Mr Stanley Becker, vice-chairman and chief creative officer of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Pacific Los Angeles, will be given responsibility for 'the restructuring and regeneration of the Saatchi New York creative department'.</p>

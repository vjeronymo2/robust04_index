			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Crime and the Results"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The cycles of violence which  the Palestinian territories are witnessing raise a great deal of  doubt about the continuation of the talks or implementation of  the accord. While Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has  always accused radical Muslims of trying to derail the peace  accord by attacking Israelis, in the wake of the Hebron crime it  has been proved that the responsibility falls on the shoulders  of racist Israeli settlers. Rabin's government must confront  those narrow-minded people and put an end to their provocations.  Although in yesterday's cabinet session the Israeli Government  took some steps to restrict the settlers' movements, those steps  are insufficient to reassure us of what will happen tomorrow.  The feeling of dejection among our people can only be overcome  by measures aimed at restraining the settlers, disarming them,  and preventing them from carrying out provocative acts against  Palestinians.    Although the Palestinian-Israeli accord represented a  political breakthrough between the two peoples, we are not  misrepresenting the facts when we say that the deterioration of  the situation, the nonimplementation of the accord on its dates,  and Israel's attempt to extract more concessions from the  Palestinian side were all factors that contributed to a setback  and erosion of international fervor for the accord.  Undoubtedly, the accord will be in danger of collapse unless  Israel takes immediate steps to implement it without waiting for  agreements on details. It is impossible to reach a finalized  solution and agreement on all the clauses. The dangers  surrounding the accord require one to bet on goodwill and begin  implementing the accord. They also require the commitment of  the two parties to address the economic concerns in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Close Brothers significantly ahead of forecasts at Pounds 16.7m Shares in Close Brothers, the merchant banking and financial services group, rose 83p to 528p yesterday when the company announced interim profits significantly ahead of forecasts. The company reported pre-tax profits up by almost Pounds 10m to Pounds 16.7m for the six months to January 31. Analysts had been predicting figures in the region of Pounds 12m. Winterflood Securities, the smaller companies market maker acquired for Pounds 19m last April, was a large contributor to the increase, accounting for about 40 per cent of profits. The remaining Close Brothers' businesses also put in a strong performance, recording a 45 per cent advance. Winterflood benefited from the increased activity in the stock market, and made record profits during the period. The company now makes a market in 1,150 stocks and is moving to larger premises. The merchant bank's loan portfolio grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 349m, and the group reduced the percentage of bad debts. Corporate finance operations are geared to small and medium sized companies, and Close Brothers has benefited from a surge in corporate activity among the smaller listed companies. Prompt, the company's insurance premium financing subsidiary, saw a 32 per cent increase in volume in the period, while the asset leasing business also performed strongly. The interim dividend is raised to 5p (3.2p), payable from earnings per share up from 11.9p to 22.2p. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. COMMENT Close Brothers' shares fell 11 per cent last week, in part because of concerns that the company might be affected by a less confident stock market. It has provided a powerful defence at the interim stage. Brokers expect pre-tax profits to exceed Pounds 33m (previous forecasts had peaked at Pounds 25m), which puts the shares on a p/e of 12, even after the shares' meteoric performance yesterday. The momentum of the company's market making business may slow, but Close Brothers has a broad spread of businesses, which should perform strongly in the economic upturn; the shares should do likewise.</p>

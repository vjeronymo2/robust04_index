			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GHOST RIVER;  </P> <P> STRETCH OF THE STANISLAUS PRIZED BY RAFTERS HAS REAPPEARED AT BOTTOM OF  SHRINKING RESERVOIR  </P> <P> Hard rain pelted the river and the ghost forest of drowned oaks and sugar pines  along the banks, but Jim Foust was too delighted to be cold. He was confirming  the rumor that has swept like a good joke through California's river rafting  fraternity -- after 10 years at the bottom of a lake, the famous rapids of the  Stanislaus River canyon are runnable again.  </P> <P> "It's really kind of amazing," Foust said, paddling down the Stanislaus as he  had dozens of times in the 1970s. "The trees are all dead, of course, but I  recognize those rocks. And the rapids are just about how I remember them."  </P> <P> The Stanislaus was one of the special places to California environmentalists,  celebrated for its steep limestone cliffs, Indian caves and soaring red-tailed  hawks as well as the mild but thrilling rapids. Hearts broke when man sunk the  Stanislaus beneath New Melones Reservoir to store irrigation water for Central  Valley growers.  </P> <P> But nature has proven to be the greater force, at least for now. Drought has  dropped the lake nearly 200 feet, exposing four miles of rapids where many  California rafters -- including former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. -- got their  first taste of white water, and where an epic and emotional environmental  battle was fought a decade ago.  </P> <P> The Stanislaus was the first popular stretch of white water for rafting, an  easy drive from the Mother Lode towns of Sonora and Columbia. Plans to dam the  canyon set off several years of protests and brought about the creation of  Friends of the River, an environmental lobbying group that has fought off every  dam project that would inundate white water since New Melones.  </P> <P> Driving the canyon rim on a dirt road turned muddy by two days of chilling  rain, Foust's excitement grew with every new river view. "There's Widowmaker  (rapid), I think," Foust said to Gate Briseno, another veteran of the old  river.  </P> <P> The shrinking lake has left a bathtub ring of denuded rock high on the canyon  cliffs. Silt has piled six feet deep along the banks of the resurgent river,  now bare of the thick brush and trees Foust recalls from 10 years ago. Shrubs  and poison oak rooting in the newly exposed flats are the only greenery.  </P> <P> Wearing thermal underwear and a wet suit, Foust put his raft into the river  just below the bridge at Camp Nine Road. His party included Rich Sasser, a  Modesto firefighter and part-time river guide making his first run down this  piece of the Stanislaus. "Never thought I'd get to run this part," Sasser said.  </P> <P> The raft drifted past a grazing cow, but there were few birds and no other  animal life visible. Foust, owner of Sunshine Outdoor Center 30 miles  downstream in Knights Ferry, stopped occasionally to clamber over rocks and  check out side canyons to refresh his memory for landmarks.  </P> <P> He pronounced about four miles of rapids to be as good as ever. The silt had  washed out of most of the rock groins and cascades during the summer. "This  water is running pretty clean, even with the rain," Foust said.  </P> <P> Downstream from Razorback rapid, the river widens and turns so heavily silted  that the raft scraped on the bottom.  </P> <P> About a mile farther downstream the silt bottom drops away and the flowing  water turns to glass, signaling the upper bounds of the reservoir. Rapids that  were lower in the canyon -- Chicken Falls, Wino's Swim, Chinese Dogleg --  remain inundated. The old Parrotts Ferry bridge where rafters used to haul out,  still three miles downriver, is deep underwater.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chained to a Rock  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Foust was working the other side of the Stanislaus controversy.  He was a river ranger for the Army Corps of Engineers sent out to find Mark  DuBois, an activist who had chained himself to a rock at the water line  somewhere in the canyon in an attempt to block filling of the lake.  </P> <P> DuBois -- then director of Friends of the River -- was visited by accomplices  and reporters, but was never discovered by Foust and other searchers. He came  out of the canyon voluntarily, but not before Gov. Brown negotiated an  agreement with the Corps of Engineers to delay the filling.  </P> <P> Word that the Stanislaus rapids are back has spread fast to old river hands,  including DuBois, who said that travel plans will prevent him from rafting the  canyon for a few weeks.  </P> <P> "I very much want to go up there," DuBois said this week in San Francisco,  where he is helping organize an Earth Day celebration for next April. "The  Stanislaus touched people's hearts like few places have. It was accessible, but  because you had these 1,000-foot cliffs around you, you felt as if you were 100  miles away from civilization. There is no other limestone canyon on the West  Coast that compares to it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bittersweet Experience  </P> <P> DuBois said he noticed this spring that the lake was dropping fast, and  suspected that the rapids might reappear. But rafters who tried the canyon in  the spring said the water and silt were still too high for the rapids to show.  </P> <P> Original Friends of the River activists have been rafting the Stanislaus for  the last month since discovering that it runs again. Some find it a bittersweet  experience.  </P> <P> "A friend called me up and said, 'Guess what I just did?' " said Linda Cloud of  Sacramento. She arranged to go down the canyon soon after.  </P> <P> "I just found it inspiring. I kept thinking to myself, I can't believe I'm  here," Cloud said. "But there is a lot of it that is real ugly. For a lot of  people it's real painful to go back."  </P> <P> Where the river stops dropping and flattens into the lake, rafts drift past the  upper branches of old cottonwoods and pines poking above the surface. Upstream  Cloud spotted grass and wildflowers growing on the higher banks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pleasant Surprise  </P> <P> "I was really surprised at how quickly it can rejuvenate," she said. "From what  friends told me, the river had cleaned out the silt for another mile between  July and August."  </P> <P> When DuBois chained himself to the rock, the lake surface was at 803 feet above  sea level. It has filled as high as 1,087 feet, and stands now at 891 feet, "as  low as we've been since the early 1980s when we filled the dam," said Keith  Davis, park manager at New Melones for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  </P> <P> The lake will continue falling until October or November unless unexpected  heavy rains begin refilling it, Davis said, but it likely will not rise to its  normal level until the spring snow runoff.  </P></p>

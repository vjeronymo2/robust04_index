			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Balladur-Chirac duel descends into farce Such is now the intensity of political rivalry inside France's ruling Gaullist RPR party that every move by the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, or by Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader, is automatically interpreted as part of their deadly duel to win the Elysee. The fact that Mr Balladur cancelled a meeting yesterday with RPR deputies was widely interpreted as a move to dodge confrontation with backbench MPs complaining at his criticism of Mr Chirac. Mr Balladur himself explained that he had found time to meet RPR senators yesterday, but not the deputies, because, though he was pressed for time, he had a long-standing appointment to meet the former group. But his side-stepping of the deputies may have also had something to do with the fact the latter included Mr Chirac, an MP for the Correze region as well as mayor of Paris, and who had decided to delay a trip to Tokyo for several hours to attend the meeting. This prompted speculation about whether it was Mr Balladur who cancelled, on learning Mr Chirac had altered his travel plans, or vice versa. All that this farce can be safely held to illustrate is the extraordinary allergy that has developed between France's prime minister and the leader of his own party. Despite all the calls by themselves and their party for unity, the two men seem to like being as far apart as possible. These days, for instance, Mr Chirac likes to be out of Paris on Tuesdays when Mr Balladur hosts a weekly meeting of the conservative coalition's leaders. One possible way of settling the Balladur-Chirac rivalry would be to hold US-style primary elections, as urged by Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR interior minister. But acceptance of this proposal is unlikely. The former French president, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said yesterday that rivalries on the right were no obstacle to winning the presidency. He noted that the right had three times fielded two rival candidates since 1958 and won. Meanwhile, Mr Alain Carignon, who resigned from the Balladur government to fight corruption allegations, was yesterday remanded in custody at least until October 28, while at the same time a former close associate of his at the Grenoble city hall made fresh accusations in yesterday's Liberation newspaper that Mr Carignon had promised the city's water concession to Lyonnaise des Eaux.

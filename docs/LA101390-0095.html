			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> CRITICISM BY ANC BRINGS REFORM DELAY  </P> <P> The South African government postponed a key reform in retaliation for a blast  of criticism from Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. Justice Minister  Hendrik J. Coetseesaid that, following ANC accusations that Pretoria was trying  to undermine black-white reconciliation, he would delay announcing guidelines  for the release of political prisoners and the return of exiles. The two issues  are among the ANC's conditions for entering formal negotiations with the white  government on ending apartheid and enfranchising the black majority.  </P></p>

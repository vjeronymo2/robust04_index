			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Balaguer heads for seventh term of office: Dominican Republic election looks like usual one-horse race Mr Antonio Reynoso, recently suspended from the priesthood for involvement in politics, is promising a virtual revolution in the Dominican Republic. If he wins the presidential election in May, he is planning (threatening, say cynics) to lead 'a government without theft and with efficiency'. There is general acceptance in the country that official corruption is endemic. President Balaguer, who admitted as much in recently decreeing that corrupt officials should be tried, immediately dampened public expectations of change by saying there was no proof. While Mr Reynoso's plan for clean government is being received with some sympathy, he is unlikely to get a chance to implement it. A familiar picture is emerging in the election campaign. The three main contenders will be the conservative Mr Balaguer, Mr Juan Bosch, his arch rival and once an avowed Marxist who has done an ideological volte face, and Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a social democrat doing well in opinion polls. Mr Balaguer, who is finishing his sixth term, had said on 14 occasions that he would not stand again. More recently, after returning from medical treatment in the US, the 87-year-old president said his decision would depend on his health. The incumbent Reformist Social Christian party then surprised no one by deciding he would stand again. Mr Balaguer and Mr Bosch (85) have contested all elections in the country since the 1960s. The president, who is blind, believes in public works and was particularly keen on presiding over the inauguration of the Columbus light-house, a massive structure the cost of which is unknown even to senior ministers. Mr Bosch, who is ill, and who shed his Marxist habit four years ago and proclaimed the virtues of a market economy, is likely to fare far worse in the election than his traditional close and controversial second. Mr Pena Gomez, 54-year-old leader of the Dominican Revolutionary party, appears most likely to mount the strongest challenge. He has a handicap, however. He is black in a country of long-standing prejudice against the black 10 per cent of the population, and where the tone has been set by Mr Balaguer's writings which have been dismissive of the intellectual, moral and physical qualities of blacks. The issue has become a factor in the campaign with Mr Pena Gomez's PRD accusing the PRSC of mounting a racist campaign. Whoever wins will face a difficult task in trying to move an economy which Mr Bernardo Vega, a former central bank governor, describes as being 'on auto-pilot while in a state of suspended animation. There is marginal economic growth, no inflation, no movement of the exchange rate.' The main sectors have suffered from a coincidence of setbacks which have dampened economic growth. The increasingly inefficient state sugar producer has been overwhelmed by deficits, and there has been a progressive reduction in the US's valuable sugar quota. The state-owned gold producer has been forced to close by falling prices and high production costs. Nickel production has also been hit by low prices. The trade deficit reached Dollars 1.75bn last year, 15 per cent higher than 1992, but the balance of payments has benefited from earnings from the free trade zones which produce exclusively for export, mainly to the US, and from tourism. 'This has been supported by substantial inflows of funds repatriated by Dominicans abroad to benefit from the attractive interest rates of about 35 per cent for Dominican peso deposits,' said Mr Vega. 'But because of these high rates there has been little investment. Now interest rates are coming down and there will be some capital flight before the election.' In trying to massage the economy towards expansion, the government has been subsidising sugar mills, coffee, cocoa and rice. This has damaged the fiscal accounts and has not produced many positive results. Under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the government is being forced towards prudence in its fiscal affairs. The economy is about Dollars 640m in arrears on servicing its Dollars 4.5bn foreign debt, but some relief should come from an agreement with commercial bank creditors to reduce by about a half the Dollars 1bn which they are owed. Except for Mr Reynoso, none of the candidates is promising to do anything very different. The auto-pilot may have security of tenure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko article under the "Commonwealth" rubric: </F> "CIS Leaders Have Discussed Ways of Deepening Integration"]    [Text] The top two CIS councils -- the Council of Heads of  State and the Council of Heads of Government -- began working in  parallel yesterday morning at the Grand Kremlin Palace and the  President Hotel in Moscow. Unlike the previous sessions in  December, these were held with the active participation of  delegations from Ukraine and Moldova, which announced their  desire to affiliate to earlier accords on the Commonwealth.  There was another innovation -- for the first time Vladimir  Shumeyko, chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, took  part in this work.    Presumably it was the participation of the authorized  representative of the legislative branch of power which helped  to free the stranded ship of CIS business ties.    The participants in the "premiers' council," chaired by  Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, settled all  20 questions ahead of schedule. In the words of Vladimir  Mashchits, leader of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Cooperation [as published], the main achievements of the meeting  may be considered the institution of a standing body -- the  Commission of the Economic Union -- under the CIS Coordinating  Committee and the signing of an agreement on a multilateral  free-trade zone among Russia and all the other CIS states. "We  are now transforming these bilateral treaties into multilateral  ones," the minister stressed. In his opinion, this agreement  could begin operating in the very near future. "It all depends  on how long it takes each republic to fulfill all the legal  requirements," he explained. A significant place among the  package of documents signed by the premiers is occupied by the  agreement on the development of production, credit and finance,  insurance, and mixed transnational associations, which enshrines  the obligation of the sides to ensure state support for  cooperation among economic players in the CIS countries  (regardless of forms of ownership). The draft concept of a  payments union was also examined and some amendments were made  to take into account the "distinctive character" of the former  Soviet republics. Unlike the European interpretation of the  concept, we are going to view it merely as a system of  agreements on the reciprocal convertibility of national  currencies. The document is essentially a program for the  organization of payment and settlement relations among the CIS  states with their own national currencies. On the basis of this  concept a multilateral agreement on a payments union will be  prepared before the end of the year.</p>

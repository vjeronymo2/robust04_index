			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by (top): "Territorial Projects Will Be in the Form </F> of Systems Measures; Newly Conceived Active Employment Policy  Instruments Involve Seven Topical Groups"]    [Text] As of the second half of this year, some new or  newly conceived active employment policies (APZ) are expected to  be introduced into practice. The philosophy of the changes was  approved by the leadership of the Ministry of Labor and Social  Affairs in January; subsequently, directors of labor offices  were familiarized with this philosophy. The document divides the  instruments of APZ into seven topical groups as follows:  <H5>  1. Job Training </H5>   A change in the structure of professions is the most  effective APZ instrument available in solving the discrepancy  between supply and demand in the area of manpower.  Organizationally, job training will be handled on three  levels--at the initiative of the labor offices, at the  initiative of applicants for employment themselves, and at the  initiative of employers.    In the first case--that is to say, in the case of activities  organized by the labor offices--the goal is to provide room for  the training of applicants who lack any previous work  experience, to facilitate the deliberate training of applicants  who have been registered at the labor office for more than six  months (and, in limited quantities, also provide for nonspecific  training), and, finally, to provide nonspecific training for  those who have been registered for long periods. The financing  of this type of activity will be accomplished in the same manner  as has been the case for requalification up to now.    An applicant or a person interested in employment may  initiate his own job training if, on the one hand, the labor  office recognizes the purposefulness of this training in terms  of subsequent job placement, and also a person (who is already  unemployed or one who has already received notice according to  Section 46, Letters a through c, of the Labor Code) whose  existing profession is unassertable in the labor market. In the  case of applicants for specific jobs, the labor office may  defray up to two-thirds of the costs involved; in the event of  the nonspecific training of those interested in employment, it  may defray up to one-third of the costs, and, in the case of  specific training of job applicants, it may again defray up to  two-thirds of the overall costs.    Training organized by an employer is intended to cover the  need for manpower in the case of a change in production from  existing resources, and, on the other hand, it is intended to  facilitate the smooth transition to other jobs for those  employees who are released for so-called organizational reasons.  In case of an employee whom the organization would be  demonstrably releasing (and whose profession is not very  assertable on the labor market) but whom the organization would  continue to employ after retraining, the state share of  financing this training could amount to up to one-half of the  costs. If a released worker is being retrained (and has an  unassertable profession) for another employer (customized  training), the compensation paid by the state could amount to as  much as two-thirds of the costs. The same is true where an  organization is training employees of another institution that  it will subsequently hire.  <H5>  2. Contractual Jobs </H5>   The currently not overly clear category of "socially  purposeful job" (SUPM) will be replaced by the precisely defined  variations used in creating so-called contractual jobs (SM):    All types of financial assistance applicable to the present  SUPM categories will be applicable to the SM categories in the  form of self-employment by applicants and selected groups of  those interested in employment in the form of individual  entrepreneurial activity (plus the subsequent possible creation  of additional jobs). The specific types of compensation of costs  connected with the development of new jobs will be judged by the  labor offices; the maximum possible amount of the contribution  will amount to 60,000 korunas [Kc] (a condition for this is the  minimum two-year existence of a given job).    Contractual jobs with employers should contribute to solving  the problems of regional unemployment (particularly in regard to  the more poorly assertable professions). The Ministry of Labor  and Social Affairs plus other organs of state administration  shall periodically establish regions (identified by name or  through the form of criteria) in which it is possible to provide  financial support for this type of contractual job. The  appropriate labor office will then announce a selection  proceeding. For purposes of solving unemployment in certain  territories by shifting manpower to another region, there should  be the possibility of announcing this proceeding even outside of  the territory administered by the initiating labor office  (following agreement with the office that has jurisdiction in  that region). But, fundamentally, these must be new jobs for  registered applicants. In such a case, the financing is the same  as for all types of existing SUPM creations, with a maximum  amount of the contribution per job amounting to Kc50,000. It is  expected that the possibility will exist to defray all types of  ongoing and one-time costs connected with the creation and  operation of the job involved (according to the judgment of the  labor office), but for a maximum period of 12 months. The  developed contractual job must exist for a period of two years.    An instrument to facilitate entrance to the labor market is  represented by contractual jobs in the form of specialized work  done by graduates of schools and by young people. The method is  again the announcement of a selection proceeding (following  agreement with the labor office, even in another region). The  overall sum of the state contribution per job must not exceed  Kc50,000. The time limit for defraying these expenses is 12  months. In justified cases, where the employment conditions are  terminated prematurely, however, the labor office may forgo the  enforced recovery of the resources expended.    The temporary placement of unqualified applicants for  employment (and those who are difficult to retrain), with the  objective of finding them long-term employment, is the principal  motive behind the development of those contractual jobs  categorized as short-term employment for those who are difficult  to place. These jobs should come into being on the basis of  agreement between the labor office and the employing institution  on a priority basis in such cases where the employer pledges to  maintain at least a portion of the jobs that have been developed.    In such a case, the state may compensate the employer for  wages paid for a period of six months for contractual jobs so  created and may, moreover, pay him a contribution of Kc20,000,  provided the employer pledges to maintain the job in question  for an additional 12 months and employs the original applicant  in that position. Furthermore, the employer may receive  compensation for wages paid for a leader of a working group made  up of at least five such short-term employees for a period of  six months. The group leader need not be a job applicant of  record but must not be originally a basic employee of the  institution involved.  <H5>  3. Public Investments </H5>   A new instrument of the APZ--employment on public investment  projects--differs conceptually from the previous understanding.  Work categorized as periodic activities of community and public  entities will no longer be subsidized; rather, support will be  forthcoming for investments made from public resources, which  will create prerequisites for the development of new and  permanent jobs.    It will be possible to finance this kind of activity to the  full extent of wage expenses incurred by placed applicants (12  months), the costs of mobility (possibly even of providing  quarters for a period of six months) of employees who have been  hired, and the wage costs even for the group leader (with at  least five subordinates) who is not an original employee of the  institution involved.  <H5>  4. Employing the Physically Handicapped </H5>   Support for the creation of jobs for citizens with impaired  work abilities or those who are permanently handicapped will  mainly take the form of subsidies for newly created protected  workplaces and their operation. The state contribution per job  developed can, in extreme cases, amount to as much as Kc100,000  (in the event a permanently handicapped person is placed). A  condition is a minimum two-year duration of this job. The state  contribution toward the operation of a protected workshop (work  site) will amount to as much as Kc20,000 per job, in the event  this is essential for purposes of preserving that job.  <H5>  5. Partial Employment Agreements </H5>   Employment on the basis of other than a complete work  agreement should solve the work assertion of individuals who are  not in a position to accept a complete work agreement (for  example, those caring for a child, etc.). Moreover, this form of  employment should form a certain barrier against releasing  employees in cases where the employer is switching over to a new  production program.    Financially, it is possible to cover all types of expenses  connected with the establishment of such a job (for example,  even a contribution for transporting material in the case of  work at home, etc., is possible). The total contribution must  not exceed Kc25,000 and can be available for a maximum of 12  months. The job must exist for at least two years.    The new system of an active employment policy no longer  counts on employing people on the basis of a partial employee  obligation (so-called kurzarbeit--short-term work).  This instrument will be utilized individually only in cases  where its effectiveness is clearly documented.  <H5>  6. Transport Contribution </H5>   This is a new instrument of an APZ that will make it  possible  to mitigate the negative impact of a reduced number of  transportation lines usable for commuting to work. "Clients" in  this case are thus the job applicants whose placement is  demonstrably hampered by nonexistent transport connections.    The regions in which this instrument will be applied will be  determined either by the Directorate of Employment Services of  the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or jobs of this type  will come into being at the initiative of the labor offices or  directly at the initiative of job applicants.    Subsidizing opportunities will consist of the state paying  part of the cost of the employer incurred for transporting  workers (on the basis of temporary calculations). The maximum  monthly subsidy per job, however, can be at the most Kc1,000 and  will be paid for a maximum of one year.  <H5>  7. Projects Involving the Territorial Revival of Employment </H5>   A new APZ instrument in the form of regional projects for  the  revival of employment has as its goal the systems solution of  this problem in those regions that are most impacted. These  projects formulate the most effective variation of the money  flow to support the APZ and recommend even additional possible  measures that contribute to solving unemployment (for example,  the economic stimulation of suitable entrepreneurial efforts at  various locations, etc.).    The processing of these projects will be entrusted to  specifically identified firms (for example, institutions that  have experience regarding territorial planning, and organs of  state administration and self-administration should be  participating on a "subsupplier" basis (free of charge). The  project will be assigned on the basis of a selection proceeding,  announced by the labor office and evaluated by a coordinating  commission (made up of representatives of the region--for  example, the okres office, the self-administration office, the  labor office, the education office, the bank, etc.). This same  commission is simultaneously the control organ for the project.    The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs will identify those  regions in which it is possible to finance projects of  territorial employment revival out of state resources. This  means the compensation of costs (up to their full extent)  incurred for processing the project, as well as the costs of the  activities of the coordinating commission (for a period  determined by the labor office, and to a maximum of Kc30,000).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] TOKYO, May 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  told a visitor from China on Wednesday [11 May] that Japan will  broaden the teaching of history in schools to inform the younger  generations about Japan's acts of aggression before and during  World War II, Foreign Ministry officials said.    In a meeting with Liu Peng, the visiting president of the  All-China Youth Federation, Hata was quoted as saying, "Japan  must tell the generations of its offspring that such incidents  (acts of aggression) occurred." The two met at his official  residence.    Liu told Hata he was "surprised" at the remark by former  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who caused widespread anger by  calling the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication." Nagano  resigned Saturday and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai.    "The remark was made by an elderly man and I know that  Japanese youth does not have such a perception," Liu was quoted  as saying.    In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI  SHIMBUN published May 4, Nagano said the actions of the Imperial  Japanese Army was aimed at liberating Asian countries from  Western colonialism.    Hata told Liu Japan "feels deep repentance" over the Nagano  remarks and is determined not to repeat a war of aggression.</p>

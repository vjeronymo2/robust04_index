			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing, April 3 (AFP)--The whereabouts of  China's leading dissident, Wei Jingsheng, were unclear Sunday [3  April], with his secretary unable to confirm an official report  that he had been released from police detention. According to  the official Xinhua news agency, Wei was released shortly after  being picked up and questioned by police Friday as he was  attempting to return to Beijing from the nearby port city of  Tianjin.    "The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau summoned Wei  Jingsheng and had a talk with him yesterday," Xinhua said in a  brief dispatch late Saturday. "Wei left the bureau immediately  afterwards," it added. The dispatch gave no reason for Wei's  detention and no indication as to his present circumstances.    However, Wei's secretary Tong Yi, who was travelling in the  same car as the 43-year-old dissident when he was stopped and  detained on the outskirts of Beijing, said Sunday that she was  unaware of his release. "I have not seen him and he hasn't  called me," Tong said by telephone, adding that she had no idea  of his whereabouts.    The secretary had earlier said that she hoped Wei would be  released after 24 hours, as happened when he was detained during  a police sweep of at least 15 dissidents in Shanghai and Beijing  in early March. Following his release at that time, Wei left  Beijing on March 6, for what his secretary said was a period of  recuperation, and had not attempted to return to the capital  until Friday.

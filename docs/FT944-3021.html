			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (9): New home for CAF The Charities Aid Foundation, which works to increase the resources available to charities, is to lease a new 35,000sq ft building at the Kings Hill business park, close to the M20, in Kent. The CAF's new headquarters (pictured here in model form) has been designed by the architect Nicholas Hare. Kings Hill developers Rouse Kent say it will incorporate the controlled use of daylight and natural ventilation, avoiding the use of air-conditioning. The Pounds 5.25m project is being funded by Liberty Property Trust, the American parent of Rouse Kent. Work started this month on the building, which is expected to be ready for occupation by the autumn. Initially, 170 staff from the CAF's offices in Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells will move to Kings Hill, and occupy two-thirds of the building. The extra space will allow the CAF to expand, and will be sub-let until needed.</p>

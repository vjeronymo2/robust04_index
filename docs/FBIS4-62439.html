			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX Friday [13 May],  Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy rejected, in no  uncertain terms, information on Ukrainian troop buildup on the  Crimean Peninsula. Earlier, the Chairman of the Russian State  Duma's Commission on Commonwealth Affairs Konstantin Zatulin  said that Kiev sent mostly residents of its western provinces to  serve in Crimea and that it had increased to 50,000 the strength  of its Crimean contingent.    Radetskyy did not know where Zatulin found the figure and  said residents of all provinces were sent to serve in Crimea.    According to Radetskyy, the Black Sea Fleet, police force,  elite police units and paramilitary guards taken together would  number 50,000.</p>

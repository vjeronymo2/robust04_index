			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan Telecom slips 42% to Y6.16bn Japan Telecom yesterday announced a 42 per cent slide in interim unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y6.16bn (Dollars 63m) from Y10.63bn a year ago. JT is one of the leading domestic long-distance telecommunications concerns, and listed on the second section of the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges in September this year. At the net level, profits declined by 29 per cent to Y4.05bn, compared with Y5.66bn, on sales 36 per cent higher at Y149.75bn, compared with Y110.38bn. JT attributed the rise in sales largely to long-distance domestic phone services and its personal handyphone system (PHS), launched with a Tokyo Electric Power subsidiary. By products, domestic long distance and public telephone line service sales grew 36 per cent to Y132.77bn, lease line service sales grew 5.4 per cent to Y11.20bn, and PHS sales were almost three times higher at Y5.78bn. There was a steep drop in operating costs to Y33.15bn from Y51.14bn as a result of sharp cuts in retail, advertising, personnel and management costs, JT reported. However, the operating profit advanced only 0.1 per cent to Y16.29bn because of a Y62.71bn access charge paid to Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone (NTT) to connect JT's lines to NTT's. Previously, the access charge had been added to customers' bills instead of being paid directly by Japan Telecom. Japan Telecom also reported an Y5.47bn fee for listing on the Japanese equities market in September, affecting earnings growth at pre-tax and net profit levels. For the full year to end-March 1995, Japan Telecom is forecasting recurring profits of Y17bn, against an earlier forecast of Y16.02 and last year's actual Y16.23bn, net profits of Y9.2bn (Y8.54bn, Y8.42bn) and sales of Y309bn (Y325.47bn, Y250.75bn). In Tokyo yesterday, Japan Telecom's share price closed Y18,000 lower at Y965,000. In August, Japan Telecom and Nissan Motor announced they would establish a joint venture company, called Digital Tu-Ka Chugoku, to provide a mobile phone business in western Japan.</p>

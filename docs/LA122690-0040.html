			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEW COLD FRONT MAY THREATEN GROWERS' CITRUS, AVOCADO TREES  </P> <P> With much of Ventura County's citrus and avocado crop already devastated by  last weekend's freeze, growers may now have to fight to save the trees  themselves, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Farmers and other county residents enjoyed a brief reprieve of warm weather  Christmas Day as temperatures reached near 70 in inland communities, National  Weather Service meteorologist Terry Schaeffer said.  </P> <P> But by Saturday and Sunday, the next cold front from the Northwest will again  deliver freezing temperatures that will top out in the 40s or low 50s during  the day and dip into the low 20s at night, Schaeffer said.  </P> <P> Temperatures could plunge even further throughout the county if the cold front  contains an air mass that originated in Siberia before it moved across the  Arctic to the Pacific.  </P> <P> The results could be severe, he said.  </P> <P> "If the colder Arctic air comes down the coast and doesn't veer off into the  southwest desert, we may reach the point where the growers will have to forget  trying to save the fruit and just try to save their trees," Schaeffer said.  </P> <P> Last weekend, much of the coast and some inland areas -- including the  agriculturally rich Santa Clara Valley and the Los Posas and Santa Rosa valleys  -- were spared the several hours of sustained frost that cripples trees. But  those areas probably will not be as lucky this weekend, he said.  </P> <P> "This might be a much more democratic-type freeze," he said.  </P> <P> Schaeffer said satellite information today should tell growers for certain  whether the Arctic mass will skirt the county or cast a pall of heavy frost  over the county's biggest agricultural commodity -- lemons, worth $164 million  in 1989.  </P> <P> County agriculture officials estimated the crop damage at $100 million  countywide Monday. But the losses could surge, reaching into the crop yields  for the next two or three years if the extremely cold freeze hits, said Richard  Pidduck, a citrus and avocado grower in Santa Paula Canyon along California 150  north of Santa Paula.  </P> <P> "My entire avocado crop is 100% loss," he said. "And I suspect my citrus is  largely lost. We can't suffer much more fruit damage, but if we get a lot of  wood damage on the trees, they could be out of production for two or three  years."  </P> <P> Pidduck said each crop is worth about $100,000 to his ranch a year.  </P> <P> He said the losses will mean lean years for the growers and higher prices to  consumers.  </P> <P> If consumers "don't begrudge us the occasional good year we have in citrus and  avocado farming, we won't complain too loudly about the occasional bad year,"  said Pidduck, whose family has farmed in Ventura County since the early 1900s.  </P> <P> At Pidduck's orchard, the broad leaves of the tall avocado trees were darkened  and limp, their edges burned and crisp. Many of the usually waxy green leaves  on the lemon trees were gold and curled, causing the tree to rattle when the  wind blew.  </P> <P> The new lemon trees, the most vulnerable to freeze damage, lost much of their  foliage, and the tiny fruit they bore had turned into dark marble-sized balls.  </P> <P> Orange trees, the hardiest of the citrus crop, fared better, with much of the  damage limited to the leaves.  </P> <P> Randy Axell said some of his 100-acre citrus and avocado ranch near Santa Paula  had been spared from the freeze last weekend.  </P> <P> "This particular ranch isn't a total loss yet," he said. "We still have a lot  of optimism. But there are a lot of folks out there who were a lot less  fortunate than us."  </P> <P> Growers can do little more than they have already done to combat the coming  freeze, they said. They spray with a plastic-like substance, run wind machines  and sprinklers to keep the temperatures high, and fire up orchard heaters.  </P> <P> They can further protect trees by wrapping them or shoveling dirt around their  trunks, Schaeffer said. But how they handle their own orchards is an individual  economic decision.  </P> <P> "Do they concentrate the pots in the warmer areas and write off the other  trees, or pay people to shovel dirt all night?" he asked. He is seeking advice  from an agricultural expert at the University of Florida, where the citrus  industry has weathered several severe freezes.  </P> <P> Schaeffer said little if any rain or snow will come with the cold front that is  moving toward the area, so the county will find no drought relief in the cold.  </P></p>

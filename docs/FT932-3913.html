			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments advances 24% to Pounds 10.6m OXFORD INSTRUMENTS, the advanced instrumentation group, yesterday reported a 24 per cent increase in full year profits and another strong performance from its MRI scanner joint venture with Siemens. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 28 increased to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 8.56m), on turnover down 2 per cent to Pounds 101.1m (Pounds 103.3m). Interest income expanded from Pounds 357,000 to Pounds 1.1m. Earnings per share increased more modestly to 15p (14.7p), reflecting a return to 'more normal' tax rates following the release of provisions last year. A proposed final dividend of 3.1p, makes a total for the year of 4.5p (4.3p). Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, highlighted the 'excellent performance' of Oxford Magnet Technology, the MRI scanner joint venture with Siemens. OMT, which is 49 per cent owned by Oxford, contributed Pounds 6.05m (Pounds 5.1m) to group profits. Operating profits from the group's core businesses improved by 11.8 per cent to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 3.1m). The group spent Pounds 7m on research and development last year and several important new products were released. Net cash at the year end stood at some Pounds 6.7m, up Pounds 2.4m. Meanwhile the company is building a second synchrotron - a device that enables semiconductor manufacturers to pack more circuits onto microchips than with conventional systems. Mr Williams said the company was confident of selling the machine, which has a price tag of about Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m). COMMENT The results from Oxford were better than the market expected and helped lift the share price by 14p to 261p. Although operating margins are still too thin, the group seems to be heading in the right direction once more following two years of profits decline. With 85 per cent of business coming from outside the UK, the group should benefit from sterling's depreciation. Nevertheless there are uncertainties, including concerns about the body scanner market in the US, where health costs are under the microscope, and Oxford's expensive 'gamble' on the Synchrotron. These make profit forecasts hazardous, but with the shares trading on a prospective p/e of about 15 they may still be worth a flutter.</p>

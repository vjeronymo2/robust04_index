			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / BTR advance helped by Hawker Siddeley acquisition BTR, the industrial conglom-erate, yesterday reported a 7 per cent increase in interim profits as benefits from last year's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of Hawker Siddeley offset a small fall from the group's old businesses. Sir Owen Green, chairman, said acquisitions had provided an 'oasis of opportunities' in the economic desert. Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said BTR should be ready to make another acquisition next year and that recession would allow the group to 'go after another large underperforming industrial company'. In the six months to end-June, BTR's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 512m to Pounds 548m on sales 33 per cent higher at Pounds 4.3bn. Earnings per share rose 1.7 per cent to 17.7p and the interim dividend is to be raised 3.3 per cent to 7.75p. Without Hawker Siddeley, BTR's sales would have fallen about Pounds 100m and profits about Pounds 40m. This deterioration was almost entirely because of the 'dreadful' construction sector, the company said. BTR also used acquisition accounting to add another Pounds 160m of goodwill write-offs to the Pounds 270m of provisions already set up last year after the Hawker Siddeley purchase. The latest write-off covered Pounds 110m of provisions, some for contingent liabilities and a Pounds 50m adjustment to property values. Miss Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said the latest provisions, flagged at the end of the last financial year, would be the final ones relating to Hawker. The group cut net debt from Pounds 2.13bn to Pounds 1.90bn - and gearing from 89 per cent to 79 per cent - helped by better working capital control and Pounds 230m of proceeds from disposals. Operating margins fell from 15 per cent to 13.9 per cent overall. But at Hawker Siddeley, cost cutting - rather than the usual BTR price increases - led to margins rising from about 6.7 per cent to the low teens. Mr Robert Faircloth, chief operating officer, said signs of recovery earlier this year in the US had not materialised. In the UK, which now accounts for a larger proportion of BTR's sales after the Hawker acquisition, the economy was 'flat - I would like to believe it is not declining'. BTR's shares rose 19p to 425p.

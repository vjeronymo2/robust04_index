			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Arts: Folk to the fore John Drummond would once have agreed with Thomas Beecham - 'try everything once, apart from incest and folk dancing.' Now he has changed his mind, at least about folk dancing. As director of the European Arts Festival he has decreed that almost a fifth of his Pounds 6m budget will be devoted to folk festivals. This is understandable. Folk music is international and bubbles up from the community. With only three months to plan the Festival, the brainchild of John Major and created to celebrate the UK's six month Presidency of the European Community from July 1, it is naturally strong on relatively inexpensive grass roots events and short on big and costly galas which take time to organise. Drummond, who has just retired as Controller of Radio 3, has spread the Government's money over 600 events. His aims have been to permeate the whole country, to include all art forms, and to reflect the artistic life of the eleven other community members. In many cases he has given money to events that were gleams in the eye of the organisers but which needed extra cash to come to full fruition. Among those coming to the UK are the Theatre du Soleil Ariane Mnouchkine, presenting The House of Atreus in a former carpet factory in Bradford; the Piccolo Theatre from Milan and Franco Zeffirelli's company, both coming to the National Theatre in London with, respectively, La Baruffe Chiozzotte by Goldoni and Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author; and Greek Theatre Attis from Athens appearing in Cardiff and Belfast with a modern version of The Persians. Dance is enhanced by the Netherlands Dance Theatre paying its first visit for 17 years, in Bradford, and Pina Bausch returning to the UK, to the Edinburgh Festival, after a ten year gap, plus Wim Vanderkuybus from Brussels, at Oxford, Nottingham and Newcastle, and the Bagouet Company from Montpellier on its first UK visit. Among the foreign orchestras coming are the Royal Concertgebouw and the Berlin Radio Orchestra. Many of the grander events considered, like Pavarotti in Tosca at Covent Garden and the British premiere of Stockhausen's Sternklang in Birmingham, would have happened anyway, but Festival money smoothed the way and it has enabled the Royal Opera to put on a Piazza live relay of Tosca.</p>

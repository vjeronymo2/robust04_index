			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Visiting Japanese Deputy  Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata formally  proposed to North Korea here on Sunday [9 January] that the two  countries resume their normalization talks suspended since  November 1992.    In a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to  China, Hata said, ``Japan hopes to resume the normalization  talks at an early date.''    The Japanese minister said that he discussed this offer  during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen,  who he said welcomed it.    Western sources here said unofficial contacts had already  begun between the Japanese and North Korean Embassies in Beijing  on matters related to resuming the normalization talks.    They said Japan first expressed their willingness to resume  the talks to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing toward the  close of last year.    ``The time of the resumption of the talks could possibly be  either next month or March,'' one of the sources said.    Regarding the North Korean nuclear issues, Minister Hata  said  Japan and China agreed that the recent substantial progress in  U.S.- North Korea contacts was a welcome development.    Hata added he believes North Korea would not resort to any  careless acts inasmuch as their nuclear question is directly  linked to peace and stability in the whole region of Northeast  Asia let alone the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: ONCE-IN-A-CENTURY TASTE TESTING OF LATOUR, THE 'DALLAS COWBOYS OF  WINE'  </P> <P> In the long history of Bordeaux, one property stands out as a beacon of the  region, a chateau so well known that its very name prompts wine lovers to  swoon.  </P> <P> It is Chateau Latour and it is a property with a long, regal and in some ways  mystifyingly low-key image. The wine of Latour is deep and brooding, intensely  flavored and hard to evaluate when young because of the richness and depth.  </P> <P> Moreover, almost no house in all of Bordeaux has such an amazing track record  for producing fine wine even in the worst of vintages as has Latour. And thus  when Riverside wine lover Bipin Desai recently sent out invitations to a  once-in-a-century tasting of a range of Latours dating back into the 1800s, the  response was quick.  </P> <P> Held at three Los Angeles restaurants and spanning two dinners and a luncheon,  Desai's amazing event attracted wine lovers from afar, and clearly this was due  to the reputation of the chateau for making great wine, year in and out.  </P> <P> At this point it is appropriate to point out that Latour, being one of the  famed First Growth Bordeaux houses of France, gained its fame in part,  ironically, by the greatness of the other First Growth wines, and from Latour's  comparison with them. Were it not for the brilliance in Chateaux  Mouton-Rothschild, Lafite-Rothschild, Margaux and Haut-Brion, Latour would have  nothing to which it might be compared and for which it is renowned.  </P> <P> The fact is that Latour is highly praised in part because it is among the  darkest, deepest, most concentrated wines on the planet that still has the  ability to charm the pants off you. Its First Growth cousins have their own  attributes, and each has its champions, but Latour is sort of the Dallas  Cowboys of the wine game: even in an off-year its fans love 'em.  </P> <P> Latour is often compared with Lafite, its neighbor in Pauillac, in terms of  quality. And comparing them is a sport unto itself. For my money, it was best  stated by Hugh Johnson, the lyric author of dozens of wine books, who compared  the properties in his Modern Encyclopedia of Wine. The text is poetry of a high  level:  </P> <P> "The quality of each is set in relief by the very different qualities of the  other. Lafite is a tenor; Latour a bass . . . Lafite is a dance; Latour a  parade."  </P> <P> I was unable to attend Desai's Latour extravaganza, with wines dating back more  than 120 years, though I did taste a few of the youngest wines. But I  interviewed Alan Hare, president of Latour, and Christian Le Sommer, Latour's  wine maker, before the event and their comments about Latour give a perspective  on the property.  </P> <P> And one key element is the relatively greater consistency in the wines of  Latour over the last 20 years compared with wines made between the 1930s and  1960s.  </P> <P> "If we have a byword it is consistency," said Hare, acknowledging that that  word was not always used to describe Latour during that earlier four-decade  period.  </P> <P> A British firm acquired Latour in 1963 after it had fallen into disrepair, and  Hare said when the company, Pearson Group, took it over, "50% of the vines were  dead," and the wine making facility hadn't been renovated in ages.  </P> <P> There is a marvelous (perhaps apocryphal) tale that Harry Waugh, former  director of Latour, likes to tell about the sale of Latour by the de Beaumont  family, owners for nearly 300 years.  </P> <P> Waugh says that British banker-financier Lord Cowdray was told by his staff  that Latour was for sale and could be a good purchase. After investigating and  seeing the investment potential, Cowdray, apparently a lover of spirits, is  reported to have said, "I'll buy the place as long as I don't have to drink the  bloody stuff."  </P> <P> That sale benefited Latour, France and all wine lovers because the new owners  began to modernize the place, and Hare pointed out, "We have made a big  investment over the last 20 years." Le Sommer added that much of the  improvement in Latour has come in the vineyard.  </P> <P> One reason for the depth of this wine, in addition to the familiar arguments  that quality and style are due mostly to soil and climate, is that the chateau  uses two methods to limit the size of production (to no more than 25,000 cases  a year, often less).  </P> <P> One technique is simply not harvesting all the grapes that French law permits.  Hare said, moreover, that Latour has reduced even the crop it was harvesting  between 1970 and 1980, when the house produced some awfully good wine.  </P> <P> The second technique came about as a result of the massive replanting job that  faced Pearson in the 1960s. In an effort to maximize the land that has always  been Latour, the managers located two parcels that are not in the center of the  property, but which grow grapes that have essentially the same characteristics  as the primary land.  </P> <P> The two remote parcels produce some excellent lots of wine, said Le Sommer, but  the quality is simply a tad low for inclusion most years into Latour. So in  1966 a "second wine" was made for the first time.  </P> <P> Les Forts de Latour, with a label quite similar to Latour itself, is made from  grapes off the remote plots as well as from vats of Latour wine deemed not to  be of Grand Vin status, which generally is from vines that are less than 10  years old. And, said Hare, Les Forts de Latour is not sold the same way most  other chateaux second wines are sold.  </P> <P> "We tend to keep it in the bottle long enough, to make sure it is not drunk too  young," he said. The 1966 wine wasn't released until 1970, about a year or two  after most of the other second wines of the top chateaux, and the 1983 is the  current release, with the '84 to be released soon.  </P> <P> Hare admitted, "We haven't been doing a good enough job" of promoting Les Forts  de Latour, though it usually represents excellent quality at a most reasonable  price. I have a few bottles left of the 1970 Les Forts de Latour that is  absolutely wonderful wine, and Desai noted recently that the 1966 Les Forts is  one of the best wines of the vintage, rivaling Latour itself.  </P> <P> Desai's three-meal tasting event was not the first time a so-called "vertical  tasting" of Latour has been staged. English author Edmund Penning-Rowsell wrote  in his book "Bordeaux" of many he has attended. But Hare praised the Desai  event as "one of the most profound tastings of this sort we've ever done,  because the best way to find out about a wine is to have it with food."  </P> <P> Desai, a physicist at the University of California at Riverside, said the best  wines of the tasting were, expectedly, from the greatest vintages, and he said  the 1961 was "incredibly impressive, and the '64 was remarkable. But the thing  that impressed us was the wines of the 1980s -- one vintage after the other  they made excellent wines."  </P> <P> (As a side note here, Desai said he and other attendees liked the '82, though  when I ran through the first two decades of Latour at the first evening, I was  very disappointed with the initial aroma of the wine. I found the '78 and '81  to be superb.)  </P> <P> The single best wine? Desai said it was a toss-up, with some tasters preferring  the 1928, some the '45 and some the 1970, "and the 1900, tasted from a magnum,  was superb."  </P> <P> Desai said he had read so often of Latour's ability to make top wine even in  off vintages that he arranged one flight of wines all of which were from off  vintages, including bottles from 1940 and 1944, when the vines were poorly  tended because of the war. "All the off-year wines were excellent in the sense  that from some other producers, wines from these vintages would have been  undrinkable," he said.  </P> <P> Alan Hare will next be in the United States in a few weeks conducting a tour of  Bordeaux producers as they unveil the 1987 wines. I noted to Hare that 1987 was  considered a rather poor vintage in Bordeaux.  </P> <P> "Yes, that's why I asked to conduct this tour. We're quite proud of our '87."  It is, after all, a Latour.  </P> <P> Wine of the Week: 1988 Kendall-Jackson Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50) -- Some purists  may wince when they sip this wine and find there is a trace of residual sugar.  But after they say that, watch them drink up two or three more glasses to prove  it to themselves. This is about as yummy a wine as Sauvignon Blanc can produce,  with pear, melon and apple scents and a trace of lime. Hang the dollop of  sugar; it's delicious wine.  </P></p>

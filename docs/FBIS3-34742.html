			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton announced yesterday that  if North Korea prevents an inspection by the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of its nuclear installations,  economic sanctions will be imposed. These remarks by the U.S.  President came exactly one week after North Korea called the  United States a paper tiger and stated that it will be the loser  if another war breaks out in the Korean subcontinent.    Despite agreements in principle between the United States  and  North Korea last month, during the past couple of weeks a strong  propaganda war has been waged by the two countries. Pyongyang  believes that on the pretext that North Korea is manufacturing  nuclear weapons, the United States is engineering plots to cause  a war with North Korea. From Pyongyang's point of view, even  though North Korea has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact  and has allowed the IAEA to inspect North Korean nuclear  installations, the IAEA--influenced by some countries--has acted  contrary to its main duties and is aiming imaginary accusations  at North Korea for political reasons.    At any rate, for 10 months the topic of North Korea's  nuclear  arms has been a gauge to measure the pressure in relations  between Washington and Pyongyang, and this pressure has  fluctuated from threats to encouragements.    The recent U.S. threat to impose economic sanctions on North  Korea can be studied on two levels. The first is the level of  bilateral relations, in which case the sanctions will not be  very effective. The second is the level of collective acts, in  which case the United States will face two problems. The first  problem is that it is difficult to attract the attention of  countries, especially the permanent Security Council members and  specifically China, on this issue. The second problem is that  if these threats materialize, the crisis in U.S.-North Korean  relations will enter a dangerous phase because if North Korea is  put under economic pressures, it may resort to acts that will  have unfavorable consequences.</p>

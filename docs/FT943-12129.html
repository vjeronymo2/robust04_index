			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Washington tries to salvage crime bill The White House and a congressional committee are working feverishly to find common ground on tough anti-crime legislation that has a high priority in the Clinton administration. The group of proposed laws, known as the crime bill, passed the Senate and House in varying forms this spring. But disputes over racial implications of the death penalty, and over an assault weapons ban, have kept the bill for weeks in a House-Senate conference committee. It was to meet late yesterday for what could be final negotiations. If a bill acceptable to all of Congress is not released this week, no enactment is likely this year. President Bill Clinton met leaders of the powerful Congressional black caucus yesterday morning to seek a compromise on a provision in the House version of the bill that would let defendants use statistics to challenge the death penalty - allowed in 37 states - as racially biased. Senate Republicans have threatened a filibuster to kill any crime bill that includes 'racial justice' provisions. Also causing trouble for the bill is a ban on 19 brands of assault weapon. The ban passed the House and Senate but is adamantly opposed by Mr Jack Brooks, House chairman of the conference committee. Many gun control advocates in Congress think the ban in the final version of the bill will have the votes to pass and so they feel the committee should not try to compromise with Mr Brooks.</p>

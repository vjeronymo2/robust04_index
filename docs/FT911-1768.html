			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A spring of discontent THE prospect of another summer of industrial action on Britain's railways beckons. Exasperation with what passes for normal service on London Underground and British Rail was one reason why commuters sympathised with workers during the last outbreak of strikes in the summer of 1989. They blamed managers rather than workers for the daily assault by overcrowding and delays. Two years on, that exasperation has pushed the quality of public services issue up the political agenda. The prime minister has singled out education as an area for reform, the health service row rumbles on and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, has questioned the expansion of road transport; railways are finding cautious political favour. Much of the renewed discontent among rail workers comes down to money. Unions have rejected a 7 per cent pay offer which British Rail says is the most it can afford within government financing limits in a recession; it expects to overspend by Pounds 650m in this financial year. The strife on London Underground has been prompted by cuts of 1,005 jobs and new working rosters after the corporation made unexpected losses of Pounds 92m. There are more complex issues in the background. British Rail is already in dispute with unions over working patterns. It hopes to obtain seven-day rostering in return for higher basic pay. London Underground plans more flexible working for station staff after its Action Stations package fell victim to the 1989 industrial action. Neither BR nor London Underground is acting unreasonably in trying to hold down wages. Both face financial constraints and BR argues that the fall in the rate of inflation over the coming financial year means a 7 per cent rise will improve living standards. But rail managers also know that recruitment difficulties have harmed service, and that they could be exacerbated by ill-judged settlements. London Underground's job cuts are more contentious. They may amount to no more than good housekeeping in response to automated ticket sales, but passengers can already see the impact of the new rosters in the reduced opening hours of some ticket offices. This cut in service stems from financial mismanagement rather than worker intransigence. BR has learned lessons from its hasty reform attempts of two years ago, and has been patiently pursuing changes in working patterns. These would improve service and make BR a more attractive employer. The latest union opposition looks to be based on the wish of long-serving workers to protect excessive overtime payments. Management must therefore persist with its case. The unions need to be wary of pushing their luck by seeking higher pay and opposing change. Passengers' patience with them is fragile and will become more so if London Underground and British Rail can put their case better this time than they did last. But the employers need to be careful too. The changes they want may be common practice in private manufacturing, but so too is higher pay. On the railways as elsewhere, if tight government financial restrictions continue to render hollow the rhetoric of improved public services, workers will not be solely to blame for the ensuing public discontent.</p>

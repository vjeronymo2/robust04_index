			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS FORM FEDERATION  </P> <P> Leaders of a dozen San Fernando Valley homeowners associations announced Sunday  that they have banded together as a federation to fight overdevelopment and  sponsor workshops on how to fight City Hall.  </P> <P> During a news conference on the steps of Van Nuys City Hall, the group of about  15 neighborhood activists accused city officials of ignoring homeowners'  concerns and pledged to educate the public about the building-approval process  in town-hall-style seminars.  </P> <P> Sylvia Gross of Sunland-Tujunga, president of the new San Fernando Valley  Federation, said some Valley residents are so frustrated with traffic and crime  that they have suggested that the Valley incorporate as its own city.  </P> <P> Such a campaign is not currently on the group's agenda, Gross said, but "unless  some corrective measure is taken by the planning department, this could lead to  that effort."  </P> <P> The new federation includes homeowners associations from Sunland-Tujunga in the  east to Encino in the west, mainly on the Valley floor.  </P> <P> Peter Ireland of the Reseda Community Assn. said the federation would teach  residents about state environmental laws and the planning process to make them  better watchdogs.  </P> <P> No seminars have been scheduled yet.  </P> <P> The group criticized Councilman Hal Bernson for reportedly challenging the  number of residents active in homeowners associations. But despite repeated  questions from reporters, no one representing the new federation would provide  the number of dues-paying members in its affiliated associations.  </P></p>

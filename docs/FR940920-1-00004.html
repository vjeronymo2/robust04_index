Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These improved STS were the result of extensive technical meetings and discussions among the NRC staff, industry owners groups, vendors, and the Nuclear Management and Resources Council (NUMARC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, on July 22, 1993 (58 FR 39132), the Commission published a Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, which incorporated experience and lessons learned since publication of the interim policy statement. The interim policy statement identified three criteria to be used to define which of the current technical specification requirements should be retained or included in technical specifications and which LCOs could be relocated to licensee-controlled documents, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 1: Installed instrumentation that is used to detect, and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal degradation of the reactor coolant pressure boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 2: A process variable, design feature, or operating restriction that is an initial condition of a design basis accident or transient analysis that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of a fission product barrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 3: A structure, system, or component that is part of the primary success path and which functions or actuates to mitigate a design basis accident or transient that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of a fission product barrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim policy statement also stated that, in addition to structures, systems, and components captured by the three criteria, it was the Commission's policy that licensees retain in the technical specifications LCOs for a specified list of systems that operating experience and probabalistic safety assessment had generally shown to be important to public health and safety. In the final policy statement, the Commission retained this thought as a fourth criterion to capture those requirements that operating experience or probabilistic safety assessment show to be significant to public health and safety. The final policy statement also addressed comments received on the interim policy statement and described the Commission's intent with regard to use of the criteria and their codification through rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that amending &sect;50.36 to include the four criteria contained in the final policy statement could codify a viable, potentially safety-enhancing and cost-saving method for technical specification improvement. The Commission encourages licensees to use the improved STS as the basis for plant-specific technical specifications. As stated in the final policy statement, the Commission will place the highest priority on requests based on the criteria for individual license amendments that are used to evaluate all of the LCOs for an individual plant to determine which LCOs should be included in the technical specifications. Related surveillance requirements and actions would be retained for each LCO that remains in the technical specifications. Each LCO, action, and surveillance requirement should have supporting bases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission will also entertain requests to adopt portions of the improved STS, even if the licensee does not adopt all STS improvements. These portions will include all related requirements and will normally be developed as line-item improvements by the NRC staff. The Commission encourages all licensees who submit technical specification related submittals based on these criteria to emphasize human factors principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LCOs that do not meet any of the criteria, and their associated actions and surveillance requirements, may be proposed for relocation from the technical specifications to licensee-controlled documents, such as the FSAR. The criteria may be applied to either standard or custom technical specifications. The Commission will also consider the criteria in evaluating future generic requirements for inclusion in technical specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During individual technical specification conversions, a backfit analysis will be performed in cases of nonvoluntary addition of new requirements from the improved STS to individual plant technical specifications, unless the staff-suggested additional changes are needed to make the changes requested by the licensee acceptable from the standpoint of adequate protection or compliance with NRC regulations, in which case the request may be denied without the additional items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission requests comments on the criteria being proposed for inclusion in &sect;50.36 and, particularly, on Criterion 4 and what guidelines the Commission should use in defining ``significant to public health and safety.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission regulations in Subpart A of Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and would not degrade the environment in any way. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there will be no significant impact on the environment from this proposed rule. This discussion constitutes the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for this proposed rule; a separate assessment has not been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

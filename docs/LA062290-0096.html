			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Bjorn Borg's elegant seaside home in Stockholm will be seized and sold at  auction if he doesn't pay a $1.1-million debt owed by his former business  partner, Lars Skarke, court officials said.  </P> <P> Bailiffs visited Borg's home in a Stockholm suburb to assess its value.  </P> <P> "They were not let in because nobody was home," said Bjorn Edgren, a senior  court official.  </P> <P> Borg was given an extension until July 20 to pay the debt. "Then we can use a  locksmith," Edgren said.  </P> <P> The debt owed by Skarke was personally guaranteed by the former tennis star.  Skarke was managing director of Borg's clothing company, which collapsed last  year.  </P> <P> Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, said the debt payment was being arranged from  Italy but has been delayed. He said Borg planned legal action against Skarke  aimed at getting the money back.  </P> <P> Borg also is negotiating with creditors of his failed company to pay off  millions of dollars in outstanding debts.  </P> <P> Borg reportedly is in Italy to watch World Cup soccer action with his Italian  wife, Loredana.  </P></p>

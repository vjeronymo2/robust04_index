			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FOR GALLAGHER, WINNING MILWAUKEE OPEN IS A FIRST  </P> <P> Jim Gallagher Jr. was first off the tee and first in the hole Sunday to win a  three-way playoff for the $900,000 Greater Milwaukee Open at Franklin, Wis.  </P> <P> It was the first time in his seven-year career Gallagher had finished first in  a PGA tournament.  </P> <P> "It was up to them to make the putts," Gallagher said. "I was in good shape.  The ones they had to make were tough."  </P> <P> Gallagher made an eight-foot putt for par on the par-three 17th hole and then  watched as Ed Dougherty and Billy Mayfair missed tying putts from nearly the  same distance.  </P> <P> "Going first made a difference. I wanted to get it in the hole. I had the best  putt. After I saw them hit their tee shots, I just said get it close and tap it  in," Gallagher said after collecting a $162,000 first-place check.  </P> <P> Dougherty hit his tee shot into the bunker, chipped out and missed his putt  from about eight feet. Mayfair, who had a one-shot lead before bogeying the  final hole of regulation, hit his tee shot past the green, chipped back past  the hole and then missed an eight-footer.  </P> <P> The three had finished tied at 17-under 271 through 72 holes, forcing the  playoff. Mayfair had a final-round 68 and Gallagher and Dougherty each shot 66.  </P> <P> Mike Hill birdied the first hole of a sudden-death playoff to beat Bruce  Crampton and win a $450,000 Senior PGA Tour event at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Hill's second shot on the par-four, 364-yard 16th hole landed three inches from  the cup. He tapped in for the birdie. Crampton's approach landed beyond the  green and his third shot went past the cup, leaving him a long putt.  </P> <P> Trailing by a stroke, Hill birdied the 482-yard 17th hole to tie Crampton, who  shot a 66. Crampton missed a chance to win on the 18th when his birdie attempt  from the fringe stopped on the edge of the cup.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel had six birdies for a 69 to tie Martha Nause for the lead after two  rounds of a $275,000 LPGA tournament at Springfield, Ill.  </P> <P> Daniel finished with a 36-hole total of eight-under-par 136. Nause shot a 67,  the lowest round of the day.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: WHETHER THE STYLE'S GOSPEL OR SOUL MARIAH CAREY SINGS A HEAVENLY  SONG  </P> <P> Mariah Carey is an extraordinary gospel singer -- blessed with both a  remarkable command of her upper register and the ability to invest a song with  gut-wrenching passion. Unfortunately, though, she doesn't sing much gospel.  </P> <P> Her just-released debut album, "Mariah Carey" on Columbia, is primarily  pop-soul. The first single, "Vision of Love," shot up into the Billboard Top 40  in just a few weeks -- impressive for a singer who was totally unknown a month  ago. But it's Carey's gospel-style singing that gives this album its real  charge.  </P> <P> In town recently to film a video, the 20-year-old New Yorker insisted, with the  utmost sincerity, "I'm not really good enough to sing gospel. I'm not in a  league with those really good singers."  </P> <P> She'd get a strong argument from the millions who saw her knockout gospelized  version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," televised from the opener of the  Pistons-Trail Blazers basketball championship series.  </P> <P> Like Taylor Dayne and Lisa Stansfield, Carey is a white singer who has a black  vocal style. Carey, though, is the best of the lot, with range and power not  heard perhaps since Jennifer Holliday surfaced in the mid-'80s.  </P> <P> Dance-music artist Brenda K. Starr, who hired Carey as a backup singer,  orchestrated her big break. At a party two years ago, Starr slipped Carey's  demo tape to CBS Records president Tommy Mottola, who was so impressed by her  voice that he offered her a contract.  </P> <P> Raised in New York by her mother -- an opera singer and vocal coach -- Carey  was turned on to singing as a toddler. "I wanted a career as a singer before I  was old enough to know what a career is," she quipped.  </P> <P> As a youngster, Carey thrived on jazz, R&amp;B and especially gospel. "Great  gospel singing gives me chills," she said, shivering to emphasize her point.  "There's so much passion and fire and spirit in it. It comes from way down deep  inside. When the good gospel singers sing, they soar. I wish I could soar like  that." DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Baltic employee who died worked on dealing floor THE BALTIC Exchange, which arranges most of the world's freight chartering and more than half the world's ship sales, had one employee killed and six injured, one seriously, by the IRA's bomb blast. It will lose its historic headquarters. The exchange was preparing yesterday to open for business in temporary accommodation. However, although it would have been possible to hold a market from 9am today, the exchange decided, after consultation with the police and other authorities, to delay starting. The Baltic has set up temporary headquarters in the Lloyd's of London building not far from the scene of the blast. Mr Jim Buckley, the Baltic's deputy chief executive, said: 'We could have had a market. But we will not, because it would be unwise to bring people into this area, and the police would prefer us not to.' The Baltic employee who died was Mr Thomas Casey, a 49-year-old father of four who was found under rubble after the blast. He was the most senior of the exchange's 'waiters', the 15 liveried attendants on the trading floor. He was on security duty on Friday evening. Mr Buckley described him as 'a splendid man who . . . always carried out his duties with total commitment.' Another Baltic security man is still in hospital, but four cleaners hurt in the blast were discharged after treatment. Mr Buckley praised the help given by Sir Brian Jenkins, lord mayor of London, and said offers of accommodation came 'from all round the City' soon after the extent of the devastation became clear. Some space was cleared yesterday at Lloyd's, however, and exchange staff moved some records there. The exchange's 'floor' is usually a daily meeting place for ship brokers ready to move world trade 24 hours a day. It handles more than half the world's bulk cargo movements - ore, coal and grain  - and a Baltic member has probably had a hand in the majority of cargo deals that happen on a daily basis anywhere in the world. It was to the Baltic that the UK and US turned when they needed ships for the Gulf war, and about 150 vessels were chartered to move tanks, ammunition and trucks. The Baltic owns the freehold of its building in St Mary Axe, built between 1900 and 1903, and the frontage and domed trading floor are listed as historic structures. The building is insured by Royal Insurance and other companies. Two years ago members shelved a Pounds 100m scheme to rebuild and decided instead to refurbish the existing building. Mr Ted Hartill, the City of London surveyor, said last night that the exchange building had been very badly damaged and would have to be demolished and rebuilt. The exchange expects that its usual telephone number in London - 071 623 5501 - will be working today, and in-quiries can also be made on 071 283 9300.</p>

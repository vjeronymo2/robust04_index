			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES SOCIAL SECURITY;  </P> <P> ANTIQUATED EARNINGS TEST AN INJUSTICE TO SENIOR CITIZENS;  </P> <P> THE DEPRESSION-ERA LAW PUNISHES OLDER AMERICANS WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN THE  WORK FORCE. IT HAS OUTLIVED ITS USEFULNESS AND SHOULD BE ELIMINATED.  </P> <P> For two centuries Americans have believed that they can achieve any goal if  they are willing to work for it. They savor the fact that their government will  allow them to fulfill their dreams and live a life unburdened by an oppressive  "big brother." But something has gone dreadfully wrong in America, and its  older citizens are paying the price.  </P> <P> The American dream has been tarnished by what is known as the Social Security  Earnings Test. It is a law that should be eliminated.  </P> <P> I have introduced a corrective bill in the Congress (HR 311) and am an original  supporter of Rep. J. Dennis Hastert's (R-Ill.) bill, the Older Americans  Freedom to Work Act (H.R. 2460). Both measures will end this discriminatory  practice. The Social Security Earnings Test has outlived its usefulness. It is  counterproductive and often dulls what should be the "golden years" for senior  citizens.  </P> <P> Thousands of senior citizens, many Orange County residents among them, are  being taxed into poverty by the Social Security Earnings Test, which reduces  Social Security benefits by $1 for every $3 a senior citizen earns above $9,360  annually. Combined with regular federal income and Social Security taxes,  thousands of older Americans are being taxed at a rate that exceeds 56% --  higher than the rate for millionaires.  </P> <P> So how did this regressive and unproductive test become policy? It was born out  of Depression-era reforms in 1935 to create jobs during the most grim economic  period in U.S. history. Millions of older Americans were discouraged from  staying employed. The earnings test reduced their overall income, making it  unproductive for them to work beyond retirement age. This meant younger workers  with families could have jobs.  </P> <P> Today, as we face great challenges to the economic health of our country, it is  clear that this policy is senseless and harmful.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Labor now warns that as we enter the 1990s, there will  be serious labor shortages. The nation's retirement rate has increased more  than 40% in the past 20 years. Today more than 80% of all men and 92% of all  women over the age of 65 are retired. In the next 10 years, 5 million Americans  will retire, while there will be a 1.5-million decline in the number of younger  people entering the work force.  </P> <P> As labor shortages spread across the country, we cannot afford disincentives to  work. Seniors represent an obvious source of labor that will be needed well  into the 21st Century. They have invaluable experience and know-how; and yet,  the earnings test is driving them away at an alarming rate. If seniors are  physically capable and want to continue to work, they should be able to do so  without being penalized.  </P> <P> Older Americans are staying out of the work force because of the punishing  nature of the earnings test. An estimated 1 million people opt not to work  because of this cap on their earnings.  </P> <P> Why work when you are denied the full value of your labor? Another 1 million  seniors work knowing that their Social Security benefits are cut because of the  stringent earnings test.  </P> <P> The great irony here is that, in trying to limit the cost of Social Security  benefits, the federal government is denying itself as much as $3.2 billion in  income tax revenue that could be generated by eliminating the earnings test. It  makes no sense to perpetuate such an oppressive policy and its detrimental  effect on our nation's economic health.  </P> <P> While the economic cost is great, the human cost is even greater. The earnings  test is relegating thousands of seniors who want or need to work to  unproductive, unfulfilling lives. Meddling with the right to work goes against  the very grain of the beliefs and values on which our nation was founded.  </P> <P> Moreover, we are singling out one group for undue hardship. Eliminating the  earnings test would bring much-deserved liberty to the lives of seniors who  have the right to choose how they wish to live their lives. In addition,  permitting older Americans to work allows them to be independent and free of  the government dole. It will allow them to have a happier and higher quality of  life. A self-supportive citizen is not a burden on the government.  </P> <P> We all should work to rid our system of this injurious practice. The Social  Security Earnings Test must be replaced. It has outlived its usefulness, and  now only serves only to hinder our country in its challenge to remain a world  economic power.  </P></p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Plebiscite may break logjam over second term for Menem ARGENTINA'S government has threatened to hold a plebiscite later this year to force Congress to reform the constitution and allow President Carlos Menem to run for re-election in 1995. The constitution forbids presidents from holding consecutive terms. However, the opposition Radical party is opposed to Mr Menem's re-election when his present six-year term ends. The conservative UCD party, the government's ostensible ally, is split over the issue. Senator Eduardo Menem, the president's brother and head of the Senate, said: 'Since it appears that some political forces are against the reform, I think it would be correct to consult the people directly.' A plebiscite would not have force of law, but the government is confident of wining a 70 per cent majority, which would intimidate Congress into supporting reform. Constitutional amendment has become Argentina's leading political issue. Mr Eduardo Bauza, secretary general of the presidency, warned that 'undoubtedly we are heading towards a plebiscite' unless the opposition co-operates by approving reform. A two-thirds majority of Congress is needed to convoke a constituent assembly. Mr Menem's fixation with re-election as he approaches the middle of his term is creating political uncertainty. Analysts warn that a constituent assembly could introduce social clauses that hinder economic reform. The president has said constitutional reform will not deflect his commitment to free-market policies. But his claims that he is not directly involved in a reform campaign are not widely believed. Re-election has obsessed Argentina's civilian presidents. The only leader to win re-election was Juan Peron in 1952, but the amendment was scrapped after the army toppled him in 1955. Mr Raul Alfonsn, Mr Menem's predecessor, also tried to change the constitution but the Peronists blocked his efforts.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been revealed that the inter-Korean trade is  rapidly decreasing owing to the North Korean nuclear issue.    The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy on 16 June said  that inter-Korean trade during May was $12.551 million, a  decrease of 35 percent over the same period last year.    The imports of North Korean goods into South Korea decreased  by 42 percent to $10.882 million, and the South Korean exports  of goods to North Korea increased by 230 percent to $1.669  million.    Inter-Korean trade during the first five months of this year  increased to $79.823 million, accounting for a 2.7 percent  increase over the same period last year, of which the imports  into South Korea were $70.938 million, a decrease of 5.6 percent.    A responsible official of the Trade, Industry, and Energy  Ministry said, "The decrease in the inter-Korean trade is  largely attributable to the aggravation of the North Korean  nuclear issue and the North Korean shortage of foreign currency  resulting from its economic difficulty." He added, "Local  businesses are virtually suspending inter-Korean trade this  month."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Vladykina report under the "Ornithology" rubric: </F> "Zhirinovskiy's "Falcons" Build Their Nest in the Urals.  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia's Universities in  Yekaterinburg"]    [Text] A reception was arranged in Yekaterinburg the other  day for the opening of an LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] headquarters in the city. According to LDPR Urals  coordinator Vyacheslav Senko, the local organization numbers  around 500 Zhirinovskiyites up and down the Urals. At the  moment they are busy opening their own university and setting up  a scientific research laboratory to study anomalous phenomena.  True enough, under Mr. Zhirinovskiy's instructions, the party's  membership and the presence of money in the party till cannot be  divulged. But journalists have managed to find out that  "himself" is planning a visit to Yekaterinburg in June.    After power ends up in the hands of Vladimir Volfovich  [Zhirinovskiy], they were told at the Yekaterinburg LDPR  headquarters, 30 seats in the State Duma would be made available  to the Urals organization. In the meantime, the local  organization of the Zhirinovskiy party sets itself the task of  organizing a massive admission of new members into its ranks,  and to start its own "URALS" newspaper.</p>

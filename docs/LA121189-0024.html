			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACKERS' MAGIC DISAPPEARS;  </P> <P> KANSAS CITY: CHIEFS LIMIT MAJKOWSKI TO 123 YARDS PASSING IN 21-3 VICTORY.  </P> <P> Kansas City's defense didn't rest Sunday. The Chiefs were relentless in their  pursuit of Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski in a 21-3 victory that enhanced  their playoff hopes with two weeks left in the season.  </P> <P> "It was a pretty complete effort. We clicked on offense and the defense was  tough again," said nose guard Dan Saleaumua, who had six tackles in Kansas  City's third consecutive win.  </P> <P> While the defense was dominating the Packers, Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg  was throwing for two touchdowns and completing 15 of 19 passes for 203 yards.  </P> <P> Kansas City (7-6-1) scored 14 points in the final minute of the first half --  the second touchdown with seven seconds left after a Majkowski fumble -- to  take a 21-3 lead.  </P> <P> The defense, which has allowed only four touchdowns in its last six games and  is ranked second in the NFL, did the rest.  </P> <P> "We accept the challenge of going out there and being able to not allow  opposing offenses to get into the end zone," Chief defensive back Deron Cherry  said.  </P> <P> Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith, who caused and recovered Majkowski's  fumble, said: "I think the turning point was right before the half when they  were backed up and we got a fumble on a sack. I beat the tackle and hit his arm  and then the ball fell straight down and I fell on it. Then the offense scored,  which is what they have to do."  </P> <P> Majkowski was sacked four times and completed 14 of 34 passes for 123 yards as  the Packers (8-6) fell out of a first-place tie in the NFC Central Division.  </P> <P> Green Bay managed only four second-half first downs and 208 total yards -- 166  below its season average.  </P> <P> The Packers' Sterling Sharpe, the NFL's leading receiver going into the game,  made only one catch for five yards.  </P> <P> "They doubled Sterling and made it tough. That's the best secondary we've  played all year," Majkowski said. "It was hard to go to my second and third  reads because the heat was coming. When we got behind, they knew we had to  throw and that made it tough on our offense."  </P> <P> DeBerg hit Emile Harry with a 12-yard touchdown pass with seven seconds left in  the first half to give the Chiefs a 21-3 lead.  </P> <P> Harry's catch came three plays after Smith recovered a fumble by Majkowski at  the Green Bay 15 with 43 seconds left.  </P> <P> Kansas City had taken a 14-3 lead with 1:01 remaining in the half on Christian  Okoye's three-yard run, capping a 78-yard drive. During the drive, DeBerg hit  Stephone Paige for 23 yards, Harry for 18 and then Herman Heard for 27 yards to  the Green Bay six.  </P> <P> "I asked Steve earlier in the week to give his reason for his play," Chief  Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. "He didn't know. All I know is that he's  getting the job done."  </P> <P> Okoye, the NFL's leading rusher, finished with 131 yards in 38 carries.  </P></p>

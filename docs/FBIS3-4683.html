This is the first time that a DFAA director general visits  the United States for the sole purpose of discussing the base  issues in Okinawa. Yoneyama noted three particular pending  issues -- the return of the Naha military seaport, the return of  the Yomitan Auxiliary Air Base, and the stopping of  live-ammunition firing artillery exercises over the Prefectural  Highway 104 -- "are long- pending issues, which the prefectural  residents strongly hope to be resolved, and the DFAA also wants  to have settled." He thus indicated the solution of these three  issues was one of the important purposes of the visit.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who had received a report  on the purpose of Yoneyama's visit to the United States, on 17  February sent through his secretary a message of encouragement  saying, "I would like you to do everything to have some of the  issues of the bases on Okinawa settled." He thus expressed hope  that Yoneyama will press on the U.S. Government to resolve the  Okinawa base issues which were also a subject he had intended to  take up at the recent Japan-U.S. summit meeting.    Director General Yoneyama said at a news conference on 25  February: "The purpose of the visit to the United States is to  exchange views with the senior officials of the Defense  Department and the State Department primarily on the reduction  and realignment of U.S. military facilities and areas on  Okinawa." He noted he was looking forward to the meeting with  U.S. Government officials and military commanders concerned with  the U.S. bases in Okinawa, adding, "I would like to follow up on  what has been discussed between Japan and the United States on  the reduction and realignment of the bases on Okinawa." He will  have Kenichi Sakamoto, liaison officer in charge of the U.S.  bases in Okinawa, on his entourage in order to be able to  discuss and exchange views on details.    According to his schedule, Yoneyama will arrive in  Washington  on 27 February, and is due to meet with Assistant Secretary of  State Winston Lord, Ambassador Thomas, and Assistant Secretary  of Defense Freeman while in Washington. After touring U.S.  military bases, he will head for Hawaii, and will meet with  General Larson, commander- in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command  in Hawaii on 3 March, and then with General Stackpole, commander  of the Marine Corps forces in the Pacific, Admiral Fitzgerald,  deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet, and General Rutherford,  commander of the Pacific Air Force Command -- to exchange views  on the realignment and reduction of the U.S. military bases on  Okinawa.    In the past, there have been instances of DFAA directors  general visiting the United States in company with Defense  Agency chiefs, but (according to the DFAA) there has been "no  precedence" of a DFAA director general visiting the United  States on his own to negotiate on specific issues and exchange  views with senior government officials and military leaders  personally.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED AFTER NEEDLE PRICKS SON  </P> <P> Police in San Jose arrested the father of a 3-year-old boy who was jabbed by a  cocaine-filled hypodermic needle while trying to break up a fight between the  parents. David Kennard, 24, was arrested at his home and booked on suspicion of  assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Authorities planned to test him for any diseases that might have been passed to  the boy through the needle. Tests conducted on the boy after he was stuck with  the needle showed no significant amounts of cocaine had entered his system.  Kennard and the boy's mother, Charlene Ann Lemon, were reportedly arguing about  Kennard's cocaine use when the boy tried to stop the dispute, police said.  During the argument, Kennard was waving a syringe and the boy was jabbed in a  finger, officers said.  </P></p>

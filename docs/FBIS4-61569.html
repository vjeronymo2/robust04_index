			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Russia is ready to continue to  contribute to the settlement of the regional conflict in  Karabakh and is counting on the support of CSCE, UN, and other  organizations, Andrey Kozyrev said today at a meeting with the  Swedish diplomat Jan Eliasson who heads the CSCE peace  conference on Nagornyy Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. According  to Russia's foreign minister, "the cooperation between the  Russian intermediary and CSCE is improving" in the sphere of  unblocking the situation and their efforts are mutually  complementary.    Andrey Kozyrev stressed Russia's special interest in putting  an end to the Karabakh conflict because its links with the  region have deep historical roots. In his words, "we cannot  remain indifferent." The leading Russian diplomat said that  other countries were taking an active part in discussing the  issue. In particular, the situation in Nagornyy Karabakh was  touched upon during his working meeting with Karl Bildt, the  Swedish head of government, in St. Petersburg on Thursday [5  May]. Andrey Kozyrev said to Jan Eliasson: "Although you are  representing the CSCE here rather than Sweden, nevertheless, we  are pleased to say that we have reached an understanding on this  matter on the bilateral level as well."</p>

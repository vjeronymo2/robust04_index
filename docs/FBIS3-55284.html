			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Smirnov, secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of Russia's "ruling body," by Valentina  Nikiforova; place and date not given: "Our Deputies Did Not  Take Leave"]    [Text] Many voters have admitted voting for Communists and  Agrarians although they also sympathized with the Democratic  Party of Russia. Three weeks later Democratic Party of Russia  headquarters is receiving telephone calls again. People are now  asking: Are the Travkinites preparing to work in the State  Duma? It is said that people from government blocs are already  sharing out the positions.... What is the party doing? PRAVDA  asked Vyacheslav Smirnov, secretary of the Democratic Party of  Russia's ruling body, to talk about this.    [Smirnov] Our deputies did not take [New Year] leave, and on  1 January party leader Nikolay Ilich Travkin relinquished his  powers as head of the administration of Moscow Oblast's  Shakhovskiy Rayon and set about preparing for serious work in  the Duma. Our faction, although for the time being this is a  conditional name, is not very big. That is why consultations  with deputies from other blocs are now going on. There have  been meetings with the Agrarians, the Communists, the Women, the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord, "Yabloko," and even the  Liberal Democratic Party's "second echelon." The main topic is  how to stop the Duma turning into a farce. There are fears that  people will immediately try to discredit it.    [Nikiforova] Have Democratic Party of Russia deputies agreed  to do only ordinary work or do they aspire to leading posts in  the Duma and in committees?    [Smirnov] Our deputies have no particular aspirations. But  there have been enticing offers. For instance, to S. Glazyev  and O. Bogomolov. The party's ruling body has advised them not  to refuse.    [Nikiforova] What is S. Govorukhin doing?    [Smirnov] The party has given Stanislav Sergeyevich the task  of completing the film "The Great Criminal Revolution." If  deputies are able to watch it at the beginning of the Duma's  proceedings I am sure that work will proceed more productively.</p>

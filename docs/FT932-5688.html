			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Reservations about French strength Performances among the world's equity markets were mixed last week, although the strength of Wall Street and Tokyo helped to underpin sentiment. US markets were encouraged by the successful passage of President Bill Clinton's budget package through the House of Representatives. Disappointing economic data on Friday erased some of the gains, but what were left, combined with broadly based rises in Japanese equities, left the FT-Actuaries World index 1.4 per cent higher in local currency terms. The unveiling of the French government's economic stimulus programme was warmly received and the CAC-40 index advanced 2.7 per cent on the week. While there was an enthusiastic initial response to the measures, which included a convertible privatisation bond, some later observations were more cautious. Hoare Govett, for instance, notes in its latest strategy document that there is a risk of the market being swamped with new paper when the privatisation cycle gets under way later in the year. 'Given the collapse of earnings for French companies and the generally recessionary environment, it becomes difficult to see where the necessary net new investment in shares will come from,' Hoare writes. 'The problem is compounded by the fact that most non-resident institutional investors currently hold overweight positions, leaving little scope for further expansion of their portfolios.' The broker concludes more positively, arguing that the privatisation bond 'might just supply a way out of the vicious circle of economic recession, a depressed bourse and the need for greater government spending'. Australia recorded a 42-month high last week, on a soaring gold share market fuelled by bullion's current international allure, and a recovery in some underperforming industrial stocks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                    % change in local currency**  sterling** USDollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                          1993      1993        1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -0.12    +3.18  -15.51    +2.51      +0.73       +3.85 Belgium       -1.59    -0.82   +1.32    +8.58      +7.24      +10.57 Denmark       -2.94    +1.93  -12.77   +14.19     +14.30      +17.85 Finland       -2.49    +1.57  +54.86   +47.91     +39.53      +43.87 France        +2.58    -2.11   -4.95    +4.26      +4.23       +7.46 Germany       +1.07    -0.08   -9.81    +6.62      +5.54       +8.80 Ireland       +1.22    +0.95  +13.30   +28.27     +17.78      +21.43 Italy         -3.65    +2.55  +17.68   +27.11     +24.18      +28.03 Netherlands   +1.38    +1.70   +3.61   +10.22      +9.24      +12.63 Norway        -0.77    -2.06   -8.50   +13.11     +12.51      +16.00 Spain         +1.62    +6.01   +1.48   +21.50      +7.61      +10.95 Sweden        +0.40    +4.77  +15.91   +12.71      +7.83      +11.17 Switzerland   +1.63    +6.58  +17.43   +10.76     +11.02      +14.47 UK            +0.84    +0.95   +6.30    +1.27      +1.27       +4.42 EUROPE        +0.82    +1.24   +2.96    +6.56      +5.53       +8.81 Australia     +3.98    +3.69   +0.61   +10.89      +7.45      +10.78 Hong Kong     +2.97    +8.58  +19.25   +34.82     +31.07      +35.14 Japan         +2.36    +1.08  +22.95   +24.73     +40.90      +45.27 Malaysia      +1.39    +6.47  +46.57   +28.64     +27.62      +31.58 New Zealand   +1.13    +1.77   +4.38    +9.07     +11.83      +15.29 Singapore     +1.66    +5.64  +11.43   +18.66     +17.45      +21.10 Canada        +0.40    +0.71   +7.45   +11.26      +7.91      +11.27 USA           +1.00    +2.45   +8.38    +3.36      +0.25       +3.36 Mexico        -1.84    -0.49   -8.21    -9.84     -12.54       -9.83 South Africa  +0.19    +8.05   +6.95   +27.95     +30.33      +34.38 WORLD INDEX   +1.43    +1.91  +10.77   +10.96     +12.93      +16.43  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on May 28th 1993.

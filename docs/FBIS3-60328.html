			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "Emissions From Kola Reduced"] </F>   [Text] Emissions of sulphur at Kola have been strongly  reduced since 1989. The reason for this is the gradual  introduction of market forces into the Russian economy.    In 1990 about 550,000 tons of air pollution was  emitted--mainly sulphur--from the metal industry at Kola. About  half of this came from Pechenganikel at Nikel and Zapolyarnyy in  the vicinity of the Norwegian border. How large the emissions  will be this year nobody knows, but because of the much reduced  industrial production they will be considerably lower. In August  of this year the production at Nikel was 45.7 percent lower than  in August of last year.    "During the last 20 years an incredible 9.6 million tons of  sulphur dioxide have been emitted from the smelting works at  Kola. The environmental destruction is enormous. Nobody should  think that the problem has been solved even though market forces  have taken a drastic bite out of this sulfuric hell," says  Thomas Nilsen from Bellona.  <H5>  Depression </H5>   In the mining and smelting cities on the Kola peninsula  depression is spreading. Last Monday the labor office in the  metal city of Monchegorsk issued the first official announcement  from the large metal conglomerate that owns the smelting works:  One thousand fifty people will be let go. Journalist Sergei  Chukov from the newspaper MURMANSKII VESTIK thinks this is real.  The workers will get the boot.    In Russian industry such mass layoffs are something new.  Locally at Kola the announcement from Monchegorsk is only viewed  as a confirmation that the smelting industry is having a  difficult time.  <H5>  Cutbacks </H5>   Prices for raw materials on the world market are low.  Authorities in Moscow seem to have tightened up again on how  much of their income the conglomerate might dispose of.  Severonikel at Monchegorsk is struggling with sky-high debts  owed to both the nuclear power plant at Kola and the Murmansk  Shipping Company, which is hauling the ore from the Siberian  city of Norilsk to the Kola works. There are rumors about  layoffs of thousands of people both at Monchegorsk and at the  metal companies at Nikel and Zapolyarnyy, which are owned by the  sister company Pechenganikel.    Local sources describe the mood of the metal-producing  cities  as very depressed. Both at the metal works and at the nuclear  power plant which supplies the industry with power, the workers  presumably have not received full pay this fall. Previously the  workers had contracts for five years or more. Now only a  minority get a contract for more than a few months.    Even people with a solid knowledge of Russia have difficulty  explaining what is really happening in northwest Russia. On the  one hand their industry seems to be marked by depression, heavy  debt in rubles, and rapidly falling production. But on the other  hand more Russian nickel is being sold abroad than at any other  time, and income in dollars is high.    Scientist Rune Castberg at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute is  unsure whether what is happening at Kola is the result of a real  economic crisis or whether the leadership has let the crisis run  full course simply as a means of getting rid of superfluous  employees.    Castberg has for years worked with the Kola problems. He  does  not think that market forces and the gradual economic freedom in  Russia will result in a complete halt in pollution from Kola.    "Since the smelting works are there, it will benefit Russian  society most to have as much activity there as possible.  However, in the future production will to an increasing degree  have to be profitable," Castberg says.    He thinks it probable that the part of the metal industry  that is dependent on ore transported from Siberia will  disappear, and that the smelting industry based on the local ore  will remain. But even though some slight degree of modernization  has taken place during the last decades, the technology and the  buildings are mainly from the 1940's and 1950's. Whether the  conglomerate can afford to modernize to the degree necessary to  keep up production in the future without economic aid from  abroad is unclear.  <H5>  Skeptical of Support </H5>   Castberg is skeptical as to whether Norway should give 300  million kroner in support of modernizing the smelting industry  in Nikel in order to reduce emissions further.    "I do not think this is the most efficient use of our money.  We might rather help Pechenganikel achieve the full effect of  the cleanup capabilities the company already has," Castberg says.    The point is really that the production at the metal works  has been reduced more than the pollution. This means that the  companies are unable to clean the waste gas as well as they have  previously. One of the reasons is a strong reduction in the  production of sulfuric acid.</p>

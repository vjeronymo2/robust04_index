			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Talk" by Singha Sai: "Remove the Thorn To Improve Lao-Thai </F> Relations"]    [Excerpts] When it is said that Lao-Thai relations in the  recent past have been very peaceful, no one will deny it.  [passage omitted]    Speaking of cooperation in public security along the  Lao-Thai  border, from the time of first meeting of the committee for  cooperation to maintain peace along the Lao-Thai border until  the third meeting now, it is clear that Lao-Thai relations have  steadily developed. For example the cooperation to maintain  peace along the border has been steadily improved so that the  situation there has gradually become peaceful. Brigadier General  Douangchai Phichit, secretary-general of the committee for  cooperation to maintain peace along the border, told our group  of reporters that "the people living along the Lao-Thai border  feel more secure than in the past in making a living and  traveling to and from the neighboring country." The cooperation  in each locality involved the many border provinces of the two  countries meeting officially and signing memoranda with each  other as well as consulting to find ways to correct various  problems which groups of bad people had caused to disrupt the  peace in their localities on the border. The cooperation was  undertaken to make the border areas in the provinces on both  sides peaceful.    In addition the cooperation between the armies of Laos and  Thailand has involved talks and visits which have brought  greater understanding. The top Thai officers including those  from the Ministry of Defense, the Supreme Command Headquarters  and RTA headquarters have approved of continuing to correct past  weaknesses and obstacles to ralations, especially those hostile  groups that want to cause confusion and to disrupt the peace in  order to block the expansion of Lao-Thai relations. Because of  the determination of the Thai officials above, it is felt that  in the future Thai officials will do everything in their power  against the bad groups which hope to disrupt Lao-Thai relations  in order that Lao-Thai relations steadily improve and the  Lao-Thai border is peaceful and stable.    On 23 February 1994 officials of the Thai Supreme Command  Headquarters had Lt.Gen. Phiradet Miphian, the head of the  Directorate of Joint Intelligence of the Supreme Command  Headquarters, provide information to the Director of the  National Police Department so that he could proceed with the  case against Vang Pao, Thonglit Chokbengboun and their  associates under the charge of violating Thai security -- their  base used Thai territory to conduct operations against the Lao  government. It was used for concealing weapons, and it caused  losses for the Thai people along the border. In addition this  affected relations and created doubts between Laos and Thailand.  In any case many Thai publications printed stories about this,  and they all felt that Thai officials would act as quickly as  possible because in a few days the ceremony officially opening  the Friendship Bridge was to be held, and the day of this  historic ceremony required peace on the Lao-Thai border.    The Thai English-language newspaper DIMENSION wrote that:  "Vang Pao and Thonglit have a close relationship with the CIA."  The commander for suppression said that wrongdoers, especially  Vang Pao and his right-hand man, Thonglit, would have to be  arrested if they returned to Thailand. If they were in another  country, officials would observe to see if they were able to  make their group obey the law. A month has passed, and there has  been no new information. For real peace on the Lao-Thai border,  Thai officials will have to move fast to make their deeds match  their words.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses reflect dollar, higher oil prices The dollar stabilised, but bourses were mixed, writes Our Markets Staff. Oils were strong as the commodity price reflected a strike by Nigerial oil unions. FRANKFURT sold the 'Big Three' chemical stocks as the Dax index rose 5.95 to 2,054.00 in turnover down from DM6.4bn to DM5.4bn. BASF, Bayer and Hoechst fell by DM6.70 to DM291, DM5.20 to DM337.80, and DM3 to DM310 respectively, on the weakness of the dollar against the D-Mark this year. Mr Albert Richards, chemicals analyst at CS First Boston in London, acknowledged that, with chemicals priced in global terms, the present currency relationships meant a less competitive European chemicals industry and a more competitive one in the US. However, he said, when the dollar settles this will provide a nice buying opportunity. 'Past periods of dollar weakness were accompanied by periods of overcapacity in the US, bringing significant pressure to bear on European pricing,' he explained. 'The US, now, does not have that much spare capacity.' AMSTERDAM notched up a gain although the market stayed volatile ahead of futures and options expiry tomorrow. The AEX index improved 3.10 to 386.31, recapturing most of Tuesday's losses. Royal Dutch rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 186.80. Oce van der Grinten, up Fl 2.00 at Fl 76.00, attracted an upgrade by James Capel earlier in the week which rated the stock a buy opportunity. Capel said that fourth quarter 1994 and 1995 profits growth should be in the region of 20 per cent, placing the company's shares at a 1995 multiple in line with the market. PARIS built up a good rise on relatively thin turnover ahead of its holiday today and tomorrow. The CAC-40 index gained 32.51 or 1.6 per cent to 1,974.59. Oils were strong, helped by firmer crude prices. Elf Aquitaine rose FFr18.10 to FFr395, and Total FFr6.30 to FFr307.30. ZURICH fell to its low for the year as Roche gave up 5.3 per cent in further response to Tuesday's lower than expected first half sales. The SMI index lost 33.5 or 1.3 per cent to 2,474.5 in higher volume as recently inactive institutional investors turned sellers. Roche dropped SFr300 to SFr5,400, taking the two day loss to 10 per cent, the market unimpressed by yesterday's statement that first half financial earnings improved. The weakness spilled over into other pharmaceuticals, Ciba registered falling SFr19 to SFr721, while Sandoz, reporting its own first half sales figures today, saw its registered SFr11 lower at SFr650. MILAN reversed its five-day slide as hopes grew that budget details would finally emerge after last night's cabinet meeting. The Comit index picked up 9.25 to 687.35 as the market was also encouraged by a forecast from the Isco research group that the public sector deficit next year could be smaller than feared. Industrials were among the better performers with Pirelli rising L114 or 4.5 per cent to L2,643 in response to recent positive analysts' notes. Fiat was L96 higher at L6,585. Telecommunications, which had been one of the biggest sufferers in the recent retreat, also rose strongly with Stet adding L188 or 3.6 per cent to L5,312 and Sip putting on L122 or 3 per cent to L4,218. MADRID extended its gains to a fifth day, the general index closing 2.68 higher at 301.40 in turnover of Pta32bn. Endesa was the most active stock as it rose Pta110 to Pta5,800. However, Repsol came back from a high of Pta4,110 to close only Pta5 higher at Pta4,010 after Nymex oil prices turned mixed in New York. Nordic markets mostly had a good day, helped by the high-tech appeal of Ericsson and Nokia in Sweden and Finland - after strong second quarter results from Motorola in the US on Tuesday - and by higher oil prices in Norway. STOCKHOLM rose for the fifth consecutive session, Ericsson climbing SKr16, or more than four per cent to SKr399, as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 13.90 higher at 1,397.70. HELSINKI saw Nokia up another FM17 to Fm493 following continued gains for its American depositary shares in New York. OSLO's all-share index climbed by 9.33 to 617.31 with Norsk Hydro NKr6 higher at NKr228.50 on oil prices, high aluminium prices and a decision to lift magnesium production at Hydro's plant in Canada. WARSAW was encouraged by Tuesday's advance through the 10,000 level, and the Wig index put on another 804.7, or 7.8 per cent to 11,062.9. Turnover rose by 35 per cent to 1,400bn zlotys.

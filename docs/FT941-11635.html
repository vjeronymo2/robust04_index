			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Buying Europe's silver Since privatisation issues have been a bonanza for many British investors, it is not surprising they are rushing to jump on the European bandwagon. The level of subscriptions to the privatisation trusts launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management also reflects small investor frustration at the low return on cash and the difficulty, which evidently also besets large institutions, of securing an allocation of foreign issues as they come to market. Doubtless European governments will have to offer attractive prices to get their sales away. Even Pounds 1bn of UK investment trust money pales almost into insignificance beside anticipated sales of up to Pounds 100bn. But the new trusts will not be able to make huge returns by cashing in on the new issue discount in every case, and they may not even try when the allocation process is so uncertain. Their approach is based much more on evidence that privatisation issues tend to outperform for some years as efficiency gains are realised. It thus makes sense for trust managers to buy outside the immediate sale. That, though, raises the question of stock selection. UK investors who focused on British Steel, Rolls-Royce, and, until recently, British Aerospace, will not have enjoyed outstanding returns from privatisation. There will be dogs elsewhere in Europe too. Nor, given restrictive continental labour laws, may efficiency gains come through as quickly as in Britain. While attractive, these trusts are not a one-way bet. The point may be worth remembering if, as seems likely, they move immediately to a premium.</p>

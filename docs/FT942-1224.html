			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Power and coal sales postponed The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday postponed completing one of its most ambitious sales of eastern Germany's electricity network and of the last of the large brown coal, or lignite, fields. Following a Treuhand board meeting, the agency said the planned sale of Veag, east Germany's electricity network, and Laubag, the giant lignite fields, might be completed 'next week.' The Treuhand did not explain the delay. Veag is to be sold to a west German utility consortium led by RWE Energie. Laubag, which will supply Veag with its brown coal, will be acquired by a consortium led by Rheinbraun, the 100 per cent brown coal subsidiary of RWE. The delay in completing the deal, despite pressure from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is thought to arise from the buyers' anxiety about prospects for energy consumption in eastern Germany. The two consortiums are increasingly concerned about a shift by east German domestic and industrial customers to gas, and about the pressure on electricity to compete with gas prices. For the moment, gas prices are significantly lower than electricity prices. These factors have repeatedly affected the complex privatisation negotiations for Veag and Laubag because their sales are tied to a comprehensive investment programme of DM41bn (Pounds 16.6bn) over 10 years. But any return on those investments depends on a stable customer base. Part of the investment timetable entails the construction of two 800MW power stations at Lippendorf in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. Energy analysts yesterday suggested, however, that part of the investment programme might be cancelled, which would reduce brown coal sales to Veag and thus affect the sale price of Veag.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return"] </F>   [Excerpts] Palestinian Arab revolutionaries recently  punished two of the terrorist Israeli occupation troops in the  Gaza Strip. Consequently, Israel closed the heroic, struggling  Gaza Strip. This measure is certainly meant as a punishment for  the Palestinian Arab people. However, perhaps because of its  numerous and continuous mass punishments of the Palestinian Arab  people, Israel, when it recently closed Gaza as a mass  punishment, has forgotten that it has been closing the Gaza  Strip and the West Bank as a punishment for exactly two years  and two months. Therefore, the closure of the Gaza strip is a  mass punishment. Whether it is fair or wrong and terrorist,  like the oppressive Israeli practices, a punishment is supposed  to be aimed against those directly responsible for a certain  operation or those who failed to prevent the occurrence of such  an operation. As for those who carried out the operation -- the  Palestinian people -- they are as much experienced in enduring  Israeli crimes as they are experienced in meting out the  severest punishments to the Israeli terrorism. This is proven  by the operation that led Israel to close the Gaza Strip,  already closed for two years and two months. As for those  responsible for the failure to block the Palestinian resistance  men's execution of two Israeli occupation troops, who are they?  Evidently, Israel holds the self-rule authority responsible.  Therefore, it has closed the Gaza Strip. However, it should be  noted that the fedayeen operation was carried out in an area  directly controlled by the Israeli occupation army, in  accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What does this mean?  Despite our rejection of partial solutions, such as the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, we say those responsible for the failure  to prevent Palestinian Arab strugglers from punishing and  killing Israeli invasion soldiers are specifically the Israeli  occupation troops themselves, not any other authority.  Consequently, Israel should punish its soldiers manning the  roadblock, which Israel calls the Erez roadblock. [passage  omitted]    However, Israel does not want to admit the heroism of the  fedayeen nor the failure of some of its soldiers. Therefore, it  is trying to cover up this failure and impotency by punishing  the Palestinian Arab people. Has not Israel understood yet that  its mass punishments have prompted the few who remained outside  the intifadah to join the resistance, turning the entire  Palestinian people into a wave of fire daily scorching Israel's  face? Israel has not understood, nor will it understand. We do  not want them to understand. This is because there are still  many chapters to go in the book of the fair Palestinian Arab  punishment of the Israeli terrorism and occupation. Those  chapters, which are part of the armed Palestinian struggle, will  be written by Palestinian Arab bullets in the body of the  Israeli occupation.    Avenging Israeli terrorism is another face of the  Palestinian  revolution of liberation. This fair, well-planned vengeance,  whose clear objective is liberation and deterring and punishing  the Zionist enemy, is a book with renewable chapters. It will  end only with the departure of the last wolves of Israeli  occupation and the demolishing of the last Israeli Army camp and  last Zionist settlement in the revolutionary Palestinian Arab  territory.</p>

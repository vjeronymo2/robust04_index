			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (7): Interest is running high - Cable telephony / What's possible The Holy Grail of communications technology for business is the so-called 'ideal desktop' wherein a data workstation also serves as a networked video terminal to provide real-time interactive audio, full-motion, high-quality video, animation, spreadsheet, database, telecommunications, document processing and other applications - all on the same screen. Interest in such networked multi-media applications is running high and significant developments in software, hardware integration and switched network accessibility are expected to make them attractive as strategic business tools between now and the year 2000. The bugbear is that multi-media and the other emergent telecoms technologies are bandwidth-hungry. Broadband is expensive and must therefore be capable of instantaneous allocation on demand rather than being dedicated to any particular users or applications. It seems probable that specific sectors of business will take up broadband before the telecommunications community as a whole, probably with Lan-to-Lan and Lan-to-Wan interconnectivity driving the market in the first instance. At the same time, European businesses are widening their corporate communications bandwidth as computerisation becomes ever more ubiquitous. Ironically, the recession has also spurred technological change with many organisations re-defining and streamlining themselves into co-operating networks of smaller and more efficient units. Replacing copper with fibre optics is a massive and enormously expensive undertaking. In fact, widespread deployment of universal broadband networks based on optical fibre to business and residential users will not begin in Europe until after the turn of the millennium. Industry experts generally agree that it will not be fully completed until the end of the second decade of the next century or even later. This, combined with the investment already made in copper cabling, will ensure that conventional coaxial or twisted pair-type wiring will co-exist with a growing fibre optic infrastructure for many years. Copper cable is still being installed and the bandwidth capabilities of traditional wiring systems are being enhanced. For example, two new services just introduced in the US, High Bit Rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL) and Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), are capable of transmitting high levels of data over non-repeated twisted-pair copper cable. Field trials of copper-transported television are also under way using ADSL technology. Nevertheless, optical fibres have several advantages over copper. These include a significantly greater data capacity - the FDDI standard calls for a data rate of 100Mbit/s compared with Ethernet at 10Mbit/s and token ring at 4 or 16 Mbit/s - enhanced network security and immunity to electronic noise. They also allow a greater distance between stations and nodes. The FDDI specifies that stations can be 2km apart using multi-mode fibre or up to 40km with the latest mono-mode cable, with a total network coverage of up to 100km. Over the past few years, single mode fibre has emerged as the popular 'fibre of choice' and new developments, such as a cladding glass layer that contains a titanium oxide dopant, have produced a particularly tough, durable and reliable medium. However, fibre optics also have their drawbacks. For example, every 22 miles the light signal must be converted back to electronic pulses, amplified and then regenerated as a light signal once more. This slows transmission, and it is these staging points and other electronic pathways at either end of the optic fibre link that dictate maximum signal transmission speeds and cause data bottlenecks. This could soon be about to change. Some eight years ago scientists of the Optical Fibre Group at Southampton University showed that optical fibre cores doped with the rare earth, erbium, were more reliable and efficient. Later work has demonstrated that erbium doping facilitates almost perfect light amplification and erbium amplification systems have been tested to a distance of 100m kilometres with minimal signal attenuation and complete data integrity reported. The ramifications are enormous. With optical switches installed at the exchanges there will be no electronics to delay signals and communication at very close to the speed of light will be possible. Not only that, some 25 THz (25,000 GHz) of very cheap bandwidth would be instantly available on demand - more than enough to cope with any planned or imaginable application for any business of any size. Erbium amplified systems have been specified for several new long-haul submarine cables and also for various terrestrial networks. Some will be in place before the end of the century. Today's fibre optic networks are lit. That is to say telcos provide the fibre optic infrastructure plus the services that run over it - and garner revenue from both. In future we will see dark fibre systems where the end user will decide what applications and services to operate and also provide them. A telco would then be in a similar position to that a of utility company today - providing a pipeline service, but unable to dictate what is to be connected to it, how equipment is to be used, when or by whom. With BT and other suppliers forbidden to provide home entertainment services over their networks until 2001, the economics of deploying fibre optics is being distorted by a rigged market. In a free market, BT and its rivals could generate additional revenues from entertainment services and use them to offset at least some of the huge costs involved in laying a fibre optic infrastructure. Businesses, because they need faster and better communications, will determine when and where the new broadband systems are built. They will deploy the new technology because, in the end, they cannot afford not to. The author is deputy editor of Communications International magazine</p>

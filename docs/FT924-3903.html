			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (8): Experienced and honest - Interview, Chuan Leekpai Unlike most of his predecessors, Mr Chuan Leekpai, Thailand's new prime minister, is neither an army general nor a Bangkok-based, western-educated aristocrat. The mild-mannered Mr Chuan, leader of the Democrat Party, has been an elected member of parliament for the southern constituency of Trang for 23 years. After the election which followed the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators by troops on the streets of Bangkok in May, he emerged as prime minister at the head of a five-party coalition government. Mr Chuan, 54, is of humble origins. His father was a teacher and his mother a vegetable-seller and he describes himself as 'an ordinary man'. He has pledged to put more emphasis on rural development than previous Thai governments. Although regarded as honest and experienced in politics, he has been branded a 'wimp' by some of his opponents. He spoke to Victor Mallet and Peter Ungphakorn at Government House. These are excerpts from the interview, translated from Thai: Question: What do you hope to achieve during your tenure? Chuan: There are policies we want to emphasise that are different from those of previous governments. The first is the promotion of democracy at all levels. . . It will probably take some time. We'll start at the level of villages and tambons (sub-districts). The second is a problem raised by economists and academics who work with us. As a politician I agree with them. It is the problem of income distribution. Q: What exactly will you do? Chuan: We will expand job creation in non-agricultural sectors. This is the policy of spreading investment into rural areas. The Finance Ministry and the Board of Investment will be asked to co-operate by providing clear and sufficient incentives for investors to regard rural areas as priority targets and to provide them with profits. We have to accept the reality that to expect them to make sacrifices would be too idealistic. So the state will have to be prepared to create incentives for them. Secondly, we can offer income support by cutting people's expenses. This is also a reality - that poor people tend to have problems with their health and their children's education. . . We think we should allocate perhaps no more than a few billion baht of the budget to look after people who are unable to look after themselves, for example children and the elderly. . . As for the job creation and income distribution, we would hope to take some people out of the agricultural sector. Those who cannot leave would still farm but they would not have to share too much of the land with other people. They would then have enough land to earn a reasonable income. Q: Do you agree with those who describe the Anand government (the previous administration) as pro-big business and your government as pro-rural? Chuan: Prime Minister Anand had more experience from the industrial sector. We have more experience from the village sector. Nevertheless, if the industrial sector is not successful, job expansion for the village sector will be difficult, and therefore the two depend on each other. Q: Which of Anand's policies will you continue, and which will you change? Chuan: Among the policies of Prime Minister Anand that we should continue. . . is limiting the expansion of the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy should not be free to expand. And Prime Minister Anand's policy of placing emphasis on free trade is a policy I think has been adopted by three or four (consecutive) governments. I will try to continue with it, including Prime Minister Anand's policy on Afta (the Asean Free Trade Area). I think it should expand beyond Asean, but that is something that should be discussed further. Q: Has the Sia Song affair (involving a clampdown on stock market speculators) been properly handled? What will happen next? Chuan: We discussed this matter for about three weeks before it erupted. At the end we had to conclude that this was the best way out because the law did not give us any other option. We realised that it would have some negative effects. But taking a long-term view, we believed that it would raise the stock market to international standards. We realise that investors still behave like gamblers. They are not interested in dividends. They probably don't even know what businesses the companies are involved in; they don't know what dividends are paid. It's only day-to-day trading. Q: You're not a shareholder or a punter yourself? Chuan: No. Q: Have the lessons of May been learnt, or is Thai politics back to the bad old ways? Chuan: After May I said before anyone else that we should not believe that Thailand had suddenly become democratic just because Gen Suchinda (Kraprayoon) had gone. I was the first to remind people. I don't believe that a single event will change people's attitudes completely. We have to accept the reality. The politicians are the same group of people, mostly old faces. There are only a few new faces. The attitudes are the old attitudes. But I consider us to have made one step forward. Q: Will the armed forces now stay out of politics? Will you make sure that they do stay out of politics and business? Chuan: In my opinion, the military are more likely to stick to their own role than to play a political role as they did in the past. There are two reasons. First, I, as the government, will not make the military my own personal power-base. . . Second, the present military commanders are more democratically-minded than previous commanders. Some laws have been changed so that military decisions will have to receive the approval of the cabinet. Q: Are any other measures being taken to ensure that they do not get involved? The recent incident in Ranong (in which drunken soldiers are alleged to have attacked a police station after a brawl) shows there are still problems. Chuan: It will take time for everyone to accept that the military should be professional. I cannot be sure that such an event will not happen again. I said on the day we handed over our policy to officials all over the country - I really did - that if soldiers, police, border patrol police and defence volunteers, and so on, do not cause trouble, then the country's problems will be greatly reduced. I come across these problems frequently. Restaurant owners often complain to me that soldiers get drunk and smash the place up. So problems arise because people get drunk. It will get better. It will get better, I'm confident. Q: Is there a danger that your efforts will be undermined by disagreement and instability in the coalition? Chuan: Coalitions will always have these problems. I've been in many coalitions, so I'm prepared to face the obstacles. But ultimately I believe we'll be able to maintain the coalition so that it follows the principles of the parties who got together to draft this common policy statement. It may be slow, too slow for some people, but I think we can continue this way. I try to bring everyone in to participate in decision-making according to the democratic process. . . The things that we have said all along are intended to show the public the principles that this government adheres to when it rules the country. . . The people are the most important factor in preventing other powers from returning. Q: Existing laws on everything from traffic to the environment to prostitution are not enforced. So why introduce new laws? Chuan: It is true that Thailand's weakness is in law-enforcement. . . Enforcement is a real problem. Q: On the other hand, many Thais would argue that there is not enough new legislation, except during the Anand governments, to meet the needs of a modern state. The frequency of Parliamentary meetings has been doubled, but only from once to twice a week. Is that enough? Chuan: In Khun Anand's time, an immense amount of laws were passed because there was no opposition. Those laws are all the problems of the present government. Passing laws is dead easy when there is no opposition. But when the time comes to put them into practice, they all cause problems. . . They did not think through whether the laws would work in practice. Q: Should the police be paid more so that they don't take bribes and do enforce the law? Chuan: That's more of an excuse made by the people who take bribes. . . They should be paid more, but in this economy other officials are also underpaid. And in comparison to most people, officials in all branches of the bureaucracy earn more. People struggle and are willing to pay to get their children into the bureaucracy.</p>

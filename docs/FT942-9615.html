			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever tumbles Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever was the biggest casualty in the FT-SE 100 list yesterday after unveiling disappointing first quarter results. Underlying pre-tax profits below the lowest market predictions saw the shares slump and remain under pressure all day as analysts slashed full-year forecasts. The shares closed 57 off at 1023p with turnover a busy 3.7m. Flat trading in the company's key markets was compounded by tough conditions in the US detergents market. The results were accompanied by a cautious trading statement which further depressed sentiment. Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull, a long-term Unilever bull, moved the stock off his short-term buy list. But he added: 'Although the news flow from the company could be dull for a while, it's important to remember that the first quarter results are a poor guide to long-term trends.' At Smith New Court, Mr Tim Potter said that some of the worrying trends seen at the end of last year were continuing. 'Even if there is recovery in its major markets, trading conditions will remain intensively difficult because consumers are value-driven. We remain bearish.' He shaved his full-year forecast back to Pounds 2.35bn, with Strauss pulling back to a similar level.</p>

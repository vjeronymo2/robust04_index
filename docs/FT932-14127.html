			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (19): Big impact on the market - . . . For Risc SINCE the mid-1980s, reduced instruction set computer (Risc) design has become the basis for most - if not all - workstations above personal computer level, for departmental systems and for even more powerful machines. The trend was set by one of the oldest and one of the newest computer manufacturers: in 1986, Hewlett-Packard based its entire future computer range on Risc; and a year later, Sun Microsystems shook the workstation market with a product based on its own Risc processor called Sparc, or Scalable Processor Architecture. Sun went some way to establishing Sparc as an industry standard through licensing and marketing deals with the likes of ICL, Xerox, Fujitsu and Amdahl; in addition, the company's growing significance attracted AT&amp;T as a leading shareholder. The move towards Risc is in many ways a move right back to very earliest days of computers. In the 1940s and early 1950s, processors and memory worked at the same speed. A programmer's instructions were read from memory one at a time and processed by hardware which was wired to handle particular functions, such as add, load and store. However, advances in processor technology dramatically outpaced the speed at which program instructions could be retrieved from memory. Processors would be idle, waiting for the next instructions. So in the late 1950s and 1960s, processors were given expanded instruction sets, stored as so-called microcode in very fast local memory. This development came as high-level programming languages such as Cobol were making their mark: such languages enabled the programmer to write complicated statements - for example, to instruct a computer to compare two items of data and take different action depend ing on the result. So now, instead of retrieving and processing a simple instruction and then having to wait for the next one, the processor was fed with a complex instruction and spent so much time breaking it down into simple microcode instructions and then processing them that the former idle time was eliminated. This new approach was seized on with such enthusiasm that by the mid-1980s a big mainframe computer might have 300 to 500 instructions built in, compared with 15 to 30 in the earliest machines. Today these big systems are known as Cisc - complex instruction set computer - machines. However, continuing rapid progress in hardware technology meant the memory speed issue gradually disappeared. In fact the move towards complex instruction sets was such that in some cases the processor now keeps the memory waiting: the opposite of the situation that prompted the move to complex instruction sets. When Hewlett-Packard came to design its Risc range, it analysed 900bn lines of programming code from all application areas running on a dozen manufacturers' computers. And it discovered that just 20 per cent of instructions accounted for 80 per cent of processing. Such a finding means manufacturers can in effect return to the 1940s principle of wiring a small number of often-used simple instructions into the processor and largely dispense with microcode. This means faster processing. The removal of microcode from a microchip also means more of the instructions can be located together on the same chip, so data being passed from one instruction to another moves within the same chip and not between separate components. This, again, increases speed. Risc has had a big impact on the market, not least because it has taken off, 45 years after its original heyday, at the same time as the Unix operating system (see also the Unix entry in this A-Z). Suppliers of Risc systems of all sizes are standardising on Unix. SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS New companies - notably Sun Microsystems - have been born and have flourished, thanks to Risc products. Established manufacturers have launched whole ranges of Risc products: Hewlett-Packard staked its entire future as a computer manufacturer on Risc with its 1986 announcement and a commitment to Unix; and IBM has had success with its RS/6000 range, launched in 1990. Unlike the personal computer market, where manufacturers have largely settled on Intel processors, the Risc business is fragmented on the hardware front, although several suppliers are trying to establish their products as standards. Sun Microsystems in particular has a big following and MIPS Computer Systems has struck some deals. Microelectronics specialist Motorola is a leading supplier to Risc system builders. Motorola is also part of an as yet unknown quantity: a consortium with IBM and Apple which is working to get IBM's RS/6000 Risc processors on the market as electronic components for other computer and workstation manufacturers. The use of Risc designs, continuing advances in technology, competitive pressures and the rapid emergence of Unix as a standard operating system have taken the prices of basic powerful workstations down to around Pounds 2,000, just as the personal computer market is set for new turmoil. Intel, purveyor of processors to the personal computer industry, is about to unveil its top-end Pentium processor and, in May, Microsoft will launch its NT operating system. The two old-timers, Risc and Unix - both dating back more 30 years - will be key partners in the battle for tomorrow's desk-top computing market.</p>

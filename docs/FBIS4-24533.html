			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The Huaihe River Valley,  frequently hit by devastating flood and drought over past  centuries, has been transformed into China's leading granary.    That was made possible by two massive campaigns in the past  four decades to harness the Huaihe River, the fourth longest  river in China. The campaigns involved an investment of 27.3  billion yuan jointly by the central government and local  governments in the valley, including 184 counties and cities  within the jurisdiction of central China's Henan, east China's  Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces.    The first campaign was launched in 1950 by the late Chairman  Mao Zedong shortly after the Huaihe River overflowed in the  summer of the year, causing heavy casualties.    The second one was waged by the central government in 1991  following devastating floods in the valley which killed at least  1,000 people and caused 32.7 billion yuan of direct losses.    China has decided on a plan to spend about 12 billion yuan  during 1991-2000 on improving the valley's flood control ability  as part of its efforts to harness the river.    As part of the campaigns, 5,300 reservoirs have been built,  new rivers for the passage of flood water into the sea dug and  many other flood control and irrigation facilities, such as  pumping stations, set up.    The large-scale water conservancy construction has brought  about fundamental changes to the region's agricultural  production.    Water control and irrigation facilities have been improved  for 65 percent of the region's total cultivated land, or nearly  eight million ha [hectares], which used to be vulnerable to  water-logging.    The yearly grain output for the valley exceeds 60 million  tons, or an average of 428 kg per head of the 140 million people  of the region, more than the region's total consumption.    So the region each year supplies about 16 million tons of  grain to other parts of the country or for industrial purposes.    The northern Jiangsu plain within the valley -- 60 percent  of  Jiangsu Province's farmland, 2.93 million ha -- used to be a  corridor for flood water, and floods occurred in the past in  nine out of every ten years.    The frequent floods led to hunger and even massive uprisings  in the region's history.    As a result of the establishment of the flood controls,  irrigation systems and other water conservancy projects in the  plain, the per unit yield in the plain doubled and the per  capita grain output tripled. The improved flood-control and  irrigation capacity has also boosted the production of fruit,  tea and fresh-water aquatic products.</p>

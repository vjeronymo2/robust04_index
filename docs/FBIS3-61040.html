Utkin, candidate of military </F> sciences: "Ambushes in Modern Conditions"]    [Text] Ambushes have not lost their importance. The  reduction in the personnel strength of the armed forces and the  increased demands on their combat effectiveness force them to  look for the most effective methods of opposing the enemy. The  article by Col N. Utkin on page 20 talks about how to improve  the effectiveness of employing ambushes.    In recent years, the journal has more than once dealt with  the issue of organizing ambushes by small subunits of the Ground  Troops. Authors of articles have talked in detail about ambushes  of the Great Patriotic War and shared experience acquired in the  Republic of Afghanistan. As is clear from the articles, ambushes  have not lost their importance today. On the contrary, the  reduction in the personnel strength of the armed forces and the  increased demands on their combat effectiveness force them to  look for the most effective methods of opposing the enemy.    Ambushes were widely used in all types of combat. In an  offensive they are usually set up on the path of withdrawing  enemy subunits, on movement routes of enemy reserves and  reinforcements, on supply routes, on sectors of a possible  breakout of encirclement by defending groupings, and at sites of  planned landing of sabotage-reconnaissance groups and airborne  assault forces.    In some cases, the goal of ambushes involves making a  surprise engagement of the enemy, misleading him as to the true  intentions of friendly forces, and disrupting command and  control. In other cases, the goal is to ascertain the  composition and intentions of units being transferred to the  forward edge of the battle area and to perform other  reconnaissance measures.    In a meeting engagement, ambushes are created in forward  units and by reconnaissance bodies on avenues of movement of  superior enemy forces. The main task here is to determine their  location, composition, and nationality, and, if possible, reduce  the pace of reaching a favorable line.    In the defense, ambushes acquire special importance in the  security zone of defending forces and when conducting mobile  combat operations. Small in makeup, they are situated between  lines and on the line of withdrawal, in the first and subsequent  trenches, at the forward position, at battle outposts, on the  flanks, and in gaps. Ambushes are able to use surprise fire in  short periods of time to inflict appreciable losses on advancing  subunits, which front-line soldiers and Afghan veterans proved  repeatedly.    In recent years, when the predominant part of power  confrontations in the world took on the nature of armed  conflicts and local wars, the importance of ambush operations  have increased even more. Almost daily information is received  about the use of ambushes in one or another region to capture  weapons, equipment, or hostages, capture or destroy hostile  groupings, and eliminate command and control bodies,  politicians, and statesmen. In certain regions of the "near  abroad," ambushes have become an almost everyday phenomenon.    All this indicates that today one must not be limited to  introducing into combat training practice only experienced  amassed in the past for organizing and conducting ambushes. This  experience must be constantly improved, primarily based on  comprehensive use of modern models of equipment and armament.    As is known, ambushes are sufficiently effective when  well-trained, small subunits are assigned to them. The  proportion of ambushes in their tactics is steadily increasing.  Therefore, in my view, there is a need (if only from the  standpoint of development of theory) to make more precise the  concept apparatus as it applies to ambush operations and to  define them by type.    For some reason, there is the opinion that ambushes are  predominantly a sphere of activity of reconnaissance platoons  and companies. Scouts, they say, are better trained; moreover,  they have special equipment and gear... It seems, to some  degree, this is not unfounded, especially if you consider that  ambushes are examined in quite great detail when training  reconnaissance bodies.    At the same time, there are numerous positive examples of  operations in ambushes by subunits of other branches of troops  as well. Ambush garrisons led by a military governor were  created in Rus back in the 11th-13th centuries. Later, ambush  regiments existed in the 13th-17th centuries. Surprise and swift  attacks by small military units often had a decisive influence  on the overall outcome of a battle. A graphic confirmation of  this is the effectiveness of employing ambush detachments in the  Kulikovo Battle, the events 1812, World War I, the Civil War,  and the Great Patriotic War.    In our days, the Military Encyclopedic Dictionary gives  several interpretations of this concept. The most successful of  them is the one defining an ambush as a "military (partisan)  subunit located secretly and in advance for making a surprise  attack against the approaching enemy." Here, it seems, it is  necessary finally to arrange all points relative to typing  ambushes according to composition and missions to be  accomplished.    In my view, according to composition, they may be  reconnaissance, motorized rifle, tank, antitank, artillery,  flamethrower, aviation (helicopter, aircraft), antiaircraft, and  finally special (chemical, engineer, and in the future those  based on using weapons with new physical principles--combat  robots, electronic, and so forth). Their basis will become  individual fire weapons (combat and special), squads (crews),  platoons, companies (batteries), or groups specially created for  some period of time. Such formations can easily be reinforced  with other forces and assets if necessary and made mixed or  combined.    Ambushes can be broken down according to purpose into  antitank, anti-personnel, anti-air, anti-landing,  reconnaissance, false, containing, primary, alternate, and  special ambushes.    As is known, the greatest effectiveness of an ambush is  achieved if surprise is possible. The effect of unexpectedness  is at work here. Fire from close range and a decisive attack  inflict especially noticeable damage on the opposing side. For  example, a tank crew under the command of Lieutenant P. Gudzya  (later Hero of the Soviet Union and colonel-general) in a  fast-moving battle near the village of Nefedovo (Moscow Oblast)  in the fall of 1941 destroyed 10 out of 18 fascist tanks, making  the rest beat a hasty retreat.    Speed of actions is equally important. You see, an enemy  that  has a several-fold force superiority to the ambush can cope with  confusion, and then the situation will take shape not in the  "hunter's" favor. In other words, subunits must be able to  execute a quick disengagement and withdrawal. Experience amassed  also attests to the need to provide (which officers sometimes  forget, unfortunately) local security of ambushes so as not to  be subjected to a surprise attack themselves.    However, I repeat: In addition to the need to take into  account in training practice the experience of past years,  something new must be added to it, based on a more complete use  of the achievements of military science and the combat  characteristics of modern equipment and armament. There are  quite a few capabilities whose realization would have made it  possible to increase the effectiveness of employing ambushes. I  would like to call readers' attention to just a few of them.    It is no secret that mobile weapons operating, depending on  the mission received, on a platoon--company scale or  independently are usually used to set up the ambushes. With  skilled organization of ambushes, the tanks, infantry combat  vehicles, self-propelled artillery mounts, self-propelled  antiaircraft mounts, and other weapons making up the ambushes in  the vast majority of cases unnoticed by enemy reconnaissance,  and their surprise fire from close range prove to be deadly for  its main body.    At the same time, the effectiveness of engaging the  attacking  forces will increase if artillery and air subunits enter the  fighting. The fire of the senior commander's forces and assets  not only will support the operations of those participating in  the ambush and inflict even more damage on the enemy but also  will to a considerable extent contribute to the successful  disengagement and withdrawal of weapons to new positions.  Therefore, it seems to me that suggestions about including  artillery observers and air controllers with communications  assets and means of transport are not unfounded.    However, there are a number of problems here. For example,  questions of coordinating the ambush not only with artillery and  aviation but also with subunits from which it is assigned remain  on the agenda. In any event, I dare say that in Afghanistan a  different trend was seen. Ambushes there sometimes ended up in a  trap themselves, and in fighting a numerically superior enemy  could only count on their own forces, since help from the  outside was late.    Based on the specific tactical situation, it is advisable to  allocate some mobile assets to occupy fire positions on the  flanks and ahead of the forces defending in the security zone.  They are to open surprise aimed fire on the enemy when he  approaches effective fire range. When necessary (depending on  the importance of the target), artillery and aviation fire is  called in. It makes sense to use high-precision munitions for  more reliable engagement of the enemy. After accomplishing the  mission, combat vehicles withdraw under the cover of the senior  commander's assets and take up their places in the dispositions  of the subunit that sent them. Further development of this  variant of operations involves the participation of other forces  in destroying the enemy and in transforming ambushes into  complexes of various weapons.    A second direction of their improvement is the use of two  groups as part of the ambushes: Diversionary and combat groups,  and in individual cases a prisoner "snatch" group (Figure 1).  Such ambushes operated actively against the limited contingent  of Soviet troops in Afghanistan; and unfortunately, not without  success. Diversionary groups sought in every way possible to  create the greatest noise effect and delay the movement of our  subunits with the aid of barriers, manmade landslides (Figure 2  [not reproduced]), and mixed minefields.     <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-002C-34A>             Figure 1. Organization of ambush based on experience of combat operations in Afghanistan </FIG>      A diversionary group usually opened fire when clearing a  passage in obstacles. The main role in engaging the enemy was  assigned to the combat group "clearing" the way for the prisoner  snatch group. After carrying out their mission, the rebels  swiftly withdrew over pre-planned paths (in the vicinity of  Feyzabad) or roads (in the vicinity of Ghazni).    A further increase in the effectiveness of this method of  ambush operations is seen in using improved and advanced  armament; for example, infrared sighting and observation  devices, combat robots, remote-controlled weapons, and so forth.  The enemy can be pinned down by using remote minelaying devices,  helicopter mobile obstacle construction detachments, and  controlled minefields. Main engagement of the enemy is  accomplished by using artillery, army aviation, remotely piloted  vehicles, and others.    The third direction assumes creation of specially prepared  combat assault groups [UBG's]. These groups fought in Vietnam  and made a good showing. The composition of each of them during  those years was limited to 3-4 people equipped with automatic  weapons with silencers, "Mukha" rifle and handheld antitank  grenade launchers, special mines, and portable radios.    Today, in my opinion, it is quite realistic to create up to  18 UBG's in a motorized rifle company and up to 54 UBG's in a  motorized rifle battalion. Operating primarily at night on  enemy-occupied territory (in the security zone after it is  crossed by the advancing forces), each combat assault group,  changing the ambush site two or three times a night, is able to  destroy up to three enemy objects such as a tank, infantry  combat vehicle, armored personnel carrier, electronic equipment,  military equipment, command and staff vehicle, launcher, fuel  supply vehicle, ammunition vehicle, and so forth. Consequently,  a battalion's UBG's are able to destroy 150-200 pieces of  armament and equipment in a 24-hour period.    Combat assault groups operating independently or in platoons  could also remain in the enemy's rear area for some time after  withdrawal of the forward detachment and conduct sabotage  operations. To increase their survivability, in the planned area  of operation it is advisable to set up in advance a network of  bunkers with stores of ammunition, explosives, food,  communications equipment, medicines, and also to equip rest  areas. In the future, combat assault groups could be part of  special subunits intended for conducting ambushes, which, I am  convinced, bear a specific nature and require special training.    In conclusion, I will note that today Russia's armed forces  have amassed a large amount of experience in organizing and  conducting ambush operations. Its importance in training troops  is certainly very great. However, it will produce the most  return only if new methods of operations are developed on its  basis, fully corresponding to the modern nature of combined-arms  combat.

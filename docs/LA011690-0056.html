			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: FOR HOLLYWOOD AD AGENCIES, GETTING FIRED IS ALL PART OF SHOW  BUSINESS  </P> <P> About all Jack Fiman can do is wait.  </P> <P> His tiny Santa Monica agency, Martin &amp; Benedict Inc., has been purchasing  commercial time for films made by Cannon Pictures since 1979. Fiman's firm,  which employs just 12 people, has long relied on Cannon as its largest client.  </P> <P> But Cannon -- which mostly makes C-grade action films such as "Penitentiary  III" -- recently ran into financial troubles and underwent several management  changes at the top. Along with those changes, the studio has put its estimated  $20-million advertising account up for review.  </P> <P> Fiman hopes -- and expects -- to hang on to his biggest client. But he has been  around Hollywood long enough to know the score, and he isn't complaining about  the review. "I understand why this happens," he said. "The film industry is a  high-profile business and there's a lot of shuffling. When that happens, just  about everyone goes up for review."  </P> <P> But Cannon is just a very small piece of a very large picture. These days, it  seems half of Hollywood is out looking for agencies to plan and purchase media  time.  </P> <P> Last week, Paramount Pictures ("Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Star Trek  V -- The Final Frontier") fired the ad firm D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles  from its $70-million account. And two weeks ago, the Tri-Star division of  Columbia Pictures Entertainment ("Look Who's Talking," "Steel Magnolias") took  its estimated $150-million spot TV media buying business away from AC&amp;R  Advertising and handed it to McCann-Erickson. In November, 20th Century Fox  Film Corp. ("War of the Roses," "Enemies, A Love Story") said it was taking its  estimated $30-million network business away from the J. Walter Thompson agency  and planned to purchase the media time itself.  </P> <P> Cannon, which is not expected to name its agency until February, refused to  discuss specifically its review. But Cannon executives were willing to talk  generally about why studios seem to change agencies so often. "The marketing  task in this industry is enormously complicated," said Allan Freeman, senior  executive vice president of marketing at Cannon. "Introducing a new movie isn't  like introducing a new brand of dog food. When you bring a new dog food on the  market, you don't have 400 people around the country writing a critique on it  that weekend."  </P> <P> Some major film studios seem to change agencies almost as often as the movie  theaters change the film titles on their marquees. But why are so many  Hollywood studios prowling around for new agencies right now?  </P> <P> "When you have changes in management, the new people often like to bring in  their own teams," said Miles Turpin, chairman of the Western division of Grey  Advertising, which purchases media time for Warner Bros., the studio that  brought "Batman" to the screen last year. "Keep in mind, this was a fairly soft  Christmas. A lot of films didn't live up to expectations."  </P> <P> Of course, that won't stop agencies from chasing after film studio accounts.  After all, of the estimated $4 billion spent annually on advertising in  Southern California, an estimated $1 billion of that is spent on film  advertising. A studio will commonly spend as much as $10 million hyping a  single major release.  </P> <P> "If you're an advertising agency in Los Angeles, you're not going to have  critical mass unless you have an entertainment or (Asian) automotive account,"  said James Agnew, executive vice president and general manager of the Los  Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson. "It would be like being in Detroit and  not having an auto account." Although Thompson recently lost Fox as a client,  it still purchases media for Universal Television.  </P> <P> One film executive says marketing a film can be a no-win situation for a  studio's marketing department. "If a movie is a big success, people often say  it's because the film was good and it was booked into the right theaters," said  Barry Lorie, senior vice president of marketing at MGM/UA. "But if a movie  fails, the marketing department gets the blame because people say the ads were  lousy."  </P> <P> One key measure of success in the film industry is box office market share.  Paramount, which ranked No. 1 in box office share in 1987 and second in 1988,  fell to fifth last year. It should be no surprise then that Paramount brought  in a new marketing chief -- who last week fired the studio's agency, D'Arcy.  </P> <P> "Advertising a new film is like being asked to successfully introduce a new  product in one week," said James Helin, managing director of Paramount's former  agency, D'Arcy's Los Angeles office. "That's a very difficult thing to do." In  the film business, that first week -- if not the first 72 hours -- is often  critical to the failure or success of a film.  </P> <P> "It's the giant crapshoot of all time," said MGM's Lorie. "And it attracts the  best crapshooters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hakuhodo Advertising Wins Suzuki's L.A. Dealers  </P> <P> It isn't exactly sweet revenge -- but for all of its work, at least the Los  Angeles office of Hakuhodo Advertising didn't come out empty-handed.  </P> <P> Last week, it won the estimated $600,000 account of the Greater Los Angeles  Suzuki Dealers Assn. That win comes just a few months after the agency finished  second in the running for Suzuki's estimated $20-million national automotive ad  business. That account was won by Asher/Gould Advertising.  </P> <P> "When we didn't get the national business, we decided to continue pursing the  dealers' associations," said David Parmenter, vice president and management  director at Hakuhodo. The agency is also doing some creative projects for  Suzuki dealer associations in San Diego and Phoenix.  </P> <P> With good work for the dealer associations, Hakuhodo hopes it can land the  national account eventually. Sure, Suzuki has only a few models right now. But,  joked Parmenter, "We think Suzuki's saving us for their luxury division."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zacky Switches Firms but Not Spokeswomen  </P> <P> A new agency is under wing, but popular spokeswoman Lillian Zacky will continue  to crow about Zacky Farms' chicken in radio commercials.  </P> <P> Last week, the El Monte company -- which sells about 1 million chickens every  month -- handed its estimated $2-million creative account to Italia &amp;  Associates in Los Angeles. Western International Media will continue to handle  media buying.  </P> <P> For months, Zacky has mostly relied on free-lancers to create the folksy radio  ads that for more than a year have featured Lillian Zacky, wife of company  President Robert Zacky. In the ads, Lillian Zacky often talks about her  fictionalized attempts at the grocery store to get people to buy Zacky Farms  brand chicken.  </P> <P> "When I go to food shows, many people tell me they buy Zacky chicken because of  the commercials," said Lillian Zacky. Some people have even begun to ask for  her autograph. "Can you imagine that?" she said. "I'm flattered."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creators May Buy Back Stake in Growing Firm  </P> <P> Controlling interest in a fast-growing Los Angeles agency may be repurchased by  its local management within the next year. The two namesakes of the firm  Kresser-Craig, which creates ads for Atlantic Richfield Co., are negotiating  with giant Omnicom Co. to repurchase the one-third interest in the agency that  they sold to Omnicom just five years ago. The two men already own a one-third  interest between them. The remaining one-third is owned by Japanese ad firm  Dai-Ichi Kikaku.  </P> <P> "The discussions have been too informal to even be news," said Robert Kresser,  chairman of the agency. But Jean Craig, the agency's president and creative  director, said the deal could be completed within the next year. Why buy back  the one-third interest? Replied Craig, whose agency has increased its billings  to $80 million from about $20 million over the past five years: "We're doing  terrific."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suissa Returns to Puns for Sports Connection Account  </P> <P> If an ad campaign appeared to work well for a former client, is it OK to use  virtually the same campaign for a new client?  </P> <P> David Suissa seems to think so. Last year, his Santa Monica agency, Suissa  &amp; Associates, created those pun-filled billboards for the Marie Callender's  Family Restaurant chain. The billboards had short snappy sayings like "Yankee  Noodle Dandy." Suissa's agency lost the restaurant chain's account late last  year.  </P> <P> But Suissa recently picked up the $2.5-million Sports Connection ad business.  And last week, Sports Connection billboards began to appear with this saying:  "Happy New Rear."  </P> <P> Is Suissa just rehashing an old campaign for a new client? "We put our egos  aside," said Suissa. "The thing that counts is whether or not a campaign works.  I don't mind criticism if I'm building my client's business."  </P></p>

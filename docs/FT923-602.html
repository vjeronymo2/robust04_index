			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Major upgrade for M25 motorway OVE ARUP &amp; PARTNERS HIGHWAYS GROUP has been appointed by the Department of Transport (Eastern Region) to carry out the design and construction supervision of the widening of the M25 between Junction 23 - South Mimms and Junction 28 - Brentwood. This section of 40 kms joins the A1(M) to the A12 and includes two tunnels, Holmesdale and Bell Common, and the M11 intersection. The scheme is to widen the M25 to dual four lanes while keeping new construction within the existing fence lines. The programme is in two phases with the aim of having the first section in operation in the autumn of 1996 and the total scheme finished by the autumn of 1998. Ove Arup &amp; Partners International, in association with WS Atkins, has been appointed by the Ministry of Public Works, Kenya, to undertake the preliminary design of the Olenguruone-Silibwet Road. The project is funded by the ODA. The six-month project is for the preliminary design of the upgrading of 60 kilometres of road on the southern side of the Mau Forest in Kenya. Any work on this road has significant environmental and ecological impact and these will be key factors in assessing the upgrading of the road. The brief is to provide an all-weather single carriageway road through this rural area which minimises the environmental impact. Such rural roads are essential for the growth of the local economy by providing year round access to the local urban areas.</p>

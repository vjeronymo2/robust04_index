			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Cookery: Pleasures of the English summer table HOLIDAYING in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, I was struck by the beauty of the scenery and the charm of the small towns - particularly Tenbury Wells and, just over the Shropshire border, Ludlow. The pleasures of the table were also considerable. Hereford is famous for its beef. There are fine cheese-makers to be found in the surrounding area, good flour mills and bakers, and apple juices, cider and perry made from the fruits of local orchards. Soft fruit and vegetable growers are also plentiful, many organic. One of the things we enjoyed most was meat from a small, Q Guild family butcher's shop, which that has been buying on the hoof, slaughtering and butchering, for 90 years: T H Checketts, of Ombersley, nr Droitwich (tel: 0905-620284). Tony Checkett hangs his meat properly and shares my belief that heifer eats better than steer. The staff in his shop are young, friendly and knowledgeable. The forerib of beef that I bought (from a heifer, hung for three weeks) made a memorable roast. Also excellent were their own bacon and meaty, simply-seasoned, pork sausages. I met other shoppers in the queue who come regularly from 20 miles away. I am not surprised. Another highlight was succulent asparagus bought from Goodmans, of Walsgrove Farm, Great Witley, Worcs (tel: 0299-896272). They grow several varieties, some with deep purple tips, some the palest of greens, Geynlin, Franklin and a juicy whopper from Holland called Boonlim. The asparagus season is over, alas, but the soft red fruit season is getting into full swing. Freshly picked strawberries, raspberries and tayberries can be bought at Walsgrove farm gate or you can take a basket into the fields and pick your own. Recommended to serve with the berries are soft fresh cheeses, yoghurts and creams by Pru Lloyd of The Dairy House, Weobley, nr Hereford (tel: 0544-318815). Her products are available at the farm and in many shops locally. For hard cheeses we went to Old Ley Court, nr Churcham, just outside Gloucester (tel: 0452-750225). There Diana Smart and her son, Jamie, produce traditional hand-made Double Gloucester from full cream unpasteurised milk, and the lesser- known, fresher tasting Single Gloucester, which I like even better, which is saying quite a lot. The cheeses can be ordered by telephone and sent by post, or can be collected from the farm - which gives you the chance to see the lovely old cheese presses in the dairy, and to choose your own cheese from the cool of the cheese store. One of the most enchanted spots in Herefordshire is the nine-bedroomed Hope End Hotel, near Ledbury (tel: 0531-3613 fax: 0531-5697), where Elizabeth Barrett Browning spent many of her young days and time seems to stand still. The house, with its minaret towers, arches and walled courtyards (one with a quince tree, the other with spring water tricking from a scallop shell into a small pool), lies in a cup of lovely parkland. Patricia Hegarty's family have lived thereabouts for 600 years. Her cooking is firmly based on using the produce of the area and in particular on the offerings of the garden, where her husband, John, grows fruits, vegetables and herbs in the traditional way. As result, the menus feature seasonal treats such as seakale, ruby chard, salsify, cardoons, butternut squash, cottagers' kale, morellos, whitecurrants, mulberries and many old varieties of apple and pear, including Black Worcester pear, recorded in the area in the 16th century, still displayed in the city's coat of arms. ARTICHOKE &amp; CRAYFISH (or LOBSTER) FLAN (serves 8) Patricia Hegarty uses her own home-made curd cheese for this, and artichokes grown in the walled garden at Hope End. Saltwater crayfish is also known as crawfish, spiny lobster or langouste. It is not the same thing as freshwater crayfish. For the pastry: 3 oz of 100 per cent wholemeal flour; 2 oz unsalted butter; 1 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan or Cheddar cheese; up to 2 tablespoons cold water to bind. For the filling: 6 medium sized globe artichokes; 1 freshly cooked saltwater crayfish or lobster; 3 large eggs;  1/4 lb curd cheese; a little finely grated Parmesan or Cheddar cheese (optional). Make the pastry in a food processor or electric mixer, and let it rest for at least 20 minutes. Roll it out very thinly on a cold floured surface, use it to line a 9 inch flan tin with a removeable base, and blind bake. Boil the artichokes for 45 minutes. Take them apart. Save the fleshiest 'petals' to decorate the finished dish, discard the chokes and chop the artichoke bottoms into  1/2 inch dice. Cut the crayfish or lobster meat into pieces of the same size. Scatter both ingredients over the base of the pastry case. Beat the curd cheese with the eggs and season with sea salt and black pepper. Spoon the mixture over the shellfish and artichokes. A little grated cheese on top is nice too. Bake at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 for 20-30 minutes until set. Serve warm or cold, surrounded by the reserved artichoke petals, with the green herb dressing to spoon over the flan, and a salad of buttercrunch lettuce and blanched courgette slices on the side. GREEN HERB DRESSING 1/4 pt green virgin olive oil; 1 oz cider vinegar; 1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional); basil or tarragon. Mix the oil and vinegar with sea salt and mustard. Whizz in the chopped herbs at the last moment. BUTTERCRUNCH AND COURGETTE SALAD 1 Buttercrunch lettuce; 6 young courgettes about 4 inches long; a little landcress or sweet marjoram; sunflower seeds or toasted sesame seeds. Cut the courgettes into one-eighth inch slices. Blanch them for 1 minute in a little boiling water. Drain quickly, refresh in cold water and pat dry. Break the lettuce leaves into large bite-size pieces, mix gently with the remaining ingredients and dress just before serving.</p>

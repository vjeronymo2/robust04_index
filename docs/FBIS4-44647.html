			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marco Gasparetti: "The Electronic Owl That </F> Watches Over the Environment"]    [Text] Thousands of bright colored dots on the computer  screen reconstruct the images of animals: A wolf moving with  suspicion, a group of deer in search of drinking water, a family  of wild boars, father, mother and three little ones coming out  from behind a bush. It is the middle of the night in the wood,  but a strange electronic creature is spying on the secrets of  nature. At first sight it resembles a camera mounted on a  tripod, but there is something special inside those lenses and  printed circuits. In the absence of light an infrared eye  records details that not even the most sophisticated lens would  be able to see during the day. Officine Galileo of Florence  have jokingly renamed the nocturnal vision system an "electronic  owl." Why is it different from all the others? Because the  "electronic owl" does not act on reflected light as usually  happens, but succeeds in capturing the radiation emitted by the  subject.    The glass lens has been replaced by an opaque germanium disk  that helps in capturing wavelengths that are not visible to  normal cameras. The images are then processed by a workstation,  which reproduces the outline of the animals, their most secret  habits, their movements, and their numbers on the monitor. This  technology is also used in the military sector. Officine  Galileo has applied it to firing and sighting systems used  during the Gulf War. Above all, the system developed by the  Tuscany-based company, does not annoy "the animals of the  night." In fact, the animals are not aware of the presence of  the electronic intruder and therefore their reactions are  recorded without any outside interference. The "infrared owl"  is just the first in a series of projects developed as a result  of the reconversion of Officine Galileo's military sector  production which accounted for 80 percent of its total  production up to 1978. A system that combines a mix of  leading-edge technologies, electronics, and computer science has  been developed to safeguard against forest fires. Special  cameras installed in various parts of the forest and connected  to a computerized center, provide precious round-the-clock  information on the area and sound the alarm in case of fire.    The civil sector technology has another winning card: the  multiple use of systems. For example, the fire watchdogs can  also be used to transmit information of the state of health of  vegetation and on pollution levels. Today, the majority of  Officine Galileo's production is dedicated to civil systems  (approximately 60 percent) and primarily for environmental  protection. A bet that Officine Deputy Director Bruno Minguzzi  comments on with a little bitterness: "There is still little  awareness in connection with environmental protection and  conservation. Programs are either not being launched or proceed  very slowly."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At noon today, Joe Clark, the UN secretary  general's special representative in Cyprus, said that no  agreement has been reached on the confidence-building measures  and that there is no reason for further talks with the two  sides, at least today. He said: After my meeting today with  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, I do not think there is any  reason for me to hold any more talks.    In a statement at the Ledra Palace checkpoint, Clark said  that before making any suggestions, he wants to think about what  he discussed here and in his meetings with Greek and Turkish  representatives. Asked if he suggested any changes to the 21  March UN document, Clark said: I only dealt with one  suggestion. We always had just one package, nothing more, and  the issue was how to implement it. I asked that we deal with it  imaginatively. We have worked on it but reached no agreement.    Clark and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative in Cyprus, will brief the  ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members on  their meetings in Nicosia and Ankara. The meeting will be held  at 1800 today at the British High Commission. Clark will leave  Cyprus at 0800 tomorrow. [passage omitted]    In answer to a question, government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis said it seems that the new UN effort has reached a  deadlock. He said that our side is now waiting for the UN  secretary general to submit his report, which would recount the  events and should attribute responsibilities where they exist.  Asked whether Clark will have a new meeting with the president,  Kasoulidhis said the UN envoy wished the president Happy Easter  and bade him farewell. He added that if anything comes up, the  president will never refuse to meet with Clark.    After meeting Kliridhis, Clark said he had a lengthy meeting  with the president, adding that there is no reason for further  comment in view of the new meeting with Denktas.</p>

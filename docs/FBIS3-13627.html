During his stay in Algiers, he was received by His  Excellency  President Lamine Zeroual, who received a message from al-Shar'  addressed to him by his brother His Excellency President Hafiz  al-Asad of the Syrian Arab Republic.    A round of talks was held between Foreign Minister Mohamed  Salah Dembri and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.  Delegations from the two countries took part in the talks. The  two sides reviewed the overall fraternal ties between the two  countries and their future prospects. They decided to revive  the meetings of the Joint Syrian-Algerian Committee in Algiers  in June 1994.    The two sides also exchanged views on Arab and international  issues of common interest, foremost among which is the Middle  East peace process, and the obstacles plaguing it due to Israeli  intransigence, procrastination, and attempts to drag the  concerned Arab sides into partial solutions. They agreed that  the desired regional peace must be just and comprehensive and  grounded in the relevant international legitimacy resolutions,  particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425.    With regard to the occupied Syrian Golan, the two sides  reasserted the need for Israel to effect a complete withdrawal  from the occupied Syrian Golan in accordance with the relevant  international legitimacy resolutions. They also demanded  complete Israeli withdrawal from all other occupied Arab  territories. The two sides also said that the restoration of  the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people must be  guaranteed.    The two sides reiterated their condemnation of the heinous  massacre committed by Israeli settlers at the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron, the occupied Palestinian West Bank. They  appealed to the international community to shoulder its  responsibilities in this regard to ensure the protection of the  Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories.    The two sides underscored that the drastic situation in the  occupied Arab territories requires the termination of the  Israeli occupation and the dismantlement of settlements in  accordance with international legitimacy and the relevant UN  resolutions.    The two sides examined the overall Arab situation and the  sincere efforts required to rehabilitate Arab solidarity. They  maintained that all efforts aimed at achieving a serious Arab  reconciliation must be encouraged. The two sides also exchanged  views on the topics listed on the agenda of the next ordinary  session of the Arab League Ministerial Council.    Mindful of the importance of the issues pertaining to  Mediterranean security and cooperation, and in light of European  initiatives in this regard, the two sides urged an Arab  initiative to call for a seminar to be attended by the Arab  Mediterranean states for consultations and coordination, and  also to crystallize joint positions toward these issues.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Cheap skaters Trafalgar House's chairmen seem to be getting cheaper by the day. The latest accounts show that Sir Nigel Broackes got paid Pounds 35,000 for less than three weeks work, while Alan Clements received Pounds 65,000 for warming the chair for seven months before Simon Keswick turned up. Keswick's remuneration works out at less than Pounds 200 per day compared with Pounds 300 per day for Clements and Pounds 1,842.10 a day for Sir Nigel's final few days in office.</p>

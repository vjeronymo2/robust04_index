			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Poland announced it will change a monument inscription in a Warsaw cemetery  that now blames the Nazis for killing more than 4,000 Polish army officers  during World War II in the western Soviet village of Katyn. It cited a Radio  Moscow report quoting a Polish Red Cross document as indicating that the  Soviets committed the massacre. Government spokesman Jerzy Urban stopped short  of flatly saying that the Soviets were guilty, as Western historians contend,  and he also did not say what the new inscription will say. A committee of  Polish and Soviet historians is evaluating the Katyn issue as part of a  re-examination of the two countries' histories.  </P></p>

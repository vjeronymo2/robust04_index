			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (6): A socialist's dilemma - The role of the new competition commissioner THE internal market was not the only innovation ushered in with the new year. On January 6, European business came under the watchful eye of the European Community's first socialist competition commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, a pragmatic Belgian responsible for transport and, latterly, environment in the 1989-92 Commission. Mr Van Miert has a hard act to follow. Sir Leon Brittan, now responsible for EC trade policy, was a committed liberal in the competition field. But the instinctive reaction of some of his supporters - that Mr Van Miert is bound to be 'soft' on competition - is not necessarily borne out by the evidence. For example, during the past four years, the Belgian commissioner has pushed through a complex and far-reaching air liberalisation package, which lifted government curbs on air fares from January 1. By mid-1997, this same deal will allow any EC airline to fly any route, including domestic services, anywhere in the Community. Given the strong vested interests ranged against Mr Van Miert, this was no mean achievement. Nonetheless, Mr Van Miert takes over the role of competition commissioner at a difficult time. Pressure to reverse, or at least freeze, EC competition policy is growing. This is partly a result of the single market itself, which has opened previously protected EC industries to new competition from other EC countries and from outside the Community. It is also a symptom of the general recession which has tempted more interventionist-minded governments to try out protectionist solutions. In his earliest statements after announcement of his new job, Mr Van Miert restricted his statements on EC competition policy to saying that there would be changes. He is likely, for example, to look more carefully at the social and industrial impact of competition decisions than his predecessors. Purists fear this will water down policy, but Sir Leon believes the precedents established under his regime and that of the previous commissioner, Mr Peter Sutherland, will last. So what is in the panoply of anti-trust weapons which Mr Van Miert has inherited from his predecessors, and how will he use them? The EC merger regulation. Probably the most far-reaching of the innovations to emerge during the Sutherland-Brittan period, the regulation allows the Commission to look into large-scale cross-border mergers within set deadlines, and outlaw or amend deals. In fact, only one deal has been blocked outright since the regulation came into force 2 1/2 years ago - the Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, which, as transport commissioner, Mr Van Miert supported. As competition supremo, Mr Van Miert will have to decide whether the threshold for examining deals under the regulation should be lowered, as favoured by Sir Leon and by the Commission's own merger task force. He will also grapple with the controversial question of how to define the market for each merger, and whether to allow European champions to develop in line with the growth of the single market. Articles 85 and 86 of the original EC treaty, which are aimed at preventing cartels, price-fixing and abuse of a company's dominant position. In the last months of his tenure, Sir Leon pledged to introduce new internally-binding deadlines for such cases, which frequently take a year or more to complete. If Mr Van Miert backs the Brittan reforms, he will have to try to persuade reluctant competition officials that such deadlines are feasible and necessary and ensure they are implemented. At the same time, he inherits a commitment to devolve responsibility for smaller anti-trust cases to national authorities - but without allowing overall competition policy to be distorted. Article 90 of the EC treaty, which gives the Commission the right to issue directives breaking open public monopolies without first having to gain member state approval. That right was affirmed by the European Court in 1991, but since then even Sir Leon has fought shy of using it, although he has threatened it many times against energy, postal and telecommunications monopolies. This would be one way of opening up some of the most difficult outstanding areas of the single market. But it would also be a last resort option. If Mr Van Miert chose to use it, he could alienate those member states - notably France - which were happiest with his appointment. State subsidies. This is probably the area in which Mr Van Miert will face the strongest challenges to his authority, as member states seek to ease their favourite industries into the single market. Sir Leon's advisers claim Mr Van Miert was too soft on state aid to airlines, the supervision of which is still the responsibility of the transport commissioner. But it is impossible to predict from a handful of decisions how he will react to more complex cases which bring together industrial, social and competition considerations. An independent EC cartel office. This is not yet part of the Commission's armoury, but the question of whether to create a separate German- or British-style competition authority is certain to be posed during Mr Van Miert's tenure. The suggestion was always attacked by Sir Leon, partly on the grounds that it would encourage commissioners to take purely political decisions, whereas under the current system they are bound to consider the implications of their rulings for competition. In fact, critics suggest that latterly Sir Leon was himself much too eager to tailor competition policy to short-term political demands: striking creative deals with merging companies, for example, to avoid another row like the one that exploded over de Havilland. Competition lawyers in Brussels, and their corporate clients, say they are seeking the same from Mr Van Miert as they sought - and did not always receive - from his predecessors. They want predictability in the implementation of EC competition policy, enabling business to work confidently within the single market. Mr Van Miert's much-vaunted pragmatism will face a hard test.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         RECENT LANDMARK EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMPETITION RULINGS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DATE        CASE                           SIGNIFICANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.12.1990  ICI and Solvay fined Ecu47m    At the time, the largest ever             for alleged soda ash cartel    fine imposed by the European                                            Commission  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.3.1991   European Court upholds         Confirmed Brussels' ability             Commission's right to use      to challenge national             Article 90 of Treaty of Rome   monopolies without seeking             to liberalise the tele-        prior approval of EC             communications equipment       member states             market  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 24.7.1991   Tetra Pak fined Ecu75m for     Currently the largest fine             alleged abuse of its           ever levied by the Commission             dominant position in the             market for cartons and             liquid packaging machinery*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 2.10.1991   Commission vetoes              The first and only case yet             Aerospatiale and Alenia's      blocked under the September             attempt to take over de        1990 EC merger regulation             Havilland, Canadian aircraft             maker  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 22.7.1992   Nestle bid for Perrier         Established for the first             cleared on condition that      time that the EC merger             brands are given up to a       task force will take into            'third force' on the            account the impact of             French mineral water market    duopolies and oligopolies                                            on the market  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Decisions still subject to appeal ruling in the European Court of Justice  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

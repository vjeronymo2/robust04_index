			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "The Biggest Airbus Prepares </F> for Its Maiden Flight"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Intended to replace the Super-Guppies, all four of  which will reach retirement age before 2000, the AST is under  final assembly in Toulouse. Its maiden flight has been announced  for September 1994.    The aircraft's real name--the A300-600ST--leaves no doubt  about its Airbus family connection. The Satic consortium has  indeed developed the future replacement for the Super-Guppies  from an A300-600R. But although the new airplane uses several  unaltered subassemblies, says Satic President Ugo Drager, "the  A300-600ST program is practically equivalent to the development  of a new plane" due to the jumbo's size (over 56m long, over 17m  high, and 45m in span) and technical complexity. All the same,  the program enables Satic to borrow heavily from the know-how of  its parent companies and partners, and to cut costs and  development time while using top notch technologies.    The Satic consortium, a 50/50 joint venture of Aerospatiale  Airplanes and Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, is the chief contractor  in charge of coordinating the program. Not only is it  responsible for negotiations with Airbus Industrie, which is  acting as a real launch airline, it also handles the contracts  signed with cooperating partners, even those assigned to members  of the consortium as part of the program.    Commonly referred to as the AST (Airbus Super Transporter)  or  Belouga, after the great dolphin of the Northern Seas whose  image it invariably conjures up, the aircraft is currently  undergoing final assembly in the Toulouse halls of Hemet  Exploration, a subsidiary of Sogerma-Socea.    Using an Airbus aircraft as a starting point enables Satic  to  cut costs by employing basic structural subassemblies  manufactured by the production aircraft's traditional partners.  In all other respects, however, the A300-600R's structure had to  be substantially altered to boost its maximum carrying capacity  to 45.5 metric tons (the Super Guppy can carry 23.8 metric t).  Engineers had to increase fuselage diameter from 5.6m on the  A300-600R to 7.4m on the AST, resulting in a modification of the  entire upper part of the fuselage. Compartment access raised  another problem, which was solved by lowering the cockpit below  the level of the aircraft's floor, so that the cargo door could  be positioned in the nose cone. This configuration makes it  easier to open and close the door, which is the biggest ever  installed on an aircraft. The door's position results in gains  during loading and unloading of the craft: Turnaround time, said  program officials during the aircraft's presentation in Toulouse  on 3 February, drops from two or even three hours to 45 minutes  at most, regardless of the weather. The cargo door can open  effortlessly in 45 knot winds, which is not always the case with  Super Guppies that are not sheltered in a specific type of hall.    But the aerodynamics of such a cargo plane are grossly  different from that of the original craft. To compensate,  engineers raised the tail fin and reinforced the rear horizontal  stabilizer, equipping it with auxiliary fins to improve the  aircraft's flight stability.    On 3 February, the AST was fitted with one of the key  components of its modified portion, the cargo door. As the two  diagrams show, work to alter the A300-600R's structure was  assigned in batches to European partners. Approximately 80  percent of production work on the AST has been farmed out to  European subcontractors. The division of labor on the modified  section breaks down as follows: 60.66 percent in France; 16.73  percent in Germany; 13.03 percent in Spain; 8.71 percent in  Great Britain; and 0.87 percent in the Netherlands. As one might  expect, unaltered subassemblies will be produced in the usual  factories of Airbus Industrie partners, to hold down costs.</p>

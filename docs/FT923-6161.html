			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: Opera double bill - Edinburgh International Festival A double-bill with a combined cast of two: when the new festival director at Edinburgh has come from the world of opera, it is ironic that his first festival should be so parsimonious in the provision of operatic fare. The festival is into its second week and this performance at the King's Theatre is the nearest that the visitor seeking culture will yet have come to a staged opera. Doubtless there comes a point where the hungry man is grateful for any morsel that is thrown his way. It may not matter that this pair of one-person operas - one by Cimarosa, the other by Poulenc - barely requires any sort of staging at all. The novelty of putting them together is probably enough to carry the evening in itself. But, even combined, they are hardly able to satisfy an appetite for real opera. The first was Cimarosa's Il maestro di cappella, an under-spiced little hors d'oeuvre. The orchestra is on stage and is being rehearsed by the singer/conductor. Violins are asked to play their part first, then violas, then oboes and so on. Some amusement is caused when the players get their parts wrong, but the jokes wear thin the second time round and it is only the professionalism of Claudio Desderi, who has made a speciality of this piece as singer and conductor, that carries it off. There is rather more to Poulenc's La Voix humaine, although that, too, has always seemed to me an unsatisfying work. A desire to get the music to mirror the neurotic chat of 'Elle', a woman near suicide on the phone to the lover who has jilted her, results in a score of disconnected comments and asides, which fail to build into a single, cumulative statement. The opera stands or falls with its solo artist. In Edinburgh, Elisabeth Soderstrom showed that, in physical terms at least, she can still give a devastating performance of Elle. As we know from her Janacek heroines, there is nobody to equal Soderstrom in the portrayal of the modern woman. The forced smile, the nervous lighting of a cigarette, the sleeping pills, the affectionate cradling of the phone: all caught poor Elle, a rag-bag of 20th-century neuroses, to perfection. The timing and dramatic awareness remain inspirational. With Elle's couch wisely placed in front of the orchestra (and not behind, as at the Queen Elizabeth Hall some years ago) Soderstrom was able to make herself heard easily enough, although the voice is audibly difficult to control these days. Richard Armstrong directed the Scottish Chamber Orchestra with more drama than sensuality, the stage acoustics at the King's Theatre also being on the dry side for this lush piece. It was rumoured that the second performance on Monday was to be Soderstrom's farewell to the stage. If true, she has departed with her customary sense of style.

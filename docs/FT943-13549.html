			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Italy Before Mr Silvio Berlusconi rode on to the political stage promising radical change, investors used to fret about Italy's political volatility and its public debt-GDP ratio - the second highest in the industrialised world. Three months later, those same worries are re-emerging. There now appears a real risk that the coalition government will unravel. Given the unpopularity of his current stance, it is not certain that Mr Berlusconi would profit from any ensuing elections. The Comit index yesterday dropped 3 per cent on the uncertainty. The currency and bond markets shuddered too. The markets seem likely to continue punishing Italy until the political uncertainty is resolved. A convincing plan for correcting the budget deficit is also needed. The worry is that a strong political will is essential to make inroads into the 1995 deficit given the need for structural reforms to pension and health spending. The task grows harder as the yield spread of Italian bonds over bunds widens. It is now 415 basis points, making the deficit ever costlier to finance. Italy's underlying economy is recovering well. Inflation has fallen to its lowest level for 25 years. The weak dollar will help ensure Italian inflation remains suppressed while the strong D-Mark makes Italian exports all the more competitive. The economy is forecast to grow at about 2.5 per cent next year promising a strong rebound in corporate earnings. Mr Berlusconi must make sure that, after Italy's promising build-up, he does not shoot the gains over the bar.</p>

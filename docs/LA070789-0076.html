			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AZINGER, GILDER, KNOX SHARE LEAD WITH 65S  </P> <P> Rain-softened greens plus mild winds added up to low scores as Paul Azinger,  Bob Gilder and Kenny Knox shared a one-stroke lead in Thursday's first round of  the $1-million Greater Hartford Open at Cromwell, Conn.  </P> <P> Each shot a six-under-par 65 on the 6,786-yard course. Five players were tied  at 66, 11 more at 67.  </P> <P> The already easy Tournament Players Club of Connecticut layout was even less  challenging than normal after showers Wednesday. Balls rarely rolled far from  where they landed, and golfers could putt aggressively with little fear of  badly overshooting the cup.  </P> <P> The light breeze provided some relief from the high humidity but had little  effect on shots. Skies were cloudy most of the day but there was no rain.  </P> <P> "This is absolutely as easy as a golf course can play," said Roger Maltbie, who  shot a 66.  </P> <P> Eighty-two players broke par 71 on a course where four of the last five  tournament winners shot 15-under-par 269 for four rounds.  </P> <P> One stroke behind the leaders were Brian Tennyson, Ronnie Black, Jim Carter,  Clark Burroughs and Maltbie, the first-round leader last year with a 64.  </P> <P> Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe and Australian Peter Senior shared the lead at 132  after the second round of the $450,000 Monte Carlo Open in Monaco.  </P> <P> Senior shot a three-under-par 66, while McNulty had a 64.  </P> <P> Spain's Severiano Ballesteros shot a 67 but missed the cut with a 142, four  over par.  </P></p>

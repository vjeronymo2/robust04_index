Chi Haotian said: China attaches importance to its relations  with the United States and hopes that the spirit of the  Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle will be carried forward. It is not  strange that differences exist between the two countries. So  long as both sides adhere to the principle of equality and  mutual benefit and of respecting each other, Sino-U.S. relations  will certainly be improved and developed. The development of  friendly and cooperative relations between China and the United  States is not only beneficial to both sides but is also  beneficial to stability in the Asia- Pacific region. Turning to  China's military strategy, Chi Haotian said: China's armed  forces are defensive in nature, serving economic development.  China poses no threat to any country.    Brzezinski spoke highly of China's achievements in economic  development, believing China is an important factor for  stability in the world. He said current difficulties between  the United States and China are transitional in nature, that the  strategic interests of the two countries are long-term ones, and  that the American people's friendship for the Chinese people is  sincere. He expressed the hope that China and the United States  will continue to work hard to stabilize and develop bilateral  relations. He said he is optimistic about the prospects of  Sino-U.S. relations.    The U.S. guests came at the invitation of the Chinese  People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.</p>

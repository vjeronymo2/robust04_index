			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The shaky ruling coalition  of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and the former partner Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] were nearing agreement  in their crucial reconciliation talks Thursday [23 June], with  speculation rife on the probability of Hata's resignation,  political sources said.    Jockeying among key political parties entered the last  stretch amid a looming possibility of agreement on realliance  being reached at a meeting later in the day between Hata and SDP  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama.    The SDP, which split from the coalition in April in protest  against maneuvering by its partners to create a new Diet bloc  excluding the SDP, confirmed earlier in the day the party's  policy of demanding Hata's resignation as a condition for its  rejoining the fold.    Murayama is expected to urge Hata, who leads the first  minority government in four decades, to resign along with his  ministers at the planned meeting, coalition and SDP sources said.    Hata has so far rejected the call, but some coalition  lawmakers Thursday voiced the view that he will announce his  bowing out to pave the way for an early realliance.    The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition  bloc, is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the  Hata cabinet after the budget passes the Diet later in the day.    The SDP turned down the LDP proposal for talks to form a  joint government in a clear signal that it places top priority  on the bid to rejoin hands with the coalition.    The SDP-coalition negotiations, based on the SDP's policy  outline put forth Wednesday, centered on the bills for redrawing  an electoral map in line with the political reform law passed in  January and the proposed hike of the consumption tax.    The coalition called for an extension of the term for the  current Diet session, which expires next Wednesday, for the  passage of the bills, while the socialists argued it should be  delayed to the next session, the sources said.    On the consumption tax, the coalition sought an SDP  agreement  to specify the size of the hike, but the socialists, who  strongly objected to the introduction of the tax, rejected the  request.    Meanwhile, Hata expressed strong hope for an SDP return to  his camp.    "I would be happy if we can move toward a new politics along  with the SDP. We have a seat open for them," Hata told a House  of Councillors Budget Committee session.    In the face of growing prospects for the SDP's return to  the ruling camp, three small reformist groups decided thursday  to refuse any overtures to join the coalition unless it is made  clear that the SDP will supply the prime minister.    New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which also broke ranks with  the coalition, the Group Seiun, a splinter group from the Japan  New Party (JNP), and Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind), another  JNP defector club, also called for fresh policy-making talks  among all the parties that have accepted invitations to join the  coalition.    A senior Sakigake legislator, Hiroyuki Sonoda, in telephone  talks with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, said the SDP's  policy outline is acceptable.    ``Sakigake would respond positively if the SDP tries to  create a new coalition with Murayama as its head,'' he told Kubo.    Another Sakigake kingpin, Shusei Tanaka, told a press  conference that the SDP's move to talk not only with the  coalition but also with the LDP indicates the socialists have a  radical realignment of the coalition in mind.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ELEPHANT DOING OK AFTER SURGERY  </P> <P> The 19-year-old elephant who underwent the first-ever Cesarean section on a  pachyderm was alert and "doing fine" Tuesday, according to officials at the San  Diego Wild Animal Park.  </P> <P> Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the park, said that Jean, a 7,000-pound African  elephant, had slept on her feet Monday night after the four-hour surgery was  complete.  </P> <P> Tuesday morning she had "seemed depressed," he said, but had taken a bath and  interacted with the other elephants.  </P> <P> "We are cautiously optimistic," he said, noting that Jean has not yet begun to  eat. "She had a good afternoon, standing up on her own strength. So far, the  vets aren't worried."  </P> <P> On Monday, a team of 11 doctors removed a 300-pound dead fetus from the mother  after determining that the surgery was necessary to save her life. They  worried, however, that Jean could become infected by the fetus' decomposing  tissue. They will continue to monitor the elephant around the clock for signs  of infection, Hanscom said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VOLVO, RENAULT SWAP STOCK TO HONE COMPETITIVE EDGE  </P> <P> Sweden's car maker Volvo and Renault, the French state-owned automotive  concern, today announced acquisition of major equity stakes in each other's car  and truck production operations in a bid to become more competitive.  </P> <P> The companies said they also intend to enter into an "extensive cooperation  agreement" under which they will coordinate product development programs,  purchasing operations and investment plans.  </P> <P> But they said each company will maintain its trademarks and distribution  organizations and will continue assembling and marketing its own cars, trucks  and buses.  </P> <P> The announcement in the Dutch capital capped months-long rounds of negotiations  between the two companies, whose sales have been under pressure in an  increasingly competitive world market.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Volvo and Renault will swap 45% of the shares in their  truck and bus operations and exchange 25% of stock in their car divisions,  according to Raymond Levy, Renault's chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Pehr Gyllenhammar, president of Volvo, said the agreement means both companies  will "maintain their integrity . . . and will give them the size, breadth and  depth well above the critical mass necessary to survive in this fiercely  competitive industry."  </P> <P> The stock swap covers an auto conglomerate that will account for production of  about 2.3 million units a year, or about 20% of the European market, analysts  said.  </P> <P> The combination will produce more than 155,000 trucks, beating the current  leader in that field, Daimler Benz of West Germany, by a margin of 40,000  units.  </P></p>

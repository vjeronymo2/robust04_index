			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Zamyatin, Ilya Bulavinov, Vladimir </F> Georgiyev: "The General Chose Not To Discuss Politics"]    [Text] General George Joulwan, NATO's supreme allied  commander in Europe, described yesterday's meeting with Pavel  Grachev as a culmination of his visit to Moscow, saying NATO  wants to be not only Russia's partner but also its friend.  True, so far the sides chose not to specify the political  aspects of this friendship.    Joulwan's visit to Moscow was planned long ago and did not  depend on Russia's signing the Partnership for Peace program.  Now, as Andrey Kozyrev said at a meeting with the general, the  visit can be seen as concrete manifestation of Partnership. The  head of the Russian Foreign Ministry was, as usual, allegoric:  He compared Russia's joining Partnership to the opening of a  railway line and Joulwan's visit to the establishment of a  specific timetable. According to Kozyrev, it is planned to  include into this "timetable" five to six joint Russian-NATO  games.    In the course of talks between Joulwan and Pavel Grachev  joint peacekeeping operations were described as a high priority  in Russia's relations with NATO. Yet, the Russian minister  believes, the interests of both sides should be reckoned with.  Questioned how they will be considered in the process of  consultations, Joulwan preferred not to answer: This is a  matter for politicians, and he is a military man. Therefore he  concentrated on practical problems: He reached agreement with  Grachev on opening NATO's permanent mission with the Russian  Defense Ministry and the Defense Ministry mission with the NATO  Allied Command, and setting up an emergency hot line between the  NATO Allied Command and the Russian Armed Forces General Staff.    Russian Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov drew Joulwan's  attention to difficulties involved in implementing the  Partnership program: In his opinion, not all politicians in the  West understand what a new Russia is all about. Lobov sought to  have his interlocutor believe that the problems of sharing out  the Black Sea Fleet or Moscow's peacekeeping actions in the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia do not point to a return to its  imperial past. Suspicions that Russia continues to develop  bacteriological weapons must also be cast aside. Partnership,  according to Lobov, should help Russia cut its military spending  and release funds for reform.</p>

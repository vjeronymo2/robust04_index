			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Welsh excel on Wagner Night - Promenade concerts In the first two of its four Proms this season, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales confirmed the high reputation it has established under its principal conductor, Tadaaki Otaka. Theirs seems to be a mutually beneficial relationship - the Japanese conductor's special affinity for the Romantic repertory and the orchestra's warm, cultivated playing complement each other. The programme on Wednesday suited them well. Billed as Wagner Night, it was an attempt in the 100th anniversary season at recreating the past: until the death of Henry Wood in 1944, Wagner Nights were a tradition, which accounts for Wagner's status as the Proms' most-played composer - 4,449 performances in all. Recordings have made such programmes unnecessary and 'bleeding chunks' are now out of fashion, but Wednesday's concert was a canny box-office move: the Albert Hall was packed. The Overture to Tannhauser (played 103 times in the first ten seasons alone) and the Venusberg ballet music provided scope for polished orchestral playing. Otaka favoured slow, deliberate tempos - on its return, the Overture's chorale theme nearly ground to a halt - but gave the music shape to justify his approach. His expansive view of the Wesendonck Lieder meant that the orchestra never quite established the contrasting moods of the five songs. But Anne Evans, a lyrical Wagnerian, was an ideal soloist. 'Schmerzen' was achingly beautiful. The sultry 'Im Treibhaus' seemed to take on new meaning for the audience sweltering in the Albert Hall hothouse. Miss Evans is, of course, one of Britain's leading Wagnerians - a distinguished Brunnhilde at Bayreuth and elsewhere, and recently Isolde for Welsh National and Scottish Operas - and the chance to hear her in Brunnhilde's Immolation was especially welcome. With gleaming tone, she rode all but the biggest climaxes. Balance was bound to be a problem: one singer without the projecting help of the proscenium arch, pitted against a Wagnerian orchestra normally sunk below the stage. The Gotterdammerung finale was preceded by two other extracts from the opera, Siegfried's Rhine Journey and Siegfried's Funeral March, which found Otaka on form, able to make something genuinely dramatic of chunks that in isolation can pass as a succession of sound effects. Thursday's concert was an all-British programme, all late-Romantic - even Daniel Jones's 1976 Dance Fantasy, a genial eight-minute puff that gave the orchestra an opportunity to fly its Welsh flag. 'The Walk to the Paradise Garden' from Delius's opera A Village Romeo and Juliet followed, Otaka drawing sensuous playing from the excellent strings. His conception of the Walton Viola Concerto - premiered at the 1929 Proms with Hindemith, no less, as soloist - was less convincing. The scherzo lacked panache, and some uneasy ensemble fell short of the 'molto preciso' marking. But Nobuko Imai was an imaginative, flexible soloist, who brought shape to Walton's long lines. Otaka had firmer idea about Elgar's Symphony No 1. Conducting from memory, he welded the first movement with a clear sense of its structure, though he was too generous towards the brass. The swaggering, syncopated subject in the scherzo was also too heavy, and unduly aggressive as a result; the heartfelt Adagio was as seamless as it should be. There is more Elgar than Otaka found here, but this was nevertheless a gripping performance.</p>

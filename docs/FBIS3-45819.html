			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by staff reporter Lu Mu (7627 </F> 3668): "Steel: From 8 Million to 88 Million"; first three  paragraphs are RENMIN RIBAO editor's note]    [Text] The year 1994 has arrived while news of success  keeps pouring in for us. Often, news of success does not come  without statistical figures. A series of figures illustrates  the brilliant achievements our country has made in socialist  economic construction since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, especially since Comrade Deng  Xiaoping gave his talks during his South China tour and since  the 14th National CPC Congress was held.    Figures are most eloquent. Comparing figures is revealing.  Longitudinal comparison shows us how much progress we have made  in real terms, while lateral comparison reveals how much we are  still behind the developed nations.    To help our broad readership understand the rich contents of  figures, we open a new column, "Review and Prospects," today.  In this column, we will use past data and current statistics to  illustrate how difficult it has been for us to achieve what we  have achieved and to throw some light on the arduous nature of  our future tasks. We truly face heavy tasks and have a long way  to go. We trust that such comparisons will spur us further  ahead in reform and opening up with full confidence and to  strive for new victories in the building of socialism with  Chinese characteristics in a down-to- earth manner. We also  hope our readers will make requests and offer suggestions so  that we can run this column well together.    In order to promote iron and steel production, the people of  our country went through an arduous journey full of twists and  turns.    Most of our comrades aged 40 years or above can vividly  remember how we strived to produce 10.70 million metric tons of  steel in 1958. At that time, almost everybody, regardless of  age or sex, joined the effort. In the end, actual output was  only 8 million metric tons. The victorious newspaper stories  printed on the right carry the distinct signature of those time.    The 35 years between the 8 million metric tons of 1958 and  last year's 88.676 million metric tons span two significantly  different periods.    In the first 20 years (1958-1978), iron and steel production  of our country had slow growth. It took 12 years to bring  output from 10 million tons to 20 million tons; then it took a  further eight years to increase output from 20 million tons to  30 million tons. The novel "The Water Margin" tells a story  about "conquering Zhu's Village after three battles." In our  iron and steel production front, we also had the experience of  trying to "conquer '26 million' with three battles." For three  years in a row from 1974 to 1976, we planned to increase steel  output to 26 million tons, all to no avail.    In the second period of 15 years (1978-1993), with ongoing  reform and opening up and a spurt of vitality in our national  economy, it took five years to increase steel output from 30  million metric tons to 40 million metric tons, three years to go  from 40 million tons to 50 million tons and another three years  to go from 50 million tons to 60 million tons, two years for  output to reach 70 million tons from 60 million tons, and only  one year to grow from 70 million tons to 80 million metric tons!    In these 15 years, not only has iron and steel output  increased at dramatic rates, progress in variety, quality, and  technical advancement has also been very fast. In the 1950's  and 1960's, China could only smelt ordinary carbon steels, but  in the late 1980's, we could produce all kinds of carbon steels  and high- temperature, precision, and other kinds of alloy  steels. Varieties of steel have increased to more than 1,000.  Smelting techniques and technology have also undergone great  changes. Before 1974, China's continuous casting ratio was  zero, but it reached 34 percent last year.    Naturally, however, although China has become a big producer  of iron and steel, we are far from being a competitive producer.  Annual steel output per worker in our iron and steel industry is  only 24 metric tons, while the comparable figure in such  countries as Japan and the ROK is two to three times higher than  ours. Energy consumption per metric ton of steel in our country  is 1.5 metric tons of standard coal, which is 50 percent higher  than the advanced international level. There are even greater  gaps in terms of variety and quality. Only half of the crucial  varieties needed by key areas of the national economy are  supplied internally, and the others still need to be imported.  Our country's iron and steel industry is now making efforts to  optimize its structure and narrow the above-mentioned gaps as  soon as possible.</p>

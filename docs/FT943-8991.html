			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / How to Spend It: Find an affordable slice of Africa on darkest Regent St - An exhibition of artefacts which steers a careful line between art and tat Most of the artefacts that come out of Africa fall into one of two categories - they tend to be either old, rare and expensive or else mass-produced, tatty and inexpensive. Liberty of Regent Street this week has opened a selling exhibition of Africana which miraculously manages to fall between the two schools - almost nothing is antique or rare but neither could any of it fairly be dismissed as tourist tat. Having been a modest collector of Africana for some time (the stars of my collection probably being the little tortoise-shell and ostrich bead Bushman powder puff or, then again, it could be the spear I bought straight from a Masai warrior striding across the Serengeti) I know just how out of reach the truly old and beautiful pieces of African art have become. Picking out the one good mask from a load of tat turned out cynically for the tourist market is not always as easy as it ought to be. And while nobody minds if they like what they are buying and are being charged accordingly, none of us likes being taken for a ride. Here in the Liberty exhibition the buyer, Ron Stewart, is completely open about what is on offer. 'Nothing here is truly old and rare but everything here has appealed to me and captures something of the deep hold that Africa exerts on almost everybody who visits it.' He has managed to bridge the old and new worlds of Africa. Rooted in old Africa are pieces of woven raffia cloth from Zaire, made today but according to traditions that stretch back to long before the white man came. There are brass sculptures from Benin, again contemporary, but part of a long tradition of brass sculptures. There are Ndebele aprons of fine beadwork on animal skins, nearly as nice as the one I found in Johannesburg's city market some years ago. There were a couple of truly rare leather Masai shopping bags (I say 'were' because I have just bought one and you had better hurry if you want the second one), chicer than anything from Hermes or Gucci, though to be truthful the smell is rather more pungent than Shalimar. From new Africa there are vital, colourful township art and artefacts. Anybody who has been to an African township will know of the freshness of their approach to even the most every-day things. In a poor, dusty village in remote Botswana, I came upon one of the most desirable toys I have ever seen - a push-along lorry fashioned with love and ingenuity out of old tins and wire by a father for his son. That same impulse can be seen in the wire bicycles on sale and in the huge and wonderful tin and wire impression of a computer. The techniques used in the colourful Imbenge baskets traditionally made by the Zulu night watchmen out of old telephone wire have been deployed to make a wildly jazzy walking-stick. Old petrol-cans are saved, beaten and joined together to produce some of the jolliest lunch-boxes I have seen. Radios (proper working models) are housed in wooden cases painted in jazzed-up versions of traditional Ndebele paintings. Old enamelled tin mugs are covered in colourful Zulu beadwork and papier-mache wastepaper baskets covered in joyfully simple images painted in brilliant colours. Then there are the pieces that veer more towards proper art - from South Africa comes the most expensive piece on sale (Pounds 7,500), a vast brilliantly painted sculpture of David and Goliath by the much-feted South African artist, Johannes Maswanzany. From Zimbabwe there is a huge and impressive metal eagle (Pounds 575) as well as some naif and charming figures made by a religious group in Harare. For those wondering how to incorporate some of the fabrics into what might be a chintzy British home, I have draped some of the appliqueed raffia cloth from Zaire very simply over a pole in our study and very splendid it looks, too, while the square panels of patterned cloth can be framed and hung to serve the function of a picture. The exhibition at Liberty opened this week and is on until September 3.</p>

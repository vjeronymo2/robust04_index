Doe's troops and prepared to  fight each other, a source close to guerrilla leader Prince Johnson said.  Diplomats said the rivalry between Johnson and his foe, Charles Taylor, could  prolong this West African nation's 7-month-old civil war for weeks. Johnson's  fighters withdrew from key positions they have occupied in central Monrovia,  leaving the capital open to renewed occupation by Doe's soldiers.  </P></p>

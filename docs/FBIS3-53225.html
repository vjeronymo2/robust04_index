He said there are no obstacles on Iran's membership in GATT.    The secretary general of the International Chamber of  Commerce commented that voluntary exclusion from GATT does not  imply any weakness on the part of any country.    Rouher said in his talks with the Iranian officials in  Tehran  he had been assured that the Islamic Republic is committed to  continuing its national development projects that it started  four years ago, as well as play a more active role in  international circles.    In the same interview the Iranian secretary general of the  (Iranian) committee of the International Chamber of Commerce  Mohammad Mahdi Behkish said the Islamic Republic cannot do  better than join GATT. He added that membership in GATT would  benefit Iran and, among others, promote Iran's agricultural  exports.    The International Chamber of Commerce has 117 member states  and is active in 132 countries. It has 16 committees in various  areas including tariffs, banking, insurance, tourism, and  transportation.    Rouher is to leave Tehran later Wednesday.</p>

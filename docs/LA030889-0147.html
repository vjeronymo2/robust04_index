Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PEPSI PULLS MADONNA AD ON MTV  </P> <P> Pepsi-Cola Co. canceled plans to run a two-minute commercial with pop star  Madonna on MTV after the cable network started airing the singer's  controversial new music video, a source close to Pepsi said today.  </P> <P> The Pepsi ad with Madonna, which is dubbed "Make a Wish" and includes an  abbreviated version of her new song, "Like a Prayer," debuted last Thursday on  television shows in 40 countries.  </P> <P> The next day, MTV began running a separate music video that heralded the launch  of the singer's new song. The video shows Madonna in a black slip, dancing  among burning crosses and seeking refuge in a church where she kisses a statue  of a saint who comes to life.  </P> <P> Pepsi had planned to run the two-minute ad last weekend on MTV, but withheld it  while the video is running, the source said.  </P></p>

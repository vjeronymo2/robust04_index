			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): More young people seek job or YT place BIG increases in the number of young people aged 16 to 18 waiting either to get a job or to obtain a Youth Training place have been reported this year. According to confidential government figures, there was a rise of 23.3 per cent in the number of young people given government bridging allowances - because they could neither get a job nor obtain a YT place - in the six months to February 1991, compared with the equivalent figure in 1989-90. In London and the south-east, the comparable increase was 67.4 per cent. Recipients of bridging loans get Pounds 15 up to a maximum of eight weeks. Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's spokesman on training, said the figures revealed a genuine crisis in many areas in the provision of YT and the maintenance by Training and Enterprise Councils of the government's guarantee of a training place to all those aged 16 to 18 who wanted one. The Department of Employment said that the guarantee of YT to any young person who wanted it would be met. It said the bridging allowance was given not just to people wanting a YT placement but also to young people who wanted a job. In 1989-90, 56 per cent of school leavers aged 16 to 18 took up a YT place. Anxiety has been rising among Tecs over their ability to maintain the guarantee at a time of rising unemployment and a cut in real terms of their budgets. Recently Essex Tec warned the government that it could not maintain the guarantee this year. Last week the government said it would underwrite an overspend of about Pounds 4m by the Tec on YT this year. The Department of Employment said yesterday Essex had been an isolated issue.</p>

Applicants are advised that the Administration has proposed the consolidation of this program into the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) beginning in FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for priority areas 1.01A and 1.01B, non-competitive funding for subsequent years will be based on a program staff review of project status and performance, and evidence that the program is part of an integrated system of services described in an approved State plan as mandated by Title IV&hyph;B, Subpart 2, of the Social Security Act, pursuant to the Family Preservation and Family Support program. If the Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries program is consolidated with CCDBG, ACYF will encourage States to consider continuing those projects funded under these priority areas. For priority area 1.02, non-competitive funding beyond year three will be based on the project's responsiveness to customers' needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part III_Review Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Experts in the field, generally persons from outside of the Federal government, will use the evaluation criteria listed in Section C, Evaluation Criteria, to review and score the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ACYF reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit comments from ACYF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations, specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will be considered by ACYF in making funding decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

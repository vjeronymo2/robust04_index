			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada announces fishing cuts CANADA IS imposing a partial ban on foreign fishing inside its 200-mile zone and may restart its controversial offshore seal hunt as part of a package of measures aimed at reviving the north-west Atlantic cod fishery. Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, yesterday announced a 35 per cent cut in the 1992 northern cod quota to 120,000 tonnes, including a 50 per cent reduction in the first half of this year to 25,000 tonnes. He said the cutback would have the effect of bringing to an immediate end the winter fishing season for foreign trawlers. He also announced a ban on cod harvesting by foreign trawlers during future peak spawning periods. A diplomatic and scientific mission will meet European Commission officials in Brussels this week to express concern at the continued heavy fishing by Portuguese and Spanish trawlers outside the 200-mile limit. The measures, which are expected to lead to further fish-plant closures in Newfoundland and other Atlantic provinces, follow a sudden drop in fish stocks in the north-west Atlantic. A Canadian scientific advisory council recently slashed its estimate of the northern cod stock from 1.1m tonnes to 780,000 tonnes. Stocks of more mature fish - an indicator of spawning potential - have plummeted by more than half. The drop in fish stocks is partly blamed on a jump in the east coast seal population since environmental protests led to a halt in the seal hunt by large offshore vessels in 1987. Measures to curtail the rise in the seal population have up to now been discouraged by fears that protests would be directed against markets for Canadian fish. But Mr Crosbie said yesterday that the fishing industry is unanimous in its advice that ''notwithstanding the concern with respect to markets, measures should now be taken to start bringing the seal population under control'. The government plans to consult the fishing and sealing industry to determine the best ways of doing this.</p>

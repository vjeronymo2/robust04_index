			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Observer: Low turnout Could this be a political first? A political opinion pollster who has nothing to say. Elaine Winter, editor of the NOP Political Social Economic Review, part of Lord Hollick's MAI stable, has suspended publication of its bi-monthly review. 'This is largely a result of the fact that since the general election there has been a hiatus in the political polling that we normally do due to lack of interest,' she says in a sad letter to subscribers. 'People were so fed up with it after the election that they are not commissioning polls. If anyone needs voting intention data they can phone us up and ask if we have it, but we are doing more social than political work these days,' says Winter. She promises customers their money back and says publication will resume as soon as 'we have enough material'. Maybe if Maastricht's upsets continue, Winter's discontent could turn into glorious summer earlier than she thinks.</p>

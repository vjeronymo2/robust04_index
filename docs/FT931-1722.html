			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Observer: BT's animal magic The new symbol for the Share Shops handling the forthcoming sale of the government's BT stock remains a state secret. But Observer hears that there is a good chance that it will involve a bull and a bear. The public has to be made aware that the market for shares goes down as well as up - hence the need for the services of the stock market's two best-known animals. However, the finer details of the symbol still have to be worked out. Suggestions that the bull may be pictured dominating the bear may be ruled out on grounds of good taste - although 'that's what we hope will happen in the sale,' says one of the government's advisers.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur failures increase - Difficult trading conditions mean rise of over 9% in last six months THE FAILURE rate among Inntrepreneur Estates' pub leaseholders increased to more than 9 per cent during the last six months, Mr David Tagg, chief executive of Grand Metropolitan's property and UK retailing operations, said yesterday. Mr Tagg told shareholders at GrandMet's annual meeting that since the Inntrepreneur joint venture with Courage was established two years ago, leasehold failures had averaged between 4 per cent and 5 per cent a year. 'This has increased recently because of the difficult trading conditions,' he said. About 20 Inntrepreneur licensees, protesting that the terms of the leases were driving them into bankruptcy, picketed the meeting with placards calling for lower rents. Inside, Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders that 'only a very small minority' of Inntrepreneur's 4,700 leaseholders were not trading successfully. 'Rents are not being imposed,' he said. 'They are agreed by both parties.' Mr Terry Carpenter, a shareholder and licensee, invited Sir Allen to visit Inntrepreneur's pubs in South Wales. 'I will give you a pound for every successful one you can find,' he said. 'I will not lose much money. 80 per cent of the pubs that are shut belong to Inntrepreneur or GrandMet.' When another shareholder asked what the company thought of its relations with leaseholders, Sir Allen replied that the line was 'always a difficult one to draw.' He added: 'One cannot simply be a nice guy, much as one would like to be.' Mr Tagg said: 'Sometimes we have to take court action in the interests of the company and shareholders to recover arrears of rent or the repossession of a pub . . . but we are ready to talk to individual lessees about their problems and do what we can to help.' Another shareholder, Mr Charles Adams, suggested that the cost of more lenient treatment of leaseholders in trouble would be very small. 'I doubt if it would affect the dividend, and if it did, I am sure ordinary shareholders would be only too pleased to pay,' he said. Sir Allen said that although Inntrepreneur was still experiencing a difficult property market, it was now benefiting from lower UK interest rates. A revaluation of the estate will be made in September. Last year's revaluation led to an 11 per cent write-down and cash injections of Pounds 32m from both GrandMet and Courage. 'If it is necessary to put more money in, then we shall do it,' said Mr David Nash, finance director. On GrandMet's current trading, Sir Allen said that conditions in the UK and Europe continued to be challenging but there were 'definite signs of improvement' in the US. Currency fluctuations would have a significant favourable impact on 1993 results though balance sheet borrowings would also be increased.</p>

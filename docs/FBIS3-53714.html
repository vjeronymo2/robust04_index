Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id said around 400,000 jobs taken up by  Asians and other expatriates were awaiting Omanis and asked  local religious and tribal leaders to encourage young men to  engage in work.    Qabus, whose speech was broadcast on state-run Omani  television Thursday night, said foreigners accounted for 26  percent of the population and the government wanted to cut the  level to 10 percent.    "It is time for serious work. Let us work together to  achieve that objective," he told Omanis in an outdoor meeting,  part of his annual meet-the-people tour in remote areas of the  Sultanate.    "I have information that the majority of Omanis are aged  under 15 years. This means that the youth are coming... There  are at least 400,000 jobs occupied by expatriates and are  awaiting the Omani youth."    Qabus, 48, rejected excuses by Omanis that they could not  find jobs because they did not have academic qualifications. He  said jobs in farming and other traditional sectors that were the  main living source before oil was discovered did not require  such qualifications.    "Educational qualifications are not the ultimate goal. It is  training and rehabilitation. There are certain types of work  that do not need many qualifications. Farms and other  facilities inherited from our ancestors are still there and  testify for their capabilities," he said.    "Those who make such excuses are lazy. Only lazy people make  excuses. We all must not listen to these people and we all must  say to them: no."    Qabus said his government was chalking out an intensive  training programme for Omanis so they will replace foreigners,  who began to stream in when oil was discovered around 20 years  ago.    Oman produces around 800,000 barrels per day of oil and its  crude reserves exceed 4.5 billion barrels. It has used the oil  wealth, which fetches it more than three billion dollars a year,  to build a modern infrastructure and turn its barren territory  and mudhouses into a green spot and large buildings.    Other oil-rich Gulf states depend heavily on foreign labour  given a large shortage in skilled native labour. But they have  joined Oman in launching campaigns to lessen reliance on  expatriates, which they believe have become a threat to their  security and conservative tribal society.    Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have the biggest  percentage of foreigners, who have become a majority. But the  Iraq invasion has prompted measures in Kuwait to turn its local  population into a majority by expelling some expatriates and  restricting entry visas.    "The Omanisation programme is moving ahead," Qabus told his  citizens, who flanked him as he sat on the ground. "Shaykhs and  dignitaries are asked to urge the youth to engage in work. This  encouragement is their most important duty."    Qabus, who joined other regional states in creating a  consultative body after the Gulf war, said he was planning to  revise representation in the council according to the size of  population in the provinces.    "Representation in the consultative council will be  proportionate with the population density. The distribution  will be fair," he said.</p>

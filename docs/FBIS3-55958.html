			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Russian President Boris Yeltsin told the  Federation Council on Monday that the nation expected the  parliament to make strong efforts to consolidate civic peace.  [passage omitted]    "My speech during the opening of the Federal Assembly can  and  must be viewed as political advice to the new Russian parliament  from which the Russian people expect major democratic  accomplishments," Boris Yeltsin told Interfax before his  departure from the upper chamber of the Russian parliament.    He said that shortly he would address a joint session of  both  chambers, highlighting Russia's domestic and foreign policies,  and economic targets for the next couple of years.    As the Federation Council has not elected its chairman yet,  on Boris Yeltsin's initiative the session is chaired by the  Federation Council's oldest member, Yuriy Chernichenko, whose  candidacy was supported during an open vote.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Jakarta, May 24 (YONHAP)--South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu blazed a visible trail as he traveled  Southeast Asia over the past 10 days that will enliven bilateral  and regional relations for some time to come.    Not many other trips will ever be so multi-faceted and  multi-purpose as this one, which took Han to the Philippines,  Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, although overall themes were  evident--mustering support for Seoul's bid to grab a  non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and explaining  the South's position on the North Korean nuclear situation, for  instance.    Another Asian country, Sri Lanka, is a competitor for the  UNSC seat for 1996-97. Bearing that in mind, Han tried to build  a consensus during his visit to put up a single candidate from  the region for the seat.    On the North Korean nuclear issue, Han tried to create a  balanced view by emphasizing that the matter concerns the  international community and thus should be dealt with from a  global perspective.    Indonesia is the land where these objectives were most  highlighted. Jakarta, current chairman of the Non-aligned  Movement (NAM), serves as North Korea's diplomatic base for  Southeast Asia. Han's talks with President Suharto and Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas were crucial not only in forging close ties  with NAM but in getting the movement to note the global impact  of the North Korean nuclear row.    On Seoul's bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security  Council, Alatas said his country "had sympathy" for South Korean  efforts. Jakarta, most likely to assume the non-permanent seat  for 1995-96, could assist Seoul's bid the following year by  building an Asian consensus on competition between South Korea  and Sri Lanka.    During other parts of his visit, Han mostly filled in the  blanks of bilateral relations while noting the roles each  country would play in furthering South Korea's relations with  the region.    On a bilateral level, Han proposed to the Philippines that  they establish a "special partnership" covering economic,  cultural and social sectors and received a favorable response.    At the regional level, Manila will be the coordinator for  the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from July 1994  for two years, acting as a go-between in Korea-ASEAN relations  during the period. South Korean officials say Han's visit will  work positively in enhancing such coordination.    In Bangkok, the bilateral focus was on rectifying the trade  imbalance in Seoul's favor and activating South Korean  investment in Thailand. The two countries are expected to open  trade ministers' talks later this year.    Ties with Bangkok are already secured at the regional level,  with Thailand hosting an ASEAN meeting July 25. The regional  importance of South Korea-Thailand relations will grow as  Bangkok attempts to expand ASEAN by including the three  Indochinese countries and Myanmar.    In Vietnam, South Korea sought to establish a foothold in  the  last remaining Asian economic frontier. Han confirmed Seoul's  pledge of 50 million dollars from its Economic Development and  Cooperation fund (EDCF) and 10 million dollars more in aid. He  took it into his own hands to resolve the bitter past with  Vietnam, recalling how more than 320,000 Korean soldiers fought  on Saigon's side during the Vietnam war. "There was damage in  our past relations," he told Vietnamese President Le Duc An in  what were the most conciliatory words yet uttered by a South  Korean foreign minister. "We must overcome it by establishing  forward-looking ties."    Han called his Asian trip an example of "quiet diplomacy" --  the kind that doesn't require immediate results but long-term  efforts to look anew at Asia.    His aides intentionally avoided setting a prior agenda and  format for Han's talks with the leaders of the Philippines,  Thailand and Indonesia to allow for free discussion on whatever  they saw fit.    Han's 10-day journey to Asia is expected to paint a new  image  of South Korea as it searches for a more visible role in the  international community.</p>

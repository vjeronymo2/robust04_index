			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / A modern woman's place . . .: Dominic Lawson considers a controversy over the role of middle-class mothers Last week The Spectator published an article called: 'The Misery of Women'. It argued, in essence, that the British middle class woman was never satisfied. If she did not have a job, she was envious of those women who did: men were not so bored by them. If she did have a job, she was envious of those women who did not: they did not have to put up with the unpleasant and uncouth manners of men in the workplace. And, argued the author of the piece, James Buchan, both categories of modern middle class women envied their mothers, who were never expected to work, and were not ashamed to spend a life of leisure or pure domesticity. While I thought Buchan's article both poignant and telling, it had not occurred to me that it went beyond the painfully obvious. However, it was denounced, the very next day, by the Daily Express as 'spectacularly controversial', and was abused for its alleged foolishness and insensitivity by columnists in such diverse publications as the Evening Standard and the Independent on Sunday. Do I need to tell you that every piece of such criticism was written by a woman, all immediately identifiable as members of the second category of Buchan's miserable middle class? Buchan's analysis was, at heart, Marxist: the humanity of our woman was being destroyed by the insatiable hunger of capitalism for cheaper sources of labour. That is why, he argued 'housework has been mechanised and the fridge is stocked with Marks and Spencer recipe dishes and the birth-rate is so low.' Buchan argued that women would be much better off spending their time learning to cook and looking after the children they love. It amused me to see analysis so influenced by the left's greatest political philosopher being denounced by the legions of the politically correct, whose own philosophy usually amounts to no more than half-digested Marxism. This modern form of political correctness decrees that only women may justly pronounce on the misery of women, just as communist rulers used to insist that only members of the working class could truly pronounce on the wickedness of capitalist exploitation. One might think that the reaction to Buchan's article, and the problem he identifies, is peculiarly of our time. One would be wrong. Half a century ago C E M Joad was Britain's most famous popular philosopher and the resident leftie on the panel on the leading radio question and answer programme. In his autobiography Joad has a section 'Women in the Home'. He remarks: 'There is a controversy perpetually revived in the cheaper press on the question of whether women should go back to the home. What is not usually realised by the participators in this controversy is that for the middle-class woman - and it is over the middle-class woman that the controversy rages - there is no home to go back to . . . growth of transport facilities, increase in mechanical and electrical appliances . . . have left of (the home's) varied duties only an automatic routine. The middle-class woman neither brews nor bakes; she does not wash; she has no skill in the making of conserves and regards cooking as on the whole a nuisance. To mitigate this nuisance she does not cook so much as warm up food that others have cooked for her . . .' This was written in 1932, and by a man who described himself as 'a socialist' and a 'feminist'. Today Joad would be regarded as a reactionary old misogynist. The chief difference between Joad's analysis of the middle class woman's lot and that expounded by Buchan, is that the former believed that modern industrialism had made the housewife redundant - gadgets did her work for her - while the latter believes that gadgets have been designed to allow women into the male world of employment, and therefore to make their husbands redundant. Meanwhile, since I published Buchan's strictures, the atmosphere in the Lawson household has become a little frosty. These are dangerous waters, Watson, as that incorrigible bachelor, Sherlock Holmes, said. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

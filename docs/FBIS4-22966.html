			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ya. I. Khurgin, Moscow; UDC 51.57.591] </F>   [Abstract] The inadequacy of the probabilistic-statistical  approach to data processing is shown in a geophysical study of  wells. The drawbacks of this approach are discussed in detail.  The proposed alternative is the treatment of measured parameters  as fuzzy numbers and the determination of the main parameters of  oil- and gas-bearing strata (obtained by solving petrophysical  equations) as solutions of fuzzy systems of algebraic equations.  The appropriate mathematical vehicle is developed. The problem  of solving a fuzzy linear system of algebraic equations is  reduced to a nonlinear programming problem.

(``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the security from listing and registration include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on November 4, 1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for its common stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person may, on or before December 6, 1994, submit a letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 announces its intent to delete the Dupont County Road X23 Site, Lee County, Iowa Site, from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on this deletion. The EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance Response Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the National Contingency Plan (NCP), any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if future conditions at the site warrant such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA will accept comments on its intention to delete this site from the NPL for thirty days after the publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses the procedures that the EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the site meets the deletion criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. NPL Deletion Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NCP establishes the criteria that EPA uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA, in consultation with the State, will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and no further response action by responsible parties is appropriate; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 121(f)(1)(C) of CERCLA, and &sect;300.425(e)(2) of the NCP require State concurrence before deleting a site from the NPL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for subsequent Fund-financed actions if future conditions warrant such actions. Section 300.425(e)(3) of the NCP states: ``All releases deleted from the NPL are eligible for further Fund-financed remedial actions should future conditions warrant such action. Whenever there is a significant release from a site deleted from the NPL, the site shall be restored to the NPL, without application of the HRS [hazard ranking system].''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management. As mentioned in Section I of this notice, &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP makes clear that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for future Fund-financed response actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Deletion Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Region 7 will accept and evaluate public comments before making the final decision to delete the site from the NPL. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community are likely to be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of the site:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. EPA Region 7 has recommended the deletion and prepared the relevant documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The State of Iowa has concurred with the deletion decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Concurrent with this National Notice of Intent to Delete a notice has been published in local and community newspapers and has been distributed to appropriate federal, state, and local officials and other interested parties. This notice announces a thirty (30) day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from September 13, 1994 and which will conclude on September 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repository.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete is made. The Region will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, which will address any comments received during the public comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A deletion will occur after the Regional Administrator places a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary will be made available to local residents by Region 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for recommending deletion of the Dupont County Road X23, Lee County, Iowa Site, from the NPL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DuPont County Road X23 Site is located near West Point, Lee County, Iowa. The site is comprised of two subsites, the Baier and the McCarl subsites, located within one mile of each other on County Road X23. The Baier and McCarl subsites are located within NE1/4, SW1/4, Section 28, Township 68 North, Range 5 West and SE1/4, SW1/4, Section 22 Township 68 North, Range 5 West, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DuPont contracted with Charles Knoch to haul and dispose of paint wastes from its Fort Madison plant during the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1949&hyph;53. (Following this DuPont contracted to have the waste taken to the Strunk Farm which was cleaned up voluntarily in 1981 by DuPont.) DuPont estimates that 48,000 to 72,000 55-gallon drums of waste were disposed of at the two subsites. The Baier subsite, owned at that time by Mr. Knoch's sister, was the primary disposal site. In inclement weather when the Baier subsite was inaccessible, Mr. Knoch would use the McCarl subsite. The McCarl subsite was purchased by DuPont in 1986 to prevent a home being built on the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

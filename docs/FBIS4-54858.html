			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bernard Besserglik] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 5 (AFP) -- A new international peace  effort due to begin Thursday ran into trouble when a row erupted  over UN concessions to Serbian forces in the implementation of a  NATO-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo. A mediation team,  the first to include both US and Russian diplomats, was due in  Sarajevo later in the day to build on efforts begun last week to  bridge apparently irreconcilable differences between the Bosnian  government and separatist Serbs over a country-wide cease-fire.    The team was due to meet with leaders of the Moslem-led  government and Bosnian Serbs before reporting back to a  ministerial conference on Bosnia which diplomats in Geneva said  would be held May 13 in the Swiss city. But prospects for the  peace effort were undermined by Bosnian fury over a UN decision  to allow seven Serb tanks pass through the exclusion zone around  Sarajevo to the Mount Igman area just west of the city, where  the Serbs fear a new offensive by Moslem troops, UN officials  said.    Two Serb tanks passed through the 20-kilometre (12.5-mile)  exclusion zone on Wednesday, escorted by units of the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR), UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon  said. Agreement for the manoeuvre was given by UN envoy Yasushi  Akashi and UNPROFOR commander Bertrand de Lapresle at a meeting  with Serb leaders in Pale on Tuesday, Chaperon said.    The agreement gave authorisation for seven tanks to pass  through the zone, and early Wednesday two tanks arriving from  Pale "were escorted from Lukavica (within the exclusion zone)  and out of the zone towards Trnovo" in the Mount Igman area, he  said. The other five tanks were to follow "in the next few  days" at a time and date to be arranged, he said.    The Bosnian government responded to the deal Thursday by  demanding the dismissal of Akashi. Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic said the government insisted on Akashi's departure  because "UNPROFOR is making deals with the Serbs." An UNPROFOR  source speaking on condition of anonymity said the arrangement  over the tanks involved the UNPROFOR command based in Zagreb and  by-passed officials in Sarajevo. He described the agreement as  "a new victory" for the Serbs. "The go-ahead was given directly  by Zagreb without consulting Sarajevo," said the source, who  complained of the increasingly restrictive interpretation being  given by UN officials of the exclusion zone imposed around  Sarajevo in February. A third Serb T-34 tank from Pale was  intercepted within the exclusion zone on Tuesday was one of the  five covered under the agreement with Akashi and Lapresle,  Chaperon said.    It was still under UNPROFOR supervision, he said, describing  its presence in the zone as part of a "special agreement at the  highest level."    Chaperon confirmed that the Bosnian Government was  reinforcing its troop presence around Mount Ingman, a strategic  height overlooking Sarajevo, but he said reports that as many as  10,000 men had been deployed there were exaggerated.    Unconfirmed reports surfaced Wednesday that Akashi had cut a  deal with the Serbs under which UNPROFOR would let the Serb  tanks pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone in exchange for  the Serbs lifting their blockade of a convoy of British  peacepeekers trying to reach the eastern town of Gorazde.    The convoy, carrying 168 British troops, was allowed to  proceed late Tuesday from Rogatica, where it had been held up by  Serb officials since Sunday, but Chaperon said he was "not  aware" of any link with the concession regarding the Serb tanks.  Tension remained high in northern Bosnia in the region around  Brcko, where UNPROFOR has observed a build-up of forces by both  sides in the past two weeks. Serbs are believed to wish to  widen the corridor in which Brcko is situated and which links  Serb-held lands in eastern and western Bosnia, while government  forces could seek to cut through the five-kilometre (three-mile)  strip to the Croatian border.    In New York early Wednesday the UN Security Council warned  both sides of the "serious consequences" of any offensive  action, following a proposal earlier by France to create a  10-kilometre (six-mile) exclusion zone around the Serb-held  town. UN military observers have already been deployed to the  area, and the Security Council ordered envoy Akashi to seek  "enhanced aerial surveillance of this and other areas of  tension."    Bosnian Army Commander in Chief Rasim Delic was quoted on  Bosnian television Monday as saying that Brcko was the "key to  the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

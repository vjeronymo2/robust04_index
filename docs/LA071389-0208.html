			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EX-UMPIRE CALLS STORY FALSE, SUES  </P> <P> A former major league umpire has filed a suit against the New York Daily News  and one of its writers, seeking more than $5 million in damages.  </P> <P> KRIV-TV in Houston obtained a copy of the suit, which said the Daily News and  writer Dave Kaplan irresponsibly and maliciously published an article falsely  reporting that former umpire Satch Davidson, who retired in 1984, had been  involved in gambling and helped fix baseball games.  </P> <P> Davidson, 54, denies the report and seeks damages of $5 million or more from  New York News Inc., depending on the net worth of the organization. The suit  also asks for $50,000 or more from Kaplan, depending on his net worth.  </P> <P> "What I've said and what the lawsuit says speaks for itself," Davidson, an  umpire for 19 years, said Wednesday night.  </P> <P> F. Gilman Spencer, editor of the Daily News, said today that the suit has been  turned over to the paper's lawyers.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After a visit to the Spanish capital, Madrid,  Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri is in the Portuguese  capital, Lisbon, today.    Mr. Dembri spoke of the situation in Algeria, the scope of  the national dialogue conference and other issues. A report  from Lisbon by our television correspondent Samia Azi:    [Azi] Today was the first meeting between Foreign Minister  Mr. Dembri after arriving in Lisbon airport with his  counterpart, Mr. Durao Barroso, at the Portuguese Foreign  Ministry. The tete-a-tete talks, which lasted more than 30  minutes, consisted of different topics: security in Algeria,  the national dialogue conference, and Algerian economic reform  policy.    International problems were not ruled out at the two  ministers' talks. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  expectations for Middle East talks, and North-South relations  were discussed.    The meeting later expanded to include delegations from both  sides.    [Begin Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso recording  in  French] I can frankly tell you that here, in Europe, we are very  worried about the news we get from Algeria regarding security  matters. My Algerian colleague has had the opportunity to tell  me that some of these reports are exaggerated, that the  situation is under control, but, frankly, we have great respect  for Algeria and the Algerian people. We think of Algeria as a  very welcoming country and it would be a shame to see this image  now change abroad. [end recording]    In the evening, the Algerian foreign minister, Mr. Mohamed  Salah Dembri, met Portuguese President Mario Alberto Soares.    Mr. Dembri told the president that Algeria always supported  Portugal in its chosen democratic path.    After he met the Portuguese president, we asked Mr. Dembri:    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] As you end your meeting  with the Portuguese president, what is your opinion of the  Portuguese position towards what is happening in Algeria -- that  is of course after your meeting with the president?    [Dembri] After Spain, our visit to Portugal appeared to be  very useful because we did not have continuous dialogue with  Portugal since 1987. But now, we agreed this morning with the  foreign minister to strengthen bilateral ties and to raise them  to the required level.    Political dialogue with the Portuguese authorities consisted  of all what interests our countries bilaterally as well as  multilaterally, while including the Mediterranean, the Maghreban  Union and what interests us in terms of current international  developments.    The Portuguese were very optimistic about the current  developments in Algeria concerning the national dialogue  conference and scopes for future proposals. Algeria still  occupies its natural position and has preserved its reputation,  well-known in the histories of countries which have reached  independence after liberation wars.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 26 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem-Croat  federation in Bosnia has not yet appointed a joint army command,  but only a joint staff which has no command authority,  Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo quotes Moslem Army Commander  Rasim Delic as saying on Sunday [26 June]. The joint staff is  to speed up the solving of the remaining problems in relations  between the Moslem and Bosnian Croat armies, he added. The  setting up of a joint command is envisaged under the Vienna  accords which put the finishing touches to the Washington  agreement signed by Bosnia's Moslems and Croats in March under  strong U.S. pressure.    Two days ago, Bosnian Croat Army representatives turned down  an offer of separation along the lines of contact with Moslem  formations in the upper flow of the Vrbas in central Bosnia, on  the grounds that it was much too early for such a move to be  made. The lack of trust between the local commanders is not  surprising in view of the fact that the memory is still green of  bitter battles fought by the two sides in central Bosnia for a  year, until they were curbed by the Washington agreement.</p>

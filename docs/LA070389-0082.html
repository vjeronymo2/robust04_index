			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: PLANNER LOOKS AHEAD AFTER WATCHING IRVINE GROW UP  </P> <P> Ray Catalano came to the new town of Irvine from Syracuse 17 years ago to see  if Irvine and Orange County could meet the "social, political and physical  expectations of the new residents."  </P> <P> For the most part, Catalano says, Irvine and Orange County have done just that.  </P> <P> For despite worsening traffic congestion and air pollution, pell-mell  development, and housing costs beyond earth orbit, the 44-year-old urban  planner and slow-growth activist says Orange County's "can do" attitude  probably will not allow the gloomy scenario of post-industrial decay painted  for the future of Los Angeles in science-fiction films to occur here.  </P> <P> "Orange County will remain one of the most desirable places to live in the  world, relative to most other places," Catalano says of the next 20 to 30  years. "But there will be nostalgia for the way it was here in the 1980s. It's  been a great decade, economically and socially."  </P> <P> Trained as an urban planner in the 1960s, Catalano was 26 when he came here in  1972. UC Irvine had hired him to teach and research a new subject -- social  ecology. He helped launch a project to study the effects of the region's  economic and social performance on health care needs.  </P> <P> But unlike sociologist Herbert Gans, who moved to a new Long Island suburb and  in 1967 published "The Levittowners," a landmark book about the granddaddy of  planned communities, Catalano helped shape Irvine and the surrounding area  directly, first as a city planning commissioner and later as an appointed city  councilman who wielded the swing vote on most issues from October, 1985, to  June, 1988. In March, 1988, Catalano said he would not seek election to another  term because he did not want to ask people for campaign money and "in the same  breath tell them not to expect any favors in exchange."  </P> <P> Now he is moving on to a new research post at UC Berkeley. But looking back  over nearly two decades, Catalano says Irvine was the best place he could have  chosen to pursue his career.  </P> <P> "The opportunity to come to the major new town in America was too much to  resist," he says. "When I got here, I was interested in the place as a  laboratory, but it didn't take long to be seduced into being involved in the  place as a citizen."  </P> <P> Catalano adds: "My research had always been on the social and health effects of  change in a dynamic, growing economy. Here, they were going to build this new  town (and try) to help mitigate or make all of this change reasonable, in fact,  to stimulate the change itself and give people a hand . . . by taking as much  of the pain and confusion out of the kind of growth that other places had  undergone."  </P> <P> In the early years, says Catalano, architects ruled Irvine on the theory that  "nice environments make nice people."  </P> <P> "We discovered that wasn't true," Catalano recalls. "The remarkable thing was  the speed with which that insight led to doing other things." Irvine is now the  most progressive city in the United States, Catalano believes, thanks to  policies that promote creation of day-care facilities, affordable housing,  assistance to the homeless, and human rights.  </P> <P> Some of Catalano's other observations:  </P> <P> * "Let's face it. Orange County in 1972 was reputed to be a fairly rigid,  conservative and ideologically bound place. . . . But I think that these were  more pragmatic people than I thought. For example, they didn't create a  metropolitan area in which you had an old, geographically bound central city  that was decaying and isolated physically and socially from a lot of well-to-do  suburbs that couldn't give a damn."  </P> <P> "It's beyond me as to why the typical, influential Orange County voter -- who I  think of as being a moderate, management-oriented Republican -- doesn't  understand that they own the road system. . . . If any private corporation  struck a deal with a developer for a road to carry 100,000 cars a day and then  they put 200,000 cars a day on it, destroying the investment, pretty fast  they'd be in court for breach of contract. Yet that's exactly what's happening  to the public's infrastructure."  </P> <P> * "Right now the decision is being made, implicitly if not explicitly, that the  folks who are going to be here are those who can afford the  three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar house . . . and the people whose work styles  and life styles are such that they can afford to spend an infinite amount of  time on the freeways."  </P> <P> * Proposals for a new regional government with city and county representatives  won't work because "anybody could get a bloc of votes and do a number on us. .  . . They should form something smaller with adjacent cities that have similar  problems and let them allocate the number of (traffic) trips each day that  their road system can handle."  </P> <P> Catalano says his toughest decision as a city councilman was to cast the  deciding vote for building the Yale Avenue overpass on the San Diego Freeway,  over the objections of 1,500 neighborhood residents. The next city council  reversed that decision.  </P> <P> Leaving UC Irvine also is a tough decision, he adds, because "everything you do  here is ground breaking, risk taking. . . . UC Irvine has accelerated the  maturation of Orange County considerably -- economically as well as  culturally."  </P> <P> But Catalano isn't out the door yet. He says he will commute between UC  Berkeley and Orange County as long as necessary because he has not persuaded  his wife, June, that it is also in her professional interests to move. June  Catalano is Santa Ana's director of community development. The couple has a  3-year-old daughter, Elizabeth.  </P> <P> There's another reason to commute as well: Catalano has a major research  project under way here about how Orange County's economic performance has  affected the demand for physical and mental health services.  </P> <P> The research project is similar to one that first brought him to UC Irvine 17  years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Appointments: Maher's global post Hill Samuel Investment Management, part of the TSB group, has hired John Maher to take up the new post of global marketing director. An American, Maher joins after 17 years at Citicorp. There is currently an active trade in personnel between HSIM and Citi - with Neville Bowen, formerly chief executive of HSIM Group, which also includes the US and Irish fund management operations, now to head Citibank's worldwide fund management activities. 'We are currently 2:1 up,' says HSIM managing director Philip Beaven, referring to the fact that its group compliance officer also recently arrived from Citi. Maher, 41, gathered a wide range of marketing experience at Citi, mostly from New York, but since January 1990 he has been in London as UK business director, latterly with responsibility for the rest of Europe, too. He joins at a time when HSIM, which is manager and adviser to some Pounds 11bn of funds, is seeking to capitalise on institutional investors' growing readiness to place more money outside their domestic markets. 'Maher brings with him a breadth of experience, including in areas where we would particularly like to expand,' says Beaven, mentioning fixed interest funds for specialist insurance companies. HSIM lost its UK marketing director Jennie Paterson to Barr Rosenberg European Management last August. Maher's job will encompass hers, while adding the 'global' dimension.</p>

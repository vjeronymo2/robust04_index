			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lex Service The trend for car manufacturers to grab back the rights to distribute their products has been accelerating of late. Yesterday's blow from Volvo to Lex Service was a reminder that distributors can be left dangerously exposed. Only Inchcape, through its joint venture with Toyota, seems to have found a way round the problem. Lex's Pounds 100m settlement looks generous until one considers that in a depressed 1990 the Volvo business contributed three quarters of its Pounds 42m operating profits. Given the dire state of the UK car market, Volvo has shown a shrewd sense of timing. Lex may be temporarily cash rich, but there is no hiding the severity of its other trading difficulties. Investors wondering what it will do with the money are doubtless aware of its peculiarly undistinguished history of diversification. This time, they might prefer to demand the cash for themselves.</p>

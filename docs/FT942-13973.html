			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Strong retail sales growth at odds with expectations Strong retail sales growth in March appeared yesterday to contradict earlier indications that consumers had been tightening their belts before this month's tax increases. A survey from the Confederation of British Industry, and a Gallup poll of consumer confidence, had both hinted that sales growth might be sluggish in March. But figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that sales were 0.8 per cent higher than in February. Analysts suggested that the March figures might have been distorted by the Easter holidays, which make seasonal adjustment difficult because the holidays move around the calendar. The effect of Easter on sales is clear from the value figures, which are not seasonally adjusted. The value of retail sales in March was 6.5 per cent higher than a year earlier, compared with a 4.4 per cent annual increase in February. The annual rate of volume growth jumped from 2.8 per cent in February to 3.8 per cent in March. However Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, pointed out that the three-monthly trend was more smooth. Volumes were 3.5 per cent higher in the three months to March than in the same period a year earlier; in February, on the same basis, the increase was 3.4 per cent. The strongest growth came from the household goods sector, where sales volumes were 8.1 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1994, compared with a year earlier. Volumes in clothing and footwear stores and mixed-retail businesses were also up strongly. The only sector to show a fall was 'other non-food', which consists of a wide range of shops from tobacconists to florists.</p>

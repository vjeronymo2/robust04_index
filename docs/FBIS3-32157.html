			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- The group of separatist General  Labour Confederation [CGT] unions spearheaded by the  secretary-general of the powerful UGTT transport workers  confederation Juan Manuel Palacios and by former CGT head Saul  Ubaldini yesterday launched the Argentine Workers Movement (MTA)  umbrella group that pledged to oppose President Carlos Menem's  economic policy.    "Only the workers will save the workers," the MTA said in  its  nine-point founding document presented during an assembly staged  in the Eva Peron auditorium at the Federal Capital headquarters  of the UTA [Motor Transport Workers Union] transport workers.    The organizers said that the assembly was attended by  representatives of 80 dissident unions -- including the large  food workers union -- that decided to quit the CGT last week  after the umbrella group's leadership announced it was lifting a  general strike called for January.    The MTA is flatly rejecting the government's labour reform  bill and is demanding the collective labour bargains "to be put  into total effect."    The rebel unions announced that they will participate in the  100th weekly pensioners demonstration scheduled to take place on  March 2 and that it will launch a nationwide plan which could  lead to a general strike.    This is the second major split in the CGT in the last two  years. The ATE [Association of State Workers] state workers  union, the CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of the  Argentine Republic] teachers union and others walked out of the  organization in 1992 to launch the staunch antigovernment  Congress of Argentine Workers umbrella group. The CGT is  currently led by a five-man general secretariat. One of those  secretaries, Raul Amin called on the MTA "to stop messing about  so we can launch a joint action, because there is a campaign to  kill the labour movement." Amin defined the MTA as "an internal  line that is not leaving the CGT."    Palacios said yesterday that his faction had decided to name  itself "only to be identified because we are not prepared to  give up the glorious initials of the CGT." He stressed that the  division in the CGT was not final and called on those present at  the assembly not to criticize the current leadership. But he  added that the MTA "will occupy the place to fight left vacant  by the CGT." [passage omitted]</p>

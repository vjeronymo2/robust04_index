			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / LBC may take licence fight to court LBC, THE London commercial radio station that is losing both its frequencies after 20 years' broadcasting to the capital, is seriously considering seeking a judicial review of the decision. Mr Matthew Cartisser, LBC executive director, said one possible ground was that the Radio Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio in the UK, had indicated that it did not want a rolling news format because this was under consideration by the BBC. Yet London News Radio, the consortium which won both LBC frequencies, is proposing a rolling news format as well as a discussion station. Mr Cartisser said: 'We think we have been treated very very shabbily by the Authority. We rescued LBC (after the collapse of parent Crown Communications) and saved the Radio Authority from embarrassment.' LBC chairman Dame Shirley Porter told staff yesterday that lawyers had been consulted on the possibility of seeking a judicial review. She also revealed that LBC intended to seek one of the new FM licences for London expected to be advertised next year. LBC has launched a petition to try to save its Newstalk and London Talkback channels. More than 80 per cent of more than 60,000 calls received so far have been on LBC's side. The broadcaster is, however, to stop using the airwaves to promote its cause. This, Mr Cartisser said, was understandable in the emotion of the lost franchise but it would end. The company has also taken out newspaper advertisements today which repeat LBC's pledge to fight on.</p>

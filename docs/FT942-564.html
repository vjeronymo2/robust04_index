			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (16): Network for nuclear alerts Cable being laid, above, with the help of a helicopter for a new development within the UK government's Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, Rimnet. Key networking and electronic messaging elements are provided by BT's Global Network Services (GNS) for the Pounds 12m nuclear emergency response facility, writes Michael Wiltshire. Rimnet gathers data on gamma radioactivity levels at 92 Met Office locations throughout the UK to give an overall 'picture' of levels in the event of a nuclear accident, such as the Chernobyl disaster. Every hour, the main central database facility in London monitors levels around the country, passing on data for processing by the Department of the Environment. GNS is a leader in the managed data network services market, with connections to over 150 networks in more than 100 countries.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Heavy job cuts forecast for Northumberland South-east Northumberland faces a total loss of 2,000 jobs during 1994 and the three following years on top of up to 1,000 jobs shed last year, says a report to be considered by county councillors today. Research by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants for the county council says recent closure and redundancy announcements in the county, especially in its industrialised south-east corner, have already put it on course to fulfil the highest predictions of coal-related job losses in the coming years. About half the 2,000 forecast job losses have happened in the past few months with the sudden closure of Northumberland's last pit, Ellington. The county and district councils are lobbying the government for more economic development aid. The consultants, who completed their original study of the Northumberland economy in late 1992, say there is now evidence that the growth of self-employment in the area is less than previously estimated, and that the relative performance of its manufacturing has weakened. They predict that manufacturing employment will continue to fall while the energy sector declines steeply. They now estimate that total employment for the county by 1997 will be 1,800 jobs below 1992 levels, with the brunt of the jobs rundown concentrated on south-east Northumberland, where a fall of up to 3,000 jobs is expected. Without additional support, they say, south-east Northumberland's prospects are bleak, with unemployment expected to reach nearly twice the national average at about 17 per cent overall and 25 per cent for men.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of </F> France, by Francoise Crouigneau and Jean de Belot; place and  date not given]    [Text] With the installation of the Monetary Policy  Council last Friday [7 January], Jean-Claude Trichet now has all  the mechanisms of an independent Bank of France whose  credibility he must now establish. To achieve that, the governor  explains in an interview granted to LES ECHOS that he intends to  pursue a policy of a "stable franc" -- an expression he prefers  to that of "strong franc" -- while accepting the democratic  counterpart of independence, namely relations which are as "rich  and fruitful" as possible with Parliament.    But although the former Treasury director is pleased to see  German, British, and French interest rates now return to a  "narrow range," the loss of control of European public deficits  worries him. As a possible disrupting factor within the European  Union, they will be closely monitored by the governor of the  Bank of France. And especially by the European Monetary  Institute [EMI]. As for the single currency, Jean-Claude  Trichet calmly believes in it. Thanks to the fact that the  Maastricht Treaty is being implemented to the letter, it will be  formed, he thinks, by those in a position to do so. Within the  required time and by 1999 at the latest.    [LES ECHOS] With the first meeting of the monetary policy  committee, you have just inaugurated the new mechanisms of a  Bank of France which is independent at last. Is this council  not rather too homogeneous to be fully credible?    [Trichet] The procedure for appointing the council's members  provides exceptional guarantees of credibility. Just think that  each of the council's members has, if I can say so, four  signatures below his name: That of the speaker who nominated  him, and those of the president of the republic, the prime  minister, and the economy minister, because the appointment is  made by cabinet decree. I think that our college has great  collective authority based on a unique combination of strong  personalities who have rich and diverse national and  international training and experience and have exercised  top-level responsibilities.    [LES ECHOS] However, do you not think that the council's  members largely support the policy known as the strong franc  policy?    [Trichet] As you know, the term which I prefer is that of  the currency's internal and external credibility and stability.  This clearly says what it means. Moreover, I do not think you  would be able to find one central bank chief in the world who  supported a weak currency....    What I am sure about, is that the Monetary Policy Council  will define our monetary policy in all conscience without  neglecting any analysis, or any approach, and taking advantage  of the wealth and diversity of its composition.    [LES ECHOS] So, you expect the Monetary Policy Council to  show some contradiction in this sphere?    [Trichet] There will certainly be no contradiction because  the college will decide and its decision will, of course, be  clear and single. But there will certainly be depth and  richness in the debates within it. The people who are members  provide a full guarantee. Just think. There is a chairman of  an insurance multinational, who is an economist and financier of  international reputation, a journalist whose pedagogical talent  is unparalleled in France and who is, moreover, the head of an  enterprise, a university teacher who knows all there is to know  about France's monetary history and whose many books are  regarded as authoritative, an employer with unique experience of  large and small high-technology industries, an IMF  administrator, the chairman of a bank and head of the Stock  Exchange, and an economy minister who everybody remembers. I do  no need to introduce the deputy governors of the Bank of France  who, like me, are members of the Monetary Policy Council.  Believe me, the nine wisemen will do good work.    [LES ECHOS] However, do you not have a majority of  pro-Maastricht people on this council?    [Trichet] I do not intend to become involved in that debate.  The Monetary Policy Council defines monetary policy according to  the law. The college is a single entity and I will not indulge  in the little game of "prognostication."    [LES ECHOS] How will you organize the communication of  decisions by the Monetary Policy Council?    [Trichet] There are obviously important times when there are  things to say. I gave a public speech last Friday when the  Monetary Policy Council was installed by the prime minister and  the bank therefore made a statement on that occasion. The bank  will also make statements when the aims of monetary policy are  established. This is a conventional communique which obviously  changes in nature because previously there was a meeting of the  National Credit Council, a speach by the economy and finance  minister, and a press conference given by the governor, all of  which were coordinated.    There will now be a statement on the year's monetary policy  after consideration and a decision made fully and exclusively by  the Monetary Policy Council. The first two main dates are,  first the launch and installation of the new Bank of France and,  second, the monetary policy objectives for 1994. A third major  date in terms of statements will be the governor's annual report  submitted at least once a year, the law stipulates, to the  president of the republic and Parliament.    [LES ECHOS] Would you be in favor of reporting to Parliament  more than once a year?    [Trichet] One of the innovations introduced by the new  statute is, in fact, the establishment of a strong link between  the new institution and Parliament. My objective is to have a  well integrated Bank of France which plays an active part in our  democratic system. Our institution could not be isolated in an  ivory tower.    It must establish a permanent dialogue with the nation's  deputies and, through them, with public opinion as with the  country's vital forces -- I will return to this. This link with  Parliament is organized by several provisions of the law: The  governor reports to Parliament at least once a year; he passes  on the accounts of the Bank of France to the National Assembly  and Senate Finance Commissions. The law also stipulates that  the latter can ask the governor to attend a hearing and that the  governor can ask for a hearing with the Finance Commissions.    My feeling on this subject is very clear: I am convinced  that the relationship between the institution of the Bank of  France and Parliament is crucial, that it is -- in a democracy  -- a necessary counterpart of independence and that it is  extremely important that we in this house should really be  prepared for this relationship to be as rich and fruitful as  possible. I have had the opportunity to express my complete  readiness for this once again to the chairmen of the two  assemblies' Finance Commissions.    [LES ECHOS] Aside from these major dates, what method of  information will you adopt: That of the Bundesbank's irregular  press conferences or the publication of the minutes of the  Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee?    [Trichet] Following meetings of the Monetary Policy Council,  it is possible to imagine there being a communique in some cases  or, if necessary, a press conference. Another thing strikes me  as important: What I would call listening and informal  exchanges. The Bank of France must have its ear to the whole  economy, to the country, and public opinion. It has experience  of this: It has its network, its investigations, its  consultative council, and its branch councils with industrial  and commercial officials throughout the country.    An independent central bank absolutely must -- this is true  of the United States and Germany to mention just these two  examples -- be very close to the real economy and the two sides  of industry. This is because the independent central bank has  the task of safeguarding the currency -- which is common  property -- for the benefit of all and must do so on the basis  of four principles: listening, deciding, explaining, and  convincing.    [LES ECHOS] How will you react to your new relations with  the state, with the Treasury, which you headed a short time ago,  and especially with the budget ministry?    [Trichet] The relationship with the state is laid down by  the law. The prime minister and the economy minister have  access to the Monetary Policy Council. This is an important  initial bridge and does not undermine the monetary authority.  Such a provision operates in Germany without there being any  doubt about who is responsible for what.    [LES ECHOS] But you are cutting the umbilical cord with  the Treasury which was an essential element in the Economy  Ministry's network?    [Trichet] The Treasury is the economy minister. The  umbilical cord has indeed been cut. It is the government which  wanted it with regard to monetary policy. But there are two  other aspects to consider. First, the exchange system. The law  says that it is for the government to determine it. The Bretton  Woods agreements, the formation of the European Monetary System  [EMS], the changes to parity in the EMS are, in the final  analysis, the responsibility of governments everywhere.    The second important factor is the Bank of France which is  the monetary authority, the institution of the republic which,  through the legislator's will, has the responsibility of  conducting monetary policy everywhere by being the guardian of  the currency on behalf of all French people. Third, you have  the Bank of France as an enterprise from which the shareholder  -- the state -- is justified in asking the same management  efficiency as is required from the whole public sector. This  sphere does not enter into the sphere of monetary policy.    [LES ECHOS] The first discussions within the independent  Bank of France will probably relate to the time frames with  regard to interest rate reductions?    [Trichet] As governor of the Central Bank, I am very  privileged: I never say what will be done in the sphere of  interest rates.    [LES ECHOS] However, do you think you have room to maneuver?    [Trichet] I will not say anything about the future which we  will discuss in the Monetary Policy Council. I will just make  one observation. When I look at the past, I note that the  franc's credibility and stability have been accompanied by a  very large reduction in our market interest rates. It is the  franc's resilience which has made this reduction in our interest  rates possible, especially the medium- and long-term rates.    [LES ECHOS] Does France's European choice not effectively  reduce your room to maneuver and hence the scope of the reform  of the Bank of France?    [Trichet] When you administer monetary policy, you are not  just administering the rate day by day. In reality, we are  administering a "yield curve." With proper monetary intruments  over the shortest part. With credibility and stability, which  are factors which directly and deeply influence the longer term.  This is what is being administered with a number of complex,  technical tools, but also with the emission of signals which  contribute to the clarity of the monetary message. And it is  true to say that this "yield curve" of French interest rates is  not independent of the European environment, characterized by  persistent inflation in some countries and by large public  deficits.    The art of the central bank chief consists of relying on the  credibility and stability of his currency and, taking account of  the constraints of the European environment, seeking the best  possible yield curve.    [LES ECHOS] Are the public deficits in France not taking on  worrying proportions?    [Trichet] I welcome the French Government's decision to  launch a medium-term convergence program to resume control of  these public deficits. I think that this is very important. It  was also very appropriate to do it at the same time as the  Germans, because it is a general European problem. I am  convinced that we would not have the low medium- and long-term  market interest rates which we now have if this medium-term  convergence plan had not existed. There is a close link between  the credibility of the restoration of balance in our public  accounts and being able to secure better financing conditions  for the economy.    [LES ECHOS] The financial markets are still finding this  rather difficult to believe. Do you think that the risk premium  from which the franc suffered has really disappeared?    [Trichet] The markets are giving us interest rates of the  order of 5 percent over five years and 5.7 percent over 10  years, in other words, rates comparable to those of Germany.  Within the Group of Seven, France has the lowest five-year  interest rates, aside from Japan. Over recent months, the  approach has been this: We have the good fortune to have a good  level of long-term credibility; let us safeguard this  credibility by pursuing a policy of stability with regard to the  franc to secure 10-year rates which are among the lowest in  Europe. On that basis, we have been able to record a decrease  over the short part of the curve.    [LES ECHOS] Do you think it is possible to speed up the  process of moving toward Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]?    [Trichet] The Maastricht Treaty has been ratified by the  European Twelve. We are in phase two and, naturally, together  with all our European partners, and especially the Bank of  France with the other 11 central banks of the European Union, we  will implement phase two and working within the EMI. I have  great confidence in Mr. Lamfalussy who has been appointed by the  European Council to be its president and I am sure that we will  do good work.    [LES ECHOS] Is it possible to count on France and Germany  as a driving force in this sphere?    [Trichet] I hope so, and I am convinced that the Bundesbank  and the Bank of France, with all the other central banks, will  take care to ensure that real work can be done. Just think that  in a period which is, after all, short, we must harmonize  monetary instruments at the European level, harmonize  statistical and technical concepts making fusion possible  because that is the aim laid down by the Maastricht Treaty. It  is an enormous task which does not necessarily give rise to  high-flown communiques or spectacular initiatives. In my view,  the implementation of the EMI opens up very major practical  spheres for work.    [LES ECHOS] Does the EMI also have to monitor economic  management?    [Trichet] In addition to monetary cooperation, there is  indeed the whole aspect of the judgment passed on all the  elements of economic policy in Europe. This brings us back to  what I was telling you about our position within regard to  public finances at the level of Europe as a whole, which is a  serious and crucial subject.    [LES ECHOS] Are your prerogatives as governor not likely to  be limited by the replacement of the former Committee of  Governors by the EMI?    [Trichet] The EMI does not upset things from that viewpoint.  The Committee of Governors had an important function which it  fulfilled informally and formally in semi-official or "ex  cathedra" meetings. The governors also participate in all the  informal Economic and Finance Council meetings. There are  therefore many bridges, many meetings. I think that the EMI  will merely consolidate them.    [LES ECHOS] Now that we are gently returning to the  fluctuation bands which preceded the EMS crisis in the summer,  are you in favor of a redefinition of the EMS?    [Trichet] In this sphere, too, the fundamental rule must be  pragmatism. Experience has shown that the finance ministers and  the governors found the right response to July's crisis on 1 and  2 August: To confirm the validity of the scale of central  rates, fully justified by the fundamental economic facts while  temporarily expanding the fluctuation bands to discourage  speculation. This strategy has proved effective.    [LES ECHOS] Were you almost surprised by it in restrospect?    [Trichet] It is a good system. It was adapted to the  circumstances in which the Europeans found themselves. These  subjects must not be approached in a theoretical and abstract  way, it is better to approach them in a practical and concrete  way. That is what we did. And it worked well.    [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of speeding up a rapprochement  among the European Union's most stable currencies?    [Trichet] Things are in fact very simple. We have the  Maastricht Treaty ratified by the Twelve. It has been in force  since 1 November. All the states in the European Union are  rule-of-law states. We will implement the Maastricht Treaty.  Reread it. It gives all the appropriate answers with regard to  the criteria and procedures leading to phase three which makes  it possible for a single currency to come into force.</p>

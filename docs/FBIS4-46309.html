			<p>BFN     [Text] The photograph that the newspaper SABAH published  last Tuesday under the headline "Dirty Alliance!" exposed this  paper's ties with the "intelligence units" and how it is being  used by these circles. [Text of SABAH article appears as item  NC2605092094 in previous Terrorism Report]    It has been ascertained that the photograph of PKK [Kurdish  Workers Party] leader Abdullah Ocalan and M. Yohanna, the Syriac  Metropolitan of Aleppo, Syria, was part of the archives that  were seized during the 10 December 1993 police raid on the paper  OZGUR GUNDEM, whose publication was banned last month by the  Supreme Court.    SABAH resorted to an unbelievable lie to "prove"  PKK-Armenian  cooperation. It began its front page report on 24 May issue  with the following statement: "`PKK-Armenian cooperation,'  which Turkish Governments have known about for years and which  was being denied particularly by pro-PKK circles, has finally  been confirmed with specific documents." Claiming that after  prolonged work by the Turkish intelligence units, PKK-Armenian  cooperation was proven by photographs, SABAH asserted that the  priests of the Armenian Gregorian [Apostolic] Church met with  Ocalan in al-Biqa', and that the extremist nationalistic  Armenian Tashnak [Armenian Revolutionary Federation] Party has  been providing arms and financial assistance to the PKK through  the church. It also claimed that Ocalan wants to find shelter  in Armenia and that Armenians play an important role inside the  PKK.    It has now been determined that the Ugur Sefkat's report  accompanying the photograph, which the paper described as a  'document,' is a complete lie.    The priest standing near PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is  described as an "Armenian priest." But in actual fact, the man  on the photograph is M. Yohanna, the Syriac Metropolitan in  Syria.    The second lie concerns the date. The date of the meeting,  which took place between Ocalan and Yohanna on 10 March 1993 and  which was then distributed to subscribers by KURD-HA and which  was published in the monthly magazine OZGUR HALK in Turkey in  July 1993, has been 'changed' to 3 May 1994.    What SABAH called a 'secret' meeting was fully published in  a  monthly paper that anyone can buy and read in Turkey.    According to SABAH's "news," following a tip off about the  meeting of the Armenian priests with Ocalan, the Turkish  intelligence officials went into action and photographed the 3  May 1994 meeting. However, no explanation was given as to why  Ocalan was wearing a winter overcoat in May, as shown in the  photograph.  <H5>  The Photograph Comes From OZGUR GUNDEM's Archives </H5>   This photograph, under which some concocted information has  been sprinkled and which was supposedly taken by the Turkish  intelligence officials, was "seized" during the police raid on  OZGUR GUNDEM on 10 December 1993.    The report, which was published in the magazine OZGUR HALK  and which, together with the photograph, was transmitted to  OZGUR GUNDEM on the same day by KURD-HA, said that M. Yohanna,  the Syriac metropolitan of Aleppo in Syria, paid a  familiarization visit to PKK leader Ocalan on 10 March 1993 in  Barr Ilyas in Lebanon. M. Yohanna and Ocalan discussed the  problems of the Syriacs in South Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan] and  in the Mardin region and conversed on the common history of  Assyrians and Kurds.    In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian  Patriarchate in Istanbul told a television station that the  attire of the priest on the photograph is not that worn by the  Armenian priests and that no such meeting took place.    [SABAH's photograph appears to be an altered version of the  photograph of Ocalan and M. Yohanna published on page 16 of the  15 May 1993 issue of BERXWEDAN as part of a report on a meeting  between these two persons. The SABAH photograph seems to have  airbrushed some background details and eliminated a third person  standing beside Ocalan and Yohanna. Nicosia Bureau processed the  BERXWEDAN item in May, 1993.]</p>

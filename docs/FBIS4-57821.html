			<p>BFN     [Text] Guy Alexandre [Haitian ambassador to the Dominican  Republic] has firmly denied rumors that there is a plan to unite  Haiti with the Dominican Republic. This alleged plan to reunify  the two countries sharing the island of Hispaniola was strongly  rumored last week by the partisans of outgoing Dominican  President Joaquin Balaguer.    In a statement to the press this week, Ambassador Alexandre  said he knows nothing about this alleged unification plan. In  the middle of the grave post-electoral crisis being experienced  by the Dominican Republic today, the pro-Balaguer sectors have  set up an impressive campaign to highlight the dangers that  would threaten the Spanish-speaking part in the event of a  possible reunification. Alexandre noted the cultural and  linguistic difference between the two peoples.    Nearly half a million Haitians, considered the poorest  people  in the American hemisphere, are living in the Dominican Republic  where they work in the sugarcane fields and live in field  buildings. Alexandre adds that he is satisfied because the  Balaguer government took effective measures last October to  prevent violation of the UN embargo against Haiti, which was  reinforced on 21 May.    A UN mission, presided over by (Alexandre Martinovic),  arrived in the Dominican Republic the middle of last week to  ensure that the embargo, which some people use to amuse  themselves by violating the Haitian-Dominican border, was  observed. Observers accused several Dominican Army members of  effectively contributing to the violation of the sanctions by  authorizing the free transfer of oil products across the border.    These last months, several hundred Dominicans have made  exceptional profits by trading gasoline to Haitians, in exchange  for household items, slippers, and so on. The Dominicans are  closely observing events that threaten Haiti -- whether there  will be a foreign military intervention in that country. The  Dominican Army is extra watchful to prevent any violation of the  embargo and a massive exodus of Haitians to the Dominican  Republic, said an official source.</p>

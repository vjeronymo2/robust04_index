			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 8 (AFP) -- The Kuwaiti criminal  court Tuesday threw out an allegation by defence lawyers that it  was not competent to rule in the case of a member of the ruling  royal family and four co-defendants accused of embezzlement.    Rejecting the charge, acting state prosecutor Sultan  Bu-Jarwah adjourned the trial until March 22 to give the lawyers  time to answer the prosecution case, judicial sources said.    The five defendants, including Shaykh 'Ali Khalifah al-Sabah  of the royal family, are accused of having embezzled up to 100  million dollars from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Company  (KOTC).    Shaykh 'Ali, who was oil and finance minister in the cabinet  formed in exile in Saudi Arabia after Iraqi troops invaded  Kuwait in August 1990, pleaded not guilty when the trial opened  on January 18.    Judge Bu-Jarwah rejected the defence's allegation that the  trial had a "political" dimension. He said the prosecution was  judging the defendants "not according to their social or  political affiliations, but on the basis of equality before the  law."    The other four accused in the trial are Kuwaitis Hasan  Qabazard and 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Badr, Jordanian Nasim Muhsin and  Briton Tim Stafford.    Defence lawyers argued that the case should be handled by a  supreme court of five members, in accordance with a royal decree  of 1990 which ruled that any minister accused of crimes must  appear before such a supreme body.    However, parliament abrogated the decree on January 11 on  the  grounds that it "obstructed" justice and "protected ministers,"  particularly in connection with financial scandals which came to  light after Kuwait was liberated in February 1991.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Miners' buy-outs may get aid THE GOVERNMENT may provide cash support for efforts by managers and miners to buy all or part of British Coal when it is privatised, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday. 'The government will in the right circumstances provide financial help to a management and employee buy-out team,' he said at the annual conference of the British Association of Colliery Managers (Bacom) in Blackpool. The money would be designed to help British Coal employees assemble a bid for part or all of the corporation and to pay for any financial advice they might need. The statement was welcomed by Mr Roy Lynk, president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. 'I take this as a very positive sign', he said. Mr Lynk said he believed that Mr Eggar and Mr Michael Heseltine, who as trade and industry secretary is ultimately responsible for energy, were more sympathetic to the coal industry than Mr John Wakeham, the former energy secretary. 'This a manifestation of the new breath flowing through the department,' he said. Mr Eggar, who emphasised his confidence in the future of the UK coal industry, said employee buy-outs could be a very successful way of privatising companies. Mr Lynk said that clearly indicated that Mr Eggar considered the UDM's own plans to bid for all or part of British Coal were 'very acceptable'. The plans are already well advanced. The UDM has formed a consortium with Lloyds Merchant Bank, which is now approaching potential investors in an employee-led buy-out of British Coal if the opportunity arises. Mr Lynk said he expected Bacom, which is also interested in bidding, to join the UDM consortium.</p>

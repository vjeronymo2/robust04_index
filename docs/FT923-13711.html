			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Private View: A girl who got money and a room of her own - Anne Stotter realised as a child the importance of independence. She is now one of England's few women surgeons 'A WOMAN must have money and a room of her own.' When she said that in 1928, Virginia Woolf was talking about writing novels. Anne Stotter says her prescription fits the profession of medicine just as well. Miss Stotter is a doctor - not just any doctor but one of only 13 women consultant surgeons in England. She belongs to what is reputedly the toughest specialism, and the one with fewest female practitioners. Miss Stotter earns a lot more than the Pounds 500 a year (Pounds 11,800 in today's money) that Virginia Woolf said would suffice when she addressed the young women of Newnham College, Cambridge. More to the point: Anne Stotter realised very young that money means independence. Her father, a skilled but disillusioned printworker in Walthamstow, north-east London, never revealed how much he earned, kept his wife and six children on a tight leash yet seemed always to have spare cash himself. 'It was all very unfair,' she said. 'I think I was aware from very early on that control of my life was going to depend on having an income. I wasn't ever going to let someone say to me 'you cannot make these decisions because I hold the purse-strings.'' Anne Stotter did not achieve a room of her own until, defying her father's prejudices and amazing the nuns at her convent school, she won a place at Newnham 40 years after Virginia Woolf's visit. 'I never had a room before that I could close the door on. At home there was rarely peace and quiet, or warmth. I vowed when I left home that I would find money to keep warm - and I never had chillblains again.' Virginia Woolf's essay, A Room of One's Own, based on talks to the girls of Newnham and Girton, is a beautifully-written, gentle and penetrating polemic. Why, she muses, do women not go into business or the Stock Exchange and endow Oxbridge colleges? Why do college men eat creamed Dover sole and roast partridge for lunch, when college women get gravy soup, boiled beef, yellowed sprouts, prunes and custard? And what happened to Shakespeare's sister? She describes (or imagines) being warned off the grass of a men's college by a beadle and being turned away from a college library. So I asked Miss Stotter if medical men still defended their turf against women. 'Virginia Woolf nicely says that women cannot be doctors because they do not play football. There are still areas of protection but the worst of it has already passed. There are clubs you cannot go into.' (She was talking before this week's vote by the Garrick Club to continue to exclude women). 'They're not important, not to me anyway. What you miss out on is informal discussion of important issues while you pee. That's what you miss.' Miss Stotter is a frank person. She has, as she puts it, 'a short, sharp, effective way with words'. Despite that, and her prematurely grey hair, she did not strike me as the bossy matron type. On the contrary, she sometimes giggles like a girl. 'People assume that to have got where I am now I must be very competitive. But I'm actually a collaborator, not a competer by nature.' Do you behave differently with your male colleagues? 'Not because I'm a woman. I tend to speak succinctly. I could be a quiet, unassuming little flower but then I don't think I'd have become a surgeon in the first place. I'm actually quite self-conscious and quite shy. I don't like meeting new people. I'm awful at parties, for example, awful, awful.' Miss Stotter, whom I met in her room at Glenfield General Hospital, Leicester, is energetic as well as frank. 'I like to do things,' she said. Her idea of relaxation is to go skiing or to fly her expensive glider up a sheer Alpine escarpment. 'People always ask me if I have been discriminated against,' she continued. I wasn't going to ask you that, I replied, hypocritically. 'Well, I won't answer it then. But the short answer is No.' The longer answer, however, is that even if there is not overt discrimination there is certainly a non-malign bias. For example, other doctors tend to assume she is the dietician. Patients are reluctant to believe that it is she who will be operating on them (and then are usually pleased). During a long, intensive training in Britain and the US she kept quiet about her interest in breast cancer for fear she would be taught little else. She felt obliged to conceal the fact that she had a social life and a boyfriend. General practitioners tend still to refer to her patients with breast disease rather than other cases. 'That's a problem, because one of the things I have to do is maintain an expertise that allows me to treat emergencies.' Such is the competition for surgical posts, she said, that no woman could ever prove she was turned down on grounds of her sex. 'Anyway, there is nothing to be gained even if I had felt I had been discriminated against. I hope I would have had more sense than to bleat about it because it would hardly have helped my cause, would it?' I wanted to know about the men in her private life. I was thinking of Virginia Woolf's uncomfortable observation: 'Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.' Miss Stotter was married once. It was towards the end of her undergraduate years and it was, she said, 'a complete disaster.' As undergraduates, she and her husband had been on a par. 'When we were married things changed, to my eyes, in a startling and dreadful way. Suddenly, because I was a wife it was my job to go to the supermarket, to get the money out of the bank, to do the cooking and cleaning. 'I spent quite a lot of time protesting at this. I could have said 'Bugger it, I'm not going to.' But I didn't, and the reason I didn't was because I had very firmly ingrained what my role should be in life, and that included the supermarket. The guilt of not being a proper wife was quite substantial: an important thing about women is that they suffer much more from guilt.' She had chosen a man who was like her own father. (She loved her father, but felt relief when he died). Did your husband resent your being so intelligent? 'He did worry about it. When we did our Finals I got my results before him and I got a First - and he would not speak to me for a week except to say that if he didn't get a First the relationship was at an end.' And what happened? 'He got a First.' She giggled. They never had children and Anne Stotter decided not to get married again, not even to her long-standing boyfriend. 'There would only be disadvantages for me in being married. I happily live in sin and have for ages - not that there's much sin in it.' A surgeon needs domestic support. Few men even today will provide that, but Anne Stotter's man did. He gave up a job designing oil rigs. She keeps him and he looks after her. 'I think it takes immense character, immense self confidence and sanity to go against the grain. You can get beaten down by disapproval and people can say very offensive things. At our age they are mature enough to accept it, but if you tried it younger it would be very difficult.' I asked if medicine is neuter - or rather, androgynous, as Virginia Woolf said writing should be. Miss Stotter thinks it obvious that men and women are different but that it is impossible to determine whether the differences give one sex the advantage over the other. She just happens to have the rare sort of temperament which thrives on hard work and pressure and is good at deciding when, and whether, to cut. 'I think the fact I came from a working-class background in Walthamstow rather than from Cheltenham has more influence on how I treat patients than the fact that I'm a woman.' 'It's incomprehensible to me how I came to be the way I am,' she continued. She seemed moved. 'Little things, like deciding at 15 to apply to Cambridge  -it was an outrageous thing to do from my background and yet I did it and it turned out to be the beginning of a long chain of events which has brought me to where I am with a career that I like enormously, having left behind a huge number of hang-ups. 'I am more confident than I could ever have imagined myself becoming. I can't really work out how it happened. I am doing what I should be doing. I feel I am in the right place.' All without consciously striking a blow for women's emancipation? 'Yes. Because it felt the right thing for me to be doing as an individual. I must have an income, yes, I must have space of my own and it must be warm, yes. Those were the important things.'</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Noranda turns in CDollars 3m profit Noranda, the Canadian resources group, eked out a small profit last year, and has forecast a 'modest' improvement in 1994. But the 1993 profit of CDollars 3m (USDollars 2m) excluded various one-off charges stemming from the sale of MacMillan Bloedel, the west-coast forestry group, and the closure of a pulp mill. There was also an unusual gain of CDollars 46m from the sale of Noranda Forest shares. Including these extraordinary items, Noranda suffered a CDollars 37m loss, equal to 41 cents a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 79m, or 10 cents, in 1992. The 1992 figures are partially consolidated to show MacMillan Bloedel's earnings on an equity-accounted basis. Revenues dropped to CDollars 5.27bn from CDollars 5.55bn. Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 1m, down from CDollars 4m, equal to losses per common share of one cent and six cents respectively. Earnings from mining and metals fell to CDollars 21m from CDollars 153m. Oil and gas earnings dropped to CDollars 47m from CDollars 59m.</p>

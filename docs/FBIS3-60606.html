			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed D.Gd.: "Defense: Mitterrand Involves </F> Himself In White Paper"]    [Text] This event has not been announced and will not be  released in any communique, nor official statement. Top secret.  However, the defense council convened by President Mitterrand  yesterday at the Elysee Palace [president's office] at 1700  certainly is a major test for the present cohabitation.    The participants were -- besides the head of state -- Prime  Minister Balladur, Defense Minister Francois Leotard, Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, the  chiefs of staff, Admiral Jacques Lanxade, General Amedee Monchal  (Army), General Vincent Lanata (Air Force) and Admiral Coatanea  (Navy), Deputy General to the Armament Authority Henri Conze and  the secretary general to national defense, Admiral Lerche.    The agenda included the White Paper on defense which the  government would like to publish in January and the preparation  of the bill on the military program for the years 1995-2000 that  should be discussed by parliament next spring. In fact, the  most important issues facing the council were the French  position vis-a-vis NATO and the future of the French deterrent  force, the trends of which should be determined for the next 10  or 15 years by the White Paper.    Francois Mitterrand, who did not want to be directly  involved  in the preparation of the White Paper requested by Edouar  Balladur, could give his support to it if it does not contradict  his fundamental options in the field of defense. This is the  reason why this defense council was organized -- another council  should take place late in December or early in January -- so  that the head of state can examine the final drafting of the  document.    The Elysee and the government point out that the French  policy toward NATO is developing without jolts in cohabitation.  The joint opinion -- in view of the NATO summit on 10 January  -- is that progress will have to be made in affirming the  necessity of a European defense body, through the Western  European Union. The complementarity and the autonomy of  decision of such a body vis-a- vis the Atlantic Alliance will  have to be clearly defined. In the same way, if the government,  and to a smaller extent, the president wish to participate more  actively in the NATO structure, it is out of the question to  come back under the integrated command of the Organization,  which France wishes to see deeply reformed.    The nuclear issue was much more intricate. The majority in  government, mainly the RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- already  opposed to the moratorium on nuclear tests decided by Francois  Mitterrand -- recently seemed to support a possible development  of the French doctrine to a "strong vs. the weak" deterrence  which implies the use of miniaturized nuclear weapons called  "beheading weapons." This development is totally opposed to the  position of Francois Mitterrand, who advocates leveling strike  force in a context of "strict sufficiency" with the objective of  reducing world arsenals and fighting against proliferation.    The government will probably fix dates for the tests which  he  deems must be resumed in limited number, while waiting to  control the situation. On the other hand, Francois Leotard,  with the support or at the request of Edouard Balladur, recently  stated -- in public and on several occasions -- that France  rules out the possibility of heading for a "doctrine of use".  In this field, attention is given not to break the consensus.  But it is legitimate to wonder to what extent Edouard Balladur  supports a policy of a thorough modernization of the nuclear  arsenal, since it is quite obvious that he does -- and will not  in the coming years -- have the necessary budget for this  purpose.</p>

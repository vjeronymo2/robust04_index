			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (15): Blood, tears and factory closures - General Motors is pulling no punches in its fight for financial recovery THE cries of pain and anger echoing around Detroit these days are those of a revolution in the making at General Motors, which is urgently trying to return to financial health. The pain is from GM's suppliers, who are being asked to slash their prices; from the United Auto Workers union, which faces plant closures; and from white collar workers, who will, among other things, have to start paying part of the premium for their health insurance. GM is trying to rush through a slimming regimen which it should have made in the 1980s but failed to carry out because of its sheer size, inbred bureaucracy, and a traditional arrogance which failed to recognise how much the world was changing. The question now is whether it can move far enough, fast enough, given its bureaucratic nature and union opposition to job losses, and make itself sufficiently strong to match the formidable challenge from Japanese manufacturers. The changes began late last year when Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, announced the first phase of plans to revive GM's core North American vehicle operations, which lost some Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn last year. He revealed that over the next few years the group would close 21 plants and cut some 70,000 jobs. This was a major change in stance by the company, and meant final recognition that the market share it lost in the 1980s to Japanese and other American manufacturers was not going to come back. During the decade GM's US market share fell from around 46 per cent to 35 per cent, but its plant closures did not keep pace. The result was that it entered the recessionary downturn of the past two years with its plants working at a far lower percentage of capacity  - around 60 per cent, according to analysts' estimates - than its rivals, thus compounding its losses. However, even the raft of changes set in motion with Mr Stempel's December announcement did not go as rapidly as the GM board hoped and in April it staged an extraordinary coup. Control of the board's executive committee was taken from the chairman and given to a non-executive director. Mr Lloyd Reuss, the company's president and the man responsible for overseeing North America, was removed from that job and his place taken by Mr Jack Smith, head of international operations. It is Mr Smith who is now implementing the group's previously agreed strategy, though he has introduced several creative touches of his own and is bringing to the task an urgency which was previously lacking. Nowhere has this urgency been more evident than in the activities of Mr J Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura, a Spaniard who shook up GM's European parts suppliers in the 1980s and has now been called upon to do the same in North America by Mr Smith. Mr Lopez has caused immense controversy in the parts industry by demanding big cuts in prices by GM's suppliers, which he says can be achieved if they improve their efficiency. The suppliers have accused him of undermining their relationship with GM by putting out for fresh bidding contracts they thought they had already won, including in some cases sensitive information which they regarded as proprietary. The supply industry, which went through a major rationalisation in the 1980s, says GM is now demanding further efficiency improvements which are simply not there to be had. But Mr Lopez insists otherwise, and is offering suppliers the help of GM teams to identify waste and inefficiency. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation, it is sending a powerful message to Detroit that GM has changed. It is no longer business as usual. This message is also being drummed home to GM's own subsidiaries, which supply some 70 per cent of the group's parts, making it highly vertically integrated by the standards of the automobile industry. Mr Lopez is putting teams of efficiency experts into these operations as well and warning them that they can no longer rely on GM as a captive customer, but must earn the right to sell to the company along with the world's best. There is a danger in this strategy of clashes with the United Auto Workers union, which is strongly opposed both to job cuts at GM and the loss of supply contracts to outside companies. But it was a reluctance to take tough action in the past which has brought GM's North American operations so deeply into the red now. The delicacy of relations with the union was brought home in September when GM's plans to eliminate 240 UAW jobs at a tool and die shop in Lordstown, Ohio, led to a nine-day strike which stopped production of some of the company's most popular vehicles. This was widely interpreted as a shot across GM's bows by the UAW, ahead of next year's renegotiation of a three-year labour contract, to demonstrate that the company cannot slim down as it wishes without considerable resistance. But GM too can play hardball: one of the plants on its list of 21 due for closure is Willow Run, just outside Detroit. Most analysts had expected this plant to stay open and one in Texas, making the same car, to close. However, the Texan plant survived after its UAW workers agreed to more flexible working practices sought by the company. Even if GM can slash its cost base, it will still face the task of producing cars that US consumers want at prices they are prepared to pay. Its record here is extremely mixed. In the 1980s it became notorious for making dull, look-alike cars of dubious quality. But here too the company is changing substantially. Its quality is now generally regarded as close to Japanese rivals. Cadillac, its luxury car brand, has a big hit on its hands in the new Seville, while the group's small Saturn is in such demand that dealers cannot get enough of the model. Saturn, which is manufactured by an entirely separate company, using state-of-the-art management and production techniques, demonstrates what high standards GM can achieve. So too do its extremely successful European operations. And for all its current woes, the company retains immense strengths: it is a formidable technological leader at a time when this is more important than ever in the development of new vehicles. It is still huge, allowing large potential economies of scale. And it has a vast dealer network. The revolution could still come to grief, but the company's prospects look brighter than for many, many years.</p>

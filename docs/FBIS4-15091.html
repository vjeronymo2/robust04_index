			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- Estonian officials  dismissed rumors today about a radiation leak having taken place  at the Russian base of Paldiski, where Russia is scheduled soon  to start dismantling two nuclear reactors in its former  submarine crew training facility.    The rumors were spread after a Russian-language radio  station  aired reports of an accident at the reactor facility today.    Estonian Rescue Department officials were dispatched to the  site to check the radiation level around the base. Radiation  near the reactor building was no higher that the background of  the previous days and is lower than the maximum allowed by the  norms, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's representative  at Paldiski. Also Estonian police who observed the site found  no signs of a possible nuclear accident, Tikk added.    "I'm absolutely sure everything is all right at Paldiski,"  he  said.    Tikk said rumors had spread in the morning of a black cloud  forming above the reactor building. He said the rumor had been  taken so seriously in some places that people were ready to  start evacuation of schools and kindergartens.    "I suppose the rumors may have arisen from earlier  suppositions by some Estonian officials that the taking out of  nuclear fuel from the reactors is going to start on Apr. 5,"  Tikk said.    Estonian authorities are now trying to find out who started  the rumors.    Also in Paldiski, rumors spread late last month about  Estonian authorities registering the residents in the town in  preparation of a massive deportation.</p>

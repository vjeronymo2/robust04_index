			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NOW BLASTS REINER FOR NOT CHARGING ABORTION  FOES  </P> <P> Blasting Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for not filing felony  charges against the leaders of an anti-abortion rally last weekend, the leader  of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women said  Wednesday that Reiner is "failing miserably" on issues of abortion rights and  family support.  </P> <P> "The role of his office should have been to shut down those people," said local  NOW President Tammy Bruce, speaking at a news conference to reaffirm the  group's support for Reiner's opponent in the Democratic state attorney  general's race, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Reiner's office referred a case against two Operation Rescue  leaders to the city attorney's office, which Tuesday filed misdemeanor charges  of conspiracy to obstruct justice against the pair.  </P> <P> Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Reiner, said felony charges were not filed  because of the overwhelming likelihood that a court would not sentence the  protesters to state prison.  </P></p>

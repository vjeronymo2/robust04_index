			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Passing the buck The central banks seem simply to have stored up more trouble for themselves with yesterday's foreign exchange market intervention. The dollar recovered against the yen for a while, but the D-Mark was quickly stronger than before. The central banks were clearly wrong if they thought they could catch dealers on the hop in quiet pre-weekend markets. In fact, it seems they were simply giving speculators a chance to unload long dollar positions which should have been unwound long ago. Nor can intervention without supporting action on interest rates do the trick. Having shown their hand, the central banks cannot easily stop here. There may be no pressing domestic need for higher US rates, while the onset of recovery and excessive money supply growth hardly call for a cut in Germany. But the authorities are damned both ways. Unless they can stabilise the dollar, the US bond market, from which other markets around the world take their lead, looks vulnerable. If US interest rates are raised, though, there is a risk of yet more turbulence in the markets. The only consolation is that bonds and equities seem already to be discounting higher US rates. When the move finally comes, the markets could calm down. Yet, to support the dollar, any US rate rise would need to be large enough to make a significant dent in the recovery. Unsurprisingly, the equity market has now taken fright on both sides of the Atlantic. In watching Wall Street, London dealers must be wondering whether a similar fate will befall the UK sooner or later as its own economic recovery matures.</p>

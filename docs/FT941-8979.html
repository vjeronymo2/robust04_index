			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Girobank services 'not hit by strike' Girobank said last night that the 24-hour strike by its clerical staff did not appear to have affected customer services. The bank said most of the 2,200 staff at its Bootle headquarters on Merseyside backed the dispute but many worked normally at the bank's other offices. The NCU communications union warned that regular 24-hour strikes would continue until Girobank management improved its 1.5 per cent consolidated pay offer. The two sides are due to meet before the next strike, planned for March 8.</p>

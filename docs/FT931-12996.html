			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / President of British Bankers' Association supports monetary policy call from new bank head SIR NICHOLAS Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, yesterday supported the call of Mr Eddie George, the next governor of the Bank of England, for the Bank to be given day-to-day responsibility for monetary policy, John Gapper writes. Sir Nicholas said he believed that the Bank would want to discard much of its responsibility for banking supervision if it was given greater operational freedom to decide how to attain government inflation targets. Sir Nicholas, chairman of TSB Group, said in an interview that the government should move towards laying explicit monetary aims before parliament at least once a year, and then giving the Bank responsibility for achieving them. He said one reason the government should make its monetary targets explicit each year was that if it wanted to change the targets for political reasons it would be forced to disclose its intentions publicly. He said his idea of how the Bank should operate was close to that of Mr George, who said after his appointment was disclosed on Friday that there was a case for giving the Bank operational responsibility for monetary targets.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: German inflation falls to 2.8% Inflation in west Germany eased to 2.8 per cent a year in the month to mid-October from 3 per cent in the previous month, according to preliminary data from the federal statistics office. Prices increased just 0.1 per cent in the review period, when rents and the cost of services eased and seasonal food bills rose by less than expected. The data should soothe market fears of any monetary tightening by the Bundesbank, but did not pave the way for an automatic reduction in interest rates, said Mr Richard Reid, senior economist at the Union bank of Switzerland's Frankfurt office. Mr Reid, noting that the strong D-Mark had deflected any upwards pressure from import prices, expected inflation to continue falling. After hitting 2.3 per cent in January it could reach 2 per cent by late summer. Denmark's preliminary unadjusted trade surplus was DKr4.05bn (Pounds 425m) in August compared with DKr3.17bn in July. The unadjusted trade surplus for January to August fell to DKr23.7bn compared with DKr26.7bn for the previous year. Portugal's retail sales index rose 1.8 per cent in the 12 months to June, the National Statistics Institute said.</p>

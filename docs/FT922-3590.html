			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Generators warned on long-term coal deals BRITAIN'S privatised elec-tricity generating companies came under pressure yesterday from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, not to drive too hard a bargain with British Coal in the current negotiations over long-term coal supply. The outcome of those negotiations will crucially affect both the value of British Coal when it is privatised next summer and also the number of pits that will remain viable. Addressing the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM) in Weymouth, Mr Heseltine stressed repeatedly that it was not the job of government to intervene directly in the negotiations. But, in line with his interventionist instincts, he added: 'Remember when you are negotiating these contracts that you are determining the future availability of a national resource for which you will have longer-term need. 'Remember also that you are talking about communities of men and women whose lives will be affected by your decisions.' His comments follow indications that the generators are ready to buy about 45m tonnes of coal a year, falling gradually to 30m. The current agreement, which runs out next year, commits the generators to buy 65m tonnes. Mr Heseltine guaranteed that British Coal employees would get a stake in its future, whatever form of privatisation is chosen. He said that no final decision had yet been taken on how to privatise British Coal. He expressed sympathy, however, for the UDM-led consortium which aims to take a 25 per cent stake in the corpor-ation. Mr Roy Lynk, president of the UDM, said he would approach British Coal board members to join the consortium as well as the main management unions. Mr Lynk welcomed Mr Heseltine's speech, as a 'green light' for the UDM-led bid. PowerGen profits, Page 21</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- Today, the OAS/UN  delegation, in charge of supervising respect for human rights in  Haiti, "very firmly" denounced the assassination of four  political militants in Cite Soleil, Port-au-Prince's largest  shantytown, on Sunday night.    In a communique, the delegation said Emmanuel Joseph, 38;  Bontemps [name as received], 43; Delil Saint Louis, 26; and  Serge Joseph, 19, were gunned down by "heavily armed civilians."  The number of assassins has not been determined.    One victim was a member of the association Tete Ensemble  Cite  Soleil. Two belonged to the Association of Youths of Cite  Soleil 8, and one was a member of the Alliance of Haitian  Revolutionary Patriots and Democrats.    A fifth victim, also a member of a political party, and  whose  identity was not revealed, was wounded and left for dead. He  received treatment later, the communique said.    At least six other people were wounded Sunday night in Cite  Soleil. "Those executions seem to be a systematic elimination of  members of popular organizations which favor a return to  constitutional order," the communique concluded.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Russia expects to meet IMF Russia's deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, said yesterday he expected the International Monetary Fund and Russia to hold talks by the end of October paving the way for a Dollars 4bn standby loan. Moscow would then be able to resume talks with the Paris Club of western government creditors. Mr Shokhin, Russia's chief debt negotiator, said an IMF delegation would come to Moscow this week to meet members of the government. Another delegation would come after the IMF annual meeting due to take place October 3-4 in Madrid. Russia, which took over responsibility for servicing the debts of the former Soviet Union when it fell apart in late 1991, owes western creditors about Dollars 80bn. The IMF has already lent Russia Dollars 3bn to help buttress the economy. Further loans will depend on Moscow's willingness to press ahead with its economic reforms.</p>

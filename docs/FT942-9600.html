			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts It would be wrong to read too much into gilts' rally after yesterday's auction announcement. That was more of a technical squeeze than a welcome for the first convertible issue since the early 1980s. The revival is bound to be controversial, suggesting a degree of pressure on the Bank of England. After a surfeit of short-dated issues, it cannot easily come back for more. Yet the long end of the market remains too fragile to absorb a large conventional issue with ease. For those with short memories, the convertible works likes this. The Bank issues a five-year gilt which can be converted at specific intervals into long gilts at fixed yields below those currently prevailing in the market. The new gilt might attract institutions that are worried about committing themselves to long gilts now but are also afraid of missing the boat if bond markets do recover sharply once US rates have stopped rising. The capital risk in buying five-year paper is small and they have a chance of acquiring long-term paper at what may turn out to be attractive rates later. But this all looks too clever by half. In return for allowing the institutions to protect themselves in this way the Bank will get its five-year money cheaply, but maybe not cheaply enough. Holders will only convert if by doing so they can obtain a yield higher than generally available at the time. At that point the borrowing will become expensive for the Bank. If it really believes yields are too high, it would be better off waiting until they fall before borrowing long. It would look better off still if it had had the foresight to raise 25-year money when yields reached their floor of 6.4 per cent in late December.</p>

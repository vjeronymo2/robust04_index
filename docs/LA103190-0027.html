			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARITAL WOES RECOUNTED AT MURDER TRIAL;  </P> <P> COURTS: BETTY BRODERICK DESCRIBES COLLAPSE OF RELATIONSHIP AND BITTER DIVORCE  FROM PROMINENT ATTORNEY. SHE IS CHARGED WITH MURDER OF EX-HUSBAND AND HIS  SECOND WIFE.  </P> <P> Testifying tearfully in her own defense, La Jolla socialite turned murder  defendant Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick told her life story Tuesday,  portraying herself as a wife and mother scorned by a husband who jilted her  after 16 years of marriage for a younger woman.  </P> <P> Recounting the events of her bitter divorce from attorney Daniel T. Broderick  III -- whom she is accused of shooting to death, along with his bride -- Betty  Broderick said he walked out on her and began a legal campaign during which he  secured custody of their children and manipulated her finances, leaving her  emotionally and financially deprived.  </P> <P> In addition, Betty Broderick said, her husband called her names -- "old, fat,  ugly, boring and stupid" -- after beginning an affair and suggested that she  was crazy for thinking he was cheating on her.  </P> <P> Months later, he admitted she was right to suspect him, but maintained that she  was mentally ill, the defendant said.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick said the name-calling, the repeated suggestions and dozens of  other indignities and insults led her to an unsuccessful suicide attempt.  </P> <P> The day's testimony concluded before she could talk about what led her to sneak  into her ex-husband's suburban Marston Hills home last Nov. 5 and kill him and  Linda Kolkena Broderick, his new wife, the woman with whom he had begun the  affair six years before. Daniel Broderick, 44, was a prominent medical  malpractice attorney and a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn.  Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28, was his office assistant.  </P> <P> When the trial began last week, defense lawyer Earley conceded that Betty  Broderick fired the fatal shots, but said she did not have the premeditation  the law requires for first-degree murder because she intended only to kill  herself when she crept into the couple's home.  </P> <P> Interest Tuesday in the case was extraordinary. One San Diego television  station, KNSD (Channel 39), asked for permission to broadcast the trial live,  but San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan declined, a station spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Daniel Broderick's brother from suburban Denver and two of his sisters, from  Pittsburgh and suburban Seattle, attended. So did one of Betty Broderick's  brothers, who flew in from Tennessee.  </P> <P> At a morning recess, 43 people were waiting in line for about 20 open seats.  </P> <P> Emotions also ran high. Kim Broderick, Betty Broderick's oldest daughter, who  testified last week against her mother, burst into tears after one of the  morning sessions.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick's testimony was punctuated by frequent sobs.  </P> <P> She said her ex-husband -- consistently using the present tense -- "loves  clothes" and "looks very good in clothes." She said she often called him  "Dapper Dan" and then she burst into tears.  </P> <P> She cried, too, when she said, "Dan's opinion of me was really all I cared  about. I didn't care what anybody else thought."  </P> <P> Betty Broderick said she and Daniel Broderick were married in 1969, when he was  a medical student. Instead of becoming a doctor, he decided to go to law  school, she said.  </P> <P> The couple -- and, by then, their two daughters -- moved to San Diego and  Daniel Broderick began practicing law, she said.  </P> <P> In 1978, Daniel Broderick decided to strike out on his own, leaving the law  firm where he had worked for five years, Betty Broderick said. As it had been  while they struggled through medical school and law school, there was little  money, so she not only took care of the children but worked full time.  </P> <P> At a marriage counseling session about that time, Daniel Broderick "apologized  profusely and said he wasn't the kind of husband or father he wanted to be or I  should have," Betty Broderick said. "He said he wanted to be a very important  man, a very prominent man, a very rich man. He needed to concentrate on those  goals.  </P> <P> "We were almost there. If I would just give him more time, it really was for  the children and me that he was doing all of it," she said.  </P> <P> By 1982, Daniel Broderick's law practice was blossoming and, for the first  time, the family -- now with four children, two girls and two boys -- had  plenty of money, Betty Broderick said.  </P> <P> The next year, he hired Linda Kolkena as an office assistant, he said. Soon  afterward, she said, he began telling his wife she was "old, fat, ugly, boring  and stupid" and saying he "just wasn't having any fun in life anymore."  </P> <P> Betty Broderick said she was crushed. She said she let her hair grow, fixed her  teeth and "tried to be perfect, absolutely perfect for Dan Broderick."  </P> <P> He denied the affair, she said.  </P> <P> In November, 1983, on her 36th birthday, Betty Broderick said, she slit her  wrists and "swallowed every pill I could find in the house."  </P> <P> Defense lawyer Jack Earley said he expects to ask his client about the killings  when she resumes the stand today. If convicted, Betty Broderick, 42, could be  sentenced to life in prison without parole.  </P></p>

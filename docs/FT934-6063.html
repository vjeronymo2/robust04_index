			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Observer: Keep your quango Sounds like the government might be having a spot of trouble finding a heavyweight political figure to fill the chair of the Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes government grants to housing associations. John Maples, highly regarded as economic secretary until he lost his seat in Lewisham at the 1992 general election, isn't interested. 'When I started this enforced sabbatical I decided to get a full-time job rather than lots of little ones. I am sticking to that,' says Maples, now running one of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's government lobbying outfits. Sir David Trippier, also evicted from Parliament last year, might seem a better bet. He has done two stints at the Department of the Environment, the Housing Corporation's paymaster, so knows the business well. He would be 'flattered to be asked', but even if he were he says he would say No. He's enjoying himself too much as chairman of Tepnel Diagnostics, a bio-technology company. Given that this month's Budget is likely to cut the grant of one of Britain's biggest quangos, the former MPs' disinclination is perhaps understandable. Looks like the government may have to make do with another property developer after all.</p>

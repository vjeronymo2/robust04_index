			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Manufacturing side lifts John Haggas A sharp improvement from its manufacturing side enabled John Haggas, the West Yorkshire-based worsted spinner, to offset increased retailing losses and lift overall pre-tax profits from Pounds 355,000 to Pounds 911,000 for the half year to December 31. Manufacturing profits rose to Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 494,000) reflecting an improved performance from the spinning operation, while the fabric side again performed well. The retail division, however, incurred increased losses of Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 139,000). Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 15.6m) and earnings per share increased to 2.8p (1.06p). After a one year absence, the interim dividend is restored at 1p - last year's single distribution was 3p.</p>

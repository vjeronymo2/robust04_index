			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Fujimori makes most of breather: Peru's president consolidates his hold on power IN THE hiatus between the Organisation of American States' fact-finding mission to Lima last week and its crucial verdict on those findings, Peru's President Alberto Fujimori is consolidating the power he grabbed on April 5. Internal direction of the International Monetary Fund-approved economic adjustment programme seems assured by the ratification of Mr Carlos Bolona at the helm of the economy - after a nail-biting five days when all involved, including fellow cabinet ministers, had confirmed his resignation. The three long-standing pillars of Mr Fujimori's regime remain firm: rumours that a sector of the military might defect to support 'alternative president' Maximo San Roman seem to have been scotched - both the armed forces and the police have reiterated their loyalty to Mr Fujimori. Second, the business community is little short of euphoric since Mr Bolona's ratification and the appointment of their own Mr Jorge Camet, twice president of the private businessmen's lobby Confiep, as the minister for industry and commerce. And four out of five people, according to the polls, back Mr Fujimori and his unchecked onslaught on legislature and judiciary. 'April 5 did for Mr Fujimori what the Gulf War did for President (George) Bush,' says Mr Manuel Torrado, chief political analyst at Datum, a leading Lima market research company. Datum polls immediately before and after the autogolpe (self-generated coup) show a 15-point leap in Mr Fujimori's personal standing. Surveys of opinion show that the people on the streets of Lima, home to more than a third of Peru's 22m population, are primarily concerned with crushing poverty and unemployment, terrorism and 'delinquency'. 'In the face of all this,' according to Mr Torrado, 'the constitution, freedom and democracy just aren't the issues.' Mr Fujimori has long gained political mileage from his attacks on lazy, overpaid parliamentarians (he once dubbed them 'pachydermic') and venal judges ('jackals'). He has so successfully undermined the legislature and judiciary that the general public has now joined him in declaring open war on the other branches of government. Deposed parliamentarians led by Mr San Roman meet, discuss constitutional reform and publish timetables for a return a democracy, but most Peruvians scoff at their efforts as irrelevant. Meanwhile, Mr Fujimori and his closest, unelected, advisers handpick Supreme Court judges, the Comptroller General of the Republic and the directorate of the central bank. While Senate ratification - by no means automatic - was previously required for high-level posts, now the presidential will is sufficient. 'The danger of all this,' one foreign diplomat observed, 'is that the few checks and balances on the traditionally powerful Peruvian executive have vanished like springtime snow.' The only possible rein on Mr Fujimori is international opinion. Peru's image with creditor nations has been boosted by Mr Bolona's survival but he will have a lot of explaining to do when he visits Washington, probably next week, with a letter of political intent. Like many other Lima-based economists, Mr Augusto Alvarez considers that poor advice from his closest advisers - who tend to be men from military intelligence - led the President seriously to underestimate the impact on Peru's still shaky economy of a suspension of international financial support. 'They calculated economic damage in accounting terms and thought they could survive the suspension of US aid,' says Mr Alvarez. 'They forgot that the US is the foundation of Peru's support group, which allowed international financial relations to be normalised. And all other arrangements with the IMF, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Paris Club (of official creditors) hang on that.' So far, the government shows no sign of defaulting on debt payments - if they continue until the end of 1992, Peru will be eligible for fresh funds from the IMF and World Bank. But continuing to pay without the covering support group funds will tax monthly cash flows to the limits. Meanwhile, to maintain the high levels of popularity on which his legitimacy rests, Mr Fujimori will have to spend. 'Business, the armed forces and the population at large have given Fujimori a blank cheque,' says Mr Alvarez. 'But it's a cheque with a time limit. They will want to see something in return.' Already international reaction and suspension of aid have given Peru's financial sector a fit of the jitters. Dollar withdrawals from the commercial banking system in the three weeks after the coup totalled about Dollars 240m, a tenth of total deposits. This caused still further contraction in tight liquidity, making loans harder to find and pushing interest rates higher. While exporters and local manufacturers benefited from an initial 10 per cent devaluation of the sol, the exchange rate appears to have stagnated again. On the two fronts used by President Fujimori to justify his April 5 dissolution of Congress - more effective action against drugs trafficking and terrorism - there has been more activity in the latter than the former. The Sendero Luminoso guerrilla group's propaganda newspaper El Diario has been dismantled and its editorial staff arrested; Peter Cardenas, allegedly number two in the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) command has been captured; and the military on Tuesday hit Raucana, a Sendero-controlled shanty-town on Lima's outskirts, arresting two leaders in a bloody battle which left at least one dead and several injured. While there are growing calls for 'dialogue' from many sectors of the population - the overwhelming majority of whom support a swift return to constitutionality in an as-yet unspecified manner - President Fujimori shows little sign of responding. Unless and until opposition leader Mr San Roman can catch the popular imagination and mount an effective challenge to Mr Fujimori, it appears that only pressure from abroad will ensure an early return to democracy.</p>

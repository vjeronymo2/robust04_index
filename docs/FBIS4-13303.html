			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the opening of </F> the Knesset summer session in Jerusalem -- live]    [Text] Honorable Knesset, last week we celebrated the 46th  anniversary of Israel's establishment and independence. We  return to routine today, but we can all look back with pride and  to the future with great hope. They were 46 hard years of  struggle for a life and the building an economy and society,  which led to the State of Israel's great achievements. Despite  flaws, Israel is today one of the most exciting, beautiful  states, a good place to live. I would like to take the  opportunity of the opening of the summer session of the Knesset  to congratulate the citizens on Independence Day. Members of  the Knesset, this Independence Day was celebrated in the shadow  of terrorist attacks, including one which took place only a  short time before the Remembrance Day siren for those who fell  while fighting in the country's wars. Five citizens and  soldiers were killed in the explosion caused by a bomb at  Hadera's central bus station. The bomb was placed by a  contemptible murderer, a member of Hamas, who apparently chose  to die with his innocent victims. This assembly and the entire  country join to mourn with the families of the fallen. We wish  to console them in their grief. This assembly and the  government also wish the wounded a speedy recovery.    Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset, last September we embarked  on  a new path in an attempt to turn a page in the bloody history  between Jews, later Israelis, and Palestinians. We decided not  to settle former accounts; to forget the bloody past and the  hatred; to try to create a new, better future for both peoples  whose historic fate has ruled that they live on the same land.  We came with a desire to make peace, and I must tell the  members of the Knesset that we also found a readiness for peace  by the other side, the Palestinians, who have also suffered for  generations. Neither we nor the Palestinians will receive all  that we want, since that is the nature of negotiations, that is  the nature of compromise, that is the nature of peace.    The negotiations with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First  continue, and in my view, we are at an advanced stage. I hope  that it will be possible to conclude these negotiations within a  short while. We believe that a short time after the signing of  the agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security  forces will be able to complete their redeployment. In other  words, in the wake of the Gaza-Jericho First negotiations, the  attempt to create coexistence and peace with the Palestinians  will be tested. I tell you that I wait for the moment that as  the defense minister I will feel freer not to send IDF soldiers  to patrol Greater Gaza, towns with a population of 250,000  Palestinians, the refugee camps, Khan Yunus, Rafah, Dayr  al-Balah.    I would like to clarify in the wake of published reports,  whether true or not, that any agreement or understanding between  the PLO and Hamas on continued Hamas terror with the PLO's  approval will preclude any possibility of agreement between  Israel and the PLO. Members of the Knesset, this government  promised to make every effort for peace, and plans to continue  the talks with Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Toward the end of  April or early May the bilateral talks in Washington will  resume, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher will probably  arrive in the region to prepare the talks and allow us to  progress toward signing peace treaties between Israel and its  neighbors. In the peace talks with the Syrians, we have so far  not found the appropriate level of openness and flexibility that  would permit a breakthrough and facilitate a real discussion on  a peace treaty. Our friends the Americans, who so much want to  see peace in our region, have so far also failed in their  efforts. At the same time, the government's position is known:  We are making a great effort that the precedent Israel paid for  peace with Egypt -- a total withdrawal and the uprooting of all  signs of an Israeli presence -- will not repeat itself as a  condition for peace with Syria. Simultaneously, we are  preparing seriously for the negotiations and preparing for  various alternatives regarding the nature of peace. These  preparations include: the depth of withdrawal on the Golan  Heights; security arrangements, and the phases in which peace is  implemented. By doing so there will be time to evaluate the  normalization process before we complete our withdrawal on the  Golan Heights, and consider what will we demand from our friend  the United States in the wake of the peace. If and when we  reach a reasonable agreement with the Syrians, and the agreement  will require a significant withdrawal, we will hold a national  referendum, and the people will decide.    The negotiations with Lebanon entail negotiations with the  Syrians since we know that Beirut will not make a move without  permission from Damascus. Nevertheless, we reiterate our  proposal to the Beirut authorities. We proposed, that at the  first stage, the Lebanese Army will deploy up to the northern  border of the security zone, and for the next six months it must  prove its ability to maintain total quiet, and total disarming  of Hizballah in south Lebanon. If that is proven and if total  quiet reigns along the northern border of the security zone, we  will open peace negotiations with Lebanon, which I hope will  last three months. We will be prepared to withdraw up to the  international border between Israel and Lebanon on three  conditions: full peace and normalization; adequate security  arrangements; and of course, our commitment to the SLA [South  Lebanese Army] and the inhabitants of south Lebanon. In other  words, the incorporation of the SLA into the Lebanese Army and a  guarantee that the inhabitants of south Lebanon will not be  harmed.    A solution is possible in the negotiations with Jordan, but  to my great regret, I get the impression that it will not happen  prior to an agreement with Syria, the big brother, who is  keeping a watchful eye. Members of the Knesset, I want to tell  the truth: For 27 years we have been dominating another people  against its will. For 27 years, Palestinians in the  territories, who currently number 1.7 million, get up in the  morning cultivating fierce hatred against us, as Israelis and  Jews. Each morning they get up to a hard life, for which we are  also, but not solely, responsible. We cannot deny, the ongoing  control over a foreign people who do not want us, exacts a  painful price, the price of an ongoing confrontation between us  and them.    For six and a half years we have been witnessing the  Palestinian's popular uprising, the intifadah, against our rule.  They try to harm us through violence and terror, to cause us  fatalities, to break our spirit. I would like to present you  with some data presented to me by the IDF. Since the start of  the uprising, 217 Israelis have been murdered, of whom 68  belonged to the security forces and 151 were civilians. That is  a painful price. I recall the brigade I had the honor of  commanding in the battle for besieged Jerusalem and the road to  Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Within six months,  this brigade, which was one of the 10 brigades which became the  IDF, lost the same number of people. One of our distinguished  IDF commanders, Knesset Member Refa'el Eytan, I am certain,  remembers that. Those were the losses from one brigade, one of  10 brigades in a population of slightly more than 600,000.  Nobody's spirit was broken then, nobody rejoiced over the  bloodshed.    The number of our wounded is 7,872, of whom 5,062 belong to  the security forces, and 2,810 are civilians. Among the  Palestinians, 1,045 were killed by our forces -- the IDF and the  security forces -- 69 by Israeli civilians, 922 by other  Palestinians, 99 for unknown reasons, 21 while handling  explosives. In total, there have been 2,156 Palestinians  killed. Wounded Palestinians, according to IDF data, number  18,967, while I estimate that at least 25,000 were wounded.  There have been between 120,000 and 140,000 detentions and jail  sentences. Those are the statistics of the confrontation during  the past six and a half years.    What were the alternatives facing us after 27 years of  domination -- I do not want to use a different term -- over an  entity different from us religiously, politically, and  nationally. The first alternative was to continue the existing  situation, to make proposals for which there were no other  partners, and without a partner there is no arrangement. To try  to perpetrate the domination of another people; to continue the  path of violence and terrorism ad infinitum; and to freeze the  political process, to bring about a political stalemate.    All the governments of Israel, definitely all those since  the  Yom Kippur War, fully understood the dangers inherent in a  political stalemate. That is why all the governments searched  for the second alternative, which is to try to find a political  solution, at first through separation of forces agreements.  That was also the approach of the government of the late  Menahem Begin in the peace treaty with Egypt. That was the path  taken by Yitzhaq Shamir's government in agreeing to the Madrid  peace conference. We have also taken that path since the Oslo  deliberations and the signing ceremony in Washington.    Peace now appears to be closer than ever before. There is  a big opportunity to end the wars, the 100 years of terrorism  and bloodshed, the 100 years of enmity. When we began the  journey for peace we knew it would be impossible to wipe out 100  years of hatred with one signature. We knew it would be  impossible to change concepts and what is learned from birth, we  knew that the peace would have enemies, we knew there would be  people and organizations whose entire reason for existence is  enmity between the peoples and that they will continue to fan it  as much as they can. On the Palestinian side, the opposition to  peace is led by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, the Rejectionist  Front organizations. The emissaries of those organizations  carried out most of the recent murders and terrorist attacks,  some on suicide missions. For two or three years we have been  facing a phenomenon of extremist Islamic terrorism, which  recalls the Hizballah, which surfaced in Lebanon and perpetrated  attacks, including suicide missions. We have been seeing it for  the first time in the past two or three years among the  Palestinian terrorist organizations. There is no end to the  targets Hamas and the other terrorist organizations have among  us. Each Israeli in the territories and inside sovereign Israel,  including united Jerusalem, each bus, each home, is a target for  their murderous plans. Since there is no separation between the  two populations, the current situation creates endless  possibilities for Hamas and the other organizations. In Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, 40,000 vehicles, tens of thousands  of civilians and soldiers travel daily, according to our  estimates. IDF soldiers have the task of daily safeguarding  hundreds of Israeli vehicles, mainly buses, along 1,200 km of  roads. Hundreds of thousands of Jews and Arabs, and thousands  of vehicles mix daily, one population lives among the other.  There are also many possibilities to cross from Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip -- less from the Gaza Strip, more  from Judaea and Samaria -- into Israel. Many hidden and known  paths lead from the territories into Israel. It is impossible  to hermetically close the territories to infiltration by  individuals. We are making all efforts to bring security to the  citizens of Israel, both Jews and Arabs, within Israel and in  the territories of Judaea and Samaria, everywhere. I am  divulging to the Knesset today that a large part of the IDF's  standing army is currently on security and defense missions for  Israelis everywhere. There is no restriction on the activities  of the IDF except that they should act within the law. In this  situation, the organizations which continue terrorism have  limitless targets, and perpetrate murderous missions, with  openly declared aims -- first to murder Israelis, and  politically to do away with the peace talks, not to permit them  to continue.    At first, the murderers of Hamas and the other  organizations operated mainly against Israeli citizens and the  security forces in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The  political aims of those murderers were for Israeli settlers in  Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip harmed by terrorism to  demonstrate and act against the Israeli Government thereby  suspending the peace efforts. They apparently concluded their  efforts were insufficient. We continued with the peace  negotiations, so Hamas and the other organizations which oppose  peace have now put most of their efforts into attacks against  the Israeli population inside sovereign Israel, including united  Jerusalem. Since 1 January, 1994, 23 Israelis -- both Jews and  Arabs -- have been murdered. Twenty were killed inside  sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem, and three were  killed in the territories of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip.    Members of the Knesset, it is no secret how sensitive we are  to fatalities, and the murderers of the terrorist organizations  and the Rejectionist Front are trying to break us through  attacks with knives, explosives, firing during ambushes, and car  bombs. They do not have a chance. We experienced knifings  during the 1930's bloodshed, we experienced car bombs in the War  of Independence, we experienced bloody attacks on buses in  Ma'ale 'Aqrabbim, Avivim, and the coastal road, where the most  murderous terrorist attack in the history of terrorism, took  place in 1978 when 35 Israelis were killed. Did any of us call  the Begin government a blood-tainted government for that? No  way. We experienced the Ma'alot massacre, the Lod airport  massacre, the attack on Tel Aviv's Savoy hotel, Kefar Yuval,  Qiryat Shemona, Misgav 'Am, Naharriya.    The people of Israel are not frightened off, they do not  crack. It hurts, but we get back on our feet and go on. Even  additional terrorist attacks will not stop the peace train.  [Responding to catcalls from the right-wing opposition] Look  who sows fear among the people, does not give them strength,  does not explain the truth: how we faced much tougher  situations. I regret to say that level of personal danger to  each of us has increased in the wake of the despicable massacre  perpetrated by the Jewish murderer from Hebron. Although the  Arab terrorist organizations had a thousand reasons and excuses  for harming us, that man came and added to them.    Members of the Knesset, we found one of the foci of Hamas  activity is in Jordan and not Egypt or Tunisia, and even not  Syria or Lebanon. We are convinced that the Jordanian security  authorities are aware of that and nevertheless permitted  information and operational activity from Amman. We therefore  found it necessary to warn the Jordanian authorities against  continued Hamas activity from its territory. Israel expects the  king and his officials to act against the Hamas murderers, who  will also ultimately attempt to undermine and topple his regime  and control.    We also took a series of measures, including the tightening  of the closure. We are aware of the hardship incurred by the  inhabitants of the territories as a result of the closure, as  well as to Israel's agriculture and building, but we have no  choice. If we want to save lives we have to take tough measures  and if the situation calls for it, we will even take even  tougher measures. The IDF, Shin Bet, Israel Police, and the  Border Police are conducting a war to the bitter end against all  those who continue violence and terrorism. There are no  restrictions on the activity of the security forces against  terrorism and violence, except of course, that they operate  within the framework of the law.    Members of the Knesset, the Hizballah terrorist organization  is also partner to the effort to strangle the chance for peace.  The Lebanese war did not rid us of terrorism in Lebanon.  Hizballah leads the attacks against the IDF and SLA in the  security zone, and from time to time, even against targets in  Israel. IDF and SLA soldiers assure normal life for the  settlements and residents of the North.    Members of the Knesset, I wish to send from this podium a  greeting from the bottom of my heart to the IDF commanders and  soldiers, the commanders and officers of the Israel Police and  the Border Police, and a special greeting to the Shin Bet, which  takes a large brunt of the tough war against the murderous  enemies of Israel and peace.    Members of the Knesset, that is the current picture. The  path to peace is paved with our good intentions and the  terrorist attacks of the enemies of peace. There might be  difficult conditions and we might not succeed in totally  preventing terrorist attacks, but peace will win.</p>

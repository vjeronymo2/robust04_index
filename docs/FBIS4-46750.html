			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, KOMMERSANT-DAILY </F> columnist: "Negotiations in Geneva on Bosnia: State Duma  Accompanies Kozyrev and Christopher Duet"]    [Text] On the eve of the Geneva meeting held Friday  by the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Russia, the  United States, Great Britain, and a "trio" of the European Union  (Belgium, Greece, and Germany), few would have ventured to  predict its success: Too much divided the great powers. But,  fortunately, as has happened more than once in history,  everything occurred exactly the wrong way round: The ministers  who came out on the stage of the conference hall of the Hotel  Intercontinental after six hours of intensive negotiations  informed the world of the birth of a new political sensation.  The results of the Geneva meeting are analyzed by Sergey  Tsekhmistrenko, KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist, who has just  returned from Geneva.  <H5>  51:49 in Favor of Russian Diplomacy </H5>   Although the idea for a meeting of the ministers of foreign  affairs was formally proposed by Moscow and Paris, Russia  deserves the main credit for the fact that it did occur. Perhaps  the negotiations between Andrey Kozyrev and United States  Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the beginning of May in  Cairo were the turning point--at that time the Russian minister  succeeded in convincing the American, who had assessed the  potential of a "Geneva meeting" skeptically. However, almost up  until late night on 13 May it seemed to all of those who arrived  on the shores of Lake Geneva that reality would confirm  Christopher's correctness. But the communique distributed before  the final news conference indicated the opposite: The desired  compromise was found. And precisely thanks to Russia.    Essentially, the communique proposes an integral settlement  concept whose central element was principally a new approach to  the future arrangement of the Bosnian state. Henceforth it will  be viewed in its way as a union consisting of two  parts--Bosnian-Serb and Bosnian-Croat (what is meant in the  latter case is the Muslim-Croat federation that is being  established). Moreover, from the standpoint of international  law, both sides are given equal status. As for the key  problem--territorial demarcation--the ministers proposed to  resolve it after dividing the Bosnian territory between the  federation and the Serbs in a ratio of 51 to 49. But peace was  necessary to implement all of this, and therefore it was decided  to call on the sides to conclude an agreement on a cessation of  military operations for four months, which could be prolonged  afterwards. Direct negotiations of the parties to the conflict  were also supposed to be renewed--this was to be achieved by a  contact group of the world community, which in the course of the  next two weeks was to convince the Serbs and the Muslims with  the Croats to continue the dialogue that had been broken off.    As for the question of sanctions (against both the FRY  ((Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)) and with respect to the  embargo on the supply of arms to the Muslims), Russia and the  West agreed for the first time in Geneva that they should be  observed rigorously, and that they could be gradually canceled  only after the implementation of the aforementioned points. The  removal of sanctions as a preliminary condition of a settlement  was rejected.    Russian diplomats in Geneva really felt cheered in Geneva.  And not by chance: The main points of the adopted plan were set  forth in a message from Boris Yeltsin to Clinton, Mitterrand,  Major, and Kohl. As was reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY  columnist by a highly placed official at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of Russia, a majority of the provisions of the letter  were included in the communique practically without any changes.  Never before have Moscow's proposals been implemented so  completely at such meetings. In this connection, in the opinion  of a Russian diplomat, it can be considered that Russia today is  really playing a leading role in the settlement, although it was  not very long ago that the palm leaf of victory belonged to the  European Union. Incidentally, Kozyrev also observed: In the heat  of polemics in the negotiations, the Western colleagues appealed  more than once to Yeltsin's letter as a primary source.    But there were also two other circumstances that determined  the outcome of the negotiations. I refer to the adoption on 12  and 13 May respectively of resolutions of the United States  Senate and the State Duma of Russia on the question of  sanctions. News about these decisions suddenly rallied the main  players--Kozyrev and Christopher.  <H5>  Our Main Thought--That There Will Be No Pol Pot </H5>   The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia  commented in an interview with journalists on the lively  interest of the members of the Duma--to the detriment of  domestic problems--in the words of a well-known Soviet ditty.  Nevertheless, there was an unexpected effect when they learned  of the Duma resolution in Geneva, where there was talk of a  unilateral departure by Moscow from the sanctions regime against  the FRY in the event the United States removed the embargo on  the supply of weapons to the Muslims. Both Kozyrev and  Christopher, in order not to permit a war of parliaments,  decided to avoid extremes. Judging by the communique, Moscow  rejected a former position--the gradual removal of sanctions  right now (in the form of its own kind of overture that recently  displayed a yielding to Belgrade), but Washington did not insist  on the opposite, that is, on a toughening of sanctions. Both  ministers disavowed the decisions of their parliaments. But  while this has become a usual thing for Kozyrev (it is enough to  mention his battles with the Supreme Soviet), Christopher's step  was perhaps unprecedented.    In general, Christopher was placed in a very awkward  position  in Geneva. Just the day before, Washington assured the partners  that the Muslims with the Croats have agreed to 51 percent of  the territory of Bosnia. Therefore, when it became known that  the wards had misled the patron, demanding 58 percent, confusion  resulted, although Charles Redman, the special representative of  the United States, attempted to present all of this as "a joke."  But, in addition, the map of the division proposed by the  Muslims and the Croats said little about their peaceful  disposition. In the words of one of the officials of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this was a "war map," inasmuch as  an attempt was made in it to transform the Serbian enclaves into  territories that were not connected.    However, it will not be easy to put the Geneva agreements  into effect. For the Serbs today control almost 73 percent of  the territory of Bosnia, and few believe that it will be  possible to convince them to "squeeze" into 49 percent. Indeed,  President of Bosnia Alija Izetbegovic has also already expressed  the first doubts regarding the initiatives by Russia and the  West. However, Kozyrev, after flying into Moscow, was in an  optimistic mood--nobody from the Bosnian side has yet expressed  complete rejection. But "who is who" will become evident within  two weeks: If by that time no movement occurs, then, in the apt  expression of one Russian diplomat, the world community will put  the "carrot and stick" in motion. But it is already clear today  that a new page has been written in the history of the  settlement of the Yugoslav conflict.</p>

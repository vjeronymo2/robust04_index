			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S COLLEGIATE VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> MCPEAK SWITCHED, AND NOW SHE'S FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> For Holly McPeak, the nightmare is now just a memory. In fact, she looks back  on what transpired between her and her volleyball coach at California after  last season as a blessing in disguise.  </P> <P> And why shouldn't she? The 5-foot-7 setter's collegiate volleyball career was  in jeopardy of ending a season early but now she's guiding top-ranked UCLA into  tonight's West Regional at Pauley Pavilion, and quite possibly toward a  national championship.  </P> <P> McPeak, a standout at Mira Costa High in Manhattan Beach and one of the most  heavily recruited setters in the country, had everything going for her. She led  her high school team to a pair of state championships and a 52-1 record over  her last two seasons, and was labeled by Volleyball Monthly magazine as "the  most coveted setter in the country."  </P> <P> In her first year at Cal, she was named the Pacific 10 Conference freshman of  the year.  </P> <P> But then came Dave DeGroot, replacing Marlene Piper as coach, and McPeak's life  in volleyball subsequently changed from one filled with optimism to one of  growing frustration. Ultimately, she was banned from the team.  </P> <P> "It was just basically, 'Do what you want. Get what you want out of it,' "  McPeak says of Cal volleyball under DeGroot. "I never felt it was disciplined  enough."  </P> <P> But she had accepted a scholarship and as a sophomore was intent on making the  most of her commitment, and the team was faring well. The Golden Bears with  McPeak had gone 18-15 under Piper in 1987, then had posted a 19-15 record in  '88 and a 19-13 mark in '89 under DeGroot.  </P> <P> But McPeak and DeGroot did not get along. By the end of her junior year, McPeak  said she lost respect for DeGroot as a coach and DeGroot considered her an  uncoachable player.  </P> <P> "He wanted me to do one thing and I thought I was doing it," McPeak said. "His  anger built up and I didn't know I wasn't doing the right thing because he  never told me. It was just a buildup, and he didn't deal with it correctly, and  it just blew up."  </P> <P> DeGroot told McPeak not to bother to return for her senior year, which was fine  with her, since she had no desire to come back anyway.  </P> <P> "I was considering not playing toward the end of last season, but he did not  allow me to come back," McPeak said. "He was not being fair. He wouldn't even  talk to me or explain why he did not want me to come back."  </P> <P> DeGroot was on a recruiting trip and couldn't be reached for comment, but said  last month: "I just thought it was best for (McPeak) to go on."  </P> <P> Being so far along academically, she had all but decided to finish her senior  year at Cal and then focus her training on the professional beach circuit.  </P> <P> "Then somebody suggested an intra-conference transfer," McPeak recalls. "It  popped back into my head that I could play again. It would really hurt me not  to play and watch everybody else play in my senior year. I wasn't even  considering the Pac-10 because of the rule, but somebody mentioned that I could  petition for transfer to a UC school and I just went, 'Wow, UCLA!' "  </P> <P> McPeak listened to that somebody and challenged the conference rule that states  that a transferring student must lose two years of eligibility. She called UCLA  Coach Andy Banachowski and with his help succeeded in gaining the support of  representatives of all 10 conference schools, who voted unanimously to waive  the transfer rule.  </P> <P> "There were very unusual circumstances," Banachowski said. "(DeGroot) basically  cut her from the team, told her she wouldn't play there anymore."  </P> <P> McPeak said: "I thought there would be a 5% chance that it would pass, but it  did and I'm in heaven."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, DeGroot is looking for players to help a team that finished this  season at 8-21 overall and at the bottom of the Pac-10 at 3-15.  </P> <P> Lisa Arce, another former Mira Costa star who just completed her final season  under DeGroot, offered this assessment of the program:  </P> <P> "There's no love lost between us. We got along as coach and player, but there  were times in practice where I just couldn't believe the things we were still  doing. I was frustrated and it was hard for me as a player to keep motivating  myself and that's really odd for me because I still love volleyball.  </P> <P> "I've heard of people who don't want to play because they don't want to come  back under (DeGroot's) coaching, but I've also heard people who totally like  him and believe in him, so there are two sides to it. But I personally did not  enjoy my last year playing there with him."  </P> <P> But all is well in Westwood, where McPeak and the No. 1 Bruins are going into  tonight's 6:30 match against 14th-ranked New Mexico -- a team the Bruins have  not played since 1970-71 and one that features two setters in its attack --  with a 32-1 record and a 29-match winning streak.  </P> <P> The second match pits No. 3 Stanford (26-3) against No. 19 San Diego State  (24-11).  </P> <P> McPeak will walk onto the court as only the 13th player in NCAA history to  record more than 5,000 assists, but Banachowski says that her abilities go well  beyond statistics.  </P> <P> "She's helped us with so much in addition to the setting," he said. "Our team  quickness and team defense have drastically improved this year and she's helped  tremendously along those lines."  </P></p>

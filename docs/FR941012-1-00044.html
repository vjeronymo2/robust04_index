			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Design conflicts between the need for driver visual perspective and windshield optical distortion were examined by Makiguchi,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (``A Human Factors Analysis of Optical Distortion for Automotive Windshields,'' SAE Paper 940390, 1994). Field data were gathered during straight-line driving. Based on drivers' fixation frequency and the type of objects observed, the windshield was divided into four zones. The G1 zone, with the highest fixation frequency, extended  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 degrees laterally and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8 degrees vertically from the driver's line of sight. It included crucial driving information, such as pedestrians, road signs and signals, and oncoming and nearby vehicles. The fixation frequency was reported as exceeding 95 percent. The G3 and G4 zones, with the lowest fixation frequencies, were noted at approximately 100 to 200 mm from the edge of the windshield's visible area. Drivers observe pedestrians and buildings in the zone below 8 degrees horizontal; in the zone above 8 degrees horizontal, they see the sky. A zone of middle fixation frequency, G2, was defined as the area outside the G1, G3, and G4 zones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety published a report on accidents in four urban areas arising in part from visibility problems in heavy trucks (``A Study of Fatal Crashes Involving Pedestrians and Trucks in Four Cities,'' December 1992). It noted, ``Obstruction of truck driver visibility, caused by the design of truck/tractor cabs, appears to be a major contributing factor in crashes at intersections.'' However, the discussion of accident data did not differentiate between conventional_cab behind engine_and cab-over-engine tractor involvement. The report did not mention decals or other items in CMV windshields as a potential concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the reports on these studies, the FHWA believes that the location of a transponder device near the upper margin of a CMV's windshield is unlikely to have any effect on a driver's ability to observe nearby objects, such as pedestrians.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship to Sunvisors, Sunshades, and Rear-View Mirrors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interior sunvisors are standard equipment in virtually every vehicle on the road today. Exterior sunshades are available as optional accessories from several truck manufacturers. Sunvisors are not regulated by an FMVSS or an FMCSR, nor is there an SAE Recommended Practice concerning their design. Sunvisors are not believed to have a detrimental effect on a driver's safety-related vision. On the contrary, blocking the sun's glare offers a clear safety benefit, and the loss of a small visible area of the windshield, well outside the range of the driver's field of view, is considered an acceptable tradeoff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data obtained on 33 models of new Class 8 tractor cabs, representing all seven of the major manufacturers serving the U.S. market, indicate that sunvisors vary from 5.25 to 7.5 inches in height and 19.75 to 34 inches in length.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency notes that the AVI transponder proposed to be used in ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP is roughly 2 inches smaller than the smallest sunvisor (which was only found on one cab model). The agency therefore believes that a transponder mounted within the region of the windshield that the sunvisor would cover would be extremely unlikely to have an adverse effect on safety. The audible indicator that accompanies the visible signal for the driver to enter or to bypass a POE would provide the necessary information in the event that a sunvisor were to block the driver's view of the transponder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For windshields equipped with exterior sunshades, the transponder is likely to fall at or above the portion of the underside of the sunshade visible from the cab interior. Furthermore, while exterior sunshades may limit the uppermost range of the driver's available field of view, that area is also well out of the useful field of view as reported by the research cited above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also notes that the AVI transponder would be located in approximately the same relative position in the windshield of a CMV as that of a rear-view mirror in a passenger car. The agency believes that the transponder would have no more impact on safety than the presence of such a mirror and its mounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

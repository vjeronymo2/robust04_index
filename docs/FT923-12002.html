			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Telekom tops German state sell-off list THE GERMAN telecommunications network, Deutsche Telekom, is to become the 'people's share of the nineties' in a privatisation programme unveiled yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. The government will also sell off its remaining 51 per cent stake in the Lufthansa airline 'as soon as possible'. Announcing plans to press on with the government's long term aim of withdrawing completely from business and industry with the sale of 'a good two dozen' state concerns, Mr Waigel warned, however, that privatising Telekom would need a change in the constitution. Private advisers had told him that 100 per cent privatisation of Telekom could raise up to DM70bn (Pounds 24.1bn), but he offered no estimates of the total the government hoped to earn from the sell-off. It was unclear yesterday when substantial funds would start flowing in. As the Economics Ministry pointed out, the current state of the stock markets was 'not exactly ideal' for floating the loss-making Lufthansa. Bonn also intends to hold on to a 25.1 per cent blocking minority stake in the airline for as long as competing enterprises in other countries remain under state control. The last wave of privatisations, completed in 1987 and 1988, when Bonn sold its remaining holdings in motor manufacturer Volkswagen and the Veba and Viag conglomerates, yielded more than DM10bn for the federal coffers. Mr Waigel's latest offering includes the 49 per cent federal stake in Nebenbetriebe der Bundesautobahnen, which runs 670 motorway petrol stations and restaurants. The Berliner Industriebank, which specialises in loans for businesses in the capital, will be sold before the end of next year. Other businesses on the list include the operating company for the canal connecting the rivers Rhine, Main and Danube, house builders, and a holding company involved in property, waste disposal, warehousing and transport. The minister's proposals, approved by the cabinet yesterday, follow last week's announcement of partial privatisation of the federal railways in a project due to start at the end of next year. Mr Waigel also confirmed yesterday plans to sell off surplus land and buildings currently owned by the western Bundesbahn. The government currently holds direct or indirect stakes in more than 400 commercial concerns, including transport, travel agencies, hotels and the Bonn press club.</p>

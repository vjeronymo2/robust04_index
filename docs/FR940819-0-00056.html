			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. ARI 700&hyph;1993 included purity standards for eleven additional refrigerants: R&hyph;23, R&hyph;32, R&hyph;123, R&hyph;124, R&hyph;125, R&hyph;134a, R&hyph;143a, R&hyph;401(A), R&hyph;401(B), R&hyph;402(A), and R&hyph;402(B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Liquid phase contaminant water levels were increased from 10ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1988 to 20ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1993 for R&hyph;11 and R&hyph;113 only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Where ARI 700&hyph;1988 allowed 0.5 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``other refrigerants,'' ARI 700&hyph;1993 allows 0.50 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``all other organic impurities, including other refrigerants.'' The inclusion of organic impurities other than refrigerants in the limit effectively tightens the standard, and at the same time, the change from 0.5 to 0.50 reduces the tolerance of the standard by a factor of ten. (Thus, while a sample containing 0.54 percent other refrigerants would have met the old standard, only a sample containing 0.504 percent (or less) other organic impurities would meet the new standard.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although all the comments received by EPA regarding adoption of the updated standard were favorable, the standard was not included in the final rule because it was not finalized by the time the final rule was published. (See 58 FR 28679 for a discussion of this issue in the final rule.) An appendix to the standard specifying procedures for analyzing refrigerant was undergoing a lengthy process of peer review, which is now complete. Because the final standard is substantially identical to the draft that was included in the docket for comment, and because EPA agrees with commenters that the changes to the standard are appropriate and necessary, EPA is changing the definition of ``reclaim'' to refer to ARI 700&hyph;1993, and is replacing the standard based on ARI 700&hyph;1988 with a standard based on ARI 700&hyph;1993 as appendix A. EPA is also replacing references to ARI 700&hyph;1988 with references to ARI 700&hyph;1993 in its reclaimer certification program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because section 608 of the Act does not give EPA the authority to regulate refrigerants that do not contain class I or class II substances until November, 1995, EPA is not adopting the purity standards of ARI 700&hyph;1993 that apply to refrigerants that do not contain CFCs or HCFCs. Thus, EPA is not adopting purity requirements for HFC&hyph;23, HFC&hyph;32, HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;134a, or HFC&hyph;143a at this time. (ARI and other standard-setting organizations remain free, of course, to adopt and observe purity requirements for these refrigerants.) However, the purity requirements for CFC and HCFC refrigerants (including blends that contain either CFCs or HCFCs along with non-ozone-depleting components) in appendix A are identical to the purity requirements for CFC and HCFC refrigerants in ARI 700&hyph;1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would like to clarify that since it is not possible to return a refrigerant to a standard of purity if no standard of purity is specified for that refrigerant, refrigerants that are not covered by appendix A need not be reclaimed under this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STATIC QUO: AM 530, Caltrans' Highway Advisory Radio, has been a bust for much  of the past two weeks. . . . Although a big yellow sign urges motorists on the  Costa Mesa Freeway to tune in for traffic reports, those who do hear a lot of  static. . . . Agency officials blame it on a transmission line to the  transmitter, the low frequency used and the proximity of high-voltage power  lines. Dana Parsons and Kristina Lindgren  </P></p>

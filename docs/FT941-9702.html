			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Private View: The unseen eye of a most modest writer - Norman Lewis is worshipped by his readers, yet is never really the hero of the extraordinary stories he has to tell. He is satisfied producing 'revealing little descriptions' For a man of his reputation, in an age when publishers are more concerned to push the personality of their authors than to defend the quality of their books, Norman Lewis shows a shocking lack of self-promotion. His readers worship him and Graham Greene called him one of the best writers of this century. Yet, he looks and sounds more like a solicitor's clerk from the suburbs, a person so nondescript as to be guaranteed escape from any identity parade. In manner, he is as modest as in appearance. Arriving in London from his house in the Essex countryside, he spoke of the pleasure and excitement of a trip to the city as if he had never visited the metropolis in his life, let alone tramped through the wilds of Indochina, Indonesia and Latin America for the past 50 years and more. When I asked if he regretted being known better for his travel books than his novels, he said merely: 'Probably. On the other hand, I regard myself as unambitious. I lead, in my opinion, an ideal style of life. If I'm happy with it, it's satisfactory. I'm not an ambitious person. 'It's very, very nice indeed to make a few friends to talk about things and to earn their respect as a writer - that's marvellous. But, for the public in general, I just don't care at all. I get by and that's fine.' If Norman Lewis worries and suffers as much as other men, you would not guess it. Humorous, accommodating, unfashionably respectful, he talks happily about his adventures, yet is never really the hero of the extraordinary stories he has to tell. His is the unseen eye. And this surely is the secret of literary alchemy: Lewis combines extraordinarily sharp eyes and ears with a gluttonous curiosity and a long memory. But he filters out the intrusive presence of the observer - himself. 'I am really entranced by the world in all its aspects,' he said. 'And I cannot tell you the joy that it gives me to study it, to try to analyse why I like it so much and to write little bits of description on the spot: because if I leave it 10 minutes, it's lost - less than that, before I get out of the door. 'All my notes are written on scraps of paper, which I immediately lose. I get immense enjoyment from it. This is my life, really, the enjoyment of producing what I think to be a revealing little description . . .' He quoted, with apparent approval, the complaint of one critic that his novels read like travel books, and of another that some of his travel writing reads like fiction. It is no surprise to learn that Lewis, although he always saw himself as an author, first earned his living as a photographer. Many of his 'little descriptions' have a photographic exactness about them. He does not make the mistake of trying to capture the whole picture, however; he concentrates, like a painter, on the most telling details of his subject or scene. His observations can be truly minute. To take a random example: a scene from Voices of the Old Sea, about the primitive fishing village in Catalonia where Lewis lived for three years after the second world war. It is early, and the author is taking coffee with Don Alberto, the local landowner: '. . . Don Alberto took a sip, leaving a small, vivacious stain on the cup's rim. He gasped his appreciation, then re-arranged the cup, saucer and spoon for a better display of the treacly morning reflections.' In Naples '44 the writer's talent for pen portraiture gets full rein. Lewis was serving as lowly, but hard-working and resourceful, intelligence officer in the chaos of the city's occupation by the Allies. His journal of those months records the tragi-comic antics of black marketeers, currupt mayors, distressed contessas and wide-eyed prostitutes. Lewis revealed a passion for the exotic early on. His first wife was the wilful, arresting Ernestina Corvaja, daughter of a minor Italian mafioso living in London. In his autobiography, Jackdaw Cake, Lewis describes how Ernestina flouted her father, Ernesto, by announcing their betrothal as an accomplished fact. The astonished father went grey with shock, then . . . 'Suddenly Ernesto shook his head - as if to free himself from a web clinging to his face. He straightened and smiled at me, a little wolfishly, I thought. 'What I was witnessing was a classic example of the stoic Sicilian reaction to irretrievable calamity, known in their enigmatic island as 'swallowing the claws of the toad'.' Lewis grew fond of Ernesto. Ernestina drifted away to Guatemala, though. 'It was a mistake, but it didn't have to be,' he said. 'She had too definite a personality.' Power of observation, professional detachment and nose for a story have made Lewis into an occasional reporter. He is proud of a 1968 newspaper article, 'Genocide in Brazil,' on the fate of the Indians of the Amazon; it brought an outcry and a change in Brazilian law. In The Missionaries, he exposed the cultural depredations of Christian fundamentalists on South American tribespeople; in a recent book on Indonesia, he reported on the suppression of the inhabitants of East Timor and described a vast but little-known mining project on Irian Jaya. 'The purpose, really, is to enjoy myself as a writer. In so far as I occasionally preach, it's probably the result of a Calvinistic Welsh upbringing. All the Welsh either write bad poetry or they tend to preach. 'I'm not organised in advance to think what I'm going to do. I might go over to look at the charming tribes and, suddenly, it will occur to me that horrific things are happening to them. In my childhood, this religious stuff was pumped into me, and it comes to the surface. But I'm surprised by it. I didn't start off with it.' The Welsh Calvinism was injected by three weird aunts with whom he was sent to live in Carmarthen. Life back at home in the north London suburb of Enfield was scarcely normal either: his father became a spiritualist medium and the house was turned into a temple for the production of ectoplasm and banal messages from The Other Side. I asked him: Why didn't you aspire to become a well-paid clerk in a bank, have your own house, car . . . 'Numerous reasons. Although I like money, like everyone else, I don't really aspire to be rich. And I don't aspire to have a large house. I always have the smallest car that money can buy. This is just part of my temperament. 'I haven't really thought clearly over a long period why this should be. I'm not an aspiring person, not a flamboyant person. I'm a quiet person.' The suburbs depress him now; he would rather live in a tree hut. Lewis admires the earliest travel writers including, naturally, Herodotus. As for his prose style, he admits to the influence of Hemingway, whom he met in Cuba. 'He broke new territory as far as I was concerned by, on the whole, stating things in a simple, direct manner which so many authors before him were unable to do.' Do you find writing harder or easier now? 'I don't find any difficulty at all, possibly 5 per cent easier.' He does a maximum 700 words a day, by hand, always in the morning. 'I could force myself to write in the afternoon but I know perfectly well the next day I'm going to scrap it. 'I start off with a clean page. It always has to be a lovely, clean page. And then, at a certain moment, I come back to it with a pair of scissors and some glue and start cutting bits out. At the end of the day, that sheet looks like a gypsy's petticoat. 'My wife is the only person - including me, by the way - that can read my handwriting and she types it for me.' Why don't you use a machine? 'I'm just temperamentally opposed to machinery. I prefer to pick up a pencil.' Lewis's fascination with the primitive does not seem to him to require any justification. He likes tribespeople - or Mediterranean villagers, for that matter - because they are 'exceedingly democratic', artistic, courteous, brave and charming. Is it the fallacy of the Noble Savage? 'No,' said Lewis, shortly. 'It's not.' Aren't you hunting for a completely unreal world? 'I'm hunting one that is disappearing, certainly. What I am doing, selfishly, is making the best of it. I'm enjoying this position. Apres moi, le deluge, but I don't make the deluge. I'm enjoying it while it's here.' We argued for a while over whether travel writers bear some responsibility for the destruction by commerce - including mass tourism - of the wild places they describe. Lewis denied it but said, finally: 'I'll have another think about that. I'm going to be asked this question again, quite obviously: I've gotta get my story straight.' He laughed. 'But I think I've put up a fairly solid defence so far, anyway.' He added: 'I have periodical urges to emigrate. Nothing ever comes of it.' He and his wife, Lesley, settled for a while in the wing of a Hohenstaufen castle near Rome overlooking the ruins of an ancient city. A river ran past and white cattle with long horns grazed there. It was an ideal spot for a lover of nature and birds. But, at new year, the villagers followed the ancient custom of tossing out their old furniture. They came and threw it in the river. Then men arrived, pushing an old Fiat van. That, too, was heaved over the parapet of the bridge into the water. October is the traditional shooting season. The sportsmen arrived, armed with special whirling machines to attract the game and high-powered guns with telescopic sights mounted on tripods. Some of them, Lewis swears, were kitted out in Highland dress - kilts and all. They set about shooting the songbirds. 'After the massacre,' he ended, 'there were no birds left. So, they went down to the river and shot the frogs.' The couple fled back to their own little man-made wilderness in three acres of Essex garden. But, I objected, these were charming, primitive customs you should be in favour of. Lewis looked furtive, then amused. 'Yes,' he said, 'but you can't expect me to be totally logical on all fronts.' Norman Lewis is writing another novel and - by way of self-indulgence - is planning his next trip, possibly to Colombia. He is nearly 86.</p>

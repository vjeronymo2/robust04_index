			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The South Korean puppets today brought a  large-caliber gun into the DMZ in the western front line, thus  committing a grave military provocation.    At around 0920 today, the South Korean puppets illegally  brought and installed a 105-mm large-caliber gun 1,800- meters  east of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker 0038 in front  of Tongchang-ri, Panmun County, Kaesong City, from the direction  of Paengnyong-ri, Paju County. They assumed the firing position  toward our side and gravely irritated us.    That the South Korean puppets openly brought a large-caliber  gun into the DMZ in broad daylight is a preplanned provocation  maneuver designed to artificially aggravate the situation in  this area where armed forces of the two sides are being deployed  acutely.    Since such military provocation is perpetrated at a time  when  the U.S. imperialists and bellicose elements in the puppet  military recently made frequent visits to the areas in the  foremost frontline and instigated the frenzy for northward  invasion, we cannot overlook this provocation.    The South Korean puppets should correctly ponder the grave  consequences to result from arms buildup maneuvers in the DMZ.  They should not act rashly.</p>

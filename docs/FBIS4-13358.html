			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 20 Apr (INA)--Iraq has expressed extreme  regret over Lebanon's decision to sever its diplomatic ties with  Iraq, describing it as a hasty decision.    A spokesman for the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said today that  having detained diplomatic employees with diplomatic immunity  under suspicious circumstances and on the basis of unfounded and  incorrect accusations, the Lebanese Government has violated the  provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of  1961, particularly Articles 29 and 31 of this convention. The  Lebanese Government also rejected an Iraqi proposal to set up a  joint Iraqi-Lebanese committee to supervise the investigations,  the spokesman noted.    The spokesman stressed that those measures also contravene  the brotherly relations which should prevail between Arab  countries.    Iraq demands the Lebanese Government to immediately release  the detained diplomats and not to molest other diplomats in any  way whatsoever. Iraq also urges the Lebanese Government to show  respect for its obligations in accordance with the Vienna  Convention and the rules of international dealing. This would  be by allowing all our embassy employees in Lebanon without  exception to leave the Lebanese territory, provide protection  for them and their families, and maintain the embassy building  and property.    The Iraqi Foreign Ministry held the Lebanese Government  fully  responsible for its hasty decision of severing diplomatic  relations with Iraq and for its erroneous behavior toward the  Iraqi diplomats.    The source hoped that circumstances will prevail in Lebanon  so that the Lebanese brothers will be able to express their true  position toward Lebanon-loving Iraq and to rectify this grave  mistake committed by their government.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Paribas pushed into the red by Maxwell provisions THE collapse of the Maxwell empire contributed to FFr2.8bn (Dollars 510m) of extraordinary provisions made last year by Paribas, the French investment banking group, and to its slide into an estimated net loss of FFr200m for 1991 from net profits of FFr2.5bn in 1990. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday announced it was putting Paribas' loans and long-term debt under surveillance for a possible rating reduction. Moody's will pay particular attention to the possible deterioration in the quality of the banking group's assets. Paribas, like several other prominent Parisian banks including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), made a number of loans to the Maxwell companies through its Paribas Suisse subsidiary. It has fully covered its exposure to Maxwell interests with an extraordinary provision of FFr800m. Credit Lyonnais and BNP, both state-owned banks, have far higher exposure to the Maxwell debacle than Paribas. Paris banking analysts estimate that the overall level of Maxwell loans owed to the French banking industry is around FFr15bn. The announcement of Paribas' provisions came as no surprise to the French stock market given that Mr Andre Levy Lang, president, had warned that his group would be making provisions on a number of large corporate loans. Paribas later issued a statement saying it would also be making provisions for its Maxwell loans. Despite the high level of loan loss provisions and the competitive state of the international banking industry, Paribas managed to increase its operating income to FFr3bn from FFr1.6bn including minority interests in 1991, and to FFr1.7bn from FFr400m excluding minorities. However, the group experienced a fall in income from capital transactions to FFr800m from FFr2.5bn including minorities, and to FFr700m from FFr2.1bn excluding minorities. Paribas said this reflected the state of the market. The level of ordinary banking provisions rose to FFr6.6bn from FFr5.5bn in 1991. Net profits including minority interests fell to FFr1bn from FFr4.1bn.</p>

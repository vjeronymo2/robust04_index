			<p>BFN     [Text] The major political parties have not yet reacted to  the possibility of a U.S. military intervention in Haiti or to  the announcement of a total embargo, as advocated by the United  States. The big parties, such as Movement for the Establishment  of Democracy in Haiti, National Agricultural and Industrial  Party, National Front for Change and Democracy, Assembly of  Progressive National Democrats, and Nationalistic Progressive  Revolutionary Party of Haiti refrained from reacting, at least  publicly, to those two hot points in the news.    The first reactions, however, have arrived. Some small  political formations strongly criticized the new U.S. initiative  to increase the sanctions and brandish the threat of a military  intervention. Among the major political parties, we have the  reaction of Professor Hubert de Ronceray , MDN [Mobilization For  National Development], who received those statements as a new  demonstration of contempt, aggression, and injustice toward the  Haitian people. No to American intervention! No to any new  occupation of Haiti!    The people's anti-Aristide organizations quickly reacted in  condemning the statements of the United States president. Let us  listen successively to the statements by Hubert de Ronceray from  MDN; Jude L. Jean-Jacques of AJEPOPOA, Haitian People's Power  Youth Organization; and Frank Pierre of Capois-la-Mort:    [Begin recording] [De Ronceray, in Creole] MDN finds it  strange that a great country, a strong power like the United  States of America does not see any other kind of democracy to  offer us, sees no other kind of democracy to offer a small, poor  country like Haiti but hunger, injustice, and death.    It is a shame, a waste, for such a huge power to lower  itself  to the point of agreeing to kill more Haitians and to send its  own children to die for a chicken-minded priest who performs  democracy with necklacing, iron cuts iron, and decapitation and  the burning of homes.    MDN reminds everyone that nothing will change with the road  we have taken with Article 149. It means the formation of an ad  hoc government, the holding of elections for other CASEC's  [Communal Section Administrative Councils], other mayors, other  deputies, other senators, another president.    [Jean-Jacques, in Creole] In the face of threats of  intervention being sent by some American legislators and the  State Department spokesman; in view of the arrogance of some  diplomats or spokesmen in the country asking for military  intervention in Haiti, we are asking the president of the Senate  office, Bernard Sansaricq, and the president of the Chamber of  Deputies, Robert Monde, to assume their responsibilities so that  a state authority can be established and the country's  Constitution respected; to manage the criminal, insane UN/OAS  embargo and defend the country's security. Up with political  stability! Up with democracy! Down with anarchy! Down with U.S.  intervention!    [Pierre] We say no, no, no; this will not do. Those people  should not confuse 1915 with 1994. In 1915, the United States  landed in Haiti and killed our children, brothers and sisters,  aunts, grandfathers and grandmothers; then in 1994, from the  generation of the great Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Charlemagne  Perralte, and the great independence hero Capois-la-Mort, we say  no, it will not happen. We have the blood of those ancestors in  our veins. We in Capois-la-Mort ask the Haitian Army to neither  give in nor to second guess what they heard. They must stand  firm so the parliament can become strong because the Haitian  Army is responsible for representing the country and watching  over lives and property in Haiti. [end recording]</p>

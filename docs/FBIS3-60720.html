Igor Dirkatck, an influential member of the Parliamentary  Defence Committee, told AFP that Ukraine ``must seek to obtain  the codes enabling it to control the nuclear missiles stationed  on its territory to meet the threat to its security represented  by Zhirinovskiy.''    ``Zhirinovskiy and the Communist Party want to restore the  Soviet empire and bring Russia back to its pre-1917 frontiers,''  he charged.    Ukraine possesses 130 strategic SS-19 multiple-warhead  missiles, mostly obsolete according to experts, along with 46  modern SS-24 missiles.    Though declaring its long-term intention to become a  non-nuclear state, ratifying the START-I treaty on nuclear  disarmament signed in July 1991 by the United States and the  Soviet Union, it has so far refused to give up the SS-24s.    Ukrainian leaders have said previously that they could  obtain  the nuclear codes ``but had no wish to.'' [passage omitted]    Earlier, parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman Dmitri  Pavlichko said that Sunday's vote showed Russia was ``far from  being a democracy'' and that Ukraine was right in hesitating to  give up its nuclear arsenal.    ``I hope that after these elections the (international)  community will better understand Ukraine's positions with regard  to disarmanent.'' The Russians have ``shown their  irresponsibility,'' he commented.    And Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said he  was concerned over the vote by sailors of the Black Sea fleet  who voted 19 percent in favour of Zhirinovskiy's party compared  with 11.5 percent for Russia's Choice, the party headed by  Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and which strongly backs  President Boris Yeltsin and his reform program.    ``That must push us on to resolving the question of sharing  out this fleet between Ukraine and Russia,'' he said. ``The  forces who voted for Zhirinovskiy are on our territory.''

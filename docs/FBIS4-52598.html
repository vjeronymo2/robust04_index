			<p>BFN     [Text] Bic Corporation of the United States has accused a  Thai company, Thai Merry, of dumping disposable cigarette  lighters on the US market and has asked Washington to impose  punitive import duty of 176 percent.    In a petition filed on Monday with the International Trade  Commission and the US Commerce Department Bic also asked for a  346 percent duty on Chinese-made lighters.    Neither federal agency had any immediate comment.    "As the only remaining US manufacturer of disposable  lighters, Bic is taking this action to protect our competitive  position so that we can continue to provide consumers with  made-in-the-USA quality and value," said Bic president Ray  Winter.    In Bangkok, a Foreign Trade Department source said the  department had not yet received the information about the  dumping investigation in the United States because dumping  involves the private sector.    A source from Thai Merry, the major exporter of Thai  disposable lighters, said the company had not been informed  about the case but believed it did not dump the products even  though the US is the major importer of its products.    Thai Merry already faces an anti-dumping duty collection of  14.1 percent on the value of lighters exported to the European  Union after the EU Commission found that the Thai products were  priced in a way that caused damage to local industries.    The EU also investigated dumping of disposable lighters from  China and announced a duty of 16.9 percent.</p>

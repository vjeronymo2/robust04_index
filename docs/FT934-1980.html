			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Declaration makes history but no promises 'Peace in our time' is what they did not say. 'I cannot promise you today that the joint declaration will bring peace,' said Mr Major. Mr Reynolds said: 'I have never spoken of peace before Christmas.' But the solemnity surrounding yesterday's proceedings in and around Downing Street made clear that witnesses believed they were watching history in the making. There was a real chance that the substance of the declaration would cut the ground from under the terrorists' feet after 25 years' violence. The first confirmation that journalists were to experience something special came with the mobile X-ray machine that greeted them when they descended on Downing Street for the taoiseach's 11am arrival. Right on schedule came the roar of the motorcycles carrying outriders, and four Mercedes limousines swept into Downing Street. Mr Reynolds, Mr Dick Spring and at least a score of officials emerged to be greeted by Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew under Number Ten's weather-beaten Christmas tree - diplomatically decked with orange and green fairy lights for the occasion. About 40 minutes later the two leaders emerged to make a brief statement, primarily for the television cameras - all i's now being dotted, all t's crossed. Offstage a whip, armed with a mini camera, appeared to be capturing the historic moment for posterity. No sooner had the prime ministers gone back inside than a contingent from the Democratic Unionist party appeared, accompanied by two apprehensive police officers and a buzz of anticipation. The party marched to the big black door to hand in a letter. Then the figure of the Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, delivered what was recognisable - even from a distance - as a fire-and-brimstone tirade. The phrases 'appeasement', 'lied', 'dirty deed', 'utterly failed' and 'Christian burial' were dimly perceptible through the crowd. Then off he strode. The media circus moved the other way, up the Downing Street stairs, past the portraits of former prime ministers to the state dining room. Within a couple of minutes of the press conference starting, Mr Major had coined the phrase 'the Downing Street declaration' - a point Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party's punctilious leader, was to return to later. Mr Reynolds, for his part, waxed poetical with his references to walls of wilting flowers and an eternity of tears. There was little inclination to spoil the prime ministers' momentous day by taxing them with tough questions. It was the same story - with one exception - in the House of Commons later. As the House listened attentively, the loudest sound was the rustle of declarations when the prime minister made one of several specific textual references. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, welcomed the declaration 'with enthusiasm'. Even Mr Molyneaux, an important figure in attempts to shape a durable political settlement, offered his criticisms of the 'rather tortuously worded' document 'in a constructive fashion'. But of course Mr Paisley, resplendent in an immense grey cardigan, could not resist the opportunity to have another go. Mr Major's invitation to the IRA to take a seat at the negotiating table in return for an end to violence went to 'the very gut of the resentment of the people of Northern Ireland', he railed. 'This document never once mentioned the United Kingdom.'</p>

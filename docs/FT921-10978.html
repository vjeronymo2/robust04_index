			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Putting risk reality back into export cover - The new ECGD chief's commitment to discipline in trade financing MR BRIAN Willott, newly-appointed head of Britain's export credit agency, the ECGD, has declared that his leading international aim is 'to get premium rates raised to reflect the reality of debt liabilities'. The commitment sweeps him to the heart of one of the most controversial  - and intractable - issues in export finance. It will be greeted with hollow laughter from British exporters who complain that they suffer a severe competitive handicap while the UK holds a solitary position among OECD exporters in forcing export insurance premiums up to match risk levels more accurately. For many UK exporters, the villain of the piece is the portfolio management system (PMS), introduced by the Treasury in May last year to impose discipline on export credits to risky markets, or those where exposure is substantial. ECGD staff admit that PMS has led to higher costs for premiums to risky markets. They also admit that costs average between one third and two thirds more than premiums charged by European competitors. Exporters would argue further: that cover in many risky markets is either unavailable or costs two to three times as much as it does on the continent. While it is far too early to signal to cynical exporters that a breakthrough is in sight, there are nevertheless signs that foreign export credit agencies - among them Italy's Sace, France's Coface, and Germany's Hermes - are becoming increasingly anxious over the potential liabilities they face as a result of their comparatively lax policies. In addition, an OECD study due for completion in April will for the first time allow accurate comparison of the 24-member industrial countries' export credit insurance policies: enhanced transparency is expected to make national treasuries more starkly aware of the potential cost of existing policies. It is more doubtful whether stark awareness will prompt the sort of policy changes Mr Willott strives for. However, said Mr Willott last week, 'revealing the facts will generate a fair deal of pressure'. 'We are not saying that premium rates should necessarily be identical in every country for every agency. What we would be looking for is a regime that gave a reasonable assurance that, over a period, the agencies are to break even, taking one year with another. That must mean that other premium rates come closer to us.' Most openly alarmed is Germany's finance ministry, which until recently gave struggling manufacturers in the former eastern Germany 'no questions asked' export credit cover for sales to the former Soviet bloc. The government had found itself in a vice: without the ability to continue exporting to old markets in the east, many east German manufacturers faced almost certain closure. At the same time, the exposure of Hermesto former Soviet republics has risen to DM29bn (Pounds 10bn). Outstanding untied government credits to the former Soviet republics, coupled with credit approvals given in principle, lift this to DM63bn. Even more alarming, the government faces a DM70bn backlog in applications for insurance cover to these markets. This compares with a gross exposure by ECGD to the former Soviet republics and Yugoslavia of no more than Pounds 1bn. Close behind Germany is Italy's Sacewhich says its exposure to the former Soviet republics totals L5,600bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Most of the agency's exposure represents a conscious policy of encouraging trade with countries from which Italy imports large quantities of energy supplies and with which there are substantial trade deficits that need balancing. This has meant that Sace has provided cover where other leading industrial countries have slammed the door. Argument between Sace and the Italian treasury over how to treat Soviet risk provoked the resignation in February last year of Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the Sace chairman. The debate centred on whether premiums should be raised to cover increased risk and whether Sace should guarantee 100 per cent or merely 90 per cent of the risk. Premiums have since been raised by 20 per cent, and only 90 per cent of risk is covered. Sace expects to pay out indemnities worth L2,400bn, with provisions for a further rise to L2,800bn in 1992. It has been obliged to seek L1,800bn in extra funds from the treasury in the 1992 budget to make up the growing shortfall between indemnity payments and income from premiums. Sace and the Italian government are under pressure from Brussels to create greater transparency to ensure that political risk cover is not a disguised form of subsidy. Nevertheless Mr Roberto Ruberti, the new head of Sace, told reporters recently: 'ECGD's policy of portfolio management system, which closely relates premium to risk, would not be acceptable here. It is the only agency to have adopted such a rigorous policy, and the competition is now taking advantage of it. Italy is saying 'No' to PMS unless the rest of the world follows.' France's export credit agency, Coface, which along with Sace has a reputation for offering the cheapest export credit cover in Europe, also acknowledges that past policies cannot be maintained. One adviser noted: 'We should put up the rates - but even if you double rates, it becomes prohibitively expensive, and still doesn't raise enough money to cover funding costs.'</p>

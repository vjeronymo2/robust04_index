			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN TRIED TO BUY OUT SHOUP  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran officials wanted to get rid of Bob Shoup to the extent that they  offered him a $183,000 buyout of his position as football coach and as a  tenured associate professor, a university regent confirmed Saturday.  </P> <P> The offer, rejected by Shoup, was made in November after negotiations that  would have allowed Shoup to coach for another year reached an impasse,  according to Jim Tyner, a member of the Cal Lutheran Board of Regents.  </P> <P> Tyner said that Shoup had acquiesced to an Oct. 20 agreement under which Shoup  would have coached the team for the 1990 season and then resigned. However,  Shoup and Tyner said, the contract the school subsequently presented to Shoup  on Oct. 31 differed in several ways from the previous agreement.  </P> <P> Shoup was informed of his dismissal as football coach on Aug. 8, and the  university reiterated its position Dec. 8.  </P> <P> On Dec. 7, Shoup, the only head coach in the program's 28 years, filed a  grievance that was turned down by the school's faculty grievance committee 12  days later.

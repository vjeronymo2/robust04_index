			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIMA LEADING RACE TO CABO SAN LUCAS  </P> <P> Strong northwest winds Sunday were pushing the 37 boats toward the finish line  at near-record speed in Newport Harbor Yacht Club's race to Cabo San Lucas.  </P> <P> At the 8 a.m. Sunday roll call, the Nelson-Marek 68 sloop Prima, skippered by  Burton Benjamin of San Diego Yacht Club, was the leading the Class A fleet of  ultra-light displacement boats, showing a distance of 193 miles from the start  in 19 hours of sailing. Several of the big sleds were sailing within sight of  each other.  </P> <P> Elapsed time record for the 790-mile course is 2 days 22 hours 2 minutes 40  seconds, which would mean the lead yacht would have to finish by 11 a.m.  Tuesday to eclipse the record held by the Santa Cruz-70 Blondie.

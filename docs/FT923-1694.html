			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Carrots and sticks: As the Russian parliament reconvenes, John Lloyd sees signs of compromise as well as confrontation The opening of the Russian parliament today has been preceded by Byzantine political manoeuvres. On the one hand, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, has taken care to be seen to be emollient; he has promised the deputies that they need not face election for more than two years (many would not survive) and sought to make up with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the leader of the parliament and the most venomous foe of the government and its economic reform programme. At the same time, the Civic Forum, which unites the three centrist parties, said after a meeting of its executive committee on Sunday that it would harshly criticise the government's programme, but would not seek to overthrow it. This may be no more than a recognition that governing Russia is likely to be such a torment for the foreseeable future that it is better done by one's enemies than one's friends. Even so, Civic Forum's position represents an apparent limit on hostilities. However, as the opening of parliament has drawn nearer, so the bitterness has deepened. The Parliamentary Coalition for Reforms, a group of radical reformist deputies, meeting yesterday, said it would seek to remove Mr Khasbulatov, or even have him arraigned by the Constitutional Court for exceeding his authority. Meanwhile, the Nationalist-Communist bloc, happily in alliance and agreeing on most things, has said it will try to impeach the president. The stakes are high this session. For the Communists and the Nationalists, the government is far too open to the capitalist west, encouraging a mafia-entrepreneurial class which has already dethroned the old nomenklatura and appears to becoming a permanent fixture of Russian society. For the industrialists, who are the most powerful group within the centrist parties, the government is a threatening force, pushing them out too fast into the market and holding the spectre of bankruptcy above their heads. Their pressure, however, has stopped the government from cutting off subsidies to state enterprises and from carrying out a policy of mass unemployment. For the reformers in and out of government, time is running out. The figures on the progress of the economy are awful. The budget deficit was estimated at the end of the second quarter at Rbs950bn (or about 17 per cent of gross domestic product) against a total budget for the first half of the year of Rbs3,300bn. Inflation is said by the government to be running at 20 to 25 per cent a month, and Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the government's Centre for Economic Reform, said it could be at 50 per cent as soon as next month. Production is still falling in most sectors by between 15 and 20 per cent annually. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, yesterday told reformist deputies that he would again tighten the screw on credits, and that the restrictions would last for at least the next six months. He admitted, however, that his policy must gain wide support - a difficult trick for such an unpopular measure. His determination shows that the government has not given up on its reform programme and does not intend simply to compromise itself into stasis. It will seek to get parliament to pass a bankruptcy law, allowing it to make 'showcase' closures in the big industrial sector. Mr Yeltsin, who continues to support Mr Gaidar's now divided reformist cabinet, will try to get through a new constitution enlarging the scope of his power, for example, allowing him to rule by decree. The president will also propose legislation giving him the final say in appointing ministers. At the same time, the government is trying to rein in Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the acting chairman of the Central Bank, which has dispensed credits to enterprises and to other former Soviet republics with a liberal hand over the summer. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the vice-premier in charge of privatisation, told the news agency Interfax yesterday that a special committee headed by Mr Gaidar had been set up last week to enforce some 'fairly harsh decisions' on stopping the flow of credit, at least to republics. This is likely to mean telling the republics that they must abide by strict financial discipline or leave the rouble zone. But how the cabinet will stop Mr Gerashchenko, who is responsible to the parliament rather than the cabinet or the president, remains unclear. The governing of Russia is a continuous and increasingly sharp struggle for power, and for the right to exercise it. In the absence of a constitution, the presidential, executive and legislative branches of government have ample scope to upstage each other and cancel out each other's decrees and actions. The evidence of the long summer recess has pointed to a certain weakening of executive will and a gathering of the opposition forces. But the government now seems ready to steel itself for a further advance. It is shaping up to be a classic Russian campaign - hard, brutal, merciless. By the end of the year, in deep mid-winter, it will become more clear how the tide of battle is running.</p>

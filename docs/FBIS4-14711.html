			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Appeal "To UN Secretary General Batono (Georgian polite </F> form of address) Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Russian Federation  President Batono Boris Yeltsin, Batono Eduard Shevardnadze,  chairman of the Republic of Georgia Parliament-head of state"  from the movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!" issued on 19 March;  place not given: "The Movement `For a Peaceful Abkhazia' Has  Declared War Against Separatism and National Chauvinism! If Our  Voice Is Not Heard...!"]    [Text] This appeal comes from representatives of the  social movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!" On behalf of the  inhabitants of Abkhazia who have been driven to despair, we ask  you to adopt the most urgent and extreme measures to establish  peace and harmony on the long-suffering Abkhazian land. As a  result of the criminal policy of the Gudauta adventurists in  Abkhazia, genocide is being perpetrated on the entire population  of this once prosperous and blessed land. Abkhazians,  Georgians, Armenians, and Russians and the representatives of  other nationalities are either leaving the Republic or being  forcibly banished from it. Out of the population of more than  500,000, little more than 100,000 remain. Unless the United  Nations becomes immediately involved and the most cardinal  measures are taken, the continuing genocide against the  population of Abkhazia could lead to the most irreparable  consequences.    We ask you to use all your authority and all the means at  your disposal to force the incompetent leaders who have led the  republic into a blind alley to take constructive steps aimed at  settling the conflict. Ardzinba and his close associates have  neither the moral nor the legal right to speak on behalf of the  Abkhazian people, on behalf of all the peoples of Abkhazia,  because the majority of the electorate is roaming on foreign  soil as refugees, forcibly displaced persons, or emigrants.    We ask you to hear the voice of the long-suffering people of  Abkhazia, mothers who have lost their sons in a senseless war,  old people and children who have been deprived of shelter, and  men and workers who are longing for creative labor.    We ask the Russian president, Batoni Yeltsin, to introduce  peacekeeping troops into Abkhazia; we believe that Russian  troops will be able to bring peace and calm to Abkhazia.    We appeal to Batoni Shevardnadze to ensure public order in  Abkhazia by means of Georgian police.    We ask for the right to life, peace, and the happiness of  our  children. Do not refuse us this. If our voice is not heard, if  Ardzinba and his close associates are given, as before, the  opportunity to bury all attempts aimed at a peaceful settlement  in demagogic ruses, we will be forced to oppose the Ardzinba  regime with weapons in our hands. The Abkhazians are a small  nation. We have already paid too high a price for the excessive  ambitions of these politicians. We will not allow the entire  Abkhazian nation to be wiped off the face of the earth.    The movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!"</p>

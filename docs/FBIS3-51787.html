These actions consist of paralyzing beginning  tomorrow up to 100 percent of the heavy-transportation services,  said last night leaders of the Fuel Transportation organization,  which is grouped under the National Transportation Board, CNT.    CNT Spokesman Rudy Merida has reiterated that the government  is being pressured on account of "several pending petitions, and  if they are not attended to, the problems will be greater not  only for the government but for the community in general. This  is why the government should attend to the petitions, which  total seven in number. Among the issues to be taken up are, for  example, the customs problem--as it has a fixed eight-hour work  day. Two others are the transportation cost of fuel and cement,  given that these have not been brought up to date," he said.    "The four other problems are the interference--covered up by  several mayors--of urban transportation lines in nonurban areas.  Another is the Nonurban Transportation ruling, which has not  been enforced. Still another is the ruling for the operation of  international shipping companies and the problem of retentions,  which are illegal and which are being collected by private cargo  companies. These are some of the points this sector is  demanding be discussed."    "Nevertheless, given that government authorities have  expressed their incapacity to reach an agreement, the directors  of organized transportation have decided to start staging the  strikes as of 25 January, after noon. It is almost certain that  the first to go on strike will be those who transport fuel,  followed by other heavy-transportation services. This will  continue until a total transportation strike takes place if the  government, finance, energy and mines, and communications  ministers do not meet with us this very day. We are giving you  until noon tomorrow; if no solution is presented, we will  definitely go on strike," said Rudy Merida, who made the  statement.</p>

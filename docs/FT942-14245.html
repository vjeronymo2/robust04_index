			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Wagons roll into Eastern Europe - Burton's gold medal biscuits Weston's Wagon Wheels - the chocolate - coated, mallow - filled biscuits beloved of children in the UK - have established a new market: they are now among the most popular imported biscuits on sale in Russia. Their manufacturer, Burton's Biscuits, has won a Queen's Award for exports thanks to a surge in overseas sales in the past three years. Although Burton's still only exports about a fifth of its Pounds 160m turnover, its exports have doubled in the past three years and rose by 70 per cent in the past two years. Burton's claims to be the UK's fastest growing biscuit manufacturer. It is part of Associated British Foods, which merged with Weston Biscuit company in 1968. The Weston family are major shareholders in the big milling and baking group with Mr Garfield Weston chairman. Burton's products include Jammie Dodgers, Jaffa Cakes, Royal Edinburgh Shortbread, Rich Tea biscuits and Liquorice Allsorts. It produces its biscuits and other confectionery in factories at Llantarnam in Gwent, in Edinburgh and in Blackpool where the business was founded in 1935. Though based in Bracknell, Berkshire, its export division is based in Edinburgh. Burton's has invested Pounds 80m in manufacturing equipment in the past seven years. According to Mr Ian Gibson, the general manger of the export division, the company's export efforts focus on Europe. 'We've developed private label products for food retailers in France and the Netherlands to sell under their own names, and we also have a branded operation,' he says. The Nordic countries are good markets for Burton's brands, and its biscuits sell in Singapore, Australia and North America. Burton's is a good example of a British manufacturer taking advantage of the opening up of eastern European markets since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. As well as selling in Russia it has also developed markets in Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovenia.</p>

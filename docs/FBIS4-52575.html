			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi (BISNIS)--President Suharto is prepared to  extend his term of office as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement  [NAM] for six months to a year when his term ends in 1995 if NAM  member countries have not been successful in finding a successor.    The willingness of Pak Harto [President Suharto] to extend  the term as NAM chairman applies only if NAM countries face  difficulties in finding a new leader, Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas said, as reported from New Delhi yesterday by BISNIS  correspondent Tarman Azzam.    Accompanied by Minister of State and State Secretary  Murdiono, Ali Alatas reported the results of a meeting between  President Suharto and Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in New  Delhi Monday night [28 March].    In his meeting with Rao, President Suharto explained  Indonesia's view, namely that NAM chairmanship succession should  be conducted in an orderly way so that more members will hold  the position for leading the developing nations.    The Indian prime minister was told of the NAM chairman's  views on the importance of the World Population Conference in  Cairo, Egypt, from 1 to 4 June, when it is hoped that a decision  will be made on NAM leadership.    The meeting in Cairo will be preceded by a meeting of NAM  foreign ministers on 30-31 May, Ali Alatas said.    Murdiono said that Indonesia's term of office as NAM  chairman  will end in 1995. Indonesia's willingness to extend the term is  only to permit the next candidate for the NAM chairmanship to  prepare itself in the best possible way.    The subject of extending Indonesia's term of office as NAM  chairman surfaced because several member countries asked  Indonesia to hold the office for another term.    According to Murdiono, Indonesia's basic position is that it  is not good for a person to be NAM chairman for two successive  terms. In this case, Pak Harto wants the NAM fully to uphold the  basic principles of the NAM organization.</p>

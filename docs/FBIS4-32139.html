			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tatyana Vasileva: "Zhelev Considers Second </F> Term in Office""]    [Text] The veto that President Zhelev is expected to  impose on the laws on the judiciary and mass privatization may  once again put him one step in front.    The personification of the amendments to the Judiciary  System  Act as "anti-Tatarchev" and "anti-Grigorov," as well as the  personification of the reaction to them, may prove harmful; the  laws at least should not be used as a means of obtaining  personal revenge. However, it will certainly open the hearts of  the people at 134 Rakovski Street [headquarters of Union of  Democratic Forces, SDS] to the head of state whom they rejected  more than a year ago. If, after lengthy consultations with all  the parties concerned, Dr. Zhelev nonetheless decides to return  the law to parliament for further drafting in the plenary hall,  this will undoubtedly also make him a hero in the eyes of  Europe, where people already believe that our judiciary is being  recommunized.    Stopping the mass privatization act will also increase the  president's rating abroad. Foreign investors are staying away  from Bulgaria not only because, as a Balkan country, we are  considered to be a high risk, but also due to the model for  privatization that we have now been arguing over for three  months. Although winning a few points abroad, Dr. Zhelev will  nevertheless attract the wrath of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist  Party]. The Socialists are already wondering whom to blame  because their increasingly impoverished electorate has nothing  to gain from taking part in the mass privatization.    It will be a veritable feat of aerobatics if the head of  state finds another form of veto that will allow him to make up  with the SDS without provoking an almighty quarrel with the BSP,  and at the same time avoid damaging his image abroad. This  would certainly mean that, after almost four years in the  supreme office, Dr. Zhelev refuses to walk any longer along the  edge of the precipice and is looking to win the soft, velvety  caresses of the electorate.    If the president acts to set people's minds at rest, in  contrast to the political storm that everyone expects, this may  be interpreted as meaning that the head of state is already  thinking about a second term.</p>

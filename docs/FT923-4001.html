			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laser-Scan runs up Pounds 408,000 loss An 18 per cent reduction in turnover forced Laser-Scan Holdings into a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 408,000 in the first half of 1992, compared with profit of Pounds 246,000. Mr Jim Utterson, chairman of the USM-quoted micrographic equipment company, said the turnover fall from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 3.99m reflected the continuation of the adverse trading conditions of the latter half of 1991. Losses per share were 2.5p (earnings 1.5p). Pressure on margins had persisted with geographic systems in particular being affected. Also imaging systems, which depended on a small number of relatively large orders, did not achieve the same level of shipments as last year.</p>

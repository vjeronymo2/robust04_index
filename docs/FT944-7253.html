			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Observer: Honk for Oui Given the streak of recklessness that seems to possess your average Belgian when placed behind the wheel of a car, proposals by transport minister Elio di Rupo to raise the speed limit by 10kph to 130kph - to bring things in line with neighbouring France - might seem academic in the extreme. Nonetheless, it is a notion upon which - surprise, surprise - the Flemings and the Walloons cannot agree. Quite why those pro the increase should be the Francophones, while the Dutch speakers all duly line up on the side of the nays, is less than clear to a non-Belgian. But there are more motorway accidents in Flanders. Which in turn is explained less by the fact that Walloons make yet crazier drivers, than by the existence of a different order of hazard - the regional police force. The latter installs nightly check points - which seem to have the reverse of their intended effect of cutting down the accident rate.</p>

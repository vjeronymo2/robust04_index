			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Victoria Brittain report: "UN Peacekeepers Criticised for </F> `Neglecting Human Rights'"]    [Text] The credibility of United Nations peacekeeping  operations is being undermined by the forces' neglect of human  rights violations, according to a report by Amnesty  International.    "It is essential that human rights are made an intrinsic  part  of all peacekeeping activities," the report says. It was  released today in Mozambique, one of the countries where UN  peacekeepers have a weak mandate, according to Amnesty.    The report contrasts two countries where human rights  monitoring was made part of the UN mandate -- El Salvador and  Cambodia -- with six African countries where it is minimal,  inconsistent or non-existent. In Somalia, Angola, Western  Sahara, Liberia, Rwanda and Mozambique the neglect of human  rights has led to disaster or at best stalemate, the report says.    "In some operations human rights have been ignored and UN  personnel have stood by, silent, while serious violations were  taking place.... That must not be allowed to continue."    The report condemns the UN's failure to denounce such abuses  as Unita's refusal to release prisoners held in Jamba, or the  Moroccan government's blocking of investigations into  "disappeared" Saharawis. In Angola, Amnesty believes the UN's  lack of response to peace pact violations in the run-up to the  election contributed to UNITA's contempt for the peace process  and the return to war.    Amnesty calls for the principle established in the former  Yugoslavia -- of all UN bodies having a duty to provide human  rights information -- to be applied universally.    The report cites Sudan as an "urgent humanitarian challenge"  and says UN agencies should monitor and demand compliance with  international human rights and humanitarian law standards by all  sides, rather than keeping quiet to ensure access to populations  in need. "This cannot be avoided in the name of  humanitarianism," the report says in a paragraph which will be  controversial with aid agencies.    Among the report's proposals is the appointment in Angola of  a UN human rights commissioner, and for on-site monitors in  Iraq, an idea endorsed both by the special rapporteur on Iraq,  Max van der Stoel, and the UN General Assembly.</p>

Kozaburo Nishimura, chairman of the Japan Society of  Industrial Machinery Manufacturers, said: "Since intensifying  Japan-U.S. friction has resulted in the yen's appreciation, we  are now faced with a difficult situation. Therefore, I hope  efforts will be made to prevent Japan-U.S. relations from being  impaired." Many participants called for steady implementation of  the economic stimulus package. Concerning Japan-U.S. ties,  Minister Kumagai stressed: "Japan should resolutely carry out  whatever is achievable and settle economic problems existing  between our two countries as soon as possible."</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCRAMBLING OVER SATELLITE DISHES RENEWED  </P> <P> So you're a sports fan, but you can't get cable TV. What to do?  </P> <P> There is an alternative: Invest in a satellite dish.  </P> <P> But, you ask, what about scrambling?  </P> <P> Scrambling -- the process by which TV suppliers electronically jumble their  satellite transmissions so they can only be seen with a special decoding device  -- put a big damper on the sales of satellite dishes a few years ago.  </P> <P> But the technology for decoding scrambled signals is now available to  consumers, and the satellite dish industry is making a comeback. The difference  is that most of the sports programming that formerly was available for free now  must be paid for.  </P> <P> About 2.3 million of the nation's homes are equipped with satellite dishes.  About 500,000 of those homes have systems with de-scramblers, and that number  is growing by about 15,000 per month.  </P> <P> In Mira Mesa Business Park, an industrial area north of here, two modern  buildings house the headquarters of the VideoCipher division of General  Instrument Corp. Off to the side of the main lobby is an area filled with  space-age television monitors and computer equipment.  </P> <P> Esther Rodriguez, VideoCipher vice president, explains that this is called the  DBS center -- for direct broadcast service, the trade term for the satellite  dish business. Here, scrambled signals are unscrambled for home satellite dish  consumers who own a VideoCipher II de-scrambler, or a similar one made by a  competitor.  </P> <P> VideoCipher, formerly M/A Com before being purchased by General Instrument in  1986, owns the patent for scrambling and unscrambling signals and has licensed  22 competitors. It operates the DBS center on a nonprofit basis in order to  make money on hardware sales -- mainly de-scramblers and futuristic  pay-per-view equipment.  </P> <P> But many of the program suppliers require that consumers pay a fee to them for  receiving their service, just as they would if they got it by cable. "That's  been a tough adjustment for a lot of satellite dish owners," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Originally, after a 1979 Federal Communications Commission decision that  removed the requirement that all Earth stations be licensed by the government,  individual dish owners could tune in for free to virtually any TV signal that  was being fed by satellite. This was particularly attractive to sports fans,  who could get any event televised anywhere, including blacked-out pro football  games.  </P> <P> The only catch then was the price of a satellite dish system. In 1979, Neiman  Marcus advertised a system for $36,000. But the price came down, first to  $10,000, then $8,000 and eventually to about $2,500 for a top-of-the-line  system. By 1985, more than 1 million homes had satellite dishes.  </P> <P> The cost of the standard dish systems continues to dwindle. A complete system,  de-scrambler included, costs about $2,500 -- or about the same as systems  without de-scramblers used to cost.  </P> <P> As the business grew, however, programmers such as HBO became concerned that  their product was being given away. So they began scrambling their signals and  charging to have it decoded.  </P> <P> For example, Dallas-based Satellite Sport Network distributes a package of six  regional sports cable networks, including Prime Ticket, at a yearly fee of  $95.40. The catch here is that pro sports leagues require blackouts. A Laker  game on Prime Ticket, for instance, can be watched in Los Angeles but not in  any other NBA city. Or a Houston Astros game on Home Sports Entertainment can  be watched in Houston but not in any other baseball city.  </P> <P> With the satellite dish business beginning to pick up again, there is  speculation that it could eventually threaten the cable television industry.  Imagine picking and choosing your own programming with no middle-man cable  operator standing in the way.  </P> <P> However, Rodriguez said: "We are not competing with cable. We look at our  business as a supplement of cable, an alternative for those who can't get  cable."  </P></p>

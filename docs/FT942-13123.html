			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (25): Users link up with groupware - Workgroups Workgroups have rocketed to prominence in technology circles through the rise of groupware. Groupware is software that ties together a scattered band of users working on one project. Every amendment to a document is instantly reflected in the overall picture, with the object of recreating electronically the sensation of everyone working in the same room. Lotus has dominated the groupware scene with its phenomenally successful Notes program. However, the idea of using information technology to link up disparate teams of people predates Notes. Any network of computers creates a workgroup. Observers point out Notes merely takes an existing capability and markets it in a fresh sense. This is a little unkind, as Notes links constellations of users across a PC network at an affordable price. And it has notched up 750,000 users worldwide, so there is a real demand for groupware. But workgroup facilities have been around for years through networking. The key to current workgroup thinking is the need to disperse information across a corporate body. Commercial survival, according to the management mantra is dependent on sharing every scrap of information the company possesses. Keep your people communicating and create a corporate knowledge base that has the edge over competitors. The rush into 'flat structures' has involved wholesale massacres of the workforce so the diminished payroll needs to pool its experience and sharpen its wits. Workgroups are a potential route to productivity among white collar staff. Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo employs Cooperation, a workgroup software suite from AT&amp;T's NCR arm, to manage assorted computer applications. Cooperation sits on top of desktop systems at Glaxo's headquarters at Ware in Hertfordshire. The company uses it to control existing programs, known in the trade as legacy systems. 'Our primary use of Cooperation is as a tool to hide the legacy systems,' says Peter Swinburne, head of IT at Glaxo. The 100 users in manufacturing, planning, new product development and customer services get a standard computer procedure through the groupware shell. This is groupware promoting productivity, and with a total investment of Pounds 300,000. Swinburne regards it as 'an integral part of our IT strategy'. It is estimated the market in workgroup products will reach Pounds 3.5bn by 1998, which includes consultancy and installation as well as software sales for US corporations. The business implications are profound enough for a UK consortium to launch a joint project with the DTI. Computer Supported Cooperative Work is a Pounds 13m scheme intended to promote workgroup practices in the restructured company of the 1990s. ACT Business Systems is managing one of the CSCW projects, the imaginatively named Business Flight Simulator. This is a best-selling computer game that resides on PCs across the world as an entertaining alternative to work. BFS is a Pounds 530,000 venture that gathers up current and imminent groupware products to create an infrastructure to encourage their use. The Post Office and Cheshire County Council are trialling these programs, tied together in a local area network BFS is not about technological innovation. 'We aim to use standard products', says Paul Ballard, senior consultant at ACT. Instead, its objective is to test the principles of decision-making in groups linked by IT. Action support is one of the key BFS motifs. This means decisions are not left hanging but are communicated to those people responsible for following through. Management should be able to monitor what actually happens after a brainstorming session via the PC and its groupware. Despite CSCW's high-powered image, it ran straight into a traditional brick wall. 'We recognise that giving senior managers the technology and expecting them to use it is a problem,' says Ballard. The difficulty - diplomatically couched as 'humanistic' - is that senior staff still know a lot less about IT than their secretaries. The BFS will only really take off when participants are truly at ease with a keyboard and screen. Naming the system after a popular computer game may be one way of breaking down resistance. British Aerospace is another participant in the CSCW movement. Designers as Users of Co-operative Knowledge ('Duck') aims to allow engineers to work as if sharing a single office. The vehicle for Duck is simultaneous multiple access to a project log, relying on a computer network. Distributed engineering teams are common to BAe, and anything that streamlines their working practices stands to save money. Workgroups will thrive. They've been around long enough. The immortal image of the Battle of Britain's operations room, where people shoved symbols across a map of the South Coast with billiard cues, was an example of a workgroup in action. If 1940s technology could successfully co-ordinate the expertise of an entire air force, CSCW should be able to enlist managers in the battle for business.</p>

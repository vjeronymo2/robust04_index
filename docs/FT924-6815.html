			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Courtaulds dips to Pounds 89m COURTAULDS, the specialist materials group reported pre-tax profits down 9 per cent from Pounds 97.7m to Pounds 88.8m for the six months to September 30. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said he was pleased sales had increased from Pounds 968m to Pounds 975.6m given the depressed state of most of the group's markets. He refused to predict if trading would improve. He said: 'I don't mind being wrong, I just hate being laughed at. However, my chemicals friends say October was a significantly better month, and that the trend continued in November.' He was optimistic about prospects for fibres, films and chemicals. The stronger dollar would help, although benefits would be partly off-set by a higher dollar interest billThe group has Dollars 665m (Pounds 440m) of dollar debt. The results benefited Pounds 9.1m from a pensions surplus. Mr Michael Pragnell, finance director, said the average tax charge was 17 against 19.7 per cent and was unlikely to rise above 23 per cent during the full year. Earnings fell 5 per cent to 18.3p (19.3p). The figures were compiled according to the new FRS3 standard. The results were hit by the weakness of the dollar. As much as 60 per cent of group turnover is in the US, or dollar-denominated. Pricing pressure had meant operating rates had been poor, with about 10 per cent of fibre capacity standing idle during the summer. 'July and August were pretty bloody,' said Mr Huismans. North American operations performed poorly. Trading profits fell 32 per cent from Pounds 37m to Pounds 25m on turnover of Pounds 268m (Pounds 286m). Sales there had been hit by the poor performances by the aerospace, viscose and coatings businesses. Mr Huismans said: 'Aerospace is in dead trouble. We've been doing a lot of cost-cutting. In spite of its present difficulties we see aerospace as an absolute core business.' European operating profits increased 11 per cent from Pounds 47m to Pounds 52m on sales of Pounds 593m (Pounds 562m). Mr Huismans said the improvement was mainly due to better results from Cellophane and Acrylics. Asian Pacific profits rose 9 per cent from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12m on turnover down 4 per cent from Pounds 104m to Pounds 100m. UK operating profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 39m to Pounds 41m on turnover down 4 per cent at Pounds 381m (Pounds 395m). Margins were helped by the closure of the Barrow plant. Coatings operating profits were Pounds 27m (Pounds 28m) on sales of Pounds 344m (Pounds 343m). Performance materials profits were Pounds 7m (Pounds 9m) on turnover of Pounds 94m (Pounds 95m). Packaging profits reached Pounds 13m (Pounds 11m) on sales of Pounds 125m (Pounds 120m). Chemicals were Pounds 19m (Pounds 18m) on turnover of Pounds 108m (Pounds 112m). Fibres and films profits were Pounds 31m (Pounds 36m) on sales of Pounds 323m (Pounds 318m). Costs had been held back through 875 jobs lost since March. Mr Huismans said a larger number would go next year. The interim dividend is increased 4 per cent to 3.8p per share (3.65p). See Lex</p>

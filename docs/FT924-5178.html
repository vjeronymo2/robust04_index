			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (21): Classical concerts galore - Paris offers top quality music - from opera to jazz WHEN the shiny new Opera Bastille flung open its doors on the Place de la Bastille in 1990, it was supposed to herald a new era for the Paris music scene by offering opera for the people, with cheap seats, state-of-the-art accoustics and marvellous music. Unfortunately for the city's opera lovers, the Opera Bastille has not turned out quite as the French government expected. The government may have lashed out on a swanky new opera house, with all the requisite technology, but it made the fatal mistake of transferring the old union agreements that had wrecked the old Opera, now limited to ballet, to the new one. The new Opera Bastille has never been far from controversy. There was the row four years ago when Daniel Barenboim, the temperamental conductor, was fired as artistic director and the recent rumpus over the Philippe Belaval's fiery resignation as director general. But the accoustics are great and the programme devised by Myung Whun Chung, the new artistic director, is now, or so Parisian opera buffs boast, among the best in Europe. The only hitch for the visitor is buying a ticket. Most of the Opera Bastille seats are snapped up in advance. Your best bet is to try to get tickets through the hotel, or to see if they can recommend a nearby booking agency. If the opera is sold out, there are always dozens of classical concerts to choose from. The most picturesque venues are the big churches. The eglise de la Madeleine near the old Opera is a stunning church with wonderful sound, as is eglise Saint-Eustache at the back of the Les Halles complex. If you want to go for a walk after the concert, the Eglise Saint Germain des Pres in the heart of the Left Bank, or Eglise Saint-Louis-en-l'Ile on the lovely Ile Saint-Louis, should appeal as should the little Sainte-Chapelle on the Ile de la Cite. Paris is paradise for any jazz fan. Modern jazz has been a pivotal part of the city's cultural agenda since the 1950s when the French existentialists recognised the importance of musicians like Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, long before their counterparts in the US. Details of the week's jazz sessions, like classical concerts, are all published in the listings magazines, Pariscope and L'Officiel des Spectacles. Although the established clubs, such as New Morning on the rue des Petites-Ecuries or Cafe de la Plage on rue de Charonne, can usually be relied on to have good line-ups. As for rock, this is one area where the French, for all their success in other arts spheres, have never really cut it. France is, after all, the land of anodyne Europop. Rarely a week goes by without Paris-Match magazine regaling its readers with the latest adventure, or misadventure of the ageing 1950s vedette, Johnny Hallyday. All the big American and European rock acts come to Paris generally to play at the amorphous - and expensive - Omnisport Bercy stadium, or, if you're lucky, La Cigale, a wonderful old vaudeville house. If you want to see the stars off stage you should pop along to Les Bains, the night club, where they almost always turn up - complete with their troops of black leather-clad bodyguards - after the show.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the issue of expanding plate glass  imports, which is one of the sectors being discussed at the  Japane-U.S. framework talks, it has been disclosed that the U.S.  Government has asked [motometa] the Japanese Government to make  Japanese glass wholesalers and glass fitters prepare independent  plans designed to increase their purchases of U.S.-made plate  glass. In the past, the United States had demanded [yokyu] that  Japan prepare a plan to buy U.S.-made auto parts, and Japan  accepted this request. The recent request is the second of its  kind. Because of this, Japan, which aims to resume the  framework talks by taking advantage of the announcement of the  recently approved "foreign economic reform plan outline," is  faced with a new difficult task.    As for an expansion of plate glass purchases, Japan and the  United States have already signed an accord. The two countries  are supposed to review this accord at the framework talks.    The United States is asking for independent purchasing plans  prepared by Japanese companies--including aluminum sash and  prefabricated home builders, plate glass wholesalers, and glass  fitters. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  is strongly rejecting this U.S. demand, saying, "Because there  is no regulation of plate glass, we cannot give guidance to  domestic companies asking them to increase their purchases of  certain goods."    There are some 1,000 glass wholesalers and glass fitters in  Japan, and most of them are small to medium-sized companies.  Because of this, MITI says that "it is impossible for us to ask  each company to prepare an independent plan."    In January 1992, Japan mapped out an action plan designed to  help foreign companies make inroads into the Japanese market.  To implement the plan, MITI has been taking various measures,  including introducing Japanese wholesalers to U.S. plate glass  manufacturers.</p>

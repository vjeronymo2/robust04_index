			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: US loses appetite for BP A SHARP change of attitude towards British Petroleum in the US, where investors have been strong buyers for some time, knocked the shares, which fell 6 1/2 to 245 1/2 p. US investment house Smith Barney revised its recommendation from buy to hold. Oil analyst Mr Michael Young said he had 'lost confidence in BP's earnings power over the next few years'. He predicts first-quarter earnings of 20 cents per American Depositary Rec-eipt and is holding his 1992 oil price estimate of Dollars 19 a barrel. In London, where the attitude is distinctly disenchanted, there was also talk in the market of extensive redundancies within the oil company. Finally, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull was telling clients that it was increasingly cautious about the potential benefits of Columbia's Cusiana oilfield, in which BP has a large stake. Owners inquiry The second Stock Exchange inquiry in as many weeks was launched into Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest holiday group. Yesterday's move is believed to centre on the collapse of the group's share price over the past month. This has coincided with chairman Mr Howard Klein selling 690,000 shares to a trust owned by the company for an employee share scheme. It has also coincided with a series of anonymous notes being circulated to Owners' employees and national newspapers suggesting that the group was about to fall prey to rival Airtours. Both companies have denied that there is any truth in the suggestion. There was brisk business in Owners yesterday, 1.1m shares being traded, and the stock ended half a penny down at 89p. Airtours slipped 5 to 239p. Queens Moat falls There was a mixed response to figures from Queens Moat Houses, one of the leading UK and Continental hotel groups. While the profits were largely in line with expectations, a warning from the group that there would be no earnings growth over the next year hurt the stock, which fell 5 to 71p. As expected, UK occupancy rates were dismal but a continued strong showing in Europe underpinned what was seen as a generally solid performance. Mr Paul Heath at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said he was likely to move from a hold to a buy over the next few months, but expressed caution over the stock, which has been prone to recent underperformance. Kleinwort Benson, a bull of the shares, shaved its 1992 profits forecast to Pounds 103m. Power generators and regional electricity companies staged a late surge amid speculation that an imminent opinion poll would give the Conservatives a lead over Labour. On the other hand, traders noted that water issues, also particularly vulnerable to changes in the political climate, did not show similar gains. Analysts suggested that the regional electricity groups have become cheap to water shares recently and were due for a bounce, but this does not apply to the power generators, which have remained relatively strong, with the exception of the Scottish power companies. The Electricity Package rallied Pounds 92 to Pounds 2,360. Utilities analyst Ms Liz Christie at Goldman Sachs regards the Scottish power companies as particularly attractive, believing them to be less vulnerable to regulatory controls, and at the present price 'no one can accuse the government of selling them too cheaply'. Water shares had a much softer tone. Costain Group dropped to 56p immediately following the preliminary figures but rallied in the wake of a positive post results meeting with analysts to close a penny firmer at 66p. Turnover in the shares was a hefty 6.5m. However, Mr Graham Foster at Nomura, who reduced his forecast for this year to Pounds 17m, said: 'The feeling still remains with Costain that they are again promising jam tomorrow. I remain very cautious.' Hoare Govett cut its forecast to Pounds 15m, while UBS is looking for Pounds 17.5m. Information organisation Reuters Holdings retreated 36 to 1105p in reaction to sharp falls on Wall Street, where traders said about 40 per cent of Reuters shares were held in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). There was also a note of caution from securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew at its morning meeting following the statement that Reuters' trading system Globex is to be launched on June 25. The house said Globex was good news but the shares had been at a substantial premium to the market. Other UK stocks with a significant ADR weighting suffered as well. SmithKline Beecham, about 33 per cent held in ADR form and which had been heavily sold in New York, showed falls of 22 to 830p for the 'A' shares and 110 to 3750p for the Units. Among transport issues, international freight company Ocean Group bounced from recent weakness to add 7 at 309p after reporting a 6 per cent improvement in 1991 profits at Pounds 51m. Rolls-Royce put on 3 to 150p, boosted by a Smith New Court recommendation. Speculation that Vickers would soon announce the outright sale of its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary sent the shares moving forward 7 to 144p. One analyst, however, discounted the talk. British Airways retreated 8 to 240p, hurt by selling in New York and a stock overhang in London, together with the rise in oil prices. Pharmaceuticals group Fisons finished a penny firmer at 323p, after being 4 ahead at one stage, with 3.8m shares traded. Securities house Hoare Govett hosted a 'reassuring' presentation by the company. New chief executive Mr Cedric Scroggs and chairman Mr Patrick Egan spoke to representatives from about 25 institutions. Hoare also reiterated its buy stance on Fisons, arguing that the shares had underperformed ahead of Mr Scroggs' appointment. Cynical fund managers and analysts returned unimpressed with the new Euro Disney site outside Paris. The visit on Tuesday was meant to present a bright image of the resort ahead of its opening this weekend. Yesterday the shares tumbled 85 to 1465p. Among insurers, Prudential stood out with a rise of 7 1/2 to 208p. Smith New Court decided that the stock looked cheap after sustained underperformance and was discussing the company with clients yesterday. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (6).

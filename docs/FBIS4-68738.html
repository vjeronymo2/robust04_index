			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Vera Shirobokova, </F> adviser of the "Reform" International Fund, followed by  unattributed report under the general heading "Belorussian  Ruble's Bid to Jump Hurdles"]    [Text] There has been much debate of late over the  unification of the Russian and Belorussian [Belarusian] monetary  systems. Viewpoints are at times diametrically opposed. So  what is really happening?    The mechanism for merging the two countries' monetary  systems  has been elaborated and agreed over the last three months. The  commission working on these problems succeeded in making fairly  good progress. Agreements were reached on many contentious  issues, and a version of the treaty was proposed by the Russian  side. However, when agreeing it with experts from Belorussia it  proved impossible to surmount differences of opinion on four  fundamental provisions.    The first contentious issue concerns the exchange rate of  Belorussian bank notes against Russian rubles. The Russian side  believes that revaluation should be implemented according to the  average value of the purchasing power parity of both countries'  currencies and their market cross rate against the U.S. dollar.  It is proposed that this rate be applied both for the exchange  of cash and the revaluation of other monetary assets.    The Belorussian side, however, proposes using a  recalculation  rate based on the purchasing power parity of bank notes. It is  proposed that funds held by the population in savings and  current bank accounts be revalued at a rate of one to one, but  subject to a six-month delay before these funds can be withdrawn  (until the complete withdrawal of Belorussian currency from cash  circulation).    Prices for deliveries of products between both countries'  economic organizations constitute the next highly significant  point of divergence. Russian experts propose a gradual  reduction of export duties (starting with 30 percent) with  commitments from Belorussia not to levy payment for the transit  of Russian cargoes across its territory, or rental payment for  Russian military facilities.    The Belorussian side, however, proposes to abolish all  reciprocal export duties and switch to domestic Russian prices  for energy sources in mutual settlements as of the date of the  monetary systems' unification. It is assumed that, in doing so,  Russia's losses from lowering prices for energy sources will be  offset by cuts in expenditure on transit and the lack of outlay  on patrolling its Western border and of expenditure on the  upkeep of military facilities. Moreover, lowering prices for  energy sources will make it possible to cut the level of  production costs for Belorussian output and thus reduce its end  price for Russian consumers.    The other two points of divergence are largely political.  Since the unification of monetary systems presupposes  unification of both the budgetary and the banking systems, the  Russian side is insisting that this process be completed as  quickly as possible (by the beginning of 1995). But as regards  the budget, Belorussia is prepared merely to create the  preconditions for its consolidation by the end of 1994.    In order to merge the banking systems, Russia proposes to  reorganize the National Bank of Belorussia as a branch of the  Central Bank of Russia, transferring to the latter all assets  and liabilities and extending to Belorussian territory the  effect of Russian laws in this sphere, by the end of this year.  Belorussia, however, is insisting on preserving the status of  its National Bank while significantly curbing its functions.    It seems that the current status of talks on the unification  of the two countries' monetary systems offers opportunities to  seek a compromise in solving the aforementioned problems. In  particular, the adoption of Belorussia's proposal to exchange  the population's savings at a rate of one to one could be quite  painless from the point of view of consequences for Russia's  economy. The sum total of the monetary accumulations of this  republic's population converted in its entirety into Russian  rubles represents a quantity which is not significant enough to  substantially affect the unified system's total amount of money  in circulation. Moreover, this option for exchanging the  population's savings provides for the freezing of deposits  throughout the period of exchanging bank notes.    As for equalizing prices for reciprocal deliveries of  products and abolishing export duties, then here, obviously, we  ought to proceed from the premise that monetary union is the  highest stage of economic integration. It must, undoubtedly, be  preceded by the creation of a customs union with the abolition  of reciprocal duties and nontariff restrictions, a common market  with the abolition of obstacles to the movement of goods,  capital, and labor, and an economic union involving, in addition  to everything listed above, a high degree of coordination in  economic policy. Only when these stages of integration have  been traversed will it be possible to talk about creating a  monetary union. In this connection, the Russian side's  unwillingness to opt for the complete abolition of duties for  imported goods means a restriction on implementing the first  stage of integration -- the creation of a customs union.    Furthermore, the Russian side is taking into account of  current losses from deliveries of fuel at domestic prices, while  taking no account of the possible gain (and not only economic  gain) in the long term. And even the Belorussian side's  arguments, substantiating compensation for lost profits, should  be taken into account. After all, in the event of failure to  sign the agreement on monetary union, Russia will have to set up  a real border with Belorussia and a corresponding infrastructure  in order to ensure effectively protect its economic interests.  Apart from all else, Belorussia may introduce stringent customs  duties for the transit of Russian cargoes across its territory,  as well as demanding compensation for expenditure on the upkeep  of Russian military facilities. All this together is quite  comparable with that which Russia is losing on deliveries to  Belorussia of energy sources at domestic prices.    But the fate of the agreement in question depends on how far  the sides are ready to go toward mutual concessions. What that  agreement may give to both sides, and not only in the economic  sense, has already been discussed on many occasions. But  unfortunately, it seems that in this issue, as in all the  economic processes under way in the CIS, it is not economic  expediency which prevails when implementing specific actions,  but political considerations. [Shirobokova ends]  <H5>  ...And Meanwhile </H5>   The results of the latest stage in the talks on the  unification of the monetary systems have been perceived  ambiguously in Belorussia. National Bank Chairman S.  Bogdankevich, for instance, stated: "I have no more illusions.  It must be admitted that the 8 September treaty is not viable,  it has not been accepted by the Russian side."    Some of the republic's political forces have also been quick  to exploit this for their propoganda ends. Thus, a statement by  the Belorussian Association of Servicemen, recently abolished by  decision of the Supreme Court but re-created in the form of an  organizational council, sharply criticized the government for  its desire to unify the monetary systems of Belorussia and  Russia. And it issued an unequivocal warning: "We know the  names of those who are campaigning to destroy the political  autonomy of Belorussia, and we consider it our moral duty to  warn these people."    Nevertheless, the republic leaders' views on the unification  of the monetary systems have not altered. And this, obviously,  is primarily attributable to the state of the economy.  According to data from the Belorussian State Committee for  Statistics, its national income in the first two months of this  year, compared with January-February last year, fell by 33  percent. The volume of industrial output stood at 63.5 percent.  Reciprocal indebtedness rose significantly, and large stocks of  unsold products have built up. As of 1 March, Belorussian  enterprises had stock surpluses worth R2.114 billion. Some 88.9  percent of all outstanding debts comprised debts to Russian  enterprises.    This is why Belorussian Parliament Head Mechyslaw Hryb  expressed concern regarding the prevailing situation since,  pending the forthcoming unification, enterprises are standing  still and trade is paralyzed. "It is neither to our advantage  nor to that of Russia to prolong this issue further. If we  cannot work things out, this means that it is necessary to  elaborate a new content of the bilateral agreement, a  large-scale treaty between the two states," Mechyslaw Hryb  stated. In his words, the Supreme Soviet Presidium has already  resolved this question: A commission has been set up under the  leadership of Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman Vyacheslav  Kuznetsov, which will work out a new agreement.    Vyachaslaw Kebich, head of the Belorussian Government, also  believes that the final documents will be signed in the  interests of both states. He stressed that he sees the aim of  his life as being the actual integration of the economy of two  peoples, close in spirit and culture, and in mode of thinking,  who want to be together.</p>

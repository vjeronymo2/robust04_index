			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / EC research funding in dispute A MAJORITY of European Community member states yesterday rallied behind proposals to spend Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10.1bn) on EC research and development programmes over the next five years. But ministers from the EC's biggest paymasters - Germany, Britain and France  -said they could not agree with the European Commission's proposal for funding of the 1994-98 'framework' programme. All three believe Ecu13.1bn is too much. France is said to favour Ecu11bn or Ecu12bn over five years, while Britain and Germany have not yet put forward a figure. The debate was expected to go on as research ministers tried to reach an initial consensus on the cost and content of the programme, which still has to be discussed by the European Parliament. National officials said they expected ministerial discussions on the content of the framework programme to be even more difficult than agreement on the budget. Yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg was the first in what could be a particularly gruelling series of ministerial meetings, parliamentary debates and consultations about the fourth framework programme. The proposal requires unanimous approval of member states. If the European Parliament disagrees with ministers, the plan could also become subject to the new and complex conciliation procedure between council and Parliament, laid out in the Maastricht treaty. That could draw out the legislative process for more than a year. An EC compromise proposal could help speed agreement on a 50-nation east-west treaty aimed at encouraging energy investment in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Talks on the treaty, which will put the aims of the 1991 European energy charter into action, have reached 'a decisive stage', according to organisers of the international negotiations, and agreement may be reached 'early next year'. Reporting on last week's round of talks, Mr Charles Rutten, chairman of the energy charter conference, said a number of controversial issues such as transit rights and disputes settlement procedure had already been settled.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea oil prices steady on Opec hopes NORTH SEA Brent oil prices firmed yesterday after adding more than Dollars 1 a dollar a barrel late last week in response to US proposals for an oil import tax. However, the price of North Sea Brent crude for March delivery slipped back towards the close of the market to end barely changed from Friday. Traders expressed the belief that the US proposals for an import tax, even if they came to nothing, could galvanise the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to take action to support oil prices. Indeed, initial steps by Mr Alirio Parra, Opec president, to secure agreement for a cut of around 1m barrels a day in Opec output for the second quarter seems to have formed a consensus. Nigeria indicated yesterday it would cut its production from its current output level which it says is 2.4m b/d. Overall Opec output remained high in January at 25.05m b/d according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the trade publication, compared with the organisation's ceiling of 24.58m b/d. Market traders believe Opec could have problems making its next deal stick since members have signally failed to abide by the current programme of cuts. 'There is no doubting their seriousness over a production cut, but will they follow through and will it be 1m barrels?' said Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York. Nevertheless, hopes for a production cut by Opec members should support crude prices in the run-up to the next meeting on February 13. There is some doubt about whether refined product prices in Europe will benefit from any action by Opec as much as crude prices. Cambridge Energy Research Associates points to high product stocks, low demand and mild weather which have depressed prices. Algeria's state oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed a Dollars 45m exploration agreement in Algiers at the weekend, Francis Ghiles reports. The agreement covers five blocks around Sour El Ghozlane, 100 miles south of Algiers, a region where oil was first exploited 50 years ago but where virtually no exploration has been conducted recently. The agreement also allows for the joint exploitation and marketing of gas.</p>

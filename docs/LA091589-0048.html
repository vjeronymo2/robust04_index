			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY REBUFFS E. GERMANY ON EMIGRES  </P> <P> As strained relations between the two nations continued Thursday, Hungary  issued an unapologetic reply to East Germany's protest over its decision to  allow thousands of East German citizens to emigrate to the West.  </P> <P> The formal response to the East German protest came in a stiff but carefully  argued letter presented to the East German ambassador at the Hungarian Foreign  Ministry here Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> The letter repeated the Hungarian assertion that the problem over the East  German refugees ultimately must be settled in negotiations between East and  West Germany. It added that Hungary will stand firm in its decision to keep its  borders open, at least temporarily, to East Germans who want to emigrate to the  West.  </P> <P> Most significantly, however, the Hungarians cited their agreement to the final  document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed in  Vienna in January, as the basis for the decision to open the borders.  </P> <P> By citing that agreement, which was also signed by East Germany, the Hungarians  were asserting that their commitment to international agreements has taken  priority over bilateral treaties with their socialist neighbors.  </P> <P> Since the Hungarian government gave the green light at midnight Sunday, at  least 12,000 East Germans have crossed into Austria and on to West Germany.  </P> <P> After nearly 10,000 made the trek, by car and bus, in the first 24 hours, the  flow of immigrants slackened considerably, but as many as 100 people per hour  were reported crossing at one Austrian border post Thursday.  </P> <P> The Hungarian Interior Ministry estimates that there are still about 60,000  East Germans in Hungary, a popular summer holiday destination for East Germans.  However, ministry spokesmen say they have no idea how many of those might be  intending to go to the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hundreds Gather  </P> <P> About 250 to 300 East Germans, most of them young and many of them carrying  bulging backpacks and duffel bags, were gathered Thursday at the center run by  the Maltese Cross humanitarian service at the Holy Family Church in the Buda  hills. Wolfgang Wagner, director of the operation, said 150 were expected to  leave by bus for the border later in the day.  </P> <P> "They have been coming at the rate of between 250 and 300 a day for the last  two days," Wagner said. "We are not sure how much longer it will go on, but the  number seems steady."  </P> <P> The exodus was prompted, in part, by Hungary's decision in May to begin  dismantling barriers on its western border with Austria.  </P> <P> The letter to the East German government made it clear that Hungary's solution  to the East German refugee problem was taken reluctantly and only after it  urged both Germanys to come to an agreement.  </P> <P> "This had become a serious problem for the Hungarian nation, and it had to be  solved," the letter said.  </P> <P> The Hungarians stressed that their decision is temporary but added that "since  the decision was taken, the problem has not been alleviated, and therefore the  Hungarian government will continue to act according to its decision."  </P> <P> The East Germans protested Tuesday that Hungary abrogated a 1969 agreement that  obligated both sides to return to their country of origin any citizens  attempting to escape to the West.  </P> <P> The Hungarians countered, in the Foreign Ministry's letter Thursday, by  adopting the principle that the accords signed in Vienna in January take  precedence over the 1969 treaty.  </P> <P> Hungarian diplomatic sources said Thursday that they were aware, when the  decision was taken in May to remove travel restrictions, that the problem with  East Germany would soon follow.  </P> <P> But the decision, they indicated, was a carefully calculated move aimed at  distancing the country from its hard-line Communist commitments of the past and  pressing its opening to the West.  </P></p>

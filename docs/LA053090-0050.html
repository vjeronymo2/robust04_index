			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA DIVISION II BASEBALL;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE GETS 26 HITS IN BEATING NEW HAVEN  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge's record for most hits in an NCAA Division II World Series  game didn't last very long.  </P> <P> The Matadors established a record with 23 hits in their opener on Sunday and  had 26 more Tuesday night in beating New Haven, 18-5, in a second-round game.  </P> <P> The victory moved Northridge to within two games of a championship.  </P> <P> Northridge and Jacksonville (Ala.) State are the only undefeated teams left in  what was an eight-team field. Four teams each have one loss.  </P> <P> The University of New Haven and Lewis College will play today for the right to  meet Northridge Thursday. Should Northridge (38-21) win that game -- it has  already defeated each team by identical scores -- it would move into the  championship game on Saturday at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Jacksonville is in a similar position in the other bracket. The  Gamecocks defeated Tampa, 10-8, in Tuesday's early game.  </P> <P> Mike Sims, Northridge's freshman catcher, had five hits, a career-high.  </P> <P> Craig Clayton and Mike Solar each had four hits, two of Solar's being home  runs. He has three homers in the two Northridge World Series Games.  </P> <P> Denny Vigo and Kyle Washington had three hits each. MIKE HISERMAN  </P></p>

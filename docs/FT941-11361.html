			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / 'Lift-off' - but still not firing on every engine: A bumpy ride for leisure A January leisure sector publication from stockbrokers Smith New Court carried the exultant headline 'We have lift-off'. Consumer spending was on an upward trend. The hotel and leisure sector was set to benefit, the publication said. That was January last year. In the event, hotel and leisure companies had a solid but uninspiring 1993, with the sector's shares tracking the FT-SE-A All Share index for most of the year. Mr Bruce Jones, a Smith New Court analyst, says his firm could have reprinted last year's publication at the beginning of 1994. The same optimistic noises are being heard. This time, however, many believe the recovery is for real. The basis of this optimism is difficult to detect. Overseas holiday bookings are undoubtedly strong, but the trend in many domestic leisure pursuits appears less cheerful. There are examples of more consumers going out to spend money on leisure activities, but, in many cases, the amount each spends is not going up. In other leisure businesses, spending per head has increased, but the number of customers has not. April's tax increases could reduce leisure spending further, ending the optimistic view that this will be the year when leisure companies put memories of the recession firmly behind them. The sector's shares have outperformed the market by a clear margin since the beginning of the year. Ladbroke, First Leisure, Rank, Airtours and Owners Abroad have all registered impressive share price increases. Yet the first round of leisure company results and trading statements has provided many examples of consumers' reluctance to spend large sums on their entertainment. First Leisure, the discotheques, bowling and tourist attractions group, last month announced pre-tax profits up 2.3 per cent to Pounds 31.8m on turnover up 12.3 per cent to Pounds 121.8m. While discotheque admissions were up 14 per cent, the group has not felt able to raise admission prices. Spending per head in the group's bowling business actually fell, while the number of games played remained stable. The Rank Organisation, whose leisure businesses include bingo, casinos and Butlin's holiday camps, last month announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 276.6m for the year to October 31, compared with a restated Pounds 125.8m the previous year. Despite the profits increase, Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, presented a similar story of cautious leisure consumers. While admissions to Odeon cinemas rose 10 per cent, largely boosted by the film Jurassic Park, strong price competition meant that Rank could not increase the price of tickets. Rank's UK nightclubs recorded a 13 per cent increase in admissions, but spending per head remained static. There were parts of Rank's business which attracted consumers who were willing to splash out a little. Spending per head at the group's social and bingo clubs increased by 6 per cent. At Rank's casinos, spending per head rose 4 per cent. But admission numbers were static in both businesses. Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, said last month that London hotel occupancies were healthy, but that average rates paid had been slow to recover. There were some signs of improvement. Stakis, the hotels and casino group, and Stanley Leisure, the betting shops and casino chain, announced big profits increases. And Mr Gifford of Rank said consumer spending in the UK and the US did now appear to be increasing. But for unbridled optimism in the leisure sector, one has to turn to the package holiday business. Airtours, the travel group appears to be in fine shape. Last December it announced full year pre-tax profits up 24.6 per cent to Pounds 45.5m, while bookings for this summer are up 56 per cent. Many consumers seem to regard a holiday in the sun as a necessity, particularly after last year's poor UK summer. They seem far more cautious about spending on other activities. Mr Jones of Smith New Court says he thinks rising consumer expenditure will spill over into the leisure sector this year. But Mr Mark Finnie, an analyst at NatWest Securities, feels that much of the current optimism surrounding the sector has been overdone. In the case of Ladbroke, whose interests include betting shops and the Hilton International hotel chain, the shares have been boosted by senior management changes. Outside the holiday sector, much of the enthusiasm for leisure shares appears to be based on the view that business has been bad for so long it is bound to get better. There is another possibility: that recession has bred consumers determined not to overspend and who will refuse to pay higher hotel rates or buy more expensive cinema tickets even in times of prosperity. But for many buyers of leisure shares, it is clearly too early in the year to be that gloomy.</p>

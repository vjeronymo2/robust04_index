			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Westport tumbles to Pounds 448,000 deficit Losses of Pounds 448,000 pre-tax were announced by Westport Group, the USM-quoted exhibition, photographic services and marketing specialist, for the year to April 30. Last time there were profits of Pounds 8,000. There were operating losses from continuing activities of Pounds 187,000 (Pounds 21,000 profits) on turnover of Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15m). Mr Ralph Kanter, chairman, said the group's success with T&amp;S Lightbox and Stanco had shown what could be achieved in spite of difficult market conditions, and he expected those companies to continue to do well in 1994-95. However, organic growth had been held back by losses in Fox Display and Studios, he said. Losses per share emerged at 0.4p (0.1p earnings).</p>

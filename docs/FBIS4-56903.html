			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement to the press on the night of 9 May,  Senator Bernard Sansaricq announced that the president of the  Court of Cassation, attorney Emile Jonassaint, is allegedly  ready to be installed as president of Haiti. Incidentally, the  Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and the legislators elected  on 18 January 1993 are preparing to install Jonassaint as  president of Haiti on 11 May. We will have further explanations  regarding this statement -- made very late last night by Senator  Sansaricq -- during the newscast.</p>

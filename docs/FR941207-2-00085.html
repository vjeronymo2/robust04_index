			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In June of 1994, the CHX submitted a letter to the Commission responding to the NYSE's first comment letter. <FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>  The CHX states that the NYSE requests that the Commission disapprove the Chicago Match because it is different from floor based trading systems existing on traditional exchanges. The CHX believes that this fact alone should not warrant Commission disapproval of the Chicago Match. The CHX states that, to the contrary, the ``National Market System envisions the emergence of different trading vehicles and systems in response to market developments.'' <FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from George T. Simon, Foley &amp; Lardner, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated June 7, 1994. The CHX also amended its filing, and submitted a second letter giving greater detail about the institutional access issue. Letter from George T. Simon, Foley &amp; Lardner, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, SEC, dated July 25, 1994. The substance of this second letter is incorporated into the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> section,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at 1. the CHX also points out that all other national securities exchanges were invited to participate in the Chicago Match but none requested to participate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CHX asserts that the Chicago Match is not a hidden market but is designed to bring together buying and selling interest on traditional exchanges with institutional trading interest that has preferred to do business on a more anonymous basis. The CHX also asserts that, unlike a PTS, the Chicago Match is a part of a registered securities exchange and, therefore, is subject to full Commission regulation, and unlike a PTS, the Chicago Match is integrated with the CHX trading floor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CHX disputes assertions that the Chicago Match actually sponsors hidden quotations that must be disseminated through CQS. The CHX asserts that buying and selling interest in the Chicago Match does not constitute bids or offers within the meaning of the Firm Quote Rule. The CHX states that in order to constitute a bid or offer within the purview of the Firm Quote Rule, an order must be disseminated at a specific price. The CHX states that none of the indications in the Chicago Match are at a specific price; rather the execution price is a function of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at the randomly selected execution time. As such, the indications are not required to be disseminated pursuant to the Firm Quote Rule. The CHX asserts that, similarly, the CQS facilities that were designed by the NYSE are incapable of processing indications without prices. Thus, even if CQS wanted to disseminate Chicago Match indications, it could not do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CHX response letter states that, without resolving the issue of whether liquidity fees are a part of the execution price or not, these fees are reported in cents and thus not reportable on the Consolidated Tape. <FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>  This point, however, has been largely addressed because, as previously noted, the CHX has finalized its tape reporting process to include reporting of an average weight of liquidity fees. The cross price plus or minus the average liquidity fee or liquidity credit for each stock stated in up to 1/256ths will be reported to the Consolidated Tape or Nasdaq. In addition, the maximum liquidity fee or liquidity credit is limited to 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time, regardless of the size of the spread. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The CHX response letter stated that it amended its rules to require liquidity fees to be reported as administrative messages on the Consolidated Tape. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CHX amended its proposal to address the NYSE's concern that trades executed in the Chicago Match could trade through another market's published quotations if liquidity fees are deemed to be a part of the price. The amendment will change the cross price of the match to the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer regardless of the size of the spread and limit the maximum size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits. If a liquidity fee is greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time, it will be reduced to 1/2 of the spread at cross time. The Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be received in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. The CHX states that these changes will eliminate the possibility of trading through another market's published quotations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CHX states that it disagrees with the NYSE's assertions that the Chicago Match's plan to permit paired orders will violate Section 12 of the Act. The CHX further states that, while it disagrees with the NYSE's view on this, it has filed amendments to its rules to preclude orders from being entered in securities not traded on the CHX. <FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3 would amend Rule 3 to provide that only exchange contracts in securities that are listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the Exchange may be entered into the Chicago Match. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the CHX disagrees with the NYSE's concern that short sale orders will be displayed through the system and thereby influence the market. The CHX states that short sale orders are currently displayed on every market whenever a short sale offer is the best offer in the market. The CHX further states that the Short Sale Rule has never prohibited the dissemination of quotations reflecting offers to sell short. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CHX also disputes the NYSE's general argument that short sales through the Chicago Match should be prohibited. The CHX states that the Chicago Match is a passive trading system that is derivatively priced. As such, trades executed through the system cannot impact the market by exerting downward pressure on prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful consideration of the comments received, as well as applicable statutory provisions, the Commission believes that the proposed Chicago Match is consistent with the Act, and in particular, Sections 6(b)(4), 6(b)(5), and 11A of the Act. Separately, the Division of Market Regulation has granted the CHX exemptions for the Chicago Match from the Short Sale Rule, the Firm Quote Rule, and Rule 11Ac3&hyph;3. <FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exemptive Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 38. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

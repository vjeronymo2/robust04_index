			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery </F> by Gerard Leclerc --live]    [Excerpts] [Leclerc] [passage omitted] We'll start with  the summit of the seven industrialized countries on employment,  the first of its kind. [passage omitted]    France has defended the idea of a social clause; in other  words, commercial agreements should be made conditional on  industrializing countries respecting a certain number of social  rules to avoid social dumping. France has not received a great  deal of support. Britain in particular does not want to hear of  any such thing.    [Alphandery] Oh yes, we did get support. You know we are  putting forward arguments to prevent unfair competition.  [passage omitted] We found support. The Italians accepted these  ideas, so did the Canadians. We made a trial run, I would say,  and we shall repeat the same plea in Marrakesh in the framework  of the GATT agreement. I hope the case will go in the right  direction -- at the very least, human rights should be respected  in international economic affairs. [passage omitted]    [Leclerc] A decisive factor for the domestic economy would  be a lowering of interest rates. For the moment, since the Bank  of France became independent, there has been practically no  lowering -- (?0.6) percent. Aren't you a little disappointed?  Couldn't more have been done?    [Alphandery] No. You know, you have to put all this in  perspective. Interest rates have gone down a great deal in  France in the past year. They have gone down by about 40  percent for short-term rates.    [Leclerc] But they're not going down any more?    [Alphandery] No, no. They are continuing to go down. They  went down -- the daily rates have gone down twice. So the  downward movement has not been interrupted. So that's the first  point. Then you mustn't forget that we have to take into  account a stable monetary environment in Europe. What is very  important if there is to be a lowering of rates, is that  currencies and parities should be relatively stable in the  European environment. Given this context I am quite hopeful  that there will be new margins for maneuver in Europe as a whole  in the next few months to bring down rates. Of course the Bank  of France is independent. It is the bank that makes the  decisions. I myself am quite optimistic about its abilities to  continue to bring down interest rates tomorrow, or in the next  few months. [passage omitted]</p>

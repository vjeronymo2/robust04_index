			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Scrapyard to splendour - The V&amp;A's new Ironwork Gallery The Victoria &amp; Albert's unparalleled ironwork collection is housed in one of the oddest spaces in any museum. Spanning the entire 220m width of the building at first-floor level and at times less than five metres wide, it is more flyover than gallery, top lit by glass domes and pierced by light wells affording unexpected bird's-eye-views of the galleries below. Two years ago the space was closed for essential repairs to the roof. Yesterday, the re-displayed Ironwork Gallery re-opened to reveal what is one of the most visually stimulating galleries the museum has to offer - at least in part. Funding has only been available for the first phase of the project, and none forthcoming for an accompanying catalogue. Indeed no publication on this extraordinary collection is currently in print. As if to emphasise the lack of cash, the display ends abruptly with a stencil representation of the massive screen designed by George Gilbert Scott for Hereford Cathedral. This tour-de-force of Gothic Revival metalwork still languishes in store awaiting a sponsor for its restoration. The sole elements in place over the stencil, like 3D jigsaw pieces, are the 'terracotta' figures of Christ and a Choir of Angels ingeniously manufactured out of electroformed copper. Dismantled and removed from the cathedral in 1967, the Hereford screen is also eloquent witness to the metalwork department's enterprise in architectural salvage on a monumental scale. Many of its treasures are here as a result of church and state's cavalier disregard for its heritage - from the 13th-century wrought-iron grilles from Chichester Cathedral rescued from a scrap-metal merchant in 1896, to an Art Nouveau fireplace designed around 1904 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and pulled out of the Willow Street Tea Rooms in Glasgow before they were demolished. A 12th-century wooden chest ornamented and protected by elaborate S-scrolling iron hinges and latchwork came from the derelict St Albans Abbey; the 17th-century polychrome chandelier rods on display once adorned Wren's St Michael Queenhithe, demolished in 1876. Garden gates stand as a solitary survivor of Robert Adam's Lansdowne House in Berkeley Square; the elegant neo-Classical lampholder a poignant reminder of one of the London's most tragic losses, the Adams' Adelphi buildings off the Strand. This sad litany continues with the disembodied balconies, balusters and grilles from France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Most of the collection, of predominantly wrought rather than cast iron from 1600-1800, was acquired by the museum 1860-1930, often through the agency of passionate preservationists. Perhaps the unlikeliest Albert Steptoe of all was the pioneering Lady Dorothy Nevill, who saw her mission as relieving workers' cottages on the Weald of their 16th-century decorative cast-iron firebacks and presenting them to the nation in 1914. The museum's mission was, of course, to improve modern design and manufactures by exhibiting the finest examples of the arts of the past and present. In this sense the V&amp;A itself was - and is - an exhibit. On show, for instance, is one of the ropework cast-iron radiator panels with their curious hermaphroditic friezes designed by Alfred Stevens for the museum around 1862. The department's most recent commission, a steel bench by the American artist Albert Paley, is due to arrive in late October. James Horrobin's impressive hammered gates to the gallery of 1981 are evidence of the relatively recent flowering of contemporary blacksmithing in Britain, a phenomenon that makes the abysmal design and poor execution of the new Queen Elizabeth Gates in Hyde Park as bewildering as they are a wasted opportunity. Their only saving grace is as a reminder that decorative ironwork was traditionally painted and gilt; black was late Victorian convention. It is, however, the stark contrast of the black, calligraphic lines of wrought iron imaginatively set against white walls that provides the gallery with its immediate drama. Its eclectic collections of smaller ironwork warrant closer inspection: fiendishly complex medieval and renaissance locks and keys take their place alongside gleaming 16th-century Venetian gondola prows, the dull, delicate filigree of Berlin iron jewellery and jolly turn-of-the-century biscuit tins. Black-stained wooden display cases are re-used from the old Glass Gallery, the first of the V&amp;A's 'materials and techniques' galleries to be re-displayed. These, plus the gimmick-free simplicity of the new installation, are virtues born of necessity.</p>

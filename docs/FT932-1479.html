			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central Americans to discuss coffee cartel A PROPOSED coffee producers' cartel is the main item on the agenda of a meeting of Central American officials today and tomorrow in Managua, Nicaragua. Producer countries have been debating the idea ever since the collapse earlier this year of talks aimed at revitalising the International Coffee Agreement between producers and consumers. The concept of a producers' association to regulate stocks and try to boost international prices is supported by Brazil, the world's leading coffee exporter, responsible for about 30 per cent of total exports. It also has the backing of the other big Latin American and African producers, says Mr Gilson Ximenes, director of the national coffee department of the Brazilian ministry of industry and commerce. Brazil has decided not to attend today's gathering. Instead, Mr Jose Andrade Eduardo Vieira, industry and commerce minister, will attend a meeting of Latin American producers in early July, also to be held in a Central American country, possibly Costa Rica. Mr Ximenes says it would be premature to outline details of how the proposed association would try to control stocks. However, the Brazilian private sector is defending a sliding scale scheme under which producers would automatically withhold more coffee as prices dropped. Under the scheme, all producer countries would withhold 25 per cent of output when the international price hit 60 US cents a lb. The amount retained would gradually decrease as the price increased to 80 cents a lb, when controls would be lifted. At present the price is hovering just above the 60 cents-a-lb mark. Mr Ximenes says he does not 'discard' the Brazilian private sector proposal. Given the present low prices, most countries are already reducing exports, according to Mr Manoel Vicente Fernandes Bertone, president of the National Coffee Council, a private Brazilian producers association. 'All countries have reached the maximum limit of exhaustion,' he says, adding that only Vietnam, Indonesia and India are maintaining previous levels of production. Brazil, for instance, shipped just 4.6m bags (60 kg each) during the first five months of this year, compared with 7.6m bags in the corresponding period of 1992. May shipments were stalled by a strike of federal tax inspectors, but exports had been down in each of the first four months.</p>

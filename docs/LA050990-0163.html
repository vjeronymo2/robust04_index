			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FLIGHT ATTENDANTS CITE HAZARDS  </P> <P> Flight attendants are asking federal authorities to give them more protection  against the day-to-day hazards of working on airliners.  </P> <P> Cosmic radiation, air pollution, jet engine noise, tobacco smoke, long working  hours and unwieldy beverage carts all pose hazards to airliner crews, the Assn.  of Flight Attendants said in a formal petition.  </P> <P> The 30,000-member union asked the Federal Aviation Administration to adopt the  same standards that protect most other workers under the Occupational Safety  and Health Act.  </P> <P> "They really only care about our safety when it comes to keeping us alive in a  crash so the passengers can be evacuated," said Matthew Finucane, the union's  director of air safety and health.  </P></p>

It said small  business telephone systems and some components were being sold at far less than  fair value.  </P> <P> It began assessing temporary anti-dumping duties in July and those would be  made permanent if the International Trade Commission, a U.S. agency, issues a  final ruling that the dumping was injuring American firms that make similar  equipment.  </P> <P> The ITC, an independent agency that monitors adherence to U.S. trade law, has  45 days to act.  </P> <P> It ruled provisionally last February that U.S. companies were in danger of  being injured by the imports.  </P> <P> The ITC and the Commerce Department acted on a complaint by American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial Corp. of Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> South Korean firms were included in the complaint, but one of them requested an  extention and as a matter of routine was granted a delay, to Dec. 18, a  department official said.  </P> <P> The department said imports of the equipment in 1988 totaled $776 million from  Japan, $342 million from Taiwan and $227 million from South Korea.  </P></p>

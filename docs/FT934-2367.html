			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Minister details Elf golden share plan Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday gave details of the golden share to be retained in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is due to be privatised early next year. According to Mr Alphandery, the terms of the golden share will require government approval for other investors, either acting individually or in concert, to raise their shareholdings in Elf above the limits of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 33.3 per cent. The golden share, which will be of unlimited duration, will also give the French government a veto over asset sales if it feels they threaten the national interest. This veto will apply to asset sales in Elf Aquitaine Production, Elf Antar France, Elf Congo and Elf Gabon, an official said. In addition to the golden share, the French government will retain a holding of between 10 and 15 per cent in Elf through Erap, the state holding company, which currently controls 50.8 per cent of the oil group's shares. The precise level will be set at the time of privatisation, which Mr Alphandery said would take place in the first few months of next year. Mr Alphandery said that the measures would 'assure the protection of national interests' following Elf's privatisation. 'With the golden share on the one hand and the state's stake on the other, we have found the right balance,' he said. Oil industry analysts said yesterday's announcement reflected the sensitivity of the privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, France's largest industrial group. 'The golden share is no surprise,' said one analyst, 'but the government is clearly retaining a maximum of control under the terms of the privatisation law.' The sale of the stake in Elf Aquitaine will be the first privatisation to take place next year. It will be the largest so far in the government's programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups.</p>

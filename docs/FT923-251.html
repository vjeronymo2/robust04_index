Cleveland has also won contracts worth Pounds 4.7m to supply, fabricate and deliver 11 crane structures to Morris Mechanical Handling at Loughborough. The contracts involve a total of 3,500 tonnes of steel. Work has commenced on the fabrication of five ship to shore cranes for the ports of Southampton and Waterford in Ireland. When completed and installed the wide-based cranes will be used to move containers. Six rail-mounted gantry cranes are being fabricated for railhead depots in London and the Midlands. Two of these will be of the lattice type. All of the cranes will be delivered by the end of May next year. Overseas, Cleveland has won a Pounds 2.6m joint venture contract with Octavius Atkinson to supply and deliver structural bridgework over an underpass in Saudi Arabia.

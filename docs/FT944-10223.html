			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance at Pounds 311m despite premium income drop Total premium income at Royal Insurance fell to Pounds 3.56bn in the first nine months of this year, compared with Pounds 3.76bn. Royal said, however, that the drop largely reflected a planned reduction in its reinsurance operation, writes Ralph Atkins. The amount of personal motor premiums written fell by 5 per cent in the nine months to Pounds 239m. Within that total, Royal said The Insurance Service, its direct-selling operation, was taking an increasing share of business. The group's pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 113m to Pounds 311m. The UK-based life operation achieved a 5 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 39m, but the overseas life operations dropped by Pounds 2m. Overall UK operating profits jumped to Pounds 276m against Pounds 79m, helped by good weather conditions and fewer claims. Royal's chain of 481 estate agents made an increased loss of Pounds 11m against Pounds 7m, partly from refurbishment costs. US operations also lost money, not helped by a high level of weather and catastrophe-related claims. But Royal expressed confidence in a recovery ahead, noting that the second and third quarters had seen some improvement in underwriting results compared with a year earlier. Adding to the spread of its business, Royal said it had struck commercial agreements with German and Scandinavian insurance companies which had increased its access to markets in those countries. The group's capital and reserves decreased to Pounds 1.94bn at September 30, compared with Pounds 2.2bn at the end of 1993 as a result of falls in world equity and bond markets. Total investment income fell to Pounds 359m from Pounds 380m owing to the effect of lower interest rates and the move in asset allocation towards equities.</p>

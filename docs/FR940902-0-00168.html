Allowances for job search outside the commuting area shall be an allowable activity under CAETA, only where it has been determined that the dislocated worker cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment within the commuting area in which the worker resides. Procedures for determining whether a dislocated worker cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment within the commuting area in which the dislocated worker resides shall be described in the grant application and shall be subject to approval by the Grant Officer. The cost of job search outside the commuting area shall be an allowable cost, but shall not provide for more than 90 percent of the cost of necessary job search expenses, and may not exceed a total of $800, unless the need for a greater amount is justified in the grant application and approved by the Grant Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relocation Allowances under CAETA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Relocation allowances under CAETA shall be allowable only where the eligible dislocated worker cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment in the commuting area in which the worker resides and has obtained suitable employment affording a reasonable expectation of long-term duration in the area in which the worker wishes to relocate, or has obtained a bona fide offer of such employment, provided that the worker is totally separated from employment at the time relocation commences. The cost of relocation for an eligible dislocated worker shall not exceed an amount which is equal to the sum of the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in transporting the dislocated worker and the dislocated worker's family, if any, and household effects, and a lump sum relocation allowance, equivalent to three times such worker's average weekly wage. The maximum relocation allowance, however, shall not exceed $800, unless a greater amount is justified in the grant application and approved by the Grant Officer. Necessary expenses shall be travel expenses for the dislocated worker and the dislocated worker's family and for the transfer of household effects. Reasonable costs for such travel and transfer expenses shall be by the least expensive, most reasonable form of transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Needs-related payments under CAETA and DDP <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman has  expressed concern over the report that India is once again  inducting additional troops in occupied Kashmir. He said it is  evident that while talking about dialogue, Indian authorities  are intent to repress by force the legitimate struggle of  Kashmiri people.    The spokesman expressed the hope that the Muslim ambassadors  visiting Indian-held Kashmir would report an objective  evaluation of the situation to their respective governments and  ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] secretary general, so that  the Muslim world would have better knowledge of the atrocities  being perpetrated by the Indian forces in the held valley. The  spokesman hoped that the ambassadors will be allowed free access  to visit all parts of the held valley, including the sites of  recent massacres in Sopor and Bijbiara, and to meet the Kashmiri  leaders, including those under detention. However, the  spokesman said according to our information, unfortunately, it  appears that once again this visit will be a conducted tour.</p>

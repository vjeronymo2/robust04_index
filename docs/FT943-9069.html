			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Respectable return on use of consultants Sir, I read with interest the letter from Barry Reamsbottom (August 9), who, I fear, has misunderstood both the Efficiency Unit scrutiny report on external consultants and the recent white paper on the civil service. The scrutiny reported that much of the work undertaken by external consultants was linked to the requirements of government programmes such as road planning/building, weapons systems design, etc, rather than simple cost-cutting exercises. Of the Pounds 12.2m direct savings identified in the report, the expenditure generating this figure was less than Pounds 3m (in itself a respectable return) and not the Pounds 508m total spend on external consultants. The 'market testing', or more correctly competing for quality, programme to which Mr Reamsbottom refers somewhat disparagingly is on course to have covered some Pounds 2bn worth of activities before the end of this year, with savings in the majority of cases of more than 20 per cent being achieved by the winning bids. This is true where an outside contractor has won or where the work has been won by an in-house team. Far from being discontinued, as Mr Reamsbottom suggests, the civil service white paper incorporates this technique for all departments to employ along with other efficiency measures that they are taking. The white paper makes clear that departments will continue to publish their intentions and report achievements against their commitments. The scrutiny on external consultants was not launched either to defend or castigate external consultants, but rather to show how government can improve its procedures when using them. This, I believe, it has done. The intention, as with market testing, is to ensure that the taxpayer's money is not wasted.

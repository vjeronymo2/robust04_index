			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / British Gas to lose household supply monopoly: Government clears the way for introduction of consumer choice by 1998 The government yesterday cleared the way for the introduction of full competition in gas supply to 18m households by 1998 but decided to allow British Gas to remain a single company. Independent suppliers, which have been clamouring for early entry into a market that was worth more than Pounds 5.6bn to British Gas last year, said competition could bring households average annual savings of Pounds 35-Pounds 40. Competition will also bring an end to the common national tariff. Ofgas, the industry regulator, says regional variations in gas prices are likely to be within 'a couple of percentage points'. Yesterday's announcement was made by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who rejected two central recommendations from a recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry. The MMC had called for the divestment by 1997 of British Gas's transportation business from its trading division. It also recommended delaying the abolition of British Gas's monopoly over the mainly household market until 2000 or beyond. But the government said the gas market should be opened up to full competition by 1998, when consumers will be able to choose between different suppliers of electricity. 'Choice for consumers is the best possible guarantee that they will obtain value for money,' said Mr Heseltine. Under the plan, 5 per cent of the market will be opened in 1996 and 1997 to ensure that the system is ready for full competition. Mr Heseltine said the complete separation of the transportation and trading arms of British Gas, as envisaged in the company's restructuring plan announced last week, was likely 'to overcome the obstacle to competition which the MMC identified'. British Gas yesterday welcomed both decisions, although Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, called on Ofgas to relax the financial regulation which has dampened the company's profitability since its privatisation in 1986. The timetable to abolish the monopoly was welcomed by independent suppliers. Some, however, were less enthusiastic about British Gas remaining intact. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director, said she reserved the right to call for divestment 'if there was any sign of accounting or cultural fiddling' between the separated business units. The Gas Consumers Association described the government plan as a 'masterly compromise between the evolution or revolution' of the domestic gas market. But Mr Ian Powe, its director, said Ms Spottiswoode was likely to come under pressure to ensure that the new gas suppliers served all customers within a market, and not just the most profitable. She said an insurance scheme would have to be set up to ensure that customers were protected in the event of a supplier going out of business. Details of a new gas supply licence will be proposed early next year. Companies which want to enter the market will have to show financial strength and access to gas supplies. Ms Spottiswoode said she was determined that British Gas's national monopoly would not be replaced with regional energy monopolies, although she conceded that the regional electricity companies would be in a strong marketing position. British Gas shares closed yesterday at 347p, down 10p. Break-up ruled out Page 6 Editorial Comment Page 11 Lex Page 12</p>

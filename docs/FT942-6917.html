			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: EIS to acquire ABPH for Pounds 2.5m EIS Group, the specialist engineer, has agreed conditionally to acquire ABPH for an aggregate consideration of Pounds 2.5m, to be satisfied either in cash or in new EIS ordinary shares. ABPH designs and manufactures electronic and electro-mechanical products mainly for defence and postal automation uses. Investors holding about 98.29 per cent of the ABPH voting rights have accepted the offer and elected for the share alternative. The number of shares to be issued has been calculated on the basis of the closing price of 405p on May 23. Five acquisitions underpinned the EIS results for 1993, when pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 15.1m).</p>

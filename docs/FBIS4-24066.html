			<p>BFN     [Text] Operation Turquoise has started. French troops have  arrived in Goma in eastern Zaire, and Jaguars have landed in the  northeast, at Kisangani; but for the moment no troops have  crossed the border with Rwanda.    Several cargo planes are expected at 125 air base in Istres  in Bouches-du-Rhone: They are to load up with men and military  equipment bound for Bangui. Francois Lecazeau reports:    [Lecazeau] Three large Antonov cargo planes already landed  this morning at 125 air base in Istres in Bouches-du-Rhone.  They are to be joined by one or two more. During the day, they  will take on several tonnes of military equipment, and units  bound for the Rwandan border, including 80 troops from the  Mediterranean Air Region.    For the moment the authorities are being cagey about the  exact mission of these men. The planes are to take off at about  midday for Bangui, in the Central African Republic, and then for  Goma and Bukavu, on the border between Zaire and Rwanda, to join  the bulk of the troops of Operation Turquoise whose job is to  help the people of Rwanda.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: Maps For Lost Lovers THE National Youth Theatre (NYT), founded in 1956, is now a mature institution. Its alumni have contributed to the English stage as actors and technicians. To see an NYT show is to see one future in English theatre. Now at The Place Theatre, Euston, the NYT presents a devised 90-minute multi-media piece called Maps For Lost Lovers. It makes a refreshing change from usual London theatre fare. Maps For Lost Lovers offers a first opportunity to see these actors; it also suggests what theatrical material will look like within a decade. It most resembles the new forms of computer virtual reality and hypertext, where you choose what to see and how to see it. There are 14 actors in many roles, no plot, three stills projectors, two video projectors and a series of gaff-rigged screens (one per actor) which float in an ultra-violet twilight. The text (by director Dean Byfield) passes from one medium to another, now a voice, now an image, now a projected page. At the heart of the show lies the horror of loneliness and the pain of togetherness, repeated in open-armed yearning and fights between the ever shifting couples on stage. The action follows wishes and hopes transformed and compromised by the environment. Gestures and text repeat themselves: 'Will the one I love steal me a car with bullet holes down the side? Will it make me run down the street and use my voice again?' is first said, then projected, then represented. Sharp scenes emerge, including a wonderful exchange where a blindfolded actor instructs her partner to say those most and least personal words, 'I love you' proving they belong to everyone and no one: 'Say it like a surgeon. . . say it like you're angry.' Another fine scene has the cast in a frenzy of preening and primping at a nightclub, settling by force of custom into a uneasy embraces. The acting is sure-footed, the design and filming (Laura Hopkins, Caroline Rye) enlightening, and the ambient music (Andy Price) an aid to reflection. Since Gutenberg made everyone a reader and the photocopier made everyone a publisher, this form of multi-media 'hyper-theatre' makes everyone a director. The Place Theatre, London (071) 387 0031 Until September 5</p>

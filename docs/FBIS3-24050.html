			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kiva under rubric "At the Crossroads of </F> Opinions": "Amnesty: Pros and Cons"]    [Text] I tend to associate our stormy political life  simultaneously with American roller-coasters and Russian  swashbuckling horseback races. Here, as a rule, there are both  sudden sharp, nerve-tingling curves and people tumbling from the  saddle. Just a few days ago public attention zeroed in on the  President's State of the Nation message to the Federal Assembly.  Then, after barely having time to discuss it meaningfully, we,  voluntarily or involuntarily, switched our attention to the  development of the plot spawned by the amnesty. And now we are  suddenly faced with the fact of the precipitous release from  Lefortovo Prison of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan Khasbulatov,  Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov, and other  instigators of the bloody October events and Mayday clashes,  which also had casualties. Also absolved of punishment,  regardless of the court's decision, are the organizers of the  unsuccessful August coup. At the same time, Procurator-General  Aleksey Kazannik was relieved of his position, albeit ostensibly  at his own request.    But let us get away from emotions and make an effort to  comprehend all this, taking into account, among other things,  the subsequent "exposure" of the ex-procurator.    First, what actually happened? The Duma passed a decree in  full conformity with the Constitution, though one could, of  course, argue where amnesty ends and pardon begins and what,  actually, are the prerogatives of the Duma and the President.  But such a debate would surely be unproductive. What guided the  Duma, or more precisely, the majority of its members? As the  decree states, objectives of "national reconciliation,  achievement of civil peace and concord." We can assume that it  had other, or even entirely different, objectives. More  precisely, some deputies were really guided by the idea of  reconciliation, some were moved by revenge, some pursued their  personal or group political goals, including setting their  sights on the presidential election, some cherished the goal of  destabilizing the situation, and so on. So what? That is real  politics, the vector of which is the sum of the actions and  reactions of many interests.    It is another question how the Constitution could make such  a  sensitive, multidimensional problem as amnesty, moreover at such  a complex, transitional stage from one social system to another,  the sole prerogative of the Duma? But, Messrs. comrades, who is  to blame but those who drew up the draft Constitution and  introduced the final amendments to it? Tantrums should have been  thrown then; now it's too late. Or, perhaps, at the time people  had forgotten about Lefortovo?    Second. Every complex matter has its pros and cons. Let us  start with the latter. With the cons, for it is precisely they  that are now arousing public opinion. Of concern is precisely  what Kazannik spoke of in his resignation statement. It is  dangerous and immoral to set free people who are guilty of the  death and injuries of many people and of causing considerable  material damage. Yes, that is so. Evil must be punished, because  otherwise it tends to spread like a cancerous tumor.  Essentially, the bloody October events became possible only  because the organizers of the bloody May events had remained  unpunished, and before them, the organizers of the Ostankino  pogroms. The "implacable opposition" was quite openly preparing  for violent actions with virtually no significant opposition. On  the contrary, it was wholeheartedly supported by the former  Supreme Soviet and enjoyed its patronage, coupled with the fact  that the procurator's office and court mishandled things, and  even now we find that the Procurator-General, whose resignation  was swiftly accepted by the President, acted inappropriately.  Clearly, the amnesty was poorly handled. The procurator, for his  part, either did nothing or remained aloof and then acted too  hastily. Why? Another mystery. It is something of a conundrum:  By its very logic, amnesty presumes the guilt of the person to  whom it applies, whereas Khasbulatov--and he is not  alone--vociferously declares that he doesn't consider himself  guilty, that he suffered in the fight for freedom. In other  words, there is neither punishment nor remorse. In purely  Russian style.    The worrisome thing is that the people coming out of  Lefortovo Prison may take up their old cause. Anpilov has  already declared, in his purely public rally manner, that if,  having gained freedom, he sees that prices are declining, then  he'll concede the correctness of Boris Yeltsin's course, but if  they rise, then he will raise the masses. And he has already  taken part in a rally.    Theoretically, there is the danger of inflaming passions in  society and destabilizing the political situation in view of the  mounting dissatisfaction with the practice of delaying wages,  persistent problems of reciprocal nonpayment, the state of  affairs in the economy as a whole, and the disastrous situation  of many "budgeteers."    There is a threat that the people coming out of Lefortovo  will assemble a powerful opposition movement on a  national-patriotic platform, a platform of counter-reform, and  will seek to unite with the "implacable" in parliament. They  will try to shift their main actions to the streets, inciting  mass strikes, organizing disobedience campaigns, demanding a  complete change in the course of reforms, and even an early  presidential election. A hypothetical leader of the opposition  is already being named: Aleksandr Rutskoy.    Such apprehensions are already being expressed in the mass  media, and I hear them from colleagues of mine, including  like-minded people or people with views close to mine, with whom  I have recently been heatedly exchanging views. One of them  declared quite strongly: "The maneuver of President Yeltsin's  opponents in the Duma has succeeded. The amnesty is a defeat for  democrats. It is a victory for opposition forces; it is not  accidental, after all, that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy came to  Lefortovo specially to declare his solidarity with the leaders  of the October rebellion. As for those democrats who voted for  the amnesty, in particular Sergey Shakhray with his strategic  calculations of sorts, they have miscalculated. They simply  overplayed their hand."    Only the future will reveal the correctness of one side or  another, as well as who won, who lost, and who was duped. But  what should not, what must not be forgotten? Firstly, that the  Duma decree is a package. It includes not only the amnesty  (moreover, not only political, but also economic), but also  repeal of its previous decree of 16 February, "On Confirming the  Members of the Commission for Investigating the events of 21  September-4 October 1993." It goes without saying that such an  investigation would have excited public opinion no less than the  amnesty itself. The decree also includes a Memorandum of  Understanding, the significance of which should not be  overlooked. The MPs have declared to the country and the world:  "We are convinced of the impermissibility of destablizing the  situation in a country which possesses such a huge weapons  arsenal... Accordingly, we consider it necessary to engage in  political struggle strictly within the framework of the law and  not resort to, or in any form call for, violence, ethnic  discord, or the suppression of people holding different views."  If these are but empty words, then there is simply nothing to  talk about. In that case the political elite is beyond the pale  of civilization, beyond responsibility, in the power of  primitive instincts, barbarian "political culture," and a  society that brings forth such an elite can stop thinking of  democracy. Our fate is dictatorship, we are incapable of  anything else. But that is not really the case.    Secondly, one should not disregard the fact that the events  of August 1991 and October 1993 were of an unusual nature rarely  encountered in world practice. Therefore, despite their  similarity to many widespread phenomena, they should be treated  as something exceptional.    The human losses, spiritual, ethical, and in part even  political losses associated with the "shooting of the  parliament" were, I sincerely believe, forced actions to prevent  civil war and disintegration of the country, and they lie solely  on the conscience of those who first called people to arms.  Besides, we may have been at the threshold of a new terror. But  you must agree that all this took place in conditions of actual  dual power.    Thirdly, we have, apparently, not yet fully realized that we  are living under a new Constitution, that we no longer have an  almighty Supreme Soviet, and that in addition to the Duma we  also have a higher chamber, the Council of the Federation. Let  us suppose that Konstantinov, Anpilov or someone else would  really like to fish in muddy political waters for the sake of  that very "destabilization of the situation" mentioned in the  Memorandum. What would follow then? Why, if nothing else works,  the President would issue, with the approval of the upper  chamber, an edict declaring an emergency situation. Then no one  can tell him what to do! But if even then the situation gets out  of control, the problem would be not the Anpilovs or  Konstantinovs, but the bankruptcy of the political course  itself, the people's failure to comprehend the essence of reform.    But let us pose the question differently. Nonpayment of  wages  for months on end, chronic government debts for delivered  produce, a stalemate because of mutual nonpayments, and the  chaos pervading the economy in general: is all that normal and  acceptable? It is not, after all, our intention to carry out  reforms in the name of reforms and against the interests of  people. As I see it, the President in his message to parliament  considers such things completely abnormal and demands their  quickest elimination. Or perhaps it is normal that neither  Gaydar nor the people who have replaced him have deemed it  necessary to keep up a constant dialogue with the people.    We must explain to the people of Russia what kind of society  we want to build, what our ideals are, what our new spirituality  is. We should allay our compatriots' fears and give them  confidence in the future. So far nothing like this has really  been done.    Third, and here I am taking up what may be in favor of  "opting for": for positively resolving the question of the  amnesty as an important component of the package decree. It is  time for those who call themselves democrats, reformers, people  dedicated to a rule-of-law (socio-rule-of-law) state and to  market (socio-market) relations, who honor our traditions and  care for our national interests, to stop arguing, splintering,  and especially infighting. The society will soon lose any idea  of who is really a democrat. PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord] voted for the amnesty and, it is said, decided its fate.  Also voting for it were "Women of Russia," "New Regional  Politics," all or most of the "Yabloko"  [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] faction, and many of those who can't  be called either anti-reform or anti-democratic. Actually, only  "Russia's Choice" voted against. It is logical to ask why there  is such divergence in the democratic camp? The reason is that  there are, among other things, different views of the events of  September-October 1993, and even, to some extent, of the events  of August 1991. So perhaps it would be reasonable to try and  bring them together, even at the risk of failure. Politics is  impossible without taking risks.    It is, actually, high time to recognize realities in the  broader aspect and get out of the cocoon of sectarianism. If the  concept of "democrats" is reduced to "Russia's Choice," what can  they do without forming blocs with other political forces and  making compromises with them? Retreat into total opposition or  prod the President towards some kind of actions? Frankly, I see  nothing positive along that road. Because in parliament there is  a certain balance of forces supported by certain moods of our  citizens. One can only blame oneself for inability to conduct a  dialog with the people and for mishandling the parliamentary  elections, roll up one's sleeves and work hard for the future.  As for the President himself, I consider that he acted quite  appropriately. There is no sense prodding him towards  confrontation with Duma members. After all, work with the  Parliament is only just beginning.    And one more thing. It may develop that the supporters of  reform would do well to accept speaker Rybkin's formula, which  he proposed during his address to Parliament on 28 February.  Essentially, the idea is to implement a program for getting out  of the economic crisis prepared within the Duma. Provided, of  course, that it is based not on intentions to abandon the course  of market reforms altogether or to create a "government of  national unity" made up of, say, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and, perhaps, Anatoliy Chubays, which would lead to  the collapse of all and everything.    What, essentially, is of fundamental importance to  reformer-democrats? To preserve the democratic Constitution and  the strategic course of reforms. And also, to win the coming  presidential election.    Fourth. The amnesty will, in my view, hardly promote the  cohesion of extremist forces in society, and in this I tend to  agree more with Shakhray than with his critics. Of course, there  are still unknown quantities which make predictions difficult,  although much will get clearer in the very near future. However,  I have always considered--and so far have not changed my opinion  on this score--that as soon as Aleksandr Rutskoy appears on the  political scene Zhirinovskiy will fade away as a presidential  contender, literally before our eyes. When he voted for the  amnesty Vladimir Volfovich probably didn't even realize that he  was thereby placing a mine under his ambitious plans. But I do  not preclude the possibility that circumstances may force Boris  Yeltsin to once again enter the arena of struggle for the  presidency and, as the ancient Romans used to say, deserve his  triumph. But we still have to live up to that time.</p>

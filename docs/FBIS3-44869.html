			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- RENMIN RIBAO today  publishes a commentator's article, entitled: "Do More Practical  Things and Less Empty Talk -- the Third Discussion on Having a  New Style of Work in the New Year."    The article says: Doing more practical things and less empty  talk is another important content of Comrade Jiang Zemin's  emphasis on improving leadership style. To advocate doing more  practical things and less empty talk means that leading cadres  at all levels should set an example and lead the broad masses in  doing practical things and solid work to contribute to the  promotion of reform, opening up, and modernization; and they  should prevent and overcome such bad work style as indulging in  exaggerations, performing only lip service and no actual deeds,  practicing formalism and seeking only a pretty appearance.    The article says: What is the most practical thing at  present which we should go all out to do well? It is to  accelerate reform and development. The decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has drawn a  blueprint for us to establish a socialist market economy. In  accordance with the guidelines of the "decision," the central  authorities this year are promulgating measures to reform the  management systems of finance and taxation, banking, foreign  trade, investment, and planning; and all localities are actively  organizing the implementation of the measures. During the  course of reform and development, we certainly will encounter  new contradictions and new difficulties. Our cadres at all  levels must rack their brains and do down-to-earth work to solve  all the contradictions and difficulties and to implement all the  central authorities's measures for accelerating reform and  development.    The article says: During the course of doing practical  things, we should correctly understand and handle the  relationship between doing practical things and making  administrative achievements. We should be concerned about the  masses' hardships and solve difficult problems for them. While  the purpose of our party is to serve the people wholeheartedly,  the objective of reform and development is to give the people an  even happier life. Leading cadres at all levels should  constantly keep in mind the broad masses' well-being, discover  problems in good time, and solve them without delay. Only in  this way can the masses' enthusiasm be protected, can the masses  be mobilized to the maximum extent and actively participate in  and support the reform, and can a stable social and political  environment for reform and development be created. To do more  practical things, we should display a spirit of hard struggle as  well as a scientific and realistic spirit. We should conduct  scientific appraisal and make policy decisions scientifically on  the basis of investigation and study. We should strive to  reduce minor slip-ups and avoid major mistakes so that each and  every practical thing will yield the best economic returns and  social benefits.    In conclusion, the article says: Since the start of reform  and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has consistently  emphasized the necessity for leading cadres to display a good  style of work. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently has more than once  called on leading cadres at all levels to do more studying and  engage in less social intercourse, to conduct more investigation  and research and make less subjective decisions, and to do more  practical things and indulge in less empty talk. These three  points are the extremely important contents of the way to  improve leadership style. As the new year has just begun, may  the leading comrades at all levels display the good work style  of doing more studying, conducting more investigation and  research, and doing more practical things, and do an even better  job in uniting and leading the broad masses in forging ahead.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Minister of  Agriculture Liu Jiang said today that China has to readjust  unbalanced product structure, raise efficiency of agriculture  and greatly increase farmers' income this year, though the  country saw a record grain output in 1993.    Addressing a press conference sponsored by the current  session of the National People's Congress, Liu said that last  year, output of cotton and sugar-bearing crops fell sharply  because of natural disasters and poor management of product  varieties in some areas of the country.    He said that inadequate macro regulations over the grain  market, irrational farm crop structure, and many other factors  fueled sharp price rises after grain price was set free late  last year. This year the Ministry of Agriculture has sent three  working teams to major rice producing areas to ensure an overall  rational plantation structure in an attempt to keep the grain  market stable.    Asked whether farmers' income has decreased, he said that  the  average income for farmers nationwide has not decreased. But he  said that growth rate of farmers' income is relatively low  comparing with that of their urban cousins.    He blamed it on the widening gap between prices of  agricultural products and those of industrial products, and on  the concentration on the sole business of planting, which cannot  provide enough jobs for all workforce in rural areas.    According to Liu, the country has a rural workforce of 430  million. Among them, 50 million have left their homes to seek  jobs elsewhere. And six million more come after them every year.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PRO AND CON ON HOPE LAND SWAP  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston must be kidding.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Bob Hope have just reached an  agreement whereby the people of California will receive 80% of Mr. Hope's land  holdings in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.  </P> <P> Giving 59 acres in exchange for 5,700 acres of pristine land, wildlife  corridors, waterfalls, fishing pools, and much much more seems insignificant by  comparison.  </P> <P> How can Sen. Cranston not support the largest parkland transaction in the Santa  Monica zone? Not a smart political move from where I stand.  </P> <P> GENA GALINDO  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

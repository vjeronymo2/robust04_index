			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Second Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk </F> to introduce UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali at The  Presidency in Pretoria -- live]    [Text] President Mandela, Your Majesties, Your Royal  Highnesses, heads of state, heads of government, Your  Excellencies, all the dignitaries here, ladies and gentlemen:  It is my great privilege to introduce our guest speaker, the  secretary general of the United Nations.    Today is a great day for all South Africans. When Mr.  Mandela shortly addressed the last crowd down on the lawns  beneath the Union Buildings, his plea was that we should forget  the past. I would like to add to that, that we as a nation will  now stretch out to the future. We face tremendous challenges in  South Africa. I'm confident that we will, in accepting those  challenges, succeed in achieving the goal which we share with  each other in the government of national unity, and that is, to  bring lasting peace to our country, to bring new wealth to our  country, and to use that new wealth in a caring manner, to  improve the quality of life of all our people. [applause]    We also have, we believe, a pivotal role to play in our  subcontinent, in Africa, and believe also in the international  community. We have, to a certain extent, been starved of cross-  pollination in the years of isolation. We have needs, if we  look at the international community. We have needs in looking  at the United Nations. We need much closer interaction. We  need access to many of the world's resources in solving our own  problems. But we also have something to give. We have  expertise, applied technology to the conditions of Africa. [as  heard] We have infrastructure, and we have a commitment to be a  good neighbor to all our neighboring countries in southern  Africa and higher up. [applause]    As a country we, therefore, stand ready, willing, and able  to make a constructive and a positive contribution, but we need  partners, and we pledge ourselves to work with the international  community, to work with the United Nations, to work with other  international agencies, and to work with the major leading  countries of the world -- America, the European Union, Japan,  and others - in addressing also problems far beyond our borders.  It is for us a great honor to have so many heads of state,  heads of government, and such eminent international leaders here  today, and specifically, Mr. Secretary General, to have you here  today, you who have brought a new dimension to the influence,  success, and activities of the United Nations. We have watched  carefully your career thus far, and we are impressed by what you  have achieved through the United Nations in your term of office.  We salute you. [applause]    We thank the United Nations and the European Union and the  Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity for their  involvement in this election. The observers played an honorable  role, and the United Nations, in coordinating their activities  locally also played a leading role, and we thank them for it  very specifically. [applause] The watching eyes of the observers  I think ensured that there was inhibition on the side of those  who might have had a tendency at times to become too exuberant.  Mr. Secretary General, it is my great honor and pleasure to ask  you to please address this eminent gathering. [applause]</p>

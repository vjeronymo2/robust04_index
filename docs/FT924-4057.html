			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Paraguay's unimagined renaissance: The generals cannot stop what they started DICTATORS and generals have ruled Paraguay for all its 181 years as an independent nation. A general may still rule Paraguay today, but an extraordinary renaissance is under way. A free press, an independent judiciary, reasonably fair elections and a new constitution are bringing Paraguayans unimagined liberties. So great are these freedoms and the enthusiasm of the Paraguayan media in raking up the disgraceful past of top government figures, that the 56-year hegemony of the army and the ruling Colorado party is now at risk. To his fury, President Andres Rodriguez, the general who toppled General Alfredo Stroessner in a 1989 military coup, has been barred from standing for re-election under Paraguay's new constitution. Promises by Gen Rodriguez - himself closely identified with the Stroessner regime that lasted 35 years - to introduce democratic reforms were met with disbelief at first. However, he took to heart warnings from Washington, Brasilia and Buenos Aires, that they would not tolerate any more dictatorship. The army and the Asuncion civilian elite assumed, though, that they would not be held responsible for misdeeds committed under Gen Stroessner. However, in August the opposition newspaper ABC Color reported that senior army officers, including the army chief of staff, were involved in trafficking in stolen cars. ABC Color's reports were followed by more corruption stories and the indictment of senior army and police officers. Says Mr Edwin Britez, political editor: 'The military were still a taboo subject then. They had a blank cheque from society that was thought necessary during the transition to a new government.' The transition to democracy will only be complete after Paraguay holds presidential elections in May 1993 and Gen Rodriguez hands over power three months later. The Colorados are holding primary elections to choose a presidential candidate, but bitter infighting among the candidates, plus daily revelations of corruption, now mean that an opposition figure could win a presidential election for the first time in Paraguay's history. Mr Domingo Laino, a courageous if eccentric opponent of 'Stroessnerismo' and candidate for the Authentic Liberal Radical party, stands to gain most from the disarray. Even Gen Rodriguez is unable to halt a liberalisation process he started, even if he never imagined the consequences it would bring. However, there is no sign of long overdue land reform, a few wealthy and powerful businessmen retain great influence, corruption and smuggling are widespread and the police are still notoriously thuggish. Washington is concerned over Paraguay's role as a corridor for cocaine shipments and money laundering. Although the transition to democracy is proceeding reasonably well, the transition to a market-based economy is less smooth. True, the government's technocratic economic team has opened and deregulated the economy - and delivered South America's lowest annual inflation rate of 16 per cent. The problem is that a business class more used to bootlegging contraband to Argentina and Brazil or living off financial speculation and cosy government-supported cartels is not ready to cope with economic reform. In March 1991 Paraguay, together with Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, formed Mercosur, a nascent common market that is already putting local businesses under pressure. Mr Jose Abreu, a member of the Union Industrial Paraguaya, which represents manufacturers, admits that 'the traditional (business) mentality that does not want change is a majority. Paraguay's strong businessmen got rich with the government, not the market.' However, he consoles himself that 'traditional people are older, they are dying out. Change will come, it's just a question of speed.' But sandwiched between the supremely efficient agricultural producer Argentina and the stumbling giant Brazil, Paraguay's outlook is, at best, mixed. This became brutally clear in October when Argentina retaliated against Brazilian exports with a 10 per cent tax on all its imports, hitting Paraguay in the crossfire. As a mainly agricultural economy with an exploding birth rate, Paraguay desperately needs growth. About 50,000 teenagers enter the labour market every year. Investment equivalent to USDollars 1bn a year is needed to provide jobs for them. However, the economy is stagnant and investment low. Paraguayans are realising that their staple exports of cotton, soyabeans and 're-exports' of contraband consumer goods to neighbouring countries are no recipe for sustained, balanced development. The trouble is that they have yet to find a new strategy to pay their way in the world.</p>

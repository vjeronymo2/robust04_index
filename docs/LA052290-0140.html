			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> BUDGET PLAN BEEFS UP POLICE TO FIGHT GANGS  </P> <P> Citing a commitment to battle gang activity in Santa Ana, City Manager David N.  Ream unveiled a $218-million budget Monday that emphasized hiring more police  to patrol the city's neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "We see gang prevention as one of the top priorities in the city," Ream said.  </P> <P> Under the budget, the Police Department would add six investigators to its  narcotics unit and four to its gang unit. Another five non-sworn officers would  be added to the department so that officers can spend more time patrolling the  city, Ream said.  </P> <P> The 10 investigators will be selected from within the department's current  351-member roster. The city will hire 15 more people to fill the vacancies,  Ream said. The Police Department's proposed $43.8-million budget is up 8.4%  from last year.  </P> <P> Ream is also recommending that the council increase funding for Pride, a city  parks and recreation program designed to prevent children from joining gangs.  The program funding would increase from $66,000 to more than $110,000 under the  proposed budget, allowing the program to be expanded to six more schools.  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young said the emphasis on gangs in the budget reflects the  city's concern with crime.  </P> <P> "We've seen gangs become more violent," Young said. "We want to beef up our  gang unit and add patrol officers to have a chilling effect on these gangs."  </P> <P> But Councilman Richards L. Norton says the city should hire even more officers.  Norton says he went on a police ride-along May 6 to observe the Police  Department's weekend gang sweeps. During his ride-along, Norton says, he and a  police officer had to guard a body for two hours until homicide investigators  were able to arrive at the scene.  </P> <P> "It's not enough still," Norton said. "This is all political rhetoric. The fact  is we don't have enough men and women on the streets."  </P> <P> The proposed budget also emphasizes the city's efforts to clean up its  neighborhoods. In a five-year plan to improve everything from trees to traffic  signals, Ream is recommending that the city spend $34.8 million on capital  improvement projects during the next fiscal year.LILY ENG  </P></p>

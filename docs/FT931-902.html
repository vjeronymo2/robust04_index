			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / TUC calls march to protest at coal decisions: Labour launches appeal THE TUC yesterday decided to hold a march, rally and lobby of parliament on Monday, when MPs debate the government's coal white paper. It could be the start of the most widespread industrial disruption experienced in Britain for many years. The Labour party appealed to the thousands who had protested against the pit closure announcement in October to lobby Tory MPs, urging them to rebel against the government in Monday's vote, although party officials conceded privately that there was little prospect of the government being defeated. Members of the National Union of Mineworkers intend to strike for 24 hours next Friday in protest at the closures. Members of the RMT rail union are due to stop work on the same day in protest over British Rail's refusal to guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies in future. The latest in a series of one-day London bus strikes will be held the same day - bus workers' third day of strike action over wage cuts imposed before privatisation - as well as a TUC demonstration as part of a wider European trade union protest against unemployment. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, yesterday called on all workers to join in the wider action in solidarity with the miners. The TUC is not doing so, but Mr Norman Willis, its general secretary, said he hoped that the strikes by miners and railwaymen would 'focus public attention' on the issues being raised by the European union day of action. Labour urged opponents of the coal white paper to contact local Conservative MPs to persuade them not to support the government in Monday's Commons vote. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, issuing what he termed 'an SOS to the nation', called on all who had 'expressed their anger at the betrayal of the miners to do it again before 10pm on Monday'. He added: 'The rigged market will not save the pits, but full mailbags of Tory MPs might.' He also released a strongly worded Labour amendment to Monday's government motion approving the white paper, calling for existing volumes of coal production to be maintained. Labour intends to press for both its official amendment and an alternative urging the adoption of the recent trade and industry select committee report on coal to be voted on. Some possible rebels were last night keeping their cards close to their chest. The Batley and Spen constituency office said Ms Elizabeth Peacock, the Conservative MP, would make up her mind how to vote after reading the white paper this weekend. Another potential rebel said he would not vote against the government but might abstain. Mr Cook attacked Tory backbenchers who were already 'mouthing words of support' for Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, saying it was not Mr Heseltine who had 'moved' over the last five months but them. 'Any Tory MP who meant a word of the expressions of support and sentiment they made last October cannot possibly go into the lobby and vote for this white paper,' he said. Mr Cook described as 'extraordinary' the government's decision not to tie the white paper's subsidy offer to a commitment from the generators to buy more coal. He said he suspected the Treasury's attitude was to 'hope that very little extra coal is bought which will mean very little is spent on the subsidy'. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last night used a speech to his local Conservative association to say that the subsidy could be as much as up to Pounds 500m over five years as proposed by the trade and industry committee report.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> MALIBU SET NOW HAS LA SCALA-BY-THE-CREEK  </P> <P> Discreet, very discreet. Maybe the new La Scala is a little self-conscious  about being in a shopping center, though a shopping center in Malibu is not  just a shopping center. Anyway, there's nothing on the street to give it away.  Even in the parking lot there is only a discreet wrought-iron sign between two  shops indicating the path to the restaurant.  </P> <P> But I can trust you with the secret. It's around the back, behind the Wells  Fargo.  </P> <P> The original La Scala in Beverly Hills is known for attracting Beautiful  People. Malibu people are just as Beautiful, only more casual. Something about  La Scala Malibu's spaciousness and comfortable booths and the odd homeyness of  having mismatched table lamps along with miniature orange trees really seems to  agree with people around here. The place is always packed for dinner.  </P> <P> Lunch is even more casual, almost beachy. Around the margin of the lunch menu  are reminders that they serve beer, wine, coffee and milk, and the dessert  tirami su is helpfully spelled out ti-ra-mi-su. However, lunch is also the  prettiest time to eat, when you have a view of the tree-lined bed of Malibu  Creek. As somebody pointed out, it should be a particularly interesting view  next time the creek floods. (La Scala does look water-tight.)  </P> <P> The food certainly attracts people in its own right: genuine Westside Italian  stuff like carpaccio and penne arrabbiate way out here in Malibu. It's marked  by a curious schizophrenia, though. Some appetizers are of the exquisite,  infinitesimal sort where you can estimate the price of each mouthful in the $2  range. For instance, the remarkably good smoked salmon in truffle sauce (an  almost undetectably discreet sauce).  </P> <P> On the other hand, some items come in very generous portions, like the calamari  salad stacked high with calamari, tomatoes and two colors of olives, all in a  very garlicky dressing. And the bean soup is a meal: a big bowl of stewed white  beans with some salt pork and virgin olive oil for flavoring.  </P> <P> The trademark of the menu on the entree side is a fascination with eggplant.  There are two pasta dishes with eggplant, one an interesting tortelloni stuffed  with eggplant and cheese in cream sauce (the eggplant tastes a little sweet and  rather like some kind of squash). The other is rigatoni Malibu, where a cream  sauce colored with tomato and dosed with Parmesan includes little well-cooked  pieces of eggplant, which here taste almost meaty.  </P> <P> Altogether, you can almost feel you're back in Beverly Hills. Tagliatelle with  ham and peas, including mushrooms and nice sweet onions. Swordfish marinated in  herbs and grilled. Roast chicken marinated in rosemary and garlic, the skin  nice and brown. And at the end, rather cakey zuppa inglese with a thick whipped  cream layer, and very good chocolate mousse, dense and a little bitter, very  rich.  </P> <P>  La Scala Malibu, 3874 Cross Creek Road, Malibu; (213) 456-1979. Open for lunch  Monday through Friday, for dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. American  Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $50-$90.  </P> <P> </P></p>

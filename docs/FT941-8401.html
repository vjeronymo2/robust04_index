			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Investing for grand-daughter For nearly two years, I have been putting about Pounds 60 a month in an investment trust savings scheme on behalf of my grand-daughter, now aged four. The shares are in my name. I intend to continue investing until she is 18. The investment will no doubt become a substantial sum while, at the same time, producing significant dividends. Am I correct in assuming that, provided her annual income does not exceed the single person's tax allowance, she will be able to claim a tax refund on the dividends? Also, when she receives the accumulated investment at 18, if/when she sells the shares, will any associated capital gains be her responsibility and not mine? The fact that you have kept the shares in your own name (instead of simply handing the monthly gifts of cash over to the girl's guardians for investment on her behalf) might be taken as evidence that, although you plan to give the shares to your granddaughter one day - when she is 18, for example - they remain your own property at present. You might wish to consult a solicitor about executing a declaration of trust if there is no clear evidence of your bare trusteeship (such as a letter to the girl's guardians and their consent to the shares being held in your name rather than theirs). It could be, of course, that you consider the guardians to be untrustworthy. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

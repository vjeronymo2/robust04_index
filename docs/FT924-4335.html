			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Russia reveals big arms contracts: Gaidar cites Dollars 2bn weapons sales in defence of his economic policies RUSSIA has recently sold more than Dollars 2bn worth of weapons abroad, Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, said yesterday. This included a Dollars 1bn contract with China and deals for Dollars 650m and Dollars 600m with India and Iran. He also mentioned 'major contracts with Syria and other countries'. Mr Gaidar revealed this in the course of a powerful defence of his market reforms to the Congress of People's Deputies. Russia would continue to export weapons, he said, but he promised to avoid conflict zones. 'We are not going to stoke conflicts by supplying arms to hot spots, but there are no reasons to abandon this important market,' he said. The acting premier, who is fighting for his political life against increasingly powerful opposition to his policies, told the country's full parliament that Russia had a choice between radical reforms and joining the ranks of third world dictatorships. He dismissed claims by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's chairman, that he was depriving the country of kinder Scandinavian market economics in favour of a harsh US model. 'A criminal slowing of restructuring an economy (dominated by the defence industry) will drag us further into underdevelopment. . . If we work really well and privatise half the economy, free the country from the reign of bureaucracy, then we will be able to discuss what kind of society we want,' he said. While admitting to a series of mistakes by his economic reform team over the past year, he said there was little room for manoeuvre on basic issues such as financial stabilisation to fend off hyperinflation, and an industrial policy which made selective use of scarce resources. But he also promised practical steps which the country needed to better implement reforms. From January 1, Russia would operate proper borders with neighbouring republics so it could get a better grip on hard currency revenues lost through illegal exports of oil and other resources. He claimed Russia would also enforce a new regime preventing other republics which used 'the Russian rouble' to interfere with monetary policy. Whether he continues as prime minister, which he sees as essential for pursuing 'responsible reform', is yet unclear. His speech drew polite applause, but appears to have swayed few of the deputies intent on his removal. 'It was beautiful but my pockets are still empty,' said Mr Yuri Gekht, leader of a conservative industrialist faction.</p>

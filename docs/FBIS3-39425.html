General Michael Rose,  commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, jokes about  my means of transportation in Sarajevo. It is a bicycle and is  ideal for moving around quickly. The man who will bear most of  the responsibility of deciding whether to launch the NATO air  strikes, came to greet me personally at the entrance to UN  headquarters. Rose is courteous but determined as a result of  the years spent in the special British forces. Born in 1940 in  Quetta, now in Pakistan, he began his military career at an  early age with the paratroopers. His curriculum includes  numerous assignments in the Middle East and the Far East, in  Northern Ireland, and at the command of the 22nd Special Air  Force Regiment, which he led to reconquer the Falklands/Malvinas  in 1982.    [Poggiali] Are you concerned about this new mission,  General?    [Rose] It is indeed a delicate and complex mission. It is  not a matter of defeating an adversary, but of preventing the  continuation of the war and a downturn in the situation. Our  strategy will be mapped out by the Security Council resolutions,  and we must closely abide by its instructions.    [Poggiali] But almost none of the contenders seems to want  to  respect the resolutions.    [Rose] After two years of war, the conflicting parties are  extremely suspicious of one another, and it is our duty to do  all that we can to open talks.    [Poggiali] A few days ago you threatened to sweep away the  Bosnian Serbs' roadblock on the way to the airport yourselves.  This is a change in style compared to the previous UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] attitude.    [Rose] Unfortunately, we must deal with a large number of  extremists who are trying to impose their will. We are also  here to put a stop to such situations and, if obliged to do so,  are also ready to resort to weapons. These are drastic  decisions but nobody should doubt our will to bring to  conclusion the mission with which we have been entrusted. Some  of the best soldiers in the world are under my command, and we  are also taking steps to strengthen the contingent: For  example, the first tanks at the disposal of this mission, the  Leopard tanks, are scheduled to arrive soon.    [Poggiali] The contingent is scattered over most of Bosnia;  some of your divisions are isolated and could be the object of  Serbian reprisals in case of an air strike.    [Rose] Obviously we have elaborated plans for any type of  eventuality. On our side we know that we can count on a  formidable air capacity and on the possibility of performing  airborne operations, both because of the mobility of the units  and the quick dispatch of reinforcements. The last person to  challenge the United Nations, Saddam Husayn, was severely  punished; therefore it would be better if everybody abided by  the United Nations' desires.</p>

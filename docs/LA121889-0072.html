			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: HE'S DANGEROUS AS ANGRY DRIVER  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Whenever my husband gets really angry, he invariably jumps  into his car and drives off. He's had several serious accidents and I believe  this is no coincidence. Why does he do this and how can I help him?-C.W.  </P> <P> DEAR C.W.: Cars represent power to many people, especially young males. This is  one of the many reasons that automobile insurance is frequently more expensive  for young male drivers. This is why motors are revved and why tires squeal as  young drivers try to go around corners at excessive speed. Now, it's possible  that you're saying that your husband isn't young. Some men don't mature as  quickly as others and continue to use cars in the same way they did as  adolescents.  </P> <P> Anger results from a feeling of powerlessness. When a person leaps in his car  in a flash of anger, he's much more likely to have an accident and to injure  himself or someone else. When people take their anger out on their car, when  they get behind the wheel when they're in a rage, the likelihood of serious  accidents soars. Studies reveal that when people are angry, their reflexes  aren't as good and they're definitely more accident-prone.  </P> <P> Your husband needs to learn how to talk about his feelings and to find  constructive ways to solve his problems. He would profit from assertiveness  training. He needs to learn that it's all right to be angry, but it is also  possible to talk rationally about feelings without resorting to aggression or  violence.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: As long as I can remember I've had a terrible fear of  flying. It was so bad I even contemplated going to a hypnotist to overcome it.  What really concerned me was that I was planning a honeymoon trip to Europe. My  new husband convinced me that everything would be fine. I didn't have time to  get therapy for my phobia, but much to my amazement, when I got on the plane I  had no fear and have had none since. What happened? -- R.D.  </P> <P> DEAR R.D.: I'm not sure, but my guess is that your new husband gave you a sense  of trust you didn't have before. The fear of flying is frequently related to a  fear of losing control. Unconsciously, you feel if you're not in the driver's  seat -- at the controls -- something dreadful will happen.  </P> <P> On your honeymoon, you may have discovered that the world didn't come to an end  if you lost control. In a satisfying sexual relationship, both partners must  have enough trust to be able to surrender themselves and to lose control or to  be swept up in the moment of passion.  </P> <P> It may sound absurd, but this surrender may have laid the groundwork for you to  enjoy your flight.  </P></p>

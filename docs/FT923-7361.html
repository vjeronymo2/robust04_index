			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Administrators appointed at Burns-Anderson BURNS-ANDERSON, the recruitment and financial services group formerly chaired by Sir John Harvey-Jones, has gone into administrative receivership. Touche Ross announced yesterday that insolvency partners Mr Nick Lyle and Mr David Morgan had been appointed joint administrative receivers of the holding company late on Friday evening. Mr Lyle was also appointed joint administrative receiver, with Mr Ken Chalk of Touche Ross, of Burns-Anderson Recruitment. Dealings in the shares were suspended at 2p on Friday, after talks aimed at restructuring the company's debts with its bankers, which include National Westminster, failed. The receivers also revealed yesterday that 16 of the 21 recruitment agency offices of Burns-Anderson Recruitment were purchased over the weekend by Premier Employment, a company newly formed by Mr Dorian Marks, the former finance director. Mr Marks, who was also a director of Burns-Anderson Recruitment, was assisted in the purchase by other former directors. Defending the swiftness of the disposal, Mr Chalk said that it had been 'a good realisation for the creditors in the circumstances.' Mr Chris Edge of Family Assurance Society, which has a 4.9 per cent stake in the group, said yesterday that the developments over the weekend were 'not an enormous surprise. The company has been struggling for a considerable period.' Pre-tax losses were Pounds 2.74m for the year to December 31 1991. The group first fell into the red in the 15 months to end-December 1990. Operating profits were Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 3.22m a year earlier) but interest charges of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 246,000) and exceptional costs of Pounds 1.86m (nil) resulted in a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.6m (profit of Pounds 2.98m). Extraordinary costs of Pounds 5.25m relating to disposals and reorganisation caused an overall deficit of Pounds 6.59m. Burns-Anderson, which had interests in banking, hire-purchase, stockbroking, insurance broking and direct marketing, sold most of these operations in 1990 to concentrate on its core businesses of independent financial advice and recruitment. The disposals reduced the group's borrowings from Pounds 35m to Pounds 15m. The receivers said that three of the group's subsidiaries, including Burns-Anderson Independent Network, the third largest network of financial advisers in the country, were not immediately affected by the collapse of the holding company. Mr Alan Taylor, managing director of the network, which has 375 individually registered members with Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation, said yesterday that the network itself continued to do business profitably and was financially 'ringfenced' from the group. Mr Stephen Kelland, director of Kelland &amp; Partners financial advisory division, said yesterday that his company had no cross-guarantees with the group. 'Whatever situation we move to will be a better one because the parent company won't have debts,' he said. The group's market capitalisation at the suspension price was Pounds 830,000, compared with a high of Pounds 55.5m in June 1987. In that month, Sir John, former chairman of ICI and a renowned troubleshooter, joined Burns-Anderson as non-executive chairman. He resigned as chairman in June 1990, leaving the board in March 1991.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS;  </P> <P> A SPEED BREAK  </P> <P> VDE IS A word-processing program for people who like their programs lean, mean  and simple, and that includes people who simply appreciate a clean,  well-written program as well as those who write on laptop computers that have  limited disk-storage space. VDE executes all the standard operations necessary  for writing articles, books or screenplays but uses only 43K of disk space  (compared to the 500K or more required by many commercial programs).  </P> <P> In spite of VDE's small size (or perhaps in part because of it), VDE is  blazingly fast. It keeps the entire file in RAM; therefore searches, re-formats  and block moves are instantaneous. Even the loading and storing of files is  speedy. And VDE is simple to learn (it mimics WordStar commands but comes with  an installation program that allows you to program the function keys any way  you want to. Under VDE, any one file is limited to 80K (12,000 words), though  you can load as many as eight files in RAM simultaneously and bounce back and  forth between them as fast as you can tap a key.  </P> <P> Unlike some best-selling commercial programs that cost up to $500, there is no  charge for VDE if you download it via modem from a bulletin board, and only a  nominal charge if you get it from a commercial-software library. VDE author  Eric Meyer of Norman, Okla., issues periodic fixes and updates. A manual on  disk with the applications file (merely print it out on your printer) is  available.  </P> <P>  VDE (and Eric Meyer) can be reached via the Glendale Litera bulletin board,  (818) 956-6164. To download, follow instructions on the bulletin board (VDE is  stored as a compacted file called VDE15.ARC). Or VDE can be obtained by mail  from various software libraries, including the Public Software Library, P.O.  Box 35705, Houston, Tex. 77235.  </P> <P> PAUL CIOTTI  </P></p>

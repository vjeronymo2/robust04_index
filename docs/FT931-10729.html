			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family (Getting an Income): Small savers start here . . . TAX-EXEMPT special savings accounts (Tessas) are aimed at the small saver. They allow tax-free interest to be earned on bank and building society deposits so long as the account has been kept open for five years. The maximum amount that can be deposited in the first year is Pounds 3,000, with limits of Pounds 1,800 in each subsequent year up to a maximum of Pounds 9,000 over five years. Most Tessas pay interest annually, but those with a monthly income option include Alliance &amp; Leicester, Coventry, National &amp; Provincial and Northern Rock. Pros. Tax-exempt interest is the main attraction of a Tessa, but many people forget they can draw the net interest without losing the tax advantage. The capital must be untouched for five years to obtain the tax benefit. If interest is withdrawn, it will be paid net of basic-rate tax. The amount withdrawn must not exceed the net amount that would have been paid if tax had been deducted. For example, a basic-rate taxpayer getting Pounds 400 in gross interest can withdraw only Pounds 300. The 'tax' will remain in the Tessa, to be included in the overall return. Rates of interest tend to be higher than on other savings accounts. Cons. Few institutions have penalties for withdrawing interest but check this. Confederation Bank's fixed-rate Tessa With a Plus requires six months' notice for interest withdrawal; there is also 180 days' loss of interest. There have been some fixed-rate Tessas but most pay variable rates. Rates. In the range of 5.5 to 8.75 per cent gross, depending on whether the institution has cut its charges following the recent base rate drop. GILT-EDGED STOCKS BONDS issued by the UK government are known as gilt-edged stocks, or gilts, because of their unimpeachable security. They offer a fixed return for a fixed period (except for those that are index-linked). Payment normally is made semi-annually. The cheapest way of buying them is through the National Savings stock register at the post office. Pros. The return is fixed and cannot fall once bought. Investors are sure what the repayment value will be and, short of revolution, it is certain. Dealing costs are cheap and the market is very liquid, making gilts easy to sell. Any profits are free of capital gains tax. Cons. Many gilts are trading at above face value; thus, investors are 'locking in' a capital loss on purchase which cannot be offset, for CGT purposes, against gains elsewhere. If interest rates rise generally, the price of gilts probably will fall; inflation will, in any case, eat into the value of the investment. Short-term gilts are offering returns which are little better than those available from building societies. Rates. Redemption yields vary from 5.5 per cent on short-term issues to 8.8 per cent at the longer end. These figures take account of both income and the capital gain/loss to maturity. PERSONAL EQUITY PLANS SHARE DIVIDENDS have always been a useful source of income but rarely have their attractions been so apparent as now. With the stock market yielding around 4.3 per cent and base rates at 6 per cent, the gap between dividend and cash returns is very small What is more, the existence of the personal equity plan means that investors can receive dividends gross. All income and gains within a Pep are tax-free. Pros. There is no time limit on holding a Pep, and investors can put in Pounds 9,000 a year, via a general and single company plan. Dividends tend to grow in line with the economy over the long term, so there is more scope for income growth than with a building society. Cons. The value of a Pep can fall and dividends can be cut. These investments are best held for the long term. Charges can outweight the tax benefits on many plans, especially for a low-rate taxpayer or for those who cannot afford to invest the full allowance. Rates. The income yields of Peps vary widely. Three income plans launched this week (see page II) yield between 5 and 7 per cent. But look carefully at the investments which the Pep will hold; a very high yield can mean very high risk or not much prospect for growth. The lower the charges, the better. NATIONAL SAVINGS NATIONAL Savings Income bonds are government-issued and sold at post offices. They pay taxable monthly income at variable rates. The minimum purchase is Pounds 2,000, with additional purchases in Pounds 1,000 lumps. The maximum is Pounds 50,000 for an individual. Pros. Safe and simple way to receive monthly income. Interest is paid gross which is convenient for non-taxpayers. Cons. Only half the advertised rate of interest will be paid if the bond is encashed in the first year. Three months' notice is required for encashment. The rate is variable and can often be beaten by the best building societies. Rates. Currently 7 per cent gross. NS gives six weeks notice of rate changes. PIBS PERMANENT interest-bearing shares (Pibs) are issued by building societies to raise capital. They will not be redeemed - there is no repayment date - so the fixed interest they pay is for life. The first issues, in 1991, were aimed mainly at institutions but several building societies, including Bristol &amp; West and Britannia, have put them within reach of private investors by making the minimum investment Pounds 1,000. Pros. Pibs offer high yields compared with other fixed-rate investments. The fixed income is paid twice a year net of basic-rate tax. A number of companies have packaged them, so they pay out income more often during the year. Pibs are exempt from capital gains tax. Cons. Since Pibs are issued by a building society, they are riskier than, say, government-issued gilts; this is why their yields are higher. There is no compensation available if the society collapses and it can skip interest payments if it gets into difficulty without having to pay them later. The only way of getting back capital is to sell the shares, but you risk making a capital loss if you do that. The market for dealing in Pibs is illiquid, which might make them hard to sell in troubled times. Rates. Present gross yields range from 10.3 to 11.9 per cent, depending on the issue.</p>

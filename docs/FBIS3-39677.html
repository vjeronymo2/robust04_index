			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Greek Disgrace"] </F>   [Text] Convention requires that the state holding the  presidency of the European Union [EU] show restraint in pushing  its national views and interests where these are at odds with  those of its partners.    Greece gave some sign of observing that convention last week  when it allowed the EU and NATO to adopt resolutions threatening  air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. But on Tuesday [15  February] it threw presidentialism to the winds by banning The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] from using the  Greek port of Thessaloniki, which had become its main lifeline  since war and sanctions cut off access to the Adriatic.    Such unilateral interference with the EU's external trade by  a member state is of dubious legality, and should be challenged  in the European Court of Justice. Politically, it is an affront  to Greece's partners, which are unanimous in wanting to help  Macedonia, and thoroughly misguided even from the point of view  of Greek national interests -- as indeed Greek policy has been  ever since Macedonia declared its independence two years ago.    Greece insists on seeing the use by a neighbouring state of  the name "Macedonia" and of symbols derived from ancient Macedon  as a threat to its territorial integrity. Unlike Bulgaria  (which has much better reason to feel unnerved by the emergence  of a state whose national "language" is in fact a dialect of  Bulgarian, spoken by a significant minority of the Bulgarian  population), Greece has failed to see that the stabilisation of  Macedonia is very much a Greek interest, since its collapse  would bring the war of Yugoslav succession right up to Greece's  borders.    Such a collapse is by no means a purely theoretical danger.  Macedonia has a large and discontented Albanian minority, so far  represented within the coalition government but coming  increasingly under radical leadership manipulated from the  Albanian capital, Tirana, while threatened by the equally  radical Macedonian nationalist opposition. A much smaller Serb  minority had settled its grievances with the government last  August, only to see its leader resign after a visit to Belgrade,  whereupon a new leader (born in Serbia) repudiated the agreement  and produced a new set of demands. Serbia's President Milosevic  weeps crocodile tears over the dangers of Albanian separatism.  "If such processes continue, I am afraid that there will be  nothing for Greece to recognise," he told the Greek foreign  minister last November.    To resist such pressures, Macedonia badly needs political  and  economic support. In depriving it of its last main trade route,  Mr Papandreou is pursuing domestic political advantage, at the  risk of a wider Balkan war. His compatriots should realise, if  he does not, that in so doing he adds to the intense irritation  with Greece already felt by many of its EU partners. That can  hardly be a wise policy for a country so heavily dependent on EU  funds.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Alitalia may use third-party carriers Alitalia, the loss-making state airline, said it might use third-party carriers on some of its routes as part of a plan to make the group more cost-efficient, Reuter reports from Rome. 'Alitalia's strategy includes the search for solutions including the use of a subsidiary company which would allow routes to be used at lower costs without losing market share,' the company said. But Alitalia denied a report in a newspaper that it had presented a plan to sell 10 per cent of its long-range routes to Air Europe, a charter airline in which it owns 27 per cent.</p>

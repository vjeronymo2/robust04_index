			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / House urged to end Bosnia arms ban The House of Representatives today debates a resolution requiring the US to stop enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia and to supply weapons to the Bosnian Moslem government. The debate comes two weeks after the Senate voted to require the administration to breach the arms embargo, and a House vote could further complicate the White House's efforts to avoid getting dragged into the Bosnian war. President Bill Clinton has said he favours lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina but does not want to act unilaterally, in defiance of the wishes of the European countries which make up the bulk of the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia. Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, has been leading the drive to block the measure, warning members that lifting the embargo would probably lead to the withdrawal of UN forces from Bosnia and threaten supplies to Sarajevo and other cities held by the Bosnian government. 'The US might have no choice but to intervene massively in the conflict or acquiesce in a humanitarian and political disaster,' Mr Perry cautioned. The resolution, sponsored by Congressman Frank McCloskey of Indiana and Congressman Benjamin Gilman of New York, requires the president to 'terminate the US arms embargo of the government of Bosnia and Hercegovina upon receipt from that government of a request for assistance in exercising its right of self-defence.' It directs the president to provide 'appropriate military assistance' and authorises the transfer of up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) of military equipment and training services to the Bosnian government. Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, will propose a substitute version which would direct the president to consider lifting the arms embargo, but would not require him to act unilaterally. The tougher McCloskey-Gilman version, however, is believed to have attracted considerable support.</p>

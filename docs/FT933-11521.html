			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Urban sprawl 'could cover one fifth of countryside' ONE FIFTH of England's countryside will have been lost to urban sprawl by 2050 if development continues at the rate of the past 10 years, the Council for the Protection of Rural England said yesterday. Mr Tony Burton, senior planner at the environmental group, said that 15 per cent of England is already covered by towns and cities. He called for stricter planning laws to protect the countryside as an aesthetic and economic resource. 'There is an economic case and an emotive case for preserving the countryside: it is marketed widely by the tourist authorities and it touches a very sensitive nerve amongst many people,' he said. Mr Burton was launching a report on the changing face of England over the past 50 years. He said the south-east region had lost as much farmland to development as if greater London had been built all over again. In the south-west the urban area has grown by 70 per cent since 1945. Overall, England has lost 700,000 hectares of farmland to urban sprawl in the past 50 years. Mr Burton called on the government to target the 150,000 hectares of derelict land in cities before it opens up more countryside for building. He also criticised the government's policy of building more roads as the single most important aspect of government policy responsible for rural land loss. The Lost Land - Regional Data.

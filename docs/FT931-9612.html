			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / BT falls 7% to Pounds 705m but maintains rise in call volume BRITISH Telecom's third-quarter profits before tax were down on last year and below City expectations but analysts were satisfied with a sound performance in a difficult economic climate. The shares rose 4p to 412p, roughly in line with the rise in the market yesterday. Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said a slight improvement in inland call volume in the second quarter had been maintained but warned: 'The economic outlook remains difficult while competition and regulation continue to exert pressure on our performance.' Profit before tax was Pounds 705m, a 7.1 per cent fall from Pounds 759m for the same period last year. Profit before tax for the first nine months of the year was Pounds 1.73bn, down 26.9 per cent on last year's Pounds 2.37bn. Analysts had been expecting between Pounds 720m and Pounds 750m for the quarter but were surprised by an exceptional charge of Pounds 56m for the premium paid on the repurchase in December last year of government-held bonds. They had also overestimated the cost to the company of restructuring in the quarter which was Pounds 17m rather than the Pounds 60m anticipated. Earnings per share were 7.2p for the third quarter, 12.3 per cent down on last year, and 17.3p for nine months, 32.4 per cent down. Turnover of Pounds 3.28bn for three months and of Pounds 9.81bn for nine months was essentially flat compared with last year. It refused to comment on rumours that it was negotiating to take a stake in Electronic Data Systems, the computing services arm of General Motors. Inland telephone call revenues were almost static in the nine-month period but grew 1.2 per cent in the third quarter. Capital spending in the nine-month period fell to Pounds 1.51bn from Pounds 1.75bn a year ago; in the three months it fell from Pounds 575m to Pounds 561m suggesting the organisation is keeping a tight grip on spending. Analysts are maintaining pre-tax profit estimates for the full year at Pounds 2.55bn. Lex, Page 18</p>

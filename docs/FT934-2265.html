			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Canada's care under the spotlight: Bernard Simon on a welfare system that some say needs re-targeting A visitor to Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver can quickly spot some obvious differences between Canada and the US. Homeless 'street people', an all-too-common sight in cities south of the border, are rare. Even the most down-at-heel parts of Canadian cities are nowhere near as decrepit as New York's Harlem, the south side of Chicago or east St Louis. One reason is Canada's comprehensive and generous social security system. Anyone out of work can claim unemployment insurance of up to CDollars 425 (Pounds 215) a week for almost a year. When that runs out, the welfare system kicks in with payments of up to CDollars 1,530 a month for a family of four, plus benefits such as subsidised housing and free medicines. Pensioners receive as much as CDollars 841 a month. Even rebellious teenagers who storm out of home are eligible for 'student welfare', with few questions asked. Canada's healthcare system offers a panoply of benefits found in few other countries. Financed by company payroll taxes or individual levies (depending on the province), it provides comprehensive and sophisticated treatment for everyone through a doctor of their choice. But the outward appearance of a compassionate and successful social security net masks some deep-seated flaws. There is a consensus that the programmes have lost direction, failing to solve the problems of those who need them most, while lavishing benefits on many for whom they were never intended. Welfare, which was at first aimed at society's most disadvantaged people, has increasingly become a haven for the able-bodied unemployed. Professor Paul Hobson, an economics professor at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, and Ms France St-Hilaire, research director of the Institute for Research on Public Policy in Montreal, estimated in a recent article that only 30-50 per cent of Canada Assistance Plan recipients - the programme of last resort - come from such vulnerable groups as the disabled, elderly or single mothers, down from 90 per cent in the early 1970s. Unemployment insurance is under fire both for its generosity and its structure, under which the duration of benefits varies according to regional unemployment rates. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest annual report on Canada, the system reduces 'the incentive and the mobility of unemployed individuals in finding a new job'. Few politicians dared discuss the highly-charged topic of social security and health-care reform during the general election campaign last October. Since then, however, policy-makers of all persuasions have acknowledged the need for a far-reaching overhaul. 'I'm convinced that the time has come when the political will exists to make changes,' says Prof Hobson. The catalyst has been the spiralling cost of the programmes at a time when the federal government and the provinces are under intense pressure to rein in widening budget deficits. Unemployment insurance and social assistance payments now make up almost 3 per cent of gross national product, compared with 1 per cent in 1965. According to the OECD, Canada has overtaken Sweden with the highest per-capita health care spending among countries with national health systems. With social security, health care and education making up about 60 per cent of total outlays by all levels of government, economists agree that wholesale reform of these programmes is the only way to make a meaningful dent in budget deficits. Changes so far have been mostly on the margin. For instance, the provinces have gradually trimmed the list of subsidised medicines available to senior citizens. The federal government earlier this year left numerous loopholes in a law which withholds unemployment insurance from people who voluntarily leave a job. But the challenges of going further are enormous. Devising more narrowly-targeted programmes with incentives for recipients to escape the welfare trap is only part of the problem. Social security funding raises issues that go to the heart of Canada's national values and constitutional make-up. Many Canadians view their social security system as one of their defining hallmarks. The attempt to trim benefits will almost certainly raise a political storm. Responsibility for funding and delivering social security is split between the federal government and the 10 provinces. But the division is a messy one. Many programmes delivered by the provinces are partly financed by federal tax revenues. Ottawa's hold on the purse-strings has left the provinces open to arbitrary cuts. Since 1990 for instance, the federal government has capped the growth of its transfers under the Canada Assistance Plan to the three richest provinces - Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. It has also frozen the per capital entitlement for health care and higher education transfers. The federal contribution to these programmes in Ontario has dropped to 31 per cent from 52 per cent in 1980. The drop helps explain why provincial deficits have soared in recent years, and why Canadian provinces are now among the most active borrowers on international capital markets. The provinces have suggested that instead of relying on transfers from Ottawa, they should be given wider taxation powers themselves. Such proposals raise fears, however, that a fundamental tenet of the Canadian federation - uniform standards of social services across the country - will be undermined as each province tailors its suit to fit its cloth. According to this argument, provinces with the broadest and most stable tax base would soon be offering the best social services. Already, some are toying with the idea of health care user-fees. Under the existing Canada Health Act, any province which imposes such levies forfeits federal funding. The looming debate on social programmes will clearly span a far wider range of issues than how to get people off the dole and the welfare rolls. Canadians also face some tough decisions about the kind of country they want to live in. This is the ninth article on welfare states around the world.

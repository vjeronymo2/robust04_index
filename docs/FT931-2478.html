			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Letter: Talisman the ideal basis for SE's Taurus mark II Sir, The Bank of England's immediate response to the sudden demise of Taurus illustrates clearly how important it is to the City that a computerised settlement system is developed. The recent articles by Richard Waters clearly explain both the development and the ultimate failure of Taurus. However, it must not be forgotten that the London Stock Exchange already has in place a very effective and efficient computerised settlement system, Talisman, which provides for settlement by market participants without the use of share certificates. I would urge that Taurus mark II should be developed as a Talisman writ large. The Talisman system involves the use of a stock exchange nominee company, Sepon, as a custodian for market participants and also indirectly for investors while their shares are in the course of settlement. Sepon should become a central depository for all investors (holding shares long term rather than just while bargains are being settled) and the London Stock Exchange should extend its book entry transfer system to cover all investors. This is not in conceptual terms a significant development and, indeed, would be similar to what the London Stock Exchange originally proposed. In particular, under the system I recommend should be adopted: investors would no longer themselves be on the company's register; instead, the only shareholder on the register would be Sepon itself. This would actually be more efficient than having the multitude of registered shareholders proposed by Taurus; professional registrars would in turn have their own accounts in Sepon (keeping their own computerised records of investors) and could still provide their services on behalf of the company to the majority of investors. However, market participants, institutions, and stockbrokers or their nominee companies could have their own Sepon accounts; the ordinary investor holding through the registrar could still vote and receive dividends himself (subject to appropriate verification); the legal framework would be made simpler by the use of a single central depository; the company should be able to obtain from Sepon account holders the identity of its 'shareholders'; and probably, the government should make participation in Taurus compulsory for all listed companies and not depend on persuasion. The know-how and skills used in developing Taurus, and, indeed, Talisman could surely be applied to implement this suggested new system very quickly.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Sunday [13 February] a trade agreement between  Japan and the United States was "80 to 90 percent complete" but  President Bill Clinton rejected it. Hosokawa made the remark to  reporters aboard a special government jetliner which landed at  Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 5:50 P.M. Sunday.    He said his government will assemble officials of various  government agencies either Monday or Tuesday to explore steps to  revive the abortive trade talks with the U.S.    Hosokawa met Clinton in Washington for three hours Friday  and  attended a breakfast meeting with the President at the White  House on Saturday.    Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are designed to help  correct the trade imbalance by increasing the access of foreign  firms to Japan's markets in the auto and auto parts and  insurance sectors and boosting foreign participation in  government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment.    Asked at his official residence about a report in THE  WASHINGTON POST's Sunday issue suggesting potential U.S. trade  sanctions against Japan, Hosokawa said, "it's too early" to  speculate on U.S. action.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OK, you finally got me to write. After 30 years of subscribing to The Times, I  finally protest and am sending back to you the "Tales of the Crypt" cover of  our TV guide for the week of June 3.  </P> <P> The cover was disgusting and not a sight I wanted to see every time I picked up  the guide.  </P> <P> In the future, please be more aware of how this affects small children (my  grandchildren, to be specific) and at least not be as graphic.  </P> <P> I still love The Times and will forgive this one mistake, but I just felt you  should know how one subscriber felt about this sort of cover.  </P> <P> Patricia A. Akers, Stanton  </P></p>

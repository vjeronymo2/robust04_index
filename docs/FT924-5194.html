			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (4): Relentless self-publicist  -Jacques Chirac has ruled the French capital since he became mayor in 1977 THE chain-smoking mayor, with his perpetual smile and his pinstripe suits, is part and parcel of the city's politics. Yet Jacques Chirac, now nearing 60, has made no secret of the fact that he sees Paris as little more than a platform to the serious business of national power. Chirac began his career as a civil servant, working his way through the ministerial ranks until 1974 when he became prime minister under President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Two years later he resigned to nurture his own national powerbase as head of the neo-Gaullist RPR. He and his old presidential mentor have since fought over, and disastrously divided, the conservative right, as illustrated by the damaging split over this autumn's Maastricht referendum. So far they have proved spectacularly successful at squashing their younger would-be successors although, as their critics suspect, they may be damaging their own parties' electoral prospects in the process. Jacques Chirac is still best known outside France for his second stint as prime minister during the cohabitation era from 1986 to 1988. Cohabitation came to an abrupt end in 1988 when the RPR suffered its worst electoral defeat in the 30 year history of the Fifth Republic courtesy of Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right wing Front Nationale, whose racist policies split the party and stole its votes. The head of the RPR, a relentless self-publicist who conducted his last presidential campaign from a travelling circus tent, has been left to bide his time back at the opulent Hotel de Ville, firing off the odd offensive at President Mitterrand, until the next elections come along.</p>

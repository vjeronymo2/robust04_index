			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (10): Moment of truth in a North London semi - David Lascelles had a shock when his house was audited or lack of it - can be a moment of truth. I recently asked the National Home Energy Rating scheme to look at our North London semi-detached. It was not exactly designed with energy efficiency in mind. Built just before the first World War, it has large rooms and high ceilings which eat up heat. A wide bay at one corner of the house is more window than wall, and the attic is poorly insulated. Even so, we have tried over the 15 years we have owned it to cut down heat waste. Eight years ago, we installed a new gas boiler, and we fitted individual thermostatic valves to all the radiators. We draught-proofed doors, double glazed most of the windows and blocked up unused fireplaces. We also converted most of the loft into a playroom, and sealed it off from the rest of the house with its own separate heating arrangements. Even so, Vic Harrison, our assessor, broke the bad news. After feeding all the information into his portable computer he told us that we rated only 2.5 on the NHER scale of one to 10. What's more, we were contributing more than 20 tonnes a year to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In short, the house was a bit of a disaster. Two things pulled us down badly. One was the loft which Harrison said was letting out lots of heat, despite all the boarding and carpeting we had put in. The other was our 'new' boiler which turned out to be hugely inefficient, spewing half its heat up the flue. Harrison's computer was uncannily accurate in guessing what our gas and electricity bills amounted to: Pounds 1,500 a year, which made it difficult to challenge its rating. So what could we do about it? The computer's main recommendation was to install a new boiler of the gas condensing type. Although this would cost Pounds 1,700, it would save us Pounds 196 a year, giving us a payback of just under nine years. Predictably, the computer also advised us to insulate the loft properly at a cost of Pounds 850. This would save us Pounds 275 a year, a payback of just over three years. With various other bits and pieces, including thicker insulation on the hot water tank, the computer's total recommendations added up to Pounds 3,010. This would produce savings of Pounds 516 a year, paying for itself in just under six years. In so doing we would raise our rating to 4.9, which is just above the national average, and cut our carbon dioxide emissions to only 12 tonnes a year. The big question now is: will we do it? Three thousand pounds seems an awful lot of money to spend, particularly at a time when domestic gas prices are set to go down, not up. And how can we be sure that the promised savings will materialise? Will we even stay in the house long enough to earn the payback. And if we don't will the house command a higher price in the market because of the extra work we carry out? Our initial reaction is to sit tight: there are too many uncertainties. Besides, with a bit of effort - draught-proofing some windows, turning down the radiator valves a notch - we can probably achieve savings without spending any money at all. I'm sure the experience will also have a subliminal effect: we'll be more energy-conscious without even realising it.</p>

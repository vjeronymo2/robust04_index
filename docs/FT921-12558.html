			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: What the authoress said to the abbe - Two friends who were part of the charmed circle of the French Enlightenment A WOMAN, A MAN AND TWO KINGDOMS by Francis Steegmuller Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 17.90, 280 pages HUMAN REASON had one of its apogees in 18th century Europe, and Paris was its capital. Steegmuller's delightful book throws wide a pair of French windows onto this bright epoch by depicting the friendship between two of its principal characters, a Parisian authoress, Louise d'Epinay, and a brilliant Neapolitan diplomat, the abbe Galiani. These lively figures were in the first circle of those who made the French Enlightenment. The editor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, was an intimate friend of both: as were Voltaire, d'Holbach and Rousseau. Most of this circle adhered to the distinguishing principle of the Enlightenment: that the unfettered exercise of reason can save humanity by ending the ignorance which impedes progress and keeps tyrants in power. This view was shared by many of Europe's intellectuals. It was therefore an age of debate. In London the bourses of ideas were the coffee houses, in Paris they were the salons. Paris's preeminence made it a gathering place for the gifted of all Europe, who met in the apartments of the famous bluestocking hostesses: Madame Geoffrin, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, and the latter's one-time mentor, the blind and formidable Marquise du Deffand, who remarked of St Denis's achievement in walking to Paris with his head under his arm: 'il n'y a que le premier pas qui coute.' Another of the salons, different from these in being more intimate and relaxed, where guests could kick off their shoes and talk freely, and where therefore genuine friendships flourished, was provided by the woman whom Voltaire called 'the eagle in a gossamer cage': Louise d'Epinay. Louise was the only child of an aristocratic but impoverished family. After her father's death she was brought up by an uncle, an immensely rich tax-farmer. She married the tax-farmer's son, who in the required manner turned out to be a drunkard and a gambler, and who dissipated his father's estate within a few years of inheriting it. The marriage ended in all but name when Louise found herself suffering a venereal disease he had brought home from the Paris stews. After the fashion of the time Louise established a de facto marriage elsewhere, which produced two children; later she had a long and happy liaison with Melchior Grimm, diplomat and polymath, a contributor to the Encyclopedie and, like his friend Diderot, an adviser to Catherine the Great of Russia. At La Chevrette. Louise's country estate outside Paris, she and Grimm entertained members of the charmed circle, among them the extraordinary Ferdinando Galiani, a tiny man possessed of a towering intellect. Shortly before her death Louise became the first recipient of the Prix Moynton, instituted by the French Academy for works 'beneficial to society.' It honoured her dialogue Les conversations d'Emilie, a discussion of education - a topic which, before the breach in their friendship, she and Rousseau had often debated, for the age's hopes rested on educating future generations according to Enlightenment principles. But it is her autobiographical novel L'Histoire de Madame de Montbrillant for which she is best known. Begun when she was thirty and published posthumously, it was hailed by Saint-Beuve as the best description of 18th century France. 'Madame d'Epinay's memoirs are not a book,' he wrote, 'they are an epoch.' Between the little abbe and Louise there grew an enduring and affectionate intellectual comradeship. Galiani had attracted the notice of Naples when still very young, with his monograph On Money and his scholarly work on Italian antiquities. Later he wrote one of the few treatises on economics to be regarded at the same time as a literary classic, the famous Dialogue on the Grain Trade. It is a loss to learning and literature that his chief endeavours as a writer were, for most of his working life, dedicated to official reports. When Galiani was first accredited to the court of Versailles he hated Paris: it was cold, foggy and wet, and he wrote plaintive letters home begging to be recalled. But when he entered salon society he found himself lionized by it for his wit and erudition, and an enduring love affair sprang up between him and the city. Years later, when he was obliged to quit Paris permanently, he was heartbroken; but his doing so was the occasion for his correspondence with Louise, who undertook to keep him in touch with Paris and its doings, and who faithfully honoured her promise. Galiani reciprocated by writing to her of life at Naples. The resulting exchange provides the basis for Steegmuller's portrait of their friendship and the age in which it flourished. Steegmuller here displays the same gracefully sure touch as in his biography of Apollinaire. The result is a very good book, full of pleasure and instruction. It deftly portrays a civilised aspect of history's finer side, and makes one long to see it restored.</p>

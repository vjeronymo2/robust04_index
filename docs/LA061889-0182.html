			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PISTONS WIN TITLE WITH HUGE ASTERISK ATTACHED  </P> <P> Get out the asterisk, and make it the giant size. Now, attach it to Detroit's  sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers.  </P> <P> Roger Maris is off the hook, if you know what I mean. The Pistons are  officially champions of the National Basketball Association, but they had to  struggle mightily to beat a crippled Lakers team that would be fortunate to  compete with the Washington Bullets.  </P> <P> Because the Lakers weren't making any excuses Tuesday night, I'll make them for  them.  </P> <P> You had only to look at the bench. See Magic Johnson in sweats and a Lakers  T-shirt. See Byron Scott in a suit. See the Lakers all dressed up with nowhere  to go, and yet, for the three consecutive games, they played the Pistons into  the final minute.  </P> <P> A healthy Lakers team probably wins another NBA championship. Find two working  hamstrings and marry them to Johnson and Scott, and the king, now officially  dead, might be breathing yet.  </P> <P> The bad boys were bad. I don't mean rough (though Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn  did their part). I mean bad. I mean that Isiah Thomas was hardly a factor and  that Mark Aguirre might as well have been on the end of leash.  </P> <P> The white-hot intensity that had marked their defense all year rarely surfaced.  What we did see, however, was inspiring play from Joe Dumars and the expected  unconscious offense from Vinnie Johnson and more inspiration from Dennis Rodman  and important points from Mahorn and James Edwards.  </P> <P> Already deeper than the opposition, the Pistons, in the end, swamped the  Lakers, who once had a 16-point lead but would need important minutes from the  likes of Jeff Lamp and David Rivers.  </P> <P> And so, a sweep. And with it, the end of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who looked as if  the time machine he discovered in Game 3 had suddenly lurched wildly into the  future.  </P> <P> He went out with seven points and three rebounds and the roar of the Lakers'  crowd. His teammates gave him an ovation, and so did the Pistons. The 24 points  and 13 rebounds he managed on Sunday would have been the way to go out, but you  don't get to pick your endings in real life.  </P> <P> It was an uncharacteristic finish for Abdul-Jabbar, who has helped define  basketball for a generation and more. With three NCAA championships and six  more in 20 NBA seasons, Abdul-Jabbar has suffered few such defeats in his  career. The wounded Lakers looked to him one last time, but Abdul-Jabbar, human  after all, is 42, without hair and now, finally, retired. It was time to take  the sky hook and go home.  </P> <P> Instead, the Lakers found James Worthy, last year's MVP in this series, who  scored a career-high 40 points. He wasn't enough.  </P> <P> It was the Pistons who fell last year in seven games in a series they might  have won and who came back to put together the best record in the regular  season.  </P> <P> Before the playoffs, they were the best team. Once the playoffs began, the  Lakers became the Lakers again, unbeaten through 11 games and dominant as of  old.  </P> <P> It looked like a great matchup until Scott was lost before Game 1 and Johnson  during Game 2. The series was over when Johnson, who tried to play in Game 3,  couldn't. The Lakers could have played out the string, but they didn't. Maybe  that's how you win five championships in a decade.  </P> <P> As the game began, it was suggested that, with Magic on the bench, Isiah Thomas  might kiss Tony Campbell at the tap. In fact, of those three great friends --  Thomas, Johnson and Aguirre -- Johnson made by far the greatest contribution.  He provided inspiration; he provided a lift. You knew where he was -- on the  bench, rooting his giant heart out.  </P> <P> For much of the game, you couldn't find his two buddies. Aguirre, of course,  has made a career of losing big games, dating back to all those early-round  losses playing with DePaul. A controversial midseason trade, some say  engineered by Thomas, sent Adrian Dantley in exchange for Aguirre, who will, as  a result, win his first ring -- if he has the guts to wear it.  </P> <P> A career 25-points-a-game scorer, Aguirre scored 28 points in the first three  games of this series. Those, of course, were the good old days. With the  Pistons struggling Tuesday night, Aguirre scored two points.  </P> <P> But it's his little friend, Isiah, the transcendent talent, who truly  disappoints. He scored 14 points. But it was Dumars, again, who stepped up when  the game counted. Thomas cried at the end, and he's a great player, but when  you see him on the floor with Magic Johnson, you understand where greatness  resides.  </P> <P> As the Lakers decade ends, it won't be with a "three-peat." It will be with the  Pistons, one of only five teams to play in the finals in the 1980s. The Pistons  are a fine team. The Lakers might have been better, though. It's something, of  course, that we'll never know.  </P></p>

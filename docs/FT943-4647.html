			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Gorbachev changes his mind A German government spokesmen said yesterday that former Soviet leader Mr Mikhail Gorbachev had backtracked on his denial that the Soviet Union had insisted that Bonn must respect Communist land seizures as a condition for the unification of Germany. The spokesman said Mr Gorbachev made clear in talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn that his comments last week meant only that he had not personally discussed the issue with Mr Kohl in the unification negotiations in 1990. Soviet administrators took about 3.3m hectares of land, much of it held by Prussian nobility, and gave it to peasants and collective farms between the end of the second world war and the founding of East Germany in 1949. The original landowners have since tried to reclaim their property but Germany's constitutional court ruled in 1991 that the land could not be returned because Bonn argued its policy was crucial to unification.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in four installments by reporters Shuzo Mochida, </F> Midori Matsushima, Ko Hirai, Seiichi Nakamura, and Go Soga]  <H5>  [15 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Yamagishi Claims He Was "Double-Crossed by  Prime Minister"; Labor Moves Faster Than SDPJ Toward Tripolar  Setup    "The pace of political realignment is fast." "We must  eventually form a new party by uniting the liberal forces of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP]."    The four chairmen, Morishige Goto of All-Japan Prefectural  and Municipal Workers' Union [Jichiro], Eiichi Yokoyama of Japan  Teachers' Union [Nikkyoso], Kyuji Sonoki of Japan  Telecommunications Workers' Union [Zendentsu], and Mototaka Ito  of Japan Postal Workers' Union [Zentei], met on the evening of 8  February at the "Yama-no-Ue Hotel" in Kanda, Tokyo. At noon that  day, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosakawa had just withdrawn the  plan for the national welfare tax that he had personally  proposed. "The power of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito is too strong." The four chairmen were in agreement on  the above-mentioned views.    Ten days earlier, the political reform bill to install the  combined small-constituency and proportional representation  systems had passed the Diet. How should Rengo and the  independent industrial unions handle the elections? How can we  keep up with the Shinseito-Komeito bloc while maintaining the  coalition regime? The attention of labor leaders, who took pride  in having "supported the SDPJ with both money and personnel,"  was turning from the "SDPJ" to a "new political force."  <H5>  Triggered by Tax Reduction Issue </H5>   The "tripolar setup proposal," with the SDPJ-DSP liberal  group as the axis and Rengo's industrial unions, formerly  affiliated with Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions], as the  nucleus, took on a sense of reality as a result of the income  tax reduction and consumption tax hike issues.    "I believe there is someone who is saying various things to  the chairman, but he is mistaken."    On the evening of 16 December 1993, when coordination was in  the final stages as to whether the FY94 budget should be  compiled before the yearend or carried over to this year, Ichiro  Ozawa, Shinseito's acting secretary general, made the above  remark to Rengo chairman Akira Yamagishi and Etsuya Washio,  secretary general, who were pressing for the "yearend."    Immediately before this, Ozawa had strongly demanded the  removal of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to Prime  Minister Hosokawa at his official residence. By "someone who is  saying various things," he meant Takemura who was advocating  compilation by yearend.    Ozawa said: "If the compilation is to be completed before  yearend, the consumption tax must be considered so the SDPJ,  too, will be in a predicament. I am concerned about that."    Yamagishi said, "I do not think we have to rely so much on  what the Ministry of Finance says."    The gap was not bridged.  <H5>  Oppose Ozawa and Ichikawa </H5>   On 9 January 1994, Yamagishi stated on a TV program that, "a  new nonconservative, liberal party should be formed," and  suggested Hosokawa and Takemura, as well as Takahiro Yokoji,  Hokkaido governor, as leaders of the new party. When asked how  about Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary general,  Yamagishi replied, "I'm not even considering them."    This was not the first time that Yamagishi mentioned the  "tripolar setup." He had mentioned that on a TV program  immediately after formation of the coalition government last  summer. However, at that time, he had notified the Ozawa group  beforehand that "they shouldn't be too concerned." At the timne,  Yamagishi was facing the election for Rengo chairmanship so he  probably wanted to indicate to union members that he was  distancing himself from Shinseito. However, the tripolar setup  proposal early this year came as a "surprise."    Then came the uproar over the national welfare tax.  Yamagishi  said "he felt as though he was double-crossed by the prime  minister," and called an emergency executive committee meeting  of the Rengo in response to the requests of Takemura and SDPJ  chairman Tomiichi Murayama. After confirming that opinions  favored "separating tax reductions from tax increases,"  Yamagishi opposed the course set by Ozawa and Ichikawa. Takemura  told his aides that "the schema has now been designed for a  confrontation between Rengo and Soka Gakkai, both of which have  national organizations."    The "tripolar proposal" gained momentum. On 16 February, a  little more than a week after the meeting of the four industrial  labor union chairmen, Masatada Kitagawa, deputy secretary  general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and one of the  leaders of the group prepared to leave the party, visited  Yamagishi. He said, "In that event, we want the support of  Rengo."  <H5>  Working on Yokoji, Too </H5>   Chairman Goto of Jichiro had dinner with Governor Yokoji on  23 February. "Multiple leaders will have to share  responsibilities in the new political entity. You are one of  them." Yokoji stated that he planned to participate actively  after the budget was approved by the Hokkaido prefectural  assembly and, on the following day, he was also persuaded by  Yamagishi that, "political reorganization will proceed even if  you are not there but it would be better if you are."    At a Chinese restaurant in Akasaka in the evening of 2  March,  political department chiefs of 10 industrial-labor unions,  including Jichiro and Nikkyoso, six Diet members of the Sakigake  [Harbinger] new party, including Hidemasa Tanaka, former prime  minister's special assistant, and five young SDPJ Diet members,  as well as former SDPJ Diet members, met for the first time.    Listening to the remarks of a Sakigake Diet member (formerly  LDP) that, "until a year ago, we were like enemies; times have  changed," Yoshito Senya, former SDPJ Diet member, felt somewhat  concerned about the fact that "labor unions were moving much  faster than the SDPJ."  <H5>  [16 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Repetition of "Piggyback Rides"--Labor Unions  Tire of Supporting SDPJ    "It is necessary to develop the power to take over the  government."    In the fall of 1991, when the SDPJ formed a "shadow cabinet"  claiming "it would become the ruling party," a request for  political fund support was made confidentially to the "Sohyo  center" by Tanabe's executive staff.    Financially endowed Jichiro, Zentei, Zendentsu, and Nikkyoso  ultimately advanced approximately 80 million yen. Actions aimed  at breaking away from the image of a "labor union party" were  dependent again on labor unions.    "Riding piggyback all the way"--that is how a certain  industrial union leader sarcastically described the relationship  between the SDPJ and labor unions.    In last year's general elections, "the labor union council  for unity with the SDPJ" collected approximately 450 million yen  from participating independent unions and presented the money to  the party. Because of the ceiling established in the Political  Fund Control Law, the party treated most of the money as "loans."  <H5>  "Loans" Advanced in Each Election </H5>   Actually, during the days of the "Sohyo Center" and "Sohyo,"  precedidng bodies of the "unity council," much larger amounts of  "loans" had been advanced whenever elections were held. However,  with the disbandment of the lending bodies, these loans were  "dissolved" (SDPJ official). These were actually political  contributions and there was no intention to repay.    In the 1992 upper house elections, each industrial union  gave  approximately 80 million yen to the party for every union  candidate it put up in the proportional representation  districts. With multiple organizational candidates to sponsor,  industrial unions exceeded the ceiling of the control law. There  were cases when "a portion was kept confidential" (a certain  industrial union leader).    For the labor unions, these "political actions" were aimed  at  obtaining personal benefits, of course, such as increasing the  wages of government workers and securing a "shortcut" to meeting  various demands concerning "systems and policies."    However, the "productive results" of the SDPJ under the  LDP's  one-party rule were inevitably limited to such actions as "we  forced replies from cabinet members" or "we forced supplementary  resolutions to be appended." As one industrial union leader puts  it, "ultimately, it was only a fight for conditional gains."    Significant environmental changes were occurring to directly  affect labor unions which had begun to feel a sense of "fatigue"  in their relations with the SDPJ. The 1987 partition and  privatization of the Japan National Railways [JNR] shocked  Zentei, which was a target of similar privatization, and  Zendentsu, which feared partitioning. A sense of crisis spread  that, "repetition of the failure of the National Railway  Workers' Union [Kokuro] must be avoided."    Furthermore, Rengo's establishment in 1989 hastened changes  in the awareness of former Sohyo affiliates, particularly the  leaders of the Government and Public Workers' Union [Kankoro],  which had been the nucleus of SDPJ support. A Jichiro executive  states: "I personally felt the perceptions being held by private  sector labor unions. Private sector members, who can be abruptly  handpicked for dismissal, have a different sense of realism. I  was impressed by their careful consideration of the future  outlook of the economy and enterprises."  <H5>  Disappointment Becomes Overwhelming </H5>   Moreover, union members were definitely "detaching  themselves  from the SDPJ." A poll survey showed that "support for SDPJ" did  not even reach 20 percent. Funds for the SDPJ had been collected  from these union members as "political enlightenment funds" or  "political struggle funds."    The shadow cabinet was the topic of conversation for a  while,  with such assertions as, "conditional approval of the `Rising  Sun,'" but it soon lost its popularity. In early 1992, labor  unions refused to give financial support to the second shadow  cabinet, saying "it was useless."    In June of that year, the process of establishing the UN  Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation Law, during which the  SDPJ used delay tactics and submitted Diet members' resignation  requests, made the labor unions' disappointment an overwhelming  one. "We were truly disappointed because resignation requests  were submitted, but no one left the Diet members' quarters"  (leading industrial union executive).  <H5>  "Disbandment" Not Forecast </H5>   In the upper house election the following month, all of the  candidates officially designated by Rengo were defeated. During  that summer, the leaders of the main industrial unions,  including Etsuya Washio (Japan Federation of Iron and Steel  Workers' Union [Tekko Roren]), Kyuji Sonoki (Zendentsu),  Mototaka Ito (Zentei), Teruhito Tokumoto (Federation of Japan  Automobile Workers' Union [Jidosha Soren]), Yasuo Iwayama  (Japanese Federation of Electrical Workers' Union [Denki  Rengo]), and Morishige Goto (Jichiro), met for earnest  discussions on the way support to political parties should be  handled.    From that summer to fall, the participants revealed, one  after another, the results of the discussions in speeches to  general meetings of various industrial unions.    "The time might come for the SDPJ to disband." "It is  impossible to form a replacement party by realigning the  existing political parties." "Setting up a new party of  `like-minded politicians' has the most potential."    However, they did not have a firm outlook for the future.    With the split of the LDP's Takeshita faction at yearend,  the  political world moved suddenly to a change in governmental reins  and election system reforms, and no one among the labor leaders  anticipated that formation of a "new party" would become a  realistic task so soon.  <H5>  [17 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Successful in Longstanding Wish To Cooperate  With Conservatives--Rengo Is Concerned About "Next Scheme"    Born in the mid-1930's, the three persons who might be  called  the new leaders of the labor circle were telling each other that  "governmental change cannot be accomplished simply by marshaling  opposition parties," and had been considering the formation of a  new force linked to a conservative segment.    They are Etsuya Washio, Tekko Roren chairman; Teruhito  Tokumoto, Jidosha Soren chairman; and, Kyuji Sonoki, Zendentsu  chairman.    On the evening of 14 September 1992, along with Jinnosuke  Ashida, chairman of the Japanese Federation of Textile, Garment,  Chemical, Mercantile, and Allied Industry Workers' Unions  [Zensen Domei], they met with Ichiro Ozawa, who was then the  representative chairman of the LDP Takeshita faction, at the All  Nippon Airways hotel in Akasaka.  <H5>  Leaders' Meeting Was Turning Point </H5>   When Ozawa explained that "LDP members will probably come to  agreement on a simple small constituency system," the labor  union officials objected, saying "no opposition party will  accept that proposal." Both sides were thinking about "spreading  the wings" (Washio) of the tie-up, but at this time agreement  was within grasp but failed.    What triggered a change in the labor circle's attitude was  the meeting between Rengo chairman Yamagishi and Ozawa, which  took place on 20 February of the following year, following the  split of the LDP's Takeshita faction in the fall of 1992. Ozawa  asserted that carrying out the electoral system reform was the  shortcut to political reorganization.    Ozawa: "The LDP has presented a plan. I'd like to see the  opposition parties submit a plan, too."    Yamagishi: "All right. We'll try to do that."    Ozawa: "Depending on circumstances, I might leave the LDP."    On 22 March, Yamagishi also met with Yuichi Ichikawa,  Komeito  secretary general. In response to Ichikawa's statement, "if the  SDPJ splits and the reformist faction leaves, I want Rengo's  support," Yamagishi replied, "of course." Three days later,  Yamagishi met with Morihiro Hosokawa, representative of the  Japan New Party [JNP], and said, "I plan to take care of the JNP  from now on."  <H5>  Support for New Parties in General Elections </H5>   The labor circle, which firmly believed that "the political  situation was certain to become fluid" (Sonoki), tried to get  the SDPJ to move with the tide. The vehicle was the "SDPJ Reform  Diet Members' Union (Giren)," led by Makoto Tanabe, former SDPJ  chairman.    In the evening of 18 February, immediately prior to the  Yamagishi-Ozawa meeting, at a gathering which included both  Yamagishi and Washio, as well as Jichiro chairman Morishige  Goto, Tanabe had shown a prospectus for formation of the Giren  in order to "create a force to establish a new political power  base" and had requested the cooperation of Yamagishi and others.    Installed in April, the reformist Giren group worked on the  party's executive committee to take bold steps toward election  system reform. Jichiro, Nikkyoso, Zendentsu, Zentei, Tekko  Roren, and Denki Rengo collected approximately 20 million yen  for Giren.    Tanabe's group had planned to make Giren the core in forming  a new mainstream faction, but the goal of the labor circle lay  further ahead. The aim was to use Giren as one of the filters in  the "selection process" for election support and to nurture it  as a "preparatory force to split the SDPJ."    "I want the selection process to be dropped." So objected  Sadao Yamahana, then SDPJ chairman. But Tanabe began to concede  gradually, "it cannot be helped."    While conducting the "selection process," the labor circle  strengthened its tie-up with the new conservative parties. On 17  June, the day before dissolution of the lower house, in a  meeting with Ashida, Hosokawa showed a chart of electoral  districts and rebuked him for Zensen Domei's election  cooperation. For some reason, Hosokawa expressed displeasure  over support for Zensen-recommended DSP candidates in a number  of electoral districts, though JNP had no candidate. Ashida  learned at this time that Masayoshi Takemura and others were  leaving the LDP on the following day.    On 25 June, just before the official announcement of general  elections, leaders of eight industrial labor unions, namely,  Jichiro, Zendentsu, Zentei, Tekko Roren, Denki Rengo, Jidosha  Soren, Federation of Electrical Workers' Unions of Japan  [Denryoku Soren], and Zensen Domei, met in a Tokyo hotel and  agreed to widen election support to JNP and Sakigake, and even  Shinseito, bypassing the old lineup of "former Sohyo-SDPJ" and  "former Domei-DSP."    With the subsequent participation of the Japanese  Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Workers' Unions  [Zosen Juki Roren], the "Nine Union United Front" performed the  function of "confidentially manipulating" labor union votes to  support the election of non-LDP candidates, including those of  the new conservative parties.  <H5>  Mixture of Success and Miscalculation </H5>   The birth of a "non-LDP coalition government" and SDPJ's  dismal loss of half of the Diet seats... the general elections  brought a mixture of success and miscalculation to the labor  unions.    With the "Nine Union United Front" as the base, Rengo will  enter into discussions on forming a new political force that it  recommends in the second-phase political realignment. Will it be  a "SDPJ-DSP liberal" alliance that is recommended by former  Sohyo-affiliates, including Jichiro, or will a coalition  framework, including the Shinseito and Komeito, be given  priority? Rengo, which succeeded for the moment in concerted  actions with conservatives, must face new problems again.  <H5>  [18 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Tide Changes Abruptly Under Central  Leadership--Confusion and Opposition Among Local Organizations    A gay mood surrounded the 40th anniversary celebration of  Jichiro's founding, held on the evening of 22 February at a  Tokyo hotel, to which Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP  Policy Affairs Research Council, and Yuriko Koike, JNP Diet  member, were invited. However, four Jichiro "organizational Diet  members," including upper house members Tetsuo Yamaguchi and  Sango Sato, were missing.  <H5>  Aftereffects of "Rebellion" Continue </H5>   Yamaguchi and his cohorts voted against the political reform  bill in the upper house plenary session on 21 January, and, four  days later, the Jichiro headquarters decided to "freeze  relations" with the four Diet members. Soon thereafter,  Yamaguchi and his cohorts were notified by the Jichiro  secretariat that "invitations to the ceremony will be canceled."    From the start, the atmosphere was acrimonious at the  meeting  of representatives of Jichiro's SDPJ Members' Council held in  the Makuhari International Conference Hall in Chiba City on the  evening of the 20th, two days before the ceremony.    When upper house member Yubun Ueno, who succeeded as  "Jichiro's Diet Members' Council chairman" after Yamaguchi's  withdrawal following the "rebellious" act, remarked that "to  begin with, Yamaguchi had not been the proper persom to become  the council chairman," Ichiu Kimishima, secretary general of the  Nagano prefectural headquarters, retorted, "the same applies to  you--Jichiro, too, had opposed the small constituency system at  last summer's general meeting."    Subsequently, about 10 regional representatives objected to  the headquarters' decision, saying "there are relations between  local regions and Diet members, too, so it was not proper for  the headquarters to decide on the punishment without consulting  us."  <H5>  "Coalition Overvalued" </H5>   The actions of labor circle leaders, who are steering boldly  in the rapid current of political reorganization, are being  watched with skeptical eyes by local labor union bosses. These  "party activists" of labor unions are the ones who supported the  SDPJ in elections and Jichiro was truly the nucleus.    In late December, after the SDPJ agreed to partial  liberalization of the rice market, Kimishima, secretary general  of Nagano prefectural headquarters, protested to other labor  union leaders and to the three executives of the party's  prefectural headquarters, that "We shouldn't be forced to go  along with the party's central headquarters beyond this point.  Many union members have the same complaint."    "Opposition to rice liberalization had been the constant  pillar of our movement. If a unified candidate is to be put up  by the ruling coalition party in the future, the banners of  `constitutional safeguard and peace' might be lowered. If that  is so, what is the labor union movement for?"    At the Zentei central committee meeting on 7 February, when  chairman Mototaka Ito cautioned that, "political developments  will unfold under central headquarters' leadership--local  regions should refrain from acting independently," Isamu  Hayashi, secretary general of Kyoto District headquarters,  objected.    "The coalition regime is being evaluated somewhat too  highly.  To begin with, what kind of a political party is the Shinseito  or Sakigake? It is not convincing simply to say that the  decision was made by Rengo."    Kyoto does not have a SDPJ representative in the Diet.  Hayashi, too, thinks that labor unions cannot continue to  function forever in "support of SDPJ." He says, "Therefore,  Zentei should concentrate on its basic union activities and stop  proposing political party support."  <H5>  Uncertainty About Election Support </H5>   Former Sohyo-affiliated labor unions in Kagawa Prefecture  are  now conducting a signature-collection campaign to oppose hikes  in the consumption tax rate. Unions are troubled about how the  significance of SDPJ's entry into the government should be  interprreted but they are certain the movement to "oppose the  national welfare tax" has the unanimous agreement of members.    In lower house elections, which will change to the small  constituency system, these labor unions are concerned that they  might be asked by the central headquarters to support Shigeaki  Tsukihara, Shinseito Diet member (Kagawa 2d District). Tsukihara  is a former Defense Agency bureaucrat and was a "defense zoku"  Diet member during his LDP days. Masahiro Miyake, Jichiro's  prefectural headquarters chairman, states, "we can never support  him."    On 19 March, Yamagata Prefecture's labor unions, such as  Zentei and Jichiro, will hold a lecture meeting in Yonezawa City  on the subject of "constitutional safeguard and peace," with  House Speaker Takako Doi as the lecturer. Soon after the  coalition government was formed, planning was started, fearing  "can peace be preserved by a regime led by Ichiro Ozawa's  Shinseito?" Feeling uncertain about "future actions" of the  central union headquarters and the SDPJ, an action committee was  formed, including conservative elements and youth groups, and  the support of municipal education committees was also secured.    With the realization of the electoral system reform, Jichiro  and Nikkyoso must conclude their reassessment of the policy to  "support only the SDPJ" at this summer's general meetings to  prepare for election campaign support. The move toward formation  and support of a "SDPJ-DSP liberal" bloc by the former  Sohyo-affiliated labor unions is their last resort for  realignment out of consideration for resistance by these local  organizations to Shinseito, et al.  <H5>  [19 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Channel to Government Secured--Will It Lead to  Better Livelihood?    "We will not stage a demonstration today. That is  unfashionable."    Rengo's "Spring Offensive General Rally" was held at noon on  the 12th in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park. Most of chairman Akira  Yamagishi's address was devoted to "politics," such as attacks  on the LDP, which was boycotting deliberations on tax reductions  and the budget bill.    "Is it impossible now to persuade the SDPJ?" In late  February, when the government was wavering about the cabinet  reshuffle, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokaea telephoned Yamagishi  to sound out his feelings. Before the seven-nation ministerial  meeting on employment (employment summit), which was held early  this week, Jinnosuke Ashida, representing the Rengo chairman,  phoned Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and advised  him that "it would be unwise to send only the labor minister  from the cabinet."  <H5>  Spring Offensive Follows Usual Pattern </H5>   Rengo, which served as one of the driving forces in the  birth  of the coalition regime, secured a channel to the government  that would have been unimaginable during the LDP rule. Even the  industrial unions are enthusiastic: "The struggle now takes  place before government policies are announced" (Hideyuki  Suzuki, chief of Jichiro's political policy bureau).    However, within Rengo ranks, dissatisfaction is constantly  smoldering that "the emphasis is on politics, not economics."  With labor unions on the government's side, can wages be  increased satisfactorily and will employment become secure?  Unless the political realignment leads to better livelihood, it  might be likened to playing with fire.    In the spring offensive, the Rengo executive committee  proposed "restructuring of the spring offensive," such as  "changing the batting order" and dispersing the peak struggles,  centered on the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus  Workers' Unions of Japan [Shitetsu] and Zendentsu, which have  been relatively unaffected by the economy. However, the usual  pattern had to be followd eventually because the industrial  unions would not consent.    As the wage structure becomes fluid with widening  differences  in business performances of industrial groups, as exemplified by  the increase in ratio of tertiary industries, and the  introduction of the annual salary system, how effective is the  "showdown tactic" aimed at fulfilling demands by opposing  management with a united labor front?    "The present spring offensive pattern was adopted in 1956.  This is another version of the `1955 setup.' Spring offensive  restructuring cannot be carried out unless there is an agreement  of views with management." This remark was made by none other  than Yamagishi while facing the spring offensive peak struggle.  Now that the schema of LDP government and management versus SDPJ  and labor unions has been overturned, new relationships with  management must be found.  <H5>  Policies Still in "Request Mode" </H5>   From the management side, even statements such as, "except  for the single item of wage increases, we have no  confrontational issues with Rengo" (Takeshi Nagano, chairman of  Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' Associations] can be  heard. Conversely, the National Confederation of Trade Unions  [Zenroren], which strongly supports the Japan Communist Party,  criticizes that, "by establishing wage demand bases below last  year's, Rengo showed that it was for labor-management unity."    In 1975, Yamagishi headed the "strike for striking rights"  as  acting secretary general of the Council of Public Corporations  and Government Enterprises Workers' Unions [Kororen]. Only  Yamagishi, with the demeanor of a "fighter," could've taken the  strongly leftist industrial unions in tow and guided  labor-political relations thus far. However, the poor showing in  the spring offensive cannot be explained away simply by saying  that Rengo is now on the government's side.    What are the labor unions, which are now on the government's  side, going to do hereafter? Recently, there have been heated  discussions in Rengo ranks that "Rengo policies are still in the  `request mode'--that must be changed to the `proposal mode.'"  However, there are hardly any discussions on how to coordiate  labor union demands and government policies.    For example, Zendentsu, which is Yamagishi's base, joined in  the past with management and the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications to oppose the privatization of Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT] and is now opposing its  partitioning. This position is an extension of the old setup  with the addition of "labor" to the "postal family," i.e.,  "government, bureaucracy, and business," and runs counter to the  aim of "deregulation" announced by the Hosokawa regime.  <H5>  Perceptions Differ on Political Participation </H5>   Will it be the formation of a SDPJ-DSP liberal bloc or will  emphasis be placed on the framework of a ruling coalition? Even  before deciding on the course to take in the political  realignment, there is the problem of bridging the wide gap in  perceptions between the aggressive view of "Rengo will strongly  support the new party" (Morishige Goto, Jichiro chairman) and  conversely, "labor unions should abandon the posture of  selecting a party and fully supporting it with money and  personnel" (Teruhito Tokumoto, Jidosha Soren chairman).    It seems that the labor circle will require more time to  locate a new coordinate axis for politics which is undergoing a  great transformation.</p>

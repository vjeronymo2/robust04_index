			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Property Trust continues recovery with Pounds 737,000 A TURNROUND from pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.95m to profits of Pounds 737,000 was announced by The Property Trust for the year to March 31. The outcome followed a return to the black in the first half with profits of Pounds 426,000 against losses of Pounds 6.32m. The property investment and trading group said the year had been one of 'significant progress', featuring a restructuring involving a capital reduction, consolidation of shares, introduction to the Official List, and a fully-subscribed Pounds 2.8m rights issue. As a result, shareholders' funds improved to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 4.7m). Turnover fell from Pounds 9.52m to Pounds 2.48m, but there were operating profits of Pounds 1.48m, against losses of Pounds 7.26m. There was no tax and earnings per share emerged at 5.6p (88.1p losses). The company said the new loan facilities were expected to provide an annual interest saving of about Pounds 100,000.</p>

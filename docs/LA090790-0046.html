			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST ROUTED BY IVORY COAST POLICE  </P> <P> Police used tear gas and truncheons Thursday to disperse government opponents  who tried to hold a protest march in the city center.  </P> <P> It was the second time in a week that opposition parties have been prevented  from marching. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny legalized opposition parties in  May after unprecedented unrest in this West African nation, but authorities  have often refused the parties permission to hold rallies.  </P> <P> Authorities alleged that the government opponents hope to disrupt the visit of  Pope John Paul II, who arrives Sunday to consecrate the huge basilica that  Houphouet-Boigny has built in his hometown of Yamoussoukro.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKER ROOMS  </P> <P> Your editorial "Foul Play" (Nov. 29) fails to address the real problem of  female or male reporters in locker rooms -- the insufferable stupidity of both  questions and answers.  </P> <P> I think we all would grant that, yes, had the losing team  caught/carried/defended with greater zeal and alacrity, the outcome would have  been different.  </P> <P> Similarly, the winning team usually allows that, yes, it was in top form,  out-hustling, out-catching and outrunning its opponent.  </P> <P> Of course it did. Which is why the game is over, and there is a winner and a  loser. But do we really need more of these "interviews," dominated by the  phrase "y'know," uttered by the marginally articulate? Did anyone ever learn  anything from these confrontations?  </P> <P> Viewers would be better served if all reporters were absent from the locker  room. Let the athletes shower and dress, then answer urgent inquiries in the  proper setting. By then, most intelligent fans will have gone on to more  stimulating pastimes.  </P> <P> DON COULSON, Orange  </P></p>

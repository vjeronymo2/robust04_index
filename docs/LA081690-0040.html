			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ICE RINK EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS;  </P> <P> BURBANK: AFTER A CAMPAIGN BY SKATING ENTHUSIASTS, THE OWNERS OF THE PICKWICK  ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT THEY WILL KEEP IT OPEN.  </P> <P> A well-organized campaign by skating enthusiasts has caused the owners of  Burbank's Pickwick Ice Arena to reverse their decision to close the landmark  facility that has served as a training ground for several Olympic champions,  sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Owners Walter and Edward Stavert are expected to announce at a news conference  this morning that the 29-year-old rink will not close Sept. 30 as planned. The  Staverts announced in June that they were closing the arena, which is one of  the few Olympic-size rinks in Los Angeles, because operating costs were  prohibitive. Pickwick General Manager Frank Silvio has said the arena needs  about $500,000 in repairs.  </P> <P> Since the announcement, skating enthusiasts have rallied to save the rink, home  of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club. The club is one of the most competitive  in the nation and has nurtured such Olympic skating stars as Linda Fratianne,  Tiffany Chin and Christopher Bowman.  </P> <P> It is also a popular practice arena for many local hockey clubs. Olympic figure  skaters who referred to the facility as their second home joined the campaign.  </P> <P> Although Pickwick management has remained silent on the closure, regular  patrons of the rink said they have seen evidence that it will remain open.  </P> <P> John Halebian, chairman of the hastily organized Save the Ice Committee, said  signs announcing the rink's closure are no longer posted at the arena. George  Yates, secretary of the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Assn., said he was told  privately by rink management that the association should plan its 1990-91  season "under the assumption that the rink will remain open." And Nick  Nickerson, a 72-year-old hockey player, said Walter Stavert told him outright  that Pickwick will not be closed.  </P> <P> Rink Manager Cary Adams would not confirm directly that the rink will remain  open, but said the owners were strongly influenced by public reaction.  </P> <P> "It's a classic example of people making a difference," Adams said.  </P> <P> The Staverts began reconsidering their decision in July. Silvio said a  contractor was brought in to inspect the arena's leaking roof and discussions  began with Burbank officials about city involvement in keeping the rink open.  </P> <P> Although they voiced their support for the rink, Burbank city officials were  unwilling to spend money to prevent the closure. Supervisor Mike Antonovich had  wanted the rink to be included in the county's massive parks bond measure,  scheduled to appear on the November ballot. He later dropped the idea, but  retained the option of devoting funds not committed to any other project to the  arena if the measure is approved by voters.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Dave LePage contributed to this story.  </P></p>

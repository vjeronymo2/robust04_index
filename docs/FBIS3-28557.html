Pae Myong-kuk of the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] has decided to resign from  the central executive council and as chairman of the South  Kyongsang Provincial chapter of his party, it was reported  Monday. Pae is under suspicion of having conspired with an aide  to former Rep. Pak Chae-kyu to expose a scandal in which Pak had  received bribes amounting to 200 million won from his supporters  in 1989. Pae replaced Pak at the National Assembly after Pak's  conviction on charges of accepting the bribes. But two weeks  ago, Pak's aide came forward and said he had exposed the scandal  at the instigation of Pae, from whom he received 2 million won.    In resigning from the party post and the provincial  chairmanship, Pae took "moral responsibility" for the affair  when he called on DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su Monday  morning.    During the meeting, Mun said Pae apologized for causing  trouble for the party and the secretary-general.    "Rep. Pae will officially announce his intention to resign  from those posts Monday," Mun said.    Pae insisted, however, that he had not instigated former  Rep.  Pak's aide, Kim Tae-wol, to bring bribery charges against his  boss. But he admitted that he had given 2 million won to Kim  Tae-wol after learning that Pak had received bribes.</p>

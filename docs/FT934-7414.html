			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica's shares suspended SHARES in Nissan Motor Iberica, the majority-owned Spanish subsidiary of the Japanese carmaker, were suspended yesterday on the Madrid stock exchange. The suspension was at the request of the company, and followed sharp fluctuations in the share price in recent days. Shares in the company, which is 70.3 per cent-owned by Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, closed on Wednesday at Pta147. The price has slipped from a high for the year of Pta434 as the company's financial crisis has deepened. The company announced earlier this week it would be forced to undertake a drastic financial restructuring, including the write-off of around two-thirds of its share capital, which currently totals around Pta60bn (Dollars 436m). It is suffering heavy losses, forecast to total around Pta40bn for the full year. In the first nine months of the year, it plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pta28.01bn, against a loss of Pta5.44bn in the same period a year ago. Accumulated losses for 1992 and 1993 are expected to total around Pta54bn. These were to be funded by writing off existing reserves of around Pta13bn, and an equity write-off, it said earlier this week.</p>

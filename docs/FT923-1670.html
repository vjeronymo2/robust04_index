			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Enron thwarted in North Sea move: Group had ambitions to expand in UK gas marketing and natural gas liquids ENRON, one of the largest US gas companies, has been thwarted in its attempt to buy a block of North Sea gas production from Chevron, the oil company. The co-venturers  - British Gas, Phillips Petroleum and Agip  - have exercised their pre-emption rights. The operating agreement allows them to pre-empt for the same cash value as any offer received by Chevron. British Gas said that the purchase was not intended to keep a competitor out of the market but was made to secure further gas supplies. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Enron had characterised its offer for the block, known as J- Block containing the Joanna and Judy fields, as its first big step into the UK gas marketing and natural gas liquids business. The deal would have given it about 190bn cubic feet of gas, and 12.5m barrels of natural gas liquids, and established the company in both the upstream and downstream sides of the energy business. It would have allowed Enron to market large quantities of gas to power generators and big industrial users in north-east England, where it is leading a consortium to build one of the biggest power stations in the UK. Enron already had plans to market surplus gas from that project  - a 1,725 megawatt gas-fired power station at Imperial Chemical Industries' Site on Teesside, which will be supplied by the Amoco-operated Everest and Lomond fields. Mr Howard Martin, vice-president of Enron Europe, said he was disappointed that his company's J-Block ambitions had come to nothing, although it would continue to look aggressively for other opportunities to grow in the North Sea. He added that Enron was negotiating with the field partners over the possible purchase of gas from the J-Block development. Although it was known British Gas had a 6.34 per cent stake in the field, and hence the power to pre-empt the deal, many industry observers believed it was unlikely to do so because of the current Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the UK gas market. They felt it would be a political error for British Gas to be seen to be trying to block potential competitors.</p>

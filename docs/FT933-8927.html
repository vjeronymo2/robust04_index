			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie breaks through 3,000 barrier THE FT-SE 3,000 mark became the test of the stock market's virility yesterday and the successful challenge to this important benchmark dominated all other considerations. The pace was set by the stock index futures sector and it was the success of the September contract in breaking through to new highs that drove the stock market to its new peak. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at an all-time high of 3,006.1, a net gain of 34.5 on the day. Equities opened lower but London was soon encouraged by a further cut in interest rates in France. When the stock index futures opened, share prices began to move ahead and the 3,000 level on the Footsie was first challenged around mid-session. Heavy arbitrage trading developed, with the large securities firms endeavouring to profit by selling the future contract at its peak and then buying the underlying stocks. However, serious problems appeared when they found stock very difficult to find. A bidding competition soon commenced and share prices were driven yet further ahead. The upturn was checked for a while, however, when the selling of the future took the steam out of the situation. But buyers for the future soon reappeared and there was no holding either the September contract or the stock market. At best, the Footsie set a new trading high of 3,010.1. Trading volume, slow to begin with, rose sharply in the second half of the session and the final Seaq figure of 830.4m shares compared with 771.9m on Tuesday. Dealers maintained that the managers of the big investment funds had mostly kept out of yesterday's highly-charged market. In the previous session, customer, or genuine investment business in equities rose to Pounds 1.57bn, fully sustaining the excellent volume levels recorded over the past eleven months. The market was led by sectors expected to benefit from the cut in UK base rates which is now confidently expected this autumn. The banking sector, having ridden through its reporting season, renewed its advance, behind the lead of HSBC which continued to benefit from the good showing of its UK Midland banking subsidiary. Consumer stocks, including stores and brewers, were to the fore as investors looked for higher profits as the improvement in the UK economy feeds through. But the pharmaceutical sector, which has performed so poorly this year, continued to drag behind the rest of the market. Also weak again were shares in BOC, which shook the stock market this week with the issue of a veiled profits warning. Some analysts continued to warn that BOC's experience underlines worries over the high ratings on UK equities. With market firms totally preoccupied with the day's events, equity strategists were not hurrying to change longer term views on the market yesterday. The question asked at every meeting last night was whether the institutions will now come in to support share prices above 3,000 or whether they will stand back and see if prices can hold at these levels. At NatWest Securities, Mr Rob Buckland pointed out that the new bullish factor for equities over the past fortnight was the strength of the government bond market, and that much will depend on how this sector performs.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott calls for shipping radar MR JOHN Prescott, shadow transport secretary, yesterday called on the government to introduce radar surveillance of shipping routes in environmentally sensitive areas, saying the only measure 'rogue operators' would recognise was 'the possibility of getting caught'. But Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, cautioned that such a step would be 'extremely expensive'. Radar surveillance in the English channel had been effective in reducing accidents there by 85 per cent, he said. The exchanges followed last month's incident when the oil tanker Braer was wrecked off the Shetland Islands.</p>

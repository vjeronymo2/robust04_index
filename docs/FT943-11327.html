			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets: Fretting over whether the price is right - London How can the shares of a small grocery chain such as William Low nearly double in value within a fortnight? Easy: when Britain's biggest food retailer, J. Sainsbury, decides to change the habits of a lifetime and enter a bidding battle to prevent Tesco, its main rival, from snapping up the struggling Scottish company. Analysts fluently reel off reasons why the majors are keen to get their hands on Wm Low: it offers a shortcut to a strong market position and distribution network in Scotland, where it is increasingly difficult to obtain planning permission for more stores. Yet a fortnight ago these strategic assets were scarcely reflected in the Dundee group's share price, which had languished as the market focused on its shrinking sales and profit margins. The episode is a useful reminder that markets must try to combine judgments of both underlying value and short-term trading performance and outlook - and how inexact the results can be. The disparity between the current buoyancy of corporate results and increasing concern over some fundamental aspects of the UK economy explains the twitchy mood of the City, even although the FT-SE 100 index has now bounced by 206 points from its June low point of 2877. This week Imperial Chemical Industries increased its pre-tax profits by 40 per cent and the UK's largest chemicals company hailed 'the first tangible signs of a widespread recovery in our worldwide markets.' Lloyds Bank got the clearing banks' reporting season off to a solid start by confirming a sharp drop in bad debt provisions, but subdued demand for loans suggests customers will not forget the harsh lesson of recession in a hurry. Even beleaguered BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, was able to increase profits in spite of the growing backlash against smoking in the US. An important cloud overhanging the equity market was dispelled on Thursday, when the new price regime for the privatised water companies was revealed. Although the controls - known as K-factors - limit future price increases to 1 percentage point a year above inflation, analysts quickly concluded that most of the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies would be able to maintain dividend increases of 3 or 4 percentage points above inflation. However, the City's underlying nervousness had been demonstrated the previous day, when the FT-SE 100 shed 34.9 points to drop back through the 3,100 mark. The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey showed that improving exports were contributing to the fastest rise in order books for almost six years. But analysts were more concerned by indications that UK interest rates might have to be tightened sooner rather than later. Inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector picked up over the quarter, and relatively weak investment intentions fuelled fears that bottlenecks are developing. As the chart shows, capacity utilisation rates showed a further increase in July - and are already running well above their long-run average. The percentage balance of firms expecting to increase their expenditure on plant and machinery over the next 12 months was plus 6 per cent in July, compared with plus 4 per cent in April, so the capacity shortfall will not be quickly made good. The broker USB warns: 'This suggests that manufacturing industry has a woefully inadequate capital base, which could act as a severe constraint on future output growth. If demand growth remains strong, it is likely to fuel rising inflationary pressures and a burgeoning current account deficit.' The CBI survey showed that most British companies have not adjusted their investment criteria for low inflation and interest rates, in spite of warnings from the government that this is stifling investment. Many companies still demand that investment projects should either yield a rate of return above 20 per cent, or pay back the investment within three years. Companies also assume the government will not deliver its inflation promise. Their average prediction for inflation when considering investment projects is 5 per cent, compared with the government's target of bringing it below 2.5 per cent by the end of the parliament. Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, has cited the expectation of higher inflation as one factor that would call for tighter monetary policy. The market again took fright yesterday afternoon, when the Bank sold short-term Treasury bills at rates of up to 5.75 per cent - half a percentage point above the level of base rates. Some traders took this as a signal that UK interest rates were about to rise and the FT-SE 100 at one point had shed 37.5 points. It recovered to close just 13.3 points down on the day, as analysts concluded that the Bank had probably not been trying to send any such signal. However, it seems clear that concern over the timing and impact of the next rise in interest rates will continue to limit the pace of the market's advance - even if companies continue to report solid increases in profits and dividends. Next week's quarterly inflation bulletin is likely to emphasise the Bank's continuing hard line on monetary policy. Meanwhile, this weekend one can only envy the shareholders of Wm Low, who wait to see which suitor will stuff most cash into their pockets. Investors in Sainsbury, Tesco and the other large food chains are likely to be less sanguine. The enthusiasm with which this battle has been joined suggests that even the UK's most successful food retailers now face a much tougher and more competitive future.</p>

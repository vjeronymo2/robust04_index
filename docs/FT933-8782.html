			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / GPA rescue hits legal snag NEGOTIATIONS between GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, and GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of the US, have run into legal difficulties, delaying completion of the deal. Before any agreement is signed GE Capital has to satisfy itself that it will not be held liable for GPA's Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3.5bn) debts. The US group has agreed in principle to buy Dollars 1.35bn of GPA's aircraft. The aircraft would be managed, with GE's own fleet, by a new subsidiary run by several of GPA's existing executives. GE Capital's lawyers want to satisfy themselves that the new subsidiary could not be held responsible - by GPA's unsecured creditors for instance - for any of the group's liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement the debt would be left with GPA. GE Capital's lawyers also wish to ensure that directors of the subsidiary could not be seen to be 'shadow directors' of GPA, and thereby responsible for the company's obligations. A senior negotiator in the deal said: 'GE's lawyers are crawling all over the deal to ensure they can safely separate the obligations from the operations.' Mr Jack Hersch, research director at MJ Whitman, which specialises in selling bank debt, said: 'It is a very fine line to separate the responsibility for the operations from the obligations to repay debt'. GPA's advisers had hoped to file the prospectus with Irish Companies House on July 16 and hold an extraordinary general meeting this week. Both companies now hope to solve the legal difficulties by early next month followed by an EGM in October. GPA needs the support of holders of 75 per cent of its shares. The delay has also caused concern to some of the group's shareholders, who are reluctant to raise all of the additional Dollars 150m originally requested by GPA to ensure the deal's success. However, GPA now believes it no longer needs to raise as much because its cash balances are stronger. GE Capital's option, which is for 65 per cent of the group, could rise to 80 per cent if shareholders fail to raise additional funds. Bankers to the group, however, remain confident that some shareholders, if not as many as first envisaged, will take part in the underwriting. The option, which is costing GE Capital less than Dollars 200m, can be exercised as late as March 31, 1997.</p>

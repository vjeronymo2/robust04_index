			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Mixed blessings for the three Ps: Patients have benefited from the Citizen's Charter, but parents and passengers have not Mr John Major certainly did not intend to undersell his Citizen's Charter when he launched it in a white paper a year ago tomorrow. 'The Citizen's Charter is the most comprehensive programme ever to raise quality, increase choice, secure better value and extend accountability. It will ensure that quality of service to the public and the new pride it will give to those who work in the public services will be a central theme of government policy for the 1990s.' The prospectus bulged with more than 80 proposals for improving the UK's public services, ranging from the privatisation of British Rail to a special 'chartermark' for public services which met the highest standards of customer satisfaction. Users of public services were promised information about the quality of service they were entitled to expect and power to insist that performance targets were met. The white paper was followed by the launch of a series of charters covering different user groups. These range from the traveller's charter for people passing through customs at ports and airports to the customer charter for claimants using the social security benefits agency. The 20th charter, from London Underground, was launched yesterday, with the usual combination of performance targets and compensation for non-fulfilment. Overseeing this process is a special Cabinet Office unit and a panel of advisers chaired by Sir James Blyth of Boots. They know that central to the success of the charter will be its progress in improving the lot of the 'three Ps': patients, passengers and parents. The greatest impact has been made with the patient's charter, which promises that no patient will have to wait more than two years for hospital treatment once on a waiting list. More than 50,000 patients had been waiting for more than two years in March 1991, a backlog which was virtually eliminated by April 1992 when the charter was implemented. Hitting that target required significant input of cash, with excess capacity in private hospitals bought in to clear the more intractable waiting lists. There were accusations at the time that this had been achieved by increasing the lists of people waiting less than one year. However, Mr Brian Edwards, general manager at Trent regional health authority who was seconded to the department of health to lead the team setting up the charter, says that achieving the target was long overdue. 'It had a marginal impact on people waiting less than a year,' he says, 'but a great impact on some real people - including many children - who had been waiting a very long time and whose needs were just as great.' Mr Edwards notes other achievements, including quicker treatment of emergency cases and reduced waiting times for out-patient appointments. 'Before, a few people were concerned about these aims,' he says. 'Now everybody is focusing on them.' British Rail's passenger's charter not only makes promises about performance, it also offers compensation if targets are not met. For commuters with season tickets, there will be rebates if trains fail to hit reliability and punctuality targets over 12 months (the first rebates will be payable in January 1993 after the scheme has been running for a full year). Ordinary passengers can also claim compensation in the form of vouchers against the cost of future journeys if they are delayed by more than an hour. This formalises the previous discretionary and unadvertised arrangements under which more than Pounds 6m a year was paid out to passengers who bothered to complain about delays. However, there have been complaints that the scheme is too restrictive. 'Vouchers and petty discounts, to be used only in certain circumstances and given grudgingly under a complex system of exemptions and conditions, go nowhere near far enough,' according to Mr John Beishon, director of the Consumers' Association. 'Neither is there any mention of consequential loss. If a train is cancelled and you have to pay out for the cost of a taxi home, BR shouldn't quibble about paying the cost.' Offering the least by way of performance targets is the parent's charter. Instead, this promises more information about schools and pupils' individual performance, with more frequent inspection by independent inspectors. League tables of schools' performance will be published from next year, including data on truancy and success in getting pupils into higher or further education. Here the emphasis is much more on providing parents with information on which they can base choices of school, and to encourage teachers to improve their performance. Outside its three core areas, there have been problems in implementing some of the white paper proposals. The Lord Chancellor's department has so far failed to produce its justice charter to make the courts more user-friendly, for example. And the deregulation of London Buses has been postponed at least until 1994. Also stalled is the network of local lay adjudicators who would take up complaints against public services and hand out small amounts of compensation informally. There is also a distinct impression that the charter is losing some of its cachet. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, might have taken the opportunity of last week's announcement about privatising the Royal Mail's parcel delivery service to mention it as an example of meeting charter objectives on competition and improved services. But he chose not to. Nor did Mr John MacGregor when he published the white paper on the privatisation of British Rail, although this was one of the firm proposals in the charter white paper. If almost every government policy last year was hung on the peg of the Citizen's Charter, it is now reserved for the politically duller announcements such as market testing in the civil service. However, Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the charter, asserts that it remains at the top of the government's priorities. Seminars will be held every six months to keep ministers up to the mark on implementing the charter. And Mr Waldegrave has promised a white paper on progress in the autumn. The prime minister has also given Mr Waldegrave a powerful weapon in the right to veto colleagues' bids for extra funds for their departments to improve customer service and implement charter promises. This implies that his endorsement would bolster any such bid, something of a coup given the jealousy with which the Treasury guards the spending round (though it remains to be seen what this right is worth). Nobody can now say that the charter was an election gimmick, but it has yet to make a real impression outside a few limited areas. One year on, the Citizen's Charter looks more likely to be a permanent feature, but its political credibility still depends on the commitment of Mr John Major, its 'onlie true begetter'.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Sport: When it comes to the crunch - American Football IF ANYONE needed reminding that American football is a violent game, the events of the past week have confirmed that no team sport bears comparison when it comes to the physical damage inflicted on athletes in the name of entertainment. Last Sunday, Dennis Byrd, a 6 ft 5 in (1.96 metre) defensive lineman for the New York Jets, rammed accidentally into a teammate while trying to flatten an opposing quarterback. The force of the impact broke Byrd's neck. As soon as his body hit the ground, it was clear Byrd was in trouble. His first words were: 'I don't have any feeling in my legs.' As doctors and teammates crowded anxiously around, he asked: 'Am I going to be paralysed?' Sadly, the answer, at least for now, is yes. On Wednesday, Byrd had surgery to stabilise his neck and spinal cord. He has little or no movement in his arms or legs. Byrd's tragedy came just a few days after Al Toon, the Jets' best wide receiver, retired because of injury. A blow to the head in a mid-November game left him groggy and confused for several weeks. Although he was expected to recover, doctors told him he had taken too much punishment to the head over his eight-year career. Toon is just one of many football players forced into involuntary retirement. Statistics show that two out of every three players retire from the National Football League because of permanent injury. Many spend the rest of their lives in pain because of crippling damage to ankles, knees, hips, elbows and shoulders. Although the total of injuries this season is about average, the numbers still are staggering. In the 12 weeks of NFL play, nearly 500 players have had to miss at least one game. That is almost 18 for each team. While life-threatening collisions are, fortunately, quite rare, Byrd broke his neck almost exactly a year after a Detroit Lions defender was paralysed permanently by a similar injury. And with footballers getting bigger and faster, it is obvious that the chances of getting hurt badly are increasing. Byrd's injury has re-opened the debate about whether American football is too violent and if the rules should be changed to make it safer. The usual reaction among players is to say that violence and injuries are a natural part of the sport. This is not surprising in a game where only a few players ever touch the ball and the rest spend their time ramming into each other. The problem with football, however, is that hitting (as it is known) is not just accepted as part of the game - it is celebrated. The league itself sells a video showing frightening collisions between players under the jokey title: 'The NFL's Greatest Hits.' It is also common for television producers during a game to replay a particularly vicious hit several times over, often with the sound turned up so that viewers can hear the crunch of plastic, muscle and bone. Given the highly-competitive nature of American sport and the intense pressure to win at any cost, it is unlikely footballers will lose the violent intensity they bring to each game, or that the fans will stop enjoying the simple brutality involved. But there are some things that could be done to limit injuries. One is to get rid of artificial turf. While studies may show it causes no more injuries than real grass, common sense dictates that it is harder on the human body. A former Miami Dolphin, Nick Buonoconti, said last week: 'Playing on artificial turf is like playing on concrete.' There was good reason for seeking his opinion on injuries: his son was paralysed permanently playing in a college football game several years ago. Another beneficial change would be to stop players using their helmets as weapons. Houston's star quarterback, Warren Moon, had his arm broken three weeks ago when an onrushing defender speared him with his helmet. The first thing Moon heard after the hit was a couple of opposing players screaming: 'Yeah] We got him outta the game]' Had Byrd led with his shoulder instead of his head, the chances are he would still be walking. But many defenders are taught to lead with the helmet: that way, they are more likely to cause an opponent to fumble the ball. Ultimately, everyone in the game will label his injury a 'freak accident' and get on with the rest of the season. But was it really that freakish? After all, it was the result of two huge men, who together weigh 38 1/2 stone (540 lb), trying to knock the stuffing out of a smaller, lighter and very vulnerable opponent. As their intended target, Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Dave Krieg, said after Sunday's game: 'It could have been me lying there.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 24 Apr (INA) -- Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN  Security Council's Special Commission, arrived in Baghdad at  noon today at the head of a delegation on a two-day visit to  Iraq.    In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, Rolf Ekeus said  that  he would resume the talks he began with Iraqi officials in New  York and Baghdad in July, 1993, which resulted in tangible  progress.    Asked whether the visit was part of the dialogue between  Iraq  and the Special Commission, Ekeus said that the UN Security  Council welcomed the visit, endorsed it, and asked for an early  report on the results of these talks, and that the Special  Commission promised to present the report to the Security  Council next week.    Ekeus also clarified that talks with the Iraqi side will  deal  with political and technical aspects.    The Special Commission consists of Maurizio Zifferero,  deputy  chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency; Tim Trigan  [name as transliterated], spokesman for the UN Special  Commission; and a number of technicians.    The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY has learned that the talks between  Iraq  and the Special Commission will begin at the Foreign Ministry  tomorrow evening.</p>

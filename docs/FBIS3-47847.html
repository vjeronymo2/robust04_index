			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the U.S. Government is  demanding that our government and North Korea make the "Joint  Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" an  international treaty lest they possess nuclear reprocessing  facilities.    A relevant government official on 16 January said that "the  United States supported making the Joint Declaration on  Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula an international treaty  which will ensure that the nuclear states assign obligation to  North and South Korea for denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula and in return for this, they will supply on a stable  basis nuclear materials required for the development of atomic  energy."    This official said: The Joint Declaration on  Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which was signed on 31  December 1991 and effectuated in February 1992, stipulates that  North and South Korea shall not possess nuclear reprocessing  facilities. However, since North Korea did not comply with it,  and in the event that its content is revised according to an  agreement reached by the North and the South, there is a  possibility for both sides to possess nuclear reprocessing  facilities. It is likely that the United States is concerned  with this situation.    It was learned that the government has not decided on the  policy up to date to cope with such a proposal by the United  States.    The U.S. proposal directly contradicts the allegation of  some  national assemblymen and scientists who call for recovery of  nuclear sovereignty by possessing nuclear reprocessing  facilities with peaceful purposes. As a result, heated  controversy will likely be touched off in the future.    The incumbent Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]  prescribes that one is allowed to possess a nuclear reprocessing  facility but should declare the quantity and purpose of  plutonium extracted from it, and this quantity and purpose are  subject to inspection and supervision.    Therefore, an expert pointed out that the demand that North  and South Korea turn their declaration into an international  treaty which does not allow them to possess a nuclear  reprocessing facility itself, contradicts the principle of  international laws. He assumed that this proposal was prompted  by the fact that suspicion of North Korea's development of  nuclear weapons has become an international issue.    At present, there is no international treaty, other than the  NPT, which restricts a certain state or district from nuclear  development.    Another government official stated that "in the event that  the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is  turned into an international treaty, it will be greatly helpful  to complete the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and  to win trust from international society concerning the nuclear  policies of North and South Korea."    He added: However, even if we want to possess nuclear  facilities after the North Korean nuclear issue is completely  resolved and the trust of the international community in nuclear  policies of the North and South is built with the declaration  turned to into an international treaty, we should have consent  from nuclear states. Therefore, this proposal would be, in  actuality, impossible.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: See the wood and buy the trees - James Buxton explores a new scheme to lure forestry investors Individual investors have barely touched forestry as an investment since 1988. That was when the government terminated the tax break system which gave the industry a bad name as high-earning sportsmen and show business figures planted hillsides full of conifers in northern Scotland. Yet, not everyone dislikes conifers, and the plantations are being made more attractive to see and visit. Furthermore, forestry still offers generous tax concessions. No income tax is payable on income from commercial woodlands and there is no capital gains tax on increases in the value of standing or felled timber. Investments in forestry held for two years qualify for 100 per cent business property relief from inheritance tax (IHT). Up to now, those tax benefits have been enjoyed mainly by land-owners. Now, though, a fund has been launched which will enable individuals to make small investments - the minimum stake is Pounds 1,000 - in existing woodlands. The Timber Lands Distribution Fund (TLDF) expects to offer a net annual distribution of 8 per cent a year over the next decade. Since that is free of income tax, it represents the equivalent of 13.3 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers. TLDF is sponsored by Neill Clerk Capital (NCC), a company which has specialised in business expansion scheme companies, and Savills, a surveyor and estate agent. They intend to raise up to Pounds 4.13m to buy plantations of mature and semi-mature sitka spruce trees from Tilhill Economic Forestry, a management company which will run the woodlands. The first forest to be acquired is Black Rigg at Newcastleton, Cumbria, followed by another at Lochgilphead in Argyll, while the sponsors have an option on three more. Fund-holders will be allowed to explore them, and much of the woodland will be harvested gradually over the fund's 10-year life. The sponsors believe the value of the timber will increase because conifers are known to appreciate in value over their 40-year span, especially in the final decade. On top of that, the sponsors say timber prices are recovering from their all-time low at the end of 1991 and point to the 12.5 per cent rise (in the year to March 1994) in the index of standing conifer sales compiled by Forest Enterprise, part of the Forestry Commission. At the end of the fund's life, all the capital will be returned. The sponsors hope the amount will at least equal the starting capital - although there are no guarantees - and claim it is possible there will be a capital gain from selling the remaining standing timber. TLDF is not a trust but an 'unregulated collective investment' under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This means it is not subject to any regulatory body (although NCC belongs to the Securities and Futures Authority). Unlike a unit trust, there is no established market for the fund, and the sponsors warn that investors could have difficulty selling their stakes if they want to pull out before the fund is wound up - although NCC will try to arrange sales on a matched bargain basis. NCC also cautions that tax rates and reliefs may change and timber prices could fall. Investors will have to bear issue costs estimated at 6.5 per cent, including a 3 per cent commission to intermediaries, as well as property acquisition costs put at 1.5 per cent; an annual 1 per cent management fee for NCC; and an annual forestry contractor's fee of Pounds 5.50 a hectare for Tilhill. The fund, which closes on December 20, should appeal to higher-rate taxpayers wishing to diversify their investments, and to people seeking to reduce their IHT liability. An interest in forestry is an advantage. Prospectuses are available from Neill Clerk Capital: telephone 071-734 4446.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN 'ELLA' AWARD FOR ALL THAT JAZZ;  </P> <P> SOCIETY BOWS TO FITZGERALD'S LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENTS  </P> <P> Ella Fitzgerald was holding court like a queen, but speaking like an old  friend.  </P> <P> "I'm feeling pretty good, thank you," she replied to an inquiry about her  health (she had open-heart surgery in 1986). "The doctor gave me some therapy,  and I go twice a week."  </P> <P> Did she have a nice birthday on April 25?  </P> <P> "Oh yes. I sat at home, and people sent me flowers. I couldn't get off the  phone!"  </P> <P> Nor could she escape from fans who huddled around her chair at a  reception/photo opportunity that preceded the Society of Singers tribute to the  71-year-old Fitzgerald Friday night at the Beverly Hilton.  </P> <P> They converged to honor her, the winner of the first "Ella" lifetime  achievement award, and she welcomed them all, the friends, the fans, the  flashbulbs.  </P> <P> There is definitely an audience for jazz among young music lovers, said  Fitzgerald. "We play lots of colleges and universities," she said, "and we mix  the program up. It's not all bop. We do Cole Porter, Rogers and Hammerstein, a  little rock and roll; jazz done in the beat of the day."  </P> <P> She added that she was "thrilled" to be associated with the Society of Singers,  a group founded to raise money to help singers in need of medical or other  emergency care that eventually plans to build a permanent residence for  singers. (The event was almost totally underwritten by Johnnie Walker Black,  and net proceeds were estimated at $500,000.)  </P> <P> Frank Sinatra is literally the chairman of the board of this organization;  Ginny Mancini (wife of composer Henry) is the president and was the benefit  coordinator along with Jeanne Hazard.  </P> <P> "It was destined, it was honest, it was heartfelt, it was done without anything  in its way," said Mancini of the decision to honor Fitzgerald. "It was  unquestionable that she should be the one."  </P> <P> "A Tisket A Tasket" was the first Fitzgerald song Mancini recalled hearing.  "What I heard I had never experienced in a singer of a lyric," she said. "I  can't define it for you. But I felt complete."  </P> <P> Jazz singer Joe Williams said his association with Fitzgerald has gone from "an  admirer to a devotee to an absolute slave. She's marvelous. God, she's  unbelievable."  </P> <P> Although the room became crowded quickly, it soon became a jazz lover's dream.  In the crowd were Mel Torme, Bea Wain, Kitty Kallen, Kar Starr, members of the  Manhattan Transfer and George Shearing.  </P> <P> Still, some wondered where the next generation of singers were.  </P> <P> "Look around," said Kallen. "Where are the young ones? Where are the Linda  Ronstadts, the Michael Jacksons? Who's going to take the mantle? Yes, they're  making money now, but they don't realize how many singers died in county  hospitals."  </P> <P> The "young ones" missed out on a tremendous show, with everyone dedicating  their performances to Fitzgerald. The capacity crowd couldn't help singing  along with Kallan, Wain, Starr, Martha Tilton, Fran Warren, Helen O'Connell,  Helen Forrest and the Sentimentalists, who performed signature songs from their  tables.  </P> <P> There was more singing from Williams, Marilyn McCoo, Dionne Warwick, the  Manhattan Transfer, a tap performance by Arthur Duncan and jazz piano from  Shearing, who also accompanied Torme. He earned a standing ovation for "A  Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square." Backing everyone up was the Capp/Pierce  Juggernaut Band.  </P> <P> Said emcee Bill Cosby after hearing the female big-band singers, "I don't  understand -- we're raising money to build a home. For what? They need a place  to work."  </P> <P> The audience heartily agreed.  </P> <P> Scattered among the tables were more luminaries: Barbra Streisand, Quincy Jones  (honorary chairmen along with Luciano Pavarotti, who didn't attend), Clint  Eastwood, Maj. Ronald Ferguson (the Duchess of York's father), Carol Bayer  Sager and Burt Bacharach, Gloria Loring, Helen Reddy, Pat Boone, Gloria and  Jimmy Stewart, Mayor Tom Bradley, Danny Thomas, Cyd Charisse and Tony Martin,  Lainie Kazan.  </P> <P> Eastwood presented the award to Fitzgerald, who apologized for her nervousness.  "All of you singers can understand how you can get nervous at such an  occasion," she said.  </P> <P> She accepted the award "for all of the great singers everywhere. This is not  just for me alone. It's for those who are trying to become something, and for  those who have fallen down by the byway." She paused. "By God, I'm trying to  make a speech and it's the worst."  </P> <P> But the greatest present of all wasn't the award, wasn't the fact that the  singers were invited on stage at the end to sing "Dream" and "Happy Birthday To  You."  </P> <P> Fitzgerald was persuaded to sing "Honeysuckle Rose." And that was the best gift  of all.  </P></p>

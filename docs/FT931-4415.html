			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / MPs challenge 'harsh' rents on pubs MPs YESTERDAY challenged Grand Metropolitan Estates about the 'harsh' rents and other conditions imposed on pub leaseholders in its Inntrepreneur (IEL) pubs joint venture with Courage. IEL executives were cross-examined by the Commons agriculture committee, which is examining the effects of beer orders which forced national brewers to free a third of their pubs from exclusive beer supplies. Mr Richard Alexander, Tory MP for Newark, said three Inntrepreneur pubs in a Yorkshire village had been held by 11 different leaseholders last year. Of 654 pubs in the county 639 lessees had left. 'Doesn't this indicate the harsh terms which brewers, and IEL in particular, are imposing on their tenants?' he asked. Mr Bob Williams, GM Estates chairman, said the pub trade in South Yorkshire had been hit by uncertainty about the future of the mining industry. 'It is causing pain and anguish all round,' he added. Inntrepreneur's business failures had been fewer under the new leases than under the former tenancies, although the rate had increased to 9.5 per cent. He insisted: 'We have no interest in closing pubs.' Ms Jean Corston, Labour MP for Bristol East, said there had been complaints of rent increases of up to 150 per cent. She questioned the imposition of penalty charges on lessees who failed to meet certain levels of beer purchases. Mr Williams agreed that penalties could be levied but said the conditions were necessary to ensure that outlets were not converted from pubs to other retail operations. Mr Michael Foster, chairman of Courage, said one of the worst effects of the beer orders had been to break down the relationships between brewer and tenants. But leases were agreed only after a long period of negotiation, he said. Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, told the committee that the disruption to the company's pub tenants was the 'biggest downside' to the beer orders. He added: 'The goodwill of 20 years was ruined overnight and it will take a long time to rebuild their confidence.' There had, however, been only 10 business failures among the company's 1,600 leaseholders. Complying with the orders had cost Whitbread about Pounds 80m. 'The costs have been massive not just in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, but in terms of management time,' Mr Jarvis said. Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied-Lyons' retailing operations, also estimated compliance costs at Pounds 80m. Bass calculated Pounds 134m costs. Mr Tony Portno, chief executive of Bass Brewers, said the beer orders caused the 'most enormous diversion' from planned strategies.</p>

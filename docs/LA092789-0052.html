			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Vandals damaged the remains of a 13th-Century Carmelite monastery in northern  Israel, apparently to protest a controversial Carmelite convent at the  Auschwitz death camp in Poland, an Israeli official said. Shalom Yankelevitch,  commissioner of antiquities for the city of Haifa, said the vandalism followed  reports that Jewish religious extremists had threatened Carmelite nuns working  at the monastery. A group of American archeologists and nuns has been  excavating for two years at the one-acre site on biblical Mt. Carmel. Roman  Catholic leaders agreed to move the convent away from Auschwitz to an  interfaith center after some Jews said its presence at the camp was offensive.  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Shares in Lasmo fell 8 per cent on yesterday's announcement that the group is taking the first steps towards a US and Canadian flotation of Ultramar's downstream assets. In one sense, that seems a curious response. The UK investment community would be right to be wary of a disguised rights issue in the form of a demerger, as proposed in the past by such as Beazer and Maxwell Communication. But that is not what is proposed. Instead, Lasmo is to be applauded for seeking to bring in genuinely new cash. The market's reaction may have been appropriate on other grounds. The chief implication is that Lasmo is hedging against failure to find a trade buyer for the assets. Presumably at this stage, any trade offers have been made on the basis that Lasmo is a forced seller, so the flotation option could be a gambit to get the price up. Lasmo must be hoping it works. Should the flotation have to go ahead, it is not entirely clear why investors should agree to pay up for assets the industry has deemed too expensive. If they did, the implications would be thought-provoking. If the US trade is right in its valuation of oil assets, it would seem to follow that the US oil sector, which has underperformed the US equity market by a fifth since the start of last year, has further to fall.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE ISSUES 30% OF COUNTY'S HOUSE PERMITS  </P> <P> Rushing to beat new city fees, developers in fast-growing Palmdale obtained  permits to build a record 6,747 houses in 1989, accounting for an estimated 30%  of all house permits issued in Los Angeles County last year, officials said  Friday.  </P> <P> The Antelope Valley city, with a population of just 55,000, by far issued the  most new house permits of any of the county's 86 cities during 1989, according  to figures provided by the city and a private industry group. The 1989 Palmdale  tally exceeded the total of 6,674 for the previous three years combined.  </P> <P> City officials said developers hurried to obtain permits before new fees of up  to $6,000 per house took effect in September and October of 1989.  </P> <P> Palmdale City Administrator Robert Toone said the city is not having trouble  keeping up with the boom. Toone said developers probably will hoard permits for  a time and then spread them out over many months to not flood the housing  market.  </P> <P> "I think you'll see a phasing of that construction," Toone said, noting that  house sales countywide have dropped in recent months. "Those houses are just  not going to be built like they have been over the past 36 months," Toone said.  </P> <P> The 6,747 new house permits last year represented a 130% increase over the  city's 2,929 permits for 1988, city records showed. Nearly 3,600 of the permits  were issued in the weeks before the new city fees began.  </P> <P> Developers rushed to avoid a nearly five-fold increase in park fees that pushed  the average to $2,106 per house. The city also added new traffic fees of $990  and drainage fees of $1,093 to $3,121 per house.  </P> <P> Toone estimated that the total city fees on a new house in Palmdale now average  about $10,000, which he said is consistent with charges in other California  cities. Most new houses in Palmdale sell for $130,000 to $150,000.  </P> <P> According to figures provided by the Construction Industry Research Board, an  industry group that monitors development activity, Palmdale's permits accounted  for about 30% of the nearly 21,800 issued countywide. Those figures, which were  for the first 11 months of 1989, showed that the next closest cities were Los  Angeles, with 2,325, and Lancaster with 2,314, said Ben Bartoletto, research  director for the board.  </P> <P> However, Lancaster had a year-end rush for permits that was not reflected in  the board's numbers. That rush, spurred by a $957 per house traffic fee that  took effect Jan. 1, should push Lancaster past Los Angeles in final rankings  for the year.  </P></p>

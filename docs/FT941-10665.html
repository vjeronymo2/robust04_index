			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Indian SE watchdog seeks more powers The Securities and Exchange Board of India is seeking additional powers to regulate the country's fast-growing capital markets. Mr SS Nadkarni, the board's new chairman, said yesterday that amendments to legislation were proposed 'to give more teeth' to the market watchdog. The board, which has gained considerable authority in recent years, remains worried about malpractice. There has been a flood of allegations of insider trading by corporate managements seeking to rig share prices before flotations. Proposals for strengthening the board's market surveillance will be welcomed by foreign investors, who have stepped up purchases of Indian shares. Foreign institutions invested Dollars 275m in January, lifting the total to Dollars l2bn since the government opened the doors a year ago. Mr Nadkarni distanced himself from his predecessor, Mr GV Ramakrishna, on the issue of abolishing badla - the carry-forward facility for shares. 'We want a transparent system,' he said. The board will reconsider its plan to ban badla if there is total segregation of transactions for carry forward and delivery of shares. Anticipating the change in the board's stance, traders on the Bombay Stock Exchange drove up share prices by 227 points or 5.8 per cent to a two-year peak of 4,144 yesterday.</p>

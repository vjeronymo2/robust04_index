At consultations held before the  signing, the sides found that political relations are making  very good progress, especially after President Zhelyu Zhelev  visited Warsaw last year to sign a bilateral treaty of  friendship and cooperation. The Polish guest said that the  Bulgarian minister of foreign affairs, Stanislav Daskalov is  expected to meet in Warsaw shortly with his Polish counterpart  Andrzej Olechowski. Mr. Byczewski described this as the second  very important stage in bilateral relations.    During the consultations the sides expressed their  dissatisfaction with the progress of economic contacts, agreeing  that both governments can help an expansion of trade and  economic cooperation.    Cultural relations were also on the agenda, as well as the  premises of the Polish Cultural Centre in Sofia. Mr. Byczewski  stressed that Mr. Daskalov had assured him that the Bulgarian  Foreign Ministry will do everything within its powers to solve  the problem. "I think this is particularly important because  both the Bulgarian Cultural Centre in Warsaw and the Polish  Cultural Centre in Sofia have fine relations and it would be  wrong to break them," the Polish deputy foreign minister said.  The building which now houses the Polish Cultural Institute in  Sofia was recently restituted to its former owners.    Integration into Europe's economic and Euro-Atlantic  structures, joining the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative  and the situation in the Balkans were discussed at a meeting  between Mr. Byczewski and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov.  Mr. Byczewski said Bulgaria and Poland have no fundamental  differences on these matters.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAGLIABUE IS PRAISED BY COLLEAGUES IN LEGAL PROFESSION  </P> <P> There are few people more familiar with the problems of the National Football  League than Paul Tagliabue. It has been his rather difficult job to defend the  league against the glut of lawsuits that contributed to Pete Rozelle's  retirement.  </P> <P> Tagliabue was the loser in the suit brought by the Los Angeles Coliseum  Commission against the NFL for antitrust violations. The jury awarded the  commission about $20 million in damages for the league's violations of  antitrust laws. The suit cost the NFL $10 million in legal fees.  </P> <P> Technically, he was the loser in the suit brought by the United States Football  League against the NFL. However, the USFL asked for $1.6 billion but was  awarded only $3 in damages. That defense cost the NFL $26 million in legal fees  and greatly enhanced Tagliabue's reputation among the league's owners.  </P> <P> And he was the loser in the Raiders' antitrust suit against the NFL for trying  to stop the team's move to Los Angeles from Oakland. The NFL had to pay $20  million in damages.  </P> <P> Tagliabue joined the powerful Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in  1969. After being made a partner, he almost exclusively handled the league's  Washington affairs.  </P> <P> Despite the losses, Tagliabue's reputation as an excellent antitrust lawyer has  remained intact.  </P> <P> The announcement of his selection as NFL commissioner was met with equal  enthusiasm by his courtroom opponents and supporters.  </P> <P> "He's a fine gentleman and a scholarly lawyer, and unlike his predecessor he  may pay some attention to antitrust laws," said Max Blecher, an attorney who  represented the Coliseum Commission against the NFL. "He'll keep them on the  straight and narrow, I hope. They need it."  </P> <P> Harry Pregerson, formerly a U.S. district judge now at the 9th U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals, also had positive recollections of Tagliabue during the  Coliseum trial.  </P> <P> "He's an outstanding lawyer and certainly has a complete understanding of how  the league functions, knows all the owners and I'm sure many of the players,"  Pregerson said, while admitting that he has never seen an NFL game in person or  on television. "He made some cogent arguments, and my impressions were always  very favorable and straightforward."  </P> <P> Peter K. Leisure, the U.S. district judge who heard the USFL-NFL trial, was  also impressed with Tagliabue.  </P> <P> "He's a man for all seasons, even though we're only talking about a fall  season," Leisure said from his office in New York.  </P> <P> "He takes great care in approaching very difficult problems, shows patience and  thoroughness and above all has a high intellect. I could not be more pleased to  hear that he would be at the helm during difficult times as well as good times  for the National Football League and professional sports in the United States."  </P> <P> Tagliabue is a specialist in antitrust law and the author of "Antitrust  Developments in Sports and Entertainment," which appeared in the Antitrust Law  Journal.  </P> <P> Lawrence Sullivan, a professor at the University of California and one of the  country's leading experts on antitrust law, said the choice of Tagliabue is a  good one.  </P> <P> "I have general impressions of him as being a very competent, rather balanced  type of person and probably a wise choice," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Antitrust legislation is at the heart of the NFL problems. The league has long  contended that its monopolistic practices are used to increase competition  rather than to discourage it. Tagliabue told Fortune magazine: "Any normal  business can decide where it wants a plant, but we're treated like a group of  conspirators rather than a meeting of the board."  </P> <P> This is a view that the courts have not accepted, instead ruling that each team  is a separate entity. The NFL has long sought an exemption similar to the one  granted major league baseball. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said  in 1922 that baseball is a national pastime and exempt from antitrust laws.  </P> <P> Tagliabue also represented the NFL in the suit filed by the National Football  League Players Assn. after the 1987 strike. The matter is yet to be decided by  a Minneapolis court.  </P> <P> Still, his reputation is not one of being anti-union.  </P> <P> "We don't have him listed as a union buster," said Virginia Diamond, an  attorney with the AFL-CIO. "We've never considered Covington &amp; Burling a  union-busting firm."  </P> <P> Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, said that he expects good  relations with the new commissioner. "I want to congratulate Paul Tagliabue on  his selection as NFL commissioner and I look forward to working with him,"  Upshaw said in a statement. "I have always found him a straight-forward  thinking type of person interested in resolving differences."  </P></p>

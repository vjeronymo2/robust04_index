			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: Outsiders invited into Italy's boardrooms - Iri, the state holding company, is testing a new mould for selection of executives The appointment of outsiders to fill top jobs at Alitalia, Italy's troubled national airline, has reinforced the sense that a tough new broom is sweeping the corridors of state industry. Mr Renato Riverso, chairman designate, and Mr Roberto Schisano, managing director, fit the new mould for selecting executives being tested by the big Iri state holding company, which owns Alitalia and a basket of other loss-making companies. Neither man has created quite the stir that followed the selection of Mr Hayao Nakamura, a senior Nippon Steel executive, to head Iri's chronically loss-making Ilva steel subsidiary, which is now in liquidation. The Alitalia appointees are slightly less egregious in that both are Italians, even if they have been out of the country for much of their careers. Mr Riverso, the respected former chairman of IBM's European operations, has spent 37 years working for IBM since joining it from university. Mr Schisano, 50, is chairman of the European operations of Texas Instruments, the US computers and electronic components group, and has worked much of his life outside Italy. Iri's growing predeliction for outsiders was indicated last year, with the choice of Mr Claudio Dematte, a respected business professor, as chairman of the Rai state broadcasting organisation, which it controls, and of Mr Gianni Locatelli, editor of the Sole 24 Ore business newspaper, as Rai's managing director. Although the Ilva, Rai and Alitalia appointments were made by two different heads of Iri, they reflect similar priorities for the group as it struggles to staunch the flow of large losses. Mr Nakamura was the choice of Mr Michele Tedeschi, Iri's former director general, who was given full executive powers after the group's July 1992 transformation into a joint stock company. Although Mr Tedeschi was subsequently shifted to Iri's big Stet telecommunications arm, Mr Romano Prodi, the new Iri chairman, has been even more active in privatising successful operations and restructuring loss-makers as a preliminary to sale or closure. The list of disposals under Mr Prodi, a market-orientated professor who ran Iri in the 1980s, includes Credito Italiano, the bank, and the food production arm of the Sme concern. Next month will see the sale of Iri's controlling stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana, another big bank. For less healthy operations, the new treatment has begun with the imposition of new management. Ilva's expansionist-minded former chief executive, Mr Giovanni Gambardella, had to make way for Mr Nakamura; various top executives at Iri's heavily loss-making Iritecna construction arm have been removed; while this week it has been Alitalia's turn. Almost all the appointees reflect similar job requirements, spotlighting previous lacunae in state industry. The most striking has been the stress on international experience - ideally in the private sector. That reflects the need to address the increasing globalisation of many of the businesses in which Iri operates and the consequent need for executives with the right backgrounds. It shows an awareness that international alliances will become more important in many Iri companies. One of the criticisms of Mr Giovanni Bisignani, Alitalia's former managing director, is that he failed to react to the merger wave sweeping across the airline industry. Private-sector experience is as important. Mr Bisignani's career was exclusively within Iri and Eni, the other big Italian state holding company. With privatisation essential to shore up Iri's tottering finances, finding market-orientated executives who have not been nurtured in Italy's big state monopolies has become a must. Politics plays a part. Managers inured in the habits of the big state holding companies have grown accustomed to a world in which large investments were often based on political, rather than commercial, concerns, or where rationalisation was regularly postponed for fear of its electoral consequences. Political changes have affected Iri directly. The long-running corruption scandals have led to the resignations of some senior staff, such as Mr Franco Nobili, the former chairman. Even where there is no hint of scandal, once prized political contacts can become embarrassing today. Critics claim Mr Bisignani's fast-track career in state industry owed something to the sponsorship of Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran political leader. With managers too closely associated with the discredited political establishment looking increasingly fragile, observers are asking how long some senior political appointees can last. Mr Biagio Agnes, the chairman of Stet, and Mr Ernesto Pascale, who chairs Iri's Sip telecoms utility, look vulnerable. However, with a limited supply of suitable candidates with strong international backgrounds to call upon, the problem for Mr Prodi may be in finding replacements.</p>

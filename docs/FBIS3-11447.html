			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Badillo] </F>   [Text] Susumo Azano Moritani, president of the Azano Group  headquartered in Jalisco, is willing to reach an agreement with  AT&amp;T "as long as the agreement is reasonable and fitting,"  despite 51 years of abuses committed by the U.S. phone company  that has sent Jalisco businessmen to jail.    Salvador Perez Gomez and Susana Manterola, Azano Moritani's  attorneys, handed over a letter to EL FINANCIERO in which their  client outlines his position on reaching an agreement with the  U.S. company. This letter indicates that AT&amp;T owes the Azano  Group $20 million for the building of a digital telephone  production plant.    Meanwhile, attorneys commented that AT&amp;T had used its  influence to pressure the Mexican Government through Jaime Serra  Puche, commerce and industrial development secretary, and  Claudio Gonzalez, presidential adviser on foreign investments --  both of whom "openly" supported the foreign company over and  above the "fair and legal" interests of the Mexican business  group.    In the document, the president of the Azano Group indicates:  "We have always been willing to receive a reasonable payment  offer, which AT&amp;T representatives have promised us again and  again in countless meetings held to resolve the amount to be  paid. Up until now, however, no agreement has been reached on  any amount."    Azano Moritani's lawyers indicated that AT&amp;T is  pressuring  their client to accept each and every condition it has  established. These conditions include a "confidentiality  contract" AT&amp;T representatives want the Jalisco businessman  to  sign without indicating the amount they are willing to pay for  the debt which has been pending for more than three years.    Salvador Perez Gomez and Susana Manterola explained that the  legal proceedings against AT&amp;T are heading in an "excellent  direction," and, therefore, the Azano Group is confident that  very soon its suit against that U.S. telephone company will be  resolved. AT&amp;T will have to pay $20 million it still owes,  otherwise the AT&amp;T plant in Guadalajara will be placed under  an  indefinite seizure. In addition, AT&amp;T officials would have to  serve prison terms for fraud.    The attorneys also noted there is a resolution pending --  No.  214/93 -- in the Third District's First Civil Court, where  Susumo Azano Moritani has presented evidence against AT&amp;T.  This  evidence includes the fact that AT&amp;T presented an amparo  plea in  an irregular manner. This legal document was delivered to Judge  Vidal Cuevas Barba's residence at a time when he had no  jurisdiction in the case.    Meanwhile, the first judge of the civil court refused to  execute the arbitration award given the countless procedural  violations of a public order nature [violaciones procesales de  orden publico], thereby ruling in favor of Avanti Construction  Co. owned by the Azano Group.    In this ruling, the first judge of the civil court resolved  to declare as "null and void everything filed before the ninth  judge of the civil court in which AT&amp;T presented the  accusations. For this court, the recorded violations are  sufficient to uphold the conclusions outlined in the previous  paragraphs."    Given this, AT&amp;T waived its amparo and asked the judge  to  return its documents that were grounds for the claim; this  implies a dismissal of charges.    Regarding AT&amp;T's statements that work at the plant had  not  been completed, claiming it had been abandoned by Avanti, the  attorneys said the telephone plant began operations on 24 July  1991. As evidence of this fact, they presented a thank you  letter from AT&amp;T dated 22 August 1991.    Two days later, on 24 August of that same year, AT&amp;T  President Robert Allen declared in Guadalajara that the first  telephone equipment manufactured at the plant was of very high  quality on an international level, thereby contradicting the  aforementioned claim that work at the plant had not been  completed.</p>

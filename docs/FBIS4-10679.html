			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in  Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, that in response to the  severe economic blockade imposed by the United States, his  country is in need of an economic model characterized by  openness to trade and foreign investment.    During a news conference on the second and final day of his  working trip to Paraguay, Robaina said that one of the main  reasons for his South American tour was to advertise investment  opportunities on the island.    During Robaina's trip to Paraguay, several political leaders  from the South American country called for the restoration of  diplomatic ties between the two nations, which were broken  during the sixties because of pressure from the United States on  the Paraguayan Government. The request was made by Senators  Carlos Romero and Eugenio Zanabria, both members of the ruling  Colorado Party [National Republican Association] and Manuel  Benitez, leader of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, the  foremost opposition party.    The Cuban foreign minister is concluding in Paraguay a tour  that included official trips to Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina.</p>

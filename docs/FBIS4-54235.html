			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Hanoi VNA May 26 -- Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van  Khai on behalf of the government presented a report on the  implementation of the socio-economic tasks in the first six  months of 1994, and orientations for socio-economic development  in the coming time, at a regular session of the National  Assembly opening here this morning.    The report notes that the positive financial and economic  changes of the past few years have been sustained, which brought  about rather comprehensive progress in the fields of economic  production, goods circulation, finance-monetary and foreign  trade with a higher growth rate compared with the corresponding  period in the past few years.    `The winter-spring crop is expected to achieve the highest  output so far, up one million tonnes compared with last year (or  an increase of 10 per cent), the agricultural economic structure  has initially reformed to the direction of increasing the rates  of industrial crops especially trees, animal breeding,  particularly aquaculture and non-farming occupations.    `The industrial production in the period under review is  expected to increase 12 per cent compared with the same period  last year (the target put forth for the whole year is 11 per  cent), with the synchronous development of all economic sectors,  of cities and industrial zones'...    ...`The export value is estimated at an increase of 27  percent (seven per cent higher than the yearly target), import  value is expected to increase 23.4 percent. The foreign  Official Development Aid (ODA) sources signed in the first  quarter of this year has doubled the 1993 amount.    The direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first  half of 1994 had a total legal capital of USD 2 billion, or  two-thirds of last year's figure...    `The total value of retail sales is expected up by 37.6 per  cent, meeting the diversified demands of the population with  higher incomes and consumption power. Goods and passengers  transportation, domestic and international tourism, and other  services have broadened rapidly. Price indexes of retail sale  and service in the first fourth months of this year increased  5.4 per cent, mainly for food and foodstuffs during Tet  holidays. But since March the prices have returned stability'.    The report also notes that `with economic growth and the  income increase of a major part of the population,  socio-cultural activities have been improved remarkably'.    `The external relations of the country continue to be  broadened and strengthened in the direction of  multi-lateralization and diversification. The exchange of  visits made by high-ranking leaders of Vietnam and other  countries, especially those in the region has contributed to the  promotion of mutual understanding, and enhancement of multisided  cooperation. After the resumption of relations of international  monetary and financial organizations with Vietnam, the lifting  of the US trade embargo against Vietnam in early this year has  created new, favourable conditions for the process of  normalization of relations between Vietnam and the US, thereby  pushing up the cooperative relations between Vietnam and other  countries as well as international organizations.    `Vietnam's international relations have been developing  rather quickly in a positive trend, thus making contributions to  the environment of peace, stability and cooperation for national  defence and construction. However, there have been complicated  developments in our border areas, the most outstanding of which  are recent violations of our country's exclusive economic zones  and continental shelf, and the developments in Cambodia include  many worrysome factors.    On major issues to be settled in the second half of this  year, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said that great  efforts should be made to continue to make the country's finance  and monetary system healthy and stable, to keep the state budget  balance, to control the inflation rate at single digit increase,  to ensure the construction progress of major projects and create  more conditions to promote investment of all economic sectors.    On the broadening of external relations and economy, Vice  P.M. Khai said that `complicated and sensitive external  relations require us to be more vigilant, dynamic and creative  in the implementation of a foreign policy of independence and  sovereignty to bring into full play the strength of the entire  nation in combination with international strength in order to  cope with current challenges, and take advances to opportunities  to step up industrialization and modernization of the country'.  [sentence as received]    Mr. Khai went on: `We are actively settling outstanding  issues and disputes with some countries through peaceful  negotiation. We are ready to proceed to normalization with the  united states, to join ASEAN and enter into multi-sided  cooperation in the Pacific region, and at the same time to  continue consolidating and expanding cooperative ties with all  countries and international organizations.    `Together with the enhancement of state-level relations it  is  necessary to develop cooperative ties in the economic,  scientific and technical, cultural fields, expand cooperation  with non-governmental organizations, and people to people  contacts and enhance foreign information service'.    Mr. Khai said that the government is preparing an overall  project for developing external economy in the new situation,  and he pointed out some tasks to be done from now to the end of  the year. These tasks include guiding the implementation of new  regulations on managing and distributing the Official  Development Assistance (ODA) from foreign countries, improving  the environment and attracting direct foreign investment,  actively implementing the National Assembly's resolution on  practice thrift, fighting against corruption and smuggling,  effectively expanding and raising the quality of scientific,  educational, cultural and social welfare activities, and pushing  up economic reforms in combination with administrative reforms.</p>

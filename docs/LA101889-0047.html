			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW BROKERAGES MAY FARE AS ERA OF TAKEOVERS ENDS  </P> <P> The worst didn't happen. The demons of Friday the 13th didn't consume Wall  Street. As the market further stabilized Tuesday, many traders concluded, along  with New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan, that last week's plunge  in stock prices was no more than a market "squall."  </P> <P> But if the investment world has avoided calamity, last week's drop and the  turmoil in the takeover game that brought it on have left Wall Street facing a  far different -- and probably more difficult -- situation.  </P> <P> The fast-money takeover game that uncapped a gusher of fees and other earnings  for Wall Street this decade seems to be on the wane. The shock of a 190-point  drop in the Dow Jones industrial index dealt a new blow to the confidence of  the average American investor. And not a few market gurus have forecast that  the plunge will bring an end, at long last, to the seven-year bull market.  </P> <P> The upshot: Wall Street's big investment banks and retail brokerages, which  have already shrunk their staffs by 12% since the crash of 1987, may face new  rounds of job cutbacks and consolidations in the months ahead. And the  investment world is likely to face a change in tone as a decade dominated by  the colorful personalities of the highly leveraged takeover game gives way to a  new era.  </P> <P> "The great and glorious days of the '80s may not be over," says Robert Kavesh,  finance and economics professor at New York University. "But we seem close to a  turning point."  </P> <P> James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a critic of heavy  borrowing, put it more forcefully. "An era is ending; another is beginning," he  said. "Those in the highest esteem will be toppled, and the most humble will  rise again."  </P> <P> The development of the highly leveraged takeovers reshaped Wall Street in the  '80s. With heavy borrowing, deal makers could arrange takeovers that in earlier  years wouldn't have been viable, and that created jobs for scores of investment  bankers, stock speculators, takeover lawyers, proxy solicitors, public  relations firms and more.  </P> <P> The recent turmoil in the junk bond market, however, is expected to mean fewer  takeovers overall and more deals of the kind that are less profitable for the  investment banks. The deals will be done as swaps of both companies' stock, or  with more cash and less debt.  </P> <P> This change would cut into the profits of the big investment banks in several  ways. The firms receive fees for the deals they arrange and for underwriting  the junk bonds that are key to financing them.  </P> <P> In the past four years, too, the investment banks have profited handsomely by  putting up their own money for the deals. And the firms have arbitrage  departments that speculate in the takeover stocks that have been so important  in driving the market.  </P> <P> Many of the largest investment banks derive about 50% of their profits from  merger-related activities; several derive 20% of their pretax profits from the  takeovers called leveraged buyouts alone.  </P> <P> "Anything that jeopardizes that business would have a very material impact on  their bottom line," says Samuel L. Hayes III, a Harvard University professor of  investment banking.  </P> <P> Some of the investment banks may also be at risk in some of the takeover deals  they have already financed with "bridge" loans. These are short-term loans made  to clients until they can arrange longer-term financing by, for example,  issuing junk bonds.  </P> <P> But questions about the wisdom of some of these loans have emerged since  September, when Campeau Corp. ran into trouble paying off bridge loans for its  purchase of Federated Department Stores. Investment banks including First  Boston, Paine Webber and Dillon, Read &amp; Co. have $400 million invested in  the Campeau bridge loan.  </P> <P> James E. Cayne, president of the Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. investment bank,  predicts that "an awful lot of firms are going to see reduced revenues" from  the investment of their own money in takeover deals and are going to pull back  from such deals in the future.  </P> <P> As for the possibility of losses, "the jury's still out," says Cayne, whose  firm has avoided such deals as too risky. "They could be substantial."  </P> <P> A managing director of one Wall Street firm predicted that investment banks  will be forced to make painful cuts in their mergers and acquisitions staff  because of the expected slowdown in takeover activity. The last big contraction  for merger professionals came in the early 1970s, he said, when a typical  investment bank had about 2,000 employees, including several dozen in the  mergers and acquisition department.  </P> <P> Now, he said, the big firms employ 8,000 to 10,000, including merger teams that  run to 400 professionals. "Nobody's had any experience in how you shrink these  operations," he said, adding that it would be a "shock" for many employees to  see how sharply compensation will be reduced if the takeover market doesn't  revive.  </P> <P> Fewer takeover deals would likely also sharpen competition among investment  banks for the deals that remain. In turn, that is expected to cut many fees.  </P> <P> Dwindling takeover activity would most affect the dozen or so largest  investment firms and would have much less of an effect on the smaller and  regional stock brokerages that make up the rest of the investment industry.  </P> <P> But all firms that make money from selling stock to individuals are likely to  feel the impact on confidence of last Friday's market spill. Though the worst  did not take place, the recurrence of such huge drops has persuaded many lay  investors that there is no logic or safety in the crap shoot of the stock  market.  </P> <P> "More individual investors will come to believe that direct participation is  something they should avoid, and that if they're going to buy stock they should  do it through mutual funds," says Perrin Long, who analyzes Wall Street firms  for Lipper Analytical Services.  </P> <P> One signal of tough times facing Wall Street is in the continuing fall of the  prices of seats on the New York Stock Exchange. On Tuesday a seat sold for  $436,000, the lowest price since one sold for $425,000 in 1985. Because of  generally low trading volume and scarcer commission dollars, exchange seats  have lost more than half their value after peaking at $1.15 million on Sept.  21, 1987.  </P> <P> The investment industry, as represented by members of the NYSE, have cut their  employment by 31,700 since the strike, or about 12%. Some analysts believe that  cuts of another 10% to 15% could be ahead if a bear stock market combines with  a sharp reduction in takeover activity.  </P> <P> Even the gloomiest observers expect to see new financial trends soon supplant  the fading fads of the '80s on Wall Street. But the leaders of the new age are  not likely to be the leveraged buyout specialists, takeover lawyers and  corporate raiders who have shone so brightly in the popular imagination in this  decade.  </P> <P> "Soon people won't even remember those guys' names," says Sharon J. Kalin,  president of the Athene-Coronado Management arbitrage firm. "The fact is,  they've already been deposed."  </P></p>

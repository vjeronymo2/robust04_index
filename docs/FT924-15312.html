			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Private bank to be closed down THE Bank of England announced last night that it is to wind up the operations of Mount Banking Corporation, a privately owned London-based bank. The Bank said it had won court approval to put in provisional liquidators. Mr Philip Wallace and Mr Timothy Hayward of KPMG Peat Marwick were sent in yesterday. 'The basis of our petition was that there were just and equitable grounds for winding up the bank,' the Bank of England said. It stressed that it 'did not allege insolvency'. Mount Banking Corporation had a total balance sheet value of Pounds 200m at the end of March this year. Its 3,000 depositors, who have deposits of about Pounds 160m, are mainly Asians resident in India and East Africa, and according to the Bank it has only a few depositors in the UK. The company has a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands and affiliated companies in Kenya and India. Mount Banking Corporation is only the second bank to be moved on by the Bank since it closed Bank of Credit and Commerce International in July last year. The other was National Guardian Mortgage in Surrey, put into administration in March this year owing 1,000 depositors about Pounds 10m.</p>

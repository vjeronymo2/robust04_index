			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol April 11 TASS -- All facilities of the  Black Sea Fleet seized by Ukrainian servicemen in Odessa had  been freed as of 16:00 Monday, a high ranking Black Sea Fleet  officer quoted Ukrainian Defence Ministry officials as saying.    First Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Vitaliy  Larionov told ITAR-TASS on Monday that this information is now  being checked. Black Sea Fleet leaders are still awaiting a  report from the commander of a squadron of reserve ships seized  in Odessa. He and his colleagues are also expected to be  released.    Larionov described the incidents in Odessa as unexpected,  particularly because they occurred when Odessa was celebrating  the 50th anniversary of its liberation from the Nazi and because  civilians, including women and children, had been affected.  Several were injured.    "Our task is to ensure calm in the Crimea and Ukraine. We  are not going to brandish arms, but we must protect our officers  and their families," Larionov continued. "We could have taken  more decisive measures, but we decided against it for the  benefit of Russia and Ukraine as we remembered that the Black  Sea Fleet is subordinated to both."</p>

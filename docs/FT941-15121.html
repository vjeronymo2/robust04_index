			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Company News This Week: A stronger finish than expected - US banks Some of the US's biggest commercial banks will put the cap on a record year when they report results this week. The stock market had already been expecting a strong fourth quarter, but early figures released by two banks last week suggested that the numbers may be even better. A bevy of the biggest banks are due to report tomorrow: the New York money-centre banks Citicorp, Chemical and Chase Manhattan, along with the biggest 'super-regionals', NationsBank and BancOne. BankAmerica and Bankers Trust come later in the week. Bank stocks sagged last autumn, when investors began to anticipate a decline in interest rate margins from record levels. Few believe the banks can repeat the bumper trading results earned in the middle of the year. JP Morgan and Citicorp gave the market pause for thought with figures released last week (Citicorp gave an outline when announcing the sale of Quotron to Reuters). Each took write-downs and/or restructuring charges, yet ended with stronger profit growth than most had expected. For JP Morgan, the figures were underpinned by advances in all of its main businesses, including trading. Citicorp will not release details until tomorrow, but is expected to report higher-than-expected revenues, in part from its retail banking operations in developing countries.</p>

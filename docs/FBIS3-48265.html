Pol Lt Col [Police Lieutenant Colonel] Nithi Charucharit,  deputy commander of mounted police, said he has already  submitted a letter to acting police chief Prathin Santiprapop  seeking a review of the reshuffle list. Nithi said his  seniority met the criteria for advancement, but he was  overlooked. He is a law graduate of Ramkhamhaeng University.  He said he has been a deputy superintendent for nine years  without any sign of being advanced. Some of the officers  promoted in the reshuffle had far less seniority.    Metropolitan police commissioner Pol Lt Gen [Police  Lieutenant General] Chamlong Iamchaengphan had recognized his  abilities in a certificate, Nithi said, but did not have the  authority to change the reshuffle.    Pol Lt Col Thawisak Tuchinda, deputy superintendent of a  special unit, has also petitioned Prathin to reconsider the  reshuffle.    Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Suwan Suwandecho, a  senior  police of General Affairs Division, also said he will forward a  protest letter to deputy interior ministers Suthat Ngoenmun  (Democrat) and Chamni Sakdiset (Phalang Tham) requesting the  reshuffle of 130 police generals be reconsidered. Suwan said  justice should prevail in every reshuffle.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Some very hot irons in the fire: John Lloyd on the challenges before President Yeltsin if the war in Chechnya is not to topple him President Boris Yeltsin has not necessarily doomed either reform or his presidency by making war on the leadership of Chechnya. There is a perfectly feasible scenario that would see him retaining both power and the ability to govern in the months ahead. But the longer the war continues, the more dire are its consequences and the less likely become his chances of survival as an effective, reforming president. The scenario favouring Yeltsin's survival goes like this. The war is won in the near future, as now seems more likely - in the sense that the Russian army takes Grozny, kills or captures General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen leader, and reduces the remaining fighters to partisan bands operating with difficulty from mountain bases. The Russian government then pumps enough money into the little territory to give it at least the appearance (and probably also some of the reality) of relative well-being. It contains the Chechens' armed hostility to Russia within the borders of Chechnya. It finds leaders - such as Mr Salimbek Khadzhiev, a former Soviet energy minister and presently 'prime minister' of the Russian - backed Chechnya government in exile - who will command some respect and support in the territory after General Dudayev's gruesome reign. And the central government begins to weave Chechen life back into Russia through a treaty that devolves at least as much power to Chechnya as has been granted to the republic of Tatarstan. This achieved, the financial cost is borne through increased oil exports (which Chechnya has, albeit in modest quantities). Secessionists with ambitions for other regions of the Russian Federation are taught a salutary lesson, and politics in Russia returns to bumpy normalcy. It is possible. But to become reality, the Russian government must deal with the following consequences of the war, which are already evident. First, the near-mutiny in the upper ranks of the army must be properly addressed. At least half a dozen senior generals, and probably many more, have refused to fight in Chechnya or give their support to the campaign there. The Russian armed forces are rich in generals and can afford to lose a few (or a few hundred). But those who have signalled open dissent are high-profile, sometimes politically active and popular men in their early middle years with the ambition to do a lot of damage to the existing authorities. Mr Yeltsin and General Pavel Grachev, his defence minister, must convincingly punish insubordination or defuse it. The indications are that General Grachev probably lacks the force and subtlety to do either. Second, the political base for reforms must be re-established. All the reformist parties are now in full and open opposition to the president. Mr Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Choice, the largest, had given him sometimes reluctant support through tough times - but now excoriates him. While Mr Boris Fyodorov's small Liberal Democratic Union supports the war (or at any rate, he does), it continues to oppose the president on the grounds that he has ceased to reform. Mr Yeltsin's new best buddy is Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party; his only complaint is that Mr Yeltsin is late in coming to a state of imperialist grace. The more conservative and secretive presidential aides - such as General Alexander Korzhakov, head of the guard - wield most power, and snarl menacingly if challenged by the press. It is still possible for Mr Yeltsin to abandon this network of supporters and return to the reformers. After all, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev did just that in the spring of 1991, after dallying with his own reactionaries. But even for an active president (and Mr Yeltsin is no longer that) it would be hard, and it may be too late - as it was for Mr Gorbachev. Third, the economy is suffering from the war. The expense threatens to blow a hole in a budget designed to be tough; and the president's attention to economic matters, never great, is now even less. And yet it is again a critical time. The budget depends on a phased series of huge loans from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The stabilisation of the currency - the main aim of the loans - depends in its turn on making the budget even tougher than that approved by the state duma, parliament's lower house, this month. Moreover, the government will have to stick to its budget targets. Last year, it squandered opportunities for economic reform by printing money when the going got rough, while Mr Yeltsin showed he was increasingly willing to initiate or approve expenditure to keep the social peace or to reward loyalty. Mr Yeltsin humbled his government after 'Black Tuesday' in October, when the rouble lost a quarter of its value against the hard currencies. This re-established his pre-eminence, but no international financial institution or government will now find a stabilisation programme credible unless they also believe he is committed to it. At present, however, he is committed only to winning in Chechnya. Fourth, the war is eating into Russia's still substantial reserves of international goodwill. The leading Moslem states, especially Turkey, protest at the action against the co-religionists in Chechnya. Non-Moslem states say it is an 'internal affair', because they can think of no other response, but they are increasingly concerned by the bloodshed. They are even more worried by the way pretensions to liberalism are giving way, as the war progresses, to a domestic authoritarianism, which also embodies anti-foreign sentiments. Already, the war has produced a threat from Russia that it will breach the terms of the treaty it signed in 1990 on conventional armed forces in Europe, because it considers the limits on armour in the southern part of Russia too restrictive. Such a unilateral renunciation would sow more distrust in a west already learning to be more wary than welcoming of Russia's foreign policy moves. Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, is spending part of this weekend explaining Russia's cause in Chechnya to European Union ambassadors. He will need high powers of persuasion to calm their alarm. Finally, the war - with its attendant propaganda, lies and threats - is destructive of public trust in the authorities. Mr Yeltsin promised to stop the bombing when he addressed his nation on Wednesday, but on Thursday it was stepped up. Government propaganda says Gen Dudayev has enslaved his people, but the defence minister told a meeting of the security council on Monday that the general had widespread support. And one of the largest claims of this administration has been a determination to protect the 25m ethnic Russians who find themselves in other former Soviet states, but many of the casualties in Grozny have been ethnic Russians with nowhere to go. Mr Yeltsin may yet pull his irons from the fire. But they are heating up all the time - and may soon be too hot to handle.</p>

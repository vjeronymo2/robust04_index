			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (5): The island looks abroad - Many see overseas investment as an advantage for the future GREENFIELD sites in Kyushu are just that. In the lush and rolling terrain towards the island's northern tip, surrounded by forests and rice fields, the arrival next spring of Toyota is signalled by the vast pastel-coloured corrugated barns which will house its plant. For the country's biggest car maker, the facility will be its first domestic production centre outside its Aichi home. When fully on stream it is intending to produce 200,000 cars a year, assuming a revival in the country's depressed automotive market. This, with a near-doubling of capacity at Nissan nearby, will bring Kyushu's annual car output to at least 700,000 units out of a total for Japan of 4.5m. Although local demand was one consideration - Toyota is building a similar facility in Hokkaido, northern Japan - the company thinks that at best 10 per cent of the vehicles built in Kyushu will stay on the island. A more important factor was the availability of land. The abundance and relative cheapness of industrial real estate in Kyushu, in addition to a well-trained workforce, have helped draw manufacturers there in the face of what Mr Jippei Mutoh, a director of the nascent Toyota operation there, acknowledges is a below-par transport infrastructure. Expressways and rail links on the island are being extended, and last month's record central government package of public works spending may yield funds for a further upgrading of ports. Still, local business leaders at times show agitation that budgets disbursed in Tokyo do not take enough account of the region's needs. 'We are saying a share should be fairly given to local areas as well,' says Mr Ryoji Tsukuda, president of Bank of Fukuoka, Kyushu's biggest home-grown bank. 'Whether it works like that is questionable.' The economic downturn in Japan has now begun to hit Kyushu, lagging about six months behind the rest of the country and not yet so severely affected by it. Access to investment capital on the island has not altered markedly, although the projects for which funds are intended are likely to receive closer scrutiny. 'There is no credit crunch in Kyushu,' Mr Tsukuda maintains. His loan book will grow some 3 to 4 per cent this year - sharply down from the usual 10 per cent, but most of the difference reflects curtailed lending through its Tokyo and Osaka branches. Prefectural governments meanwhile have become all the more anxious to secure new investment commitments. Such keenness, however, has long been the case for those regions away from the industrial north of the island, that seek creative ways to target the limited funds and incentives they have on offer. Kumamoto in western Kyushu, for example, has a 'foreigners first' policy under which bigger grants, of up to Y50m, are available for companies from overseas, whereas a Japanese group would get only Y40m. Better soft loans are offered - a maximum of Y400m compared with Y300m and carrying interest rates at a one percentage point discount to those available to domestic investors. Two foreign companies are siting themselves there this year - the Dutch ASM group and Teradyne of the US, which will both be producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Kumamoto has the world's largest integrated circuit (IC) plant, owned by NEC. Like other local administrations, Kumamoto is benefiting from the arrival of Nissan and Toyota through the automotive component suppliers which are springing up on the island as a result. A Kyushu-made Toyota will, however, have only about 20 per cent local content, and the company will have some 30 suppliers from which to draw instead of the 180 in Aichi. The 'car island' which Kyushu is beginning to call itself partially eclipses its earlier status as 'silicon island'. It produces more than a third of ICs made in Japan, approaching a tenth of the world output, and chip-making drew foreign companies to Kyushu as early as two decades ago. Texas Instruments (TI) opened its plant on the east of the island in 1973, one of a handful it now has in Japan. Its nearly 1,600 employees include 100 working in research and development, unlike TI's Japanese rivals which generally confine R&amp;D activities to their head offices. The practice helps the US company attract skilled staff. Like other manufacturers operating in Kyushu, it seeks to win back to the island those who grew up and trained there but went on to metropolitan careers. Prefectural governments make much of this 'U-turn' campaign, which they co-ordinate. But some parts of Kyushu still lose 80 per cent of local graduates to the big cities, a figure which has not changed since the drive began in the early to mid-1980s. Although the country's economic downturn this year has blunted the previously acute labour shortage, key staff in some areas remain hard to find. Mr Kiichiro Fukamoto, TI's personnel director for Kyushu, argues that siting R&amp;D at the plant gives something for qualified electronics workers to come back to. 'Getting the U-turn people is a problem for other companies - if they have skills acquired in Tokyo, they can't bring them back,' he says. Among other blandishments, TI offers its staff what it believes to be the shortest working week in Japan - just three 12-hour days. The plant runs six days a week, with Sunday overtime as needed. But as an indicator of the decline in the world semiconductor market as well as in overall Japanese industrial activity, few Sundays have been worked this year. 'Last year it was nearly every week,' says Mr Fukamoto. TI faces a further difficulty, unforeseen at the time it set up in Oita prefecture. As the industry has moved in recent years from standard chips to customised products, its physical distance from its customers has made itself more felt. Online computer links provide only a partial solution. Others see the island's geographical location as an advantage for the future. Mr Tatsuo Kawai, chairman of the Kyushu Economic Federation, has his eye on the adjacent regions of China, to which Hong Kong capital has not yet rushed as it has in the south. The large industrial groups in South Korea, which lies between southern Japan and north China - and which last month established diplomatic relations with Beijing - would also be likely to commit increasing funds there. According to Mr Kawai, the most desirable outcome would be a tripartite relationship, 'a kind of job-sharing with Korea' which would give both other countries access to Japanese technology and would draw on China's labour resources. Three-way trade flourished until a few generations ago, and Kyushu has been internationally minded even in Japan's most isolated periods. Other local business leaders share the expectation that the removal of the political obstacles which have hampered such links in the second half of the 20th century will restore what they see as the natural status quo ante.</p>

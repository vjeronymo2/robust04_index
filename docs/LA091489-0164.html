			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER FROM RUPTURED HYDRANT WASHES BODY OUT OF A DRAIN  </P> <P> A badly decomposed body washed out of a storm drain in Anaheim on Wednesday  after a car hit a hydrant, sending water gushing into the drain, police said.  </P> <P> The body was believed to have been in the drain for about three or four months,  according to Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry.  </P> <P> "That's an educated guess," he added.  </P> <P> Investigators said there was no immediate indication of foul play. "There's  nothing obvious at this point," Barry said. "Of course, that's pending an  autopsy."  </P> <P> The coroner's office will perform an autopsy today,.  </P> <P> A car hit the hydrant at about 12:15 p.m. in the 1700 block of South Walnut  Street. The impact sent water gushing down the street and into the drain. About  30 minutes later, a passer-by found the body, which had been washed into a  nearby flood-control channel near the 1500 block of West Katella Avenue.  </P> <P> Barry said investigators have not positively determined the gender or race of  the dead person, but he added: "We are reasonably sure it was a male."  </P> <P> Police plan to send information about the body to missing-persons units in the  area, Barry said.  </P> <P> "If we don't come across any information in the near future, we might have to  extend that," he said.  </P></p>

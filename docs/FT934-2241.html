			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Beckett slams move to cut sick-pay cash Planned reductions in the statutory sick-pay subsidy would impose 'substantial' costs on small employers, in spite of assurances from ministers that the changes should reduce industry's costs, the Labour party said yesterday. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, told the Commons that the government had deceived its backbenchers by disguising the true impact of changes in the sickness benefit rules and rushing them through parliament this week. She said small employers paying less than Pounds 20,000 a year in national insurance would face bigger costs because they would receive no subsidy for the first four weeks of sickness pay. Surveys suggested that the average employee was rarely sick for longer. Labour has withdrawn parliamentary co-operation in protest at the cabinet's decision to guillotine debate on the sick pay legislation and a bill increasing national insurance contributions. However, the government won the first round in its battle to get the bills through when a motion cutting short debate was approved by 307 votes to 266, a government majority of 41. Labour, which has withdrawn pairing arrangements in an attempt to force all Conservative MPs to attend the Commons for every vote, said its campaign of not co-operating would continue when parliament resumed after the Christmas recess. Labour MPs forced a series of votes on non-contentious issues late last night, underlining the leadership's determination to make life as difficult as possible for the Conservatives. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told Labour MPs in a letter that the guillotine procedure was 'indefensible'. His statement appeared designed to dispel rumours that the campaign of not co-operating would be dropped when the Commons rises on Friday. However, the political temperature was raised by Mr John Major, the prime minister, who told MPs at question time that the campaign was a 'sham'. He said it was designed to cover up the 'total mess' made by Labour's treasury team during the parliamentary debate on the imposition of value added tax on heating fuel.</p>

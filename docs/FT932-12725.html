			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Gold These days, one need only breathe the name George Soros to quicken the investment pulse. Sir James Goldsmith still excites some in the same way and when the two are linked, passions in saloon bars may swell beyond endurance. Add the intellectual endorsement of modern-day Jeremiahs such as Lord Rees-Mogg and a stampede cannot be far off. However tempting it may be to deflate such hype as a little canny buying and a lot of talk, there may be something more stirring in the gold market. For US investors, returns on cash are as near to zero as makes no odds. Bond yields may be around a cyclical low point and equities remain expensive by most historical measures. Those worried by the recent weakness in the dollar may well be tempted by a little gold - especially with the opportunity cost of holding bullion low. The balance of supply and demand has also been slowly shifting in recent years. Jewellery fabrication and bar hoarding now soak up more metal than new mined supply and scrap provide. Forward sales by producers, using borrowed central bank bullion, have locked many into current low prices for some of their production. If they wish to unwind these, sales producers will have to buy in the open market because they cannot produce sufficient from their own mines or stocks. Russia has probably sold most of the gold fitments which can be easily unscrewed. Against that is the threat of central bank selling and a subdued inflation trend. But the banks may hold off once a run starts, and the gold price has hinted of inflation to come before now.</p>

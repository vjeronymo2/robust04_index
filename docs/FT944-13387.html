			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Early gains evaporate on interest rate fears Wall Street US STOCKS attempted to rally yesterday morning but the early gains evaporated amid nagging concerns over interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.36 lower at 3,848.23, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.09 at 462.61, even though declining issues held a four-to-three edge over advances on the Big Board. Volume was heavy, with about 322m shares traded on the NYSE. In the other leading markets, the American SE composite added 0.68 at 453.53, and the Nasdaq composite improved 4.98 to 763.24. Stocks opened solidly higher, with the market trying to reverse direction after four losing sessions. There was relative tranquility in early trading in the bond and foreign exchange markets, and the day's only piece of economic news failed to excite much interest. The commerce department reported that factory orders of durable goods rose just 0.1 per cent in September after a big gain the previous month. Analysts had forecast a 0.6 per cent rise, but with most investors holding off on fresh commitments, at least until after Friday's reading on third- quarter economic growth, the data had virtually no impact. Concerns over an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term rates, and the move in long-term rates above 8 per cent, were never far from the surface. By early afternoon the jitters got the best of the market, and most share prices were showing modest losses. Later the blue chips swung into positive territory on a fleeting upturn in bonds, only to sag anew in the final hour. The session brought a few more pleasant earnings surprises. Most notably, Ford showed an impressive gain in net income and revenues, in contrast with General Motors, which last week revealed details of a disappointing third quarter. But Ford's share price could only manage to inch Dollars 1/8 ahead to Dollars 29 1/8. GM was off Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 40 3/4, and Chrysler added Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 47 7/8. Tenneco, a diversified industrial group, posted net income which had nearly doubled from the year earlier and topped the consensus forecast of analysts. However, the issue, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 43 1/2 , hardly budged. By contrast, its Case farm equipment business, which reports separately, jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 on strong results. Sara Lee, a food processor, also impressed investors with solid gains in net income and revenues in its first fiscal quarter. Its share price climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24. Borden added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 even though it reported another loss and slashed its dividend. Philip Morris gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 63 7/8 . In pharmaceuticals, McKesson surged Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 105 1/4 after Eli Lilly extended the waiting period for its tender offer for the company's shares until November 3. Lilly dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60.</p>

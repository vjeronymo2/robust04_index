			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Cleaning delay puts ship off-hire THE BERGE SUND Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Steyn: December 19 1991 A TIME-chartered ship is off-hire for a 'cause preventing the efficient working of the ship' through no 'fault' of the charterers, if she is not is an efficient state to provide the service next expected of her in furtherance of the voyage, in that she is necessarily delayed by a misfortune risk due to an unascertainable cause for which neither charterers nor shipowners are to blame. Mr Justice Steyn so held when dismissing an appeal by Sig Bergesen DY &amp; Co and others, owners of Berge Sund, from a decision by arbitrators that charterers, Mobil Shipping and Transportation Co, were entitled to the return of hire paid under the charterparty. HIS LORDSHIP said that Berge Sund was a tanker designed for the carriage of liquid petroleum gas. By a time charterparty dated September 20 1979 the owners let her to charterers for 20 years. The charterparty provided that the master, although in the owners' employ, 'shall observe the orders of the charterers as regards employment of the vessel'. An off-hire clause provided that hire should cease for loss of time 'not caused by charterers' fault . . . due to repairs, breakdown, accident or damage to the vessel, collision, standing, fire, interference by authorities or any other cause preventing the efficient working of the vessel'. For 10 months after delivery the vessel carried only cargoes of butane and propane, and did not have to be cleaned. In September 1982 she carried a contaminated cargo to Europe. During a ballast voyage to the Arabian Gulf, tank cleaning took place. The vessel reached Ras Tanura. On December 20 the charterers' surveyors found that two tanks were contaminated. Further tank cleaning was ordered. On January 1 1983 their condition was satisfactory, but then there were problems with obtaining coolant and a cargo nomination, and the port was closed, so the vessel was unable to load until January 9 1983. The arbitration dispute concerned the delay in loading. The charterers said the vessel was off-hire and claimed back hire paid for that period. Arbitrators found the vessel was off-hire from December 20 to January 9, and awarded Dollars 600,002. They found the delay at Ras Tanura arose because the vessel failed the standard copper corrosion test. They were unable to make a definite finding as to the cause of the failure. They identified three possible causes but found that neither owners nor charterers were to blame. The owners appealed. They submitted that 'fault' in the context of the off-hire clause did not mean blameworthiness, but meant responsibility for an untoward occurrence. Prima facie 'fault' in a charterparty meant conscious wrongdoing or negligence. When parties had in mind strict or absolute liability there were well-known phrases such as 'act, neglect or default'. It would be stretching the ordinary meaning to read fault in the off-hire clause as signifying less than blameworthiness. The owners' interpretation was rejected. The charterers relied on 'or any other cause preventing efficient working of the vessel' in the off-hire clause. The objective of the off-hire clause was to relieve charterers of the obligation to pay hire when they did not have use of the vessel. It did not require that 'off-hire events' should be attributable to owners' fault. The emphasis was on a pragmatic allocation of risk. It was settled that 'or any cause preventing the efficient working of the vessel' could not be construed ejusdem generis with the ill-assorted events previously mentioned in the clause. The arbitrators said that the fact they did not ascribe the unreadiness to owners' negligence did not mean it fell outside 'any other cause preventing the efficient working of the vessel'. They decided there was an off-hire event within the meaning of the clause, and time was lost as a result. They found that due to nobody's fault, cleaning unexpectedly became necessary. Reading the award as a whole they categorised the problem which arose at Ras Tanura as an accident or a misfortune risk. Mr Moore-Bick for the owners submitted that the arbitrators applied the wrong test. They found the vessel was not 'in an efficient state to provide the service expected of her, namely loading'. He said the arbitrators erred in concentrating on the charterers' subjective wishes instead of on what was objectively needed to be done in furtherance of the voyage. The court disagreed. The arbitrators posed exactly the right question. It was then submitted that the service required of the vessel was not loading but cleaning. Again the court disagreed. Objectively what was required in furtherance of the voyage was that loading should commence on December 20. The owners submitted the charterers shipped dangerous cargo which caused the vessel to go off-hire, in breach of contract. The arbitrators concluded the cargo was not dangerous. It merely required the vessel to be cleaned more thoroughly. They were right. On the facts of the case the cargo was plainly not dangerous. That ground of appeal failed. The owners relied on The Rijn (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 267 in which an off-hire claim did not succeed. Mr Justice Mustill said with regard to 'or any other cause', the only qualifying causes were those which were 'fortuitous and not the natural result of the ship complying with the charterers' orders'. The owners said the delay was caused by natural consequences of the manner in which the charterers chose to employ the vessel. The arbitrators distinguished The Rijn in which there was no element of fortuity from the present case where, they said, loss of time was not 'the natural result of loading the cargo'. They said there might have been any number of reasons why the vessel failed the copper strip corrosion test. It was clear that the arbitrators regarded the problem that arose at Ras Tanura as wholly unexpected. It was not the natural result of use of the vessel. It was a misfortune risk. The Rijn principle, whatever its precise limits might be, was inapplicable on the special facts of the case. It was common ground that there was implied into the charterparty a charterers' undertaking to indemnify owners against the consequences of complying with their orders. The undertaking was implied by law, because of the nature of the charterparty and the master's obligation to comply with charterers' orders. It was submitted that if the vessel was off-hire, the owners were entitled to indemnity. The arbitrators rejected the contention because first, they did not consider it appropriate to cut down specific provisions of the off-hire clause by reference to the more general terms of the implied indemnity; and second, the off-hire clause had the specific limitation that it was not to apply to loss of time caused by charterers' fault. A term implied by law could only be excluded by contrary provision. In other words, it would only be excluded if inconsistent with express terms of the charterparty. The arbitrators apparently thought the implication was inconsistent with the off-hire clause. Inconsistency had not been established. The implied indemnity was not limited to matters outside the scope of other clauses of the charterparty (The Ann Stathatos (1950) 83 Ll R 228,234,235). It might overlap with matters dealt with in other clauses. Such overlap did not necessarily involve inconsistency. The implied term was left intact by the express terms of the off-hire clause. However, the indemnity only extended to direct consequences of complying with the relevant orders (Ann Stathatos, 235-239). There was no express finding that loss of time resulted directly from compliance with charterers' orders. It was not possible on the facts to infer that the problem at Ras Tanura was the direct consequence of their orders or of the loading of the cargo. The appeal failed. An application to remit the award on the ground that the arbitrators overlooked a substantial issue was refused. The court was satisfied that they did not overlook the issue. For the shipowners: Martin Moore-Bick QC and D Matthews (Sinclair Roche &amp; Temperley). For the charterers: Stewart Boyd QC (Allen &amp; Overy).</p>

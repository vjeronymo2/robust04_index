			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Cardoso names ministers Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes over as Brazil's president on January 1, yesterday named his team of ministers and said they would make the changes needed 'to put the house in order'. The 20 ministries were divided almost equally between people appointed for political reasons and for technical merit. Mr Cardoso had said he wanted the best ministers possible, but has been forced to make some compromises to build political support and a working majority in Congress. The team of economists linked to the Finance Ministry, who oversaw the July launch of the Real currency, will remain in place, but some will move jobs. Mr Pedro Malan, central bank governor, will become finance minister. He will be replaced by Mr Persio Arida, known to favour privatising some of Brazil's loss-making state banks. Mr Jose Serra, a leading figure in Mr Cardoso's Social Democracy party (PSDB), will take over the Planning Ministry, where he will control the government's budget. Mr Serra has criticised the economic team's strategy of over-relying on the Real in the fight against inflation. Some analysts believe he and the team could clash. Mr Cardoso signalled he would crack down on waste in three of the main spending ministries. Mr Adib Jatene, a former health minister known for fighting corruption, returns to Health. Mr Reinhold Stephanes, who began reforming the social security system, again becomes social security minister. Mr Paulo Renato da Souza, Mr Cardoso's chief campaign co-ordinator, takes charge of education. Mr Raimundo Brito, new mines and energy minister, will have an important role in privatisations, Mr Nelson Jobim will be justice minister and Mr Luiz Felipe Lampreia, ambassador to the UN in Switzerland, foreign minister. Pele, the footballer, will be special secretary for sports. Observer, Page 15</p>

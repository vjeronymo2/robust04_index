			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] has  stated that the Turkish nation will by no means approve of a  solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. The  political parties represented at the TGNA issued a joint  communique on the Cyprus issue and addressed to the nations of  the world.    The communique read by the TGNA deputy speaker Yasin  Hatipoglu confirms that the TGNA endorses the Turkish Cypriot  people's 30-year-old just and legal struggle for their basic  sovereignty, security, and equality. The statement points out  that a just, realistic, and permanent solution to the Cyprus  issue can only be achieved by the free will of the two people on  the island. The statement notes that a return to the pre-1974  conditions is inconceivable and stresses that a solution  unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people will not be approved  by the Turkish nation.    The statement notes: The TGNA announces that Turkey is  determined to fulfill its duties and responsibilities as  stipulated by agreements -- that of a guarantor. The communique  notes that the negotiations can continue under the basic  condition that there are two equal communities with equal rights  in Cyprus. The statement indicates that a solution to the  Cyprus issue can be achieved if the issue is discussed in all  its entirety, by holding free negotiations between  representatives of the two communities, and without any external  intervention. The statement further notes that an agreement  attained by means of negotiations can be valid only after both  communities give their approval.    The statement further expresses appreciation of President  Rauf Denktas' efforts toward peace.    The conclusion of the communique expresses the following  views:    [Begin Hatipoglu recording] The TGNA announces that Turkey  endorses the Turkish Cypriot cause with determination and that  it will extend assistance to the TRNC in all areas. On this  occasion, we would like to express once more the Turkish  people's determination in fulfilling its responsibilities. [end  recording]</p>

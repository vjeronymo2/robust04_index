			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exports help Record to Pounds 2.4m Helped by improved exports, Record Holdings achieved a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 2.41m in 1993. The Sheffield-based toolmaker attributed the rise to an improvement in overall efficiency, improved prices and the absence of any large reorganisation costs. Turnover rose from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 29.4m. There was a 6 per cent fall in the home market but exports advanced 15 per cent to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 12.5m). Sales in the US rose by 56 per cent. Earnings were 4.5p (1.7p). The dividend is held at 3.6p including a 2.45p final. The shares rose 12p to 93p.</p>

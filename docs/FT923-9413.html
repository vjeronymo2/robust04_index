			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Bank chief defends tax credit scheme SIR Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, yesterday stood by his controversial proposals for a tax credit scheme to revive the housing market. He said that it was an 'open secret' that Whitehall was looking for ways to solve the housing market recession. Sir Christopher said that he was a bit taken aback that much of the media had missed key characteristics of his proposals, including the Pounds 10,000 ceiling on the tax credit. 'It was an embryo idea rather than a fully worked up proposal. We hoped that other lenders would contribute to that process as well.' He remained reasonably confident that there would be a housing recovery, even without a government initiative to revitalise the market. 'We do not believe in the disaster scenario. I don't doubt that the housing market will revive. We can already see some encouraging features in it. But there is a big difference between sooner and later as far as the economic situation is concerned,' he said. 'The later it happens, the more pain there will be and the more jobs and businesses there will be lost and also the greater the pressure the government will come under.' Sir Christopher said he was disappointed that some people had seen his proposals as self-seeking. 'We at Abbey National do not need a plan of this sort ourselves. The outlook from Abbey National is probably a bit better than it is from many other vantage points.' He also rejected claims that Abbey National had underestimated the cost of its proposals. He said the bank had been very tentative about potential costs because there were several complex and uncertain factors involved.</p>

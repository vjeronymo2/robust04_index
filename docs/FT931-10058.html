			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (18): Looking forward to a healthy future / Profile of Gambro GAMBRO is one of the few continuing success stories in slump-hit corporate Sweden. As one of the world's leading health care companies, its range of products on global markets have hardly been affected by the prevailing Nordic economic gloom. The company's inexorable climb up the FT500 from 454 in 1991 to 375 this year reflects a consistently strong performance which shows no signs of coming to an end. In the first half of 1992 Gambro recorded a 24 per cent increase in its pre-tax earnings to SKr396m and a 9 per cent improvement in group sales to SKr3.054bn. Analysts believe Gambro should go on improving its profits by an average of 12 to 15 per cent a year through the early 1990s. The company itself expects to see strong growth in all of its five designated business areas of renal care, cardiovascular surgery, intensive care and anaesthesia, blood component technology and preventive health services. The ageing of the baby boom generation in the western world promises to increase the demand for most of Gambro's products in global markets for the foreseeable future. Forecasts up to 1996 suggest an 8 per cent annual growth rate in global demand for renal care products, with a 6 per cent rise in cardiovascular surgery, 7 per cent in intensive care and anaesthesia and as much as 20 per cent in blood component technology. Mr Berthold Lindqvist, the company's president, argues Gambro's present success first began with its aggressive acquisition offensive launched in 1987, when the company strengthened its share of the European dialysis market to nearly half through the Dollars 187m purchase of Sopamed, the Swiss parent company of the Hospal group. 'It was sensible to maintain two sales organisations for Gambro and Hospal,' explains Mr Lindqvist. This helped to boost the company's performance. Three years later Gambro extended its penetration of the vital US market with the Dollars 253m acquisition of Cobe Laboratories. As a result of that strategic move Gambro strengthened its interest in cardiovascular surgery and blood component technology. 'We had been struggling in the US before then,' says Mr Lindqvist. 'Buying Cobe gave us a critical mass and enabled us to operate there much more effectively.' In October last year Gambro became majority shareholder with a 51 per cent stake in the US dialysis clinic chain, REN Corporation, in a Dollars 78m deal. A new business area - health care services - is being created to absorb this latest acquisition. Founded in 1964 as a Swedish company in Lund in the south-west of the country, today Gambro is truly international with 99 per cent of its business conducted in foreign currencies. It now employs four times as many employees in the US as it does in Sweden. Mr Lindqvist estimates the company has up to 30 per cent of the world market share in renal care products, about a quarter of that in cardiovascular surgery and up to a third in blood component technology. At present renal care accounts for an estimated 73 per cent of group sales but Mr Lindqvist points to the large growth opportunities in other parts of Gambro's product range. His main task at present is to improve the return on capital employed in its intensive care and anaesthesia which is not up to the company's target. Overall, however, Gambro can look forward to a healthy future in an industry which seems for the moment immune from the impact of global recession.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Adams says meetings with US officials going well Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said that his meetings with US officials in Washington this week had brought 'an enormous move forward for peace and for justice and reconciliation in Ireland', George Graham and David Owen write. He added: 'We have made the hope more of a reality today.' Mr Adams's comments came after he had met senior officials at the US State Department on Tuesday in the first official contact between the US administration and Sinn Fein, and after a lengthy debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, on the CNN cable television network. But the debate, touted as the highlight of Mr Adams's two-week tour of the US, was rated as a 'no-score draw' by observers. The two men tried to outdo each other with stories of how many times they had been shot at or bombed. Mr Adams (pictured right) sought repeatedly to put Mr Maginnis (left) on the spot by offering a handshake. Mr Maginnis refused and spoke only to the show's host, Larry King, rather than to Mr Adams. But both men came under attack from viewers - all of them claiming to be Irish - for refusing to do what was necessary to bring about peace. Mr Maginnis's decision to participate in a debate with Mr Adams was attacked by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party. He said the arguments in favour of taking part were 'heavily outweighed by the principles that have been given away by him sitting down on the same platform as the leader of the Provisional movement'.</p>

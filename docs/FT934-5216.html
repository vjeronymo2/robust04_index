			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Council to back Patten over democracy bill Hong Kong governor Chris Patten yesterday won the support of his Executive Council, or colonial cabinet, to push ahead with the first stage of his democracy legislation. The council voted 10 to 1 in favour of introducing a bill into the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's 60-strong law-making body, early next month. China has warned that if the bill is tabled in LegCo, further talks about Hong Kong's political development can not take place. China has accused the British of scuppering a potential deal because they brought up extraneous issues, a charge vigorously denied by London. But Beijing has sought to reassure Hong Kong that in the absence of a deal it will do its best to preserve the colony's prosperity and stability. The two sides got close to agreeing a first-stage deal when talks broke down at the weekend. The possibility remains that an agreement might be clinched before Mr Patten presents his bill. The bill contains provisions to lower Hong Kong's voting age to 18 from 21 years, abolish appointments to local government, and provide for 20 single-seat, single-vote constituencies for LegCo elections due in 1995. The more controversial aspects of Mr Patten's plans, which cover voting arrangements for 40 of LegCo's seats, will be left to another bill. It is expected that this will be introduced sometime in the new year. The Executive Council's decision was communicated yesterday to Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary. He is expected to endorse the decision. The bill will be put to LegCo on either December 8 or December 15.</p>

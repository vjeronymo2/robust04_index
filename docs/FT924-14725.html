			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ramus shows Pounds 2.9m loss as control changes hands RAMUS HOLDINGS, the USM-quoted distributor of ceramic tiles and kitchen furniture, yesterday announced sharply increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.95m for the year to June 30 and a Pounds 3m cash injection giving control to a specially created Jersey company. Guoline Holdings, owned by Malaysian companies Hong Leong Industries and Hume Industries (Malaysia), has agreed to subscribe for 6.5m new ordinary shares at 50p each, giving it 57.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital. The Takeover Panel has consented to waive conditions which would require Guoline to make an offer for Ramus. The company said that once the subscription was completed the entire board would resign, with the exception of Mr Lionel Ramus, chairman, and Mr John Ramus. Mr KC Wong would become joint managing director with Mr John Ramus. The proceeds of the subscription will be used to provide additional working capital and repay Pounds 1.5m of bank borrowings. Ramus said yesterday that trading conditions had become severe in the second half. Force One, distributor of kitchens and bathrooms acquired last December, had produced a disappointing performance and as a result its management had been replaced. The pre-tax loss, which compared with a Pounds 360,000 deficit last time, included Pounds 700,000 trading losses from Force One. Sales were Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 49.3m). Losses per share jumped to 63.1p (5.1p). There is no final dividend; last year 0.1p was paid. Dealings in the company's shares were suspended on September 16. The directors expect dealings to resume on Friday.</p>

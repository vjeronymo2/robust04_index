			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Summer Rites: The British class system all at sea THE PHRASE 'classless society' conjures up all the excesses of the French Revolution. But British premier John Major is not a second Robespierre, and it has to be said that his vision of classlessness remains utterly chimerical. To appreciate how chimerical, you have only to cross the Channel. It is not necessary to disembark. Simply make the crossing, once a year, to confirm that egalite, in British eyes, is still regarded as a coarse continental concept, as distastefully remote from England's shores as foie gras, horse-butchers and pistol-waving policemen. It yields the best form of deck entertainment: pacing the various levels of your ferry and noting the many modulations and nuances of British inequality. The aristocracy is thoroughly conspicuous by its absence. Time was when you might have spotted bulk consignments of the country's peerage, off to fritter their boodle at the gaming tables of Boulogne and Deauville. The seriously rich still go to France but not to those parts, and certainly not by means so putrid and earth-bound as a ferry. One can see why the gentry stays clear, for the ferries have taken on the unfortunate function of transporting to France great numbers of Britons whose natural inclination is to have as little as possible to do with France or anything French. The irony is that The Sun, staunch organ of proletarian francophobia, actually promotes the sale of discounted tickets; gets the charabancs down from Benfleet and Basildon and fills the ferries with cheery excursionists whose ancestors might once have been flogged into some sort of service by Nelson or Jellicoe but who now present a sorry sight. The younger ones like to drink, drop their trousers and expose all their paunchy boorishness; the older ones like to drink, too, exploring all nooks of the duty-free shop and raising toasts to French inferiority with a magnum of Blue Nun. Give them half-an-hour in the bar and they will regale the entire vessel with choruses from Vera Lynn. On arrival in Calais, they want nothing more than to be greeted by a familiar Cockney voice and a leaflet showing the way to the nearest depot of cheap beer. No wonder the middle classes shy away from the ship's saloon: the last thing one wants to see en route to the Dordogne is a derriere from Basildon. So middle-class travellers are to be found in the restaurant, or perhaps peeling hard-boiled eggs and spotting petrels on the blustery upper deck. The really shrewd bourgeoisie choose their ferry companies with care. They may know, for example, that one company, Britanny Ferries, recently tried to ban motor cyclists from passage. There were immediate  - and probably reasonable - protests from the lobby of well-groomed motor cyclists. But we class-watchers know perfectly well what that ferry company was up to. It was not so much motor cyclists per se they were trying to deter as a gamut of types likely to give offence to the better class of passenger. Men with rings thrust through their ears and dragons emblazoned on their arms. Unspeakable bovine characters who have not only Artexed their ceilings but then trumped that vulgarity by installing electric chandeliers. The last thing that the middle-class mariner wants is fraternity on a ferry with this mob. It says a great deal about Robespierre's legacy that a correspondingly delicate classification of French travellers is difficult to achieve. On my last crossing I scrutinised a sizeable French detachment for signs of their answer to Essex Man. I saw one chunky Frenchman sporting a tracksuit and a medallion but he turned out to be courteous to the purser, sober at his repast and nicely informed about the later Matisse. In any case, l'homme de Pas de Calais is an unconvincing sort. If he does exist, it is hard to see why on earth he might want to make a day trip to Dover or Newhaven. As a sociological exercise, traversing la manche is really an end in itself. The proper attitude is to study and enjoy all its cheek-by-jowel dynamics. There may be many good reasons for not using the Channel Tunnel when it opens, but the best of all, I think, is that it will be terribly dull.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Hideaki Kumano, vice  minister of international trade and industry, said Thursday [19  May] the government's decision to freeze hikes on public service  fees is "appropriate."    The decision was made taking into account various factors  facing the private sector, including business restructuring  efforts, Kumano told a news conference.    Implementation of the rate hikes at a time when the economy  is still in a slump would affect industrial activity in Japan,  Kumano said.    The government announced Wednesday it will suspend until the  end of this year a plan to raise public services charges,  including public transportation fees, highway tolls, telephone  rates and rent on government-owned houses.    Meanwhile, Kumano voiced regret over gasoline sales by an  unlicensed gas station near Nagoya in defiance of government  instructions. The gas station should get a government permit at  an early time by agreeing to undergo proper procedures, Kumano  said.    The gas station in question on Wednesday began selling  gasoline at prices very low for Japan, and motorists flocked to  fill up. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry did  not issue a business license for the station because it did not  clarify the wholesale routes of its products, one requirement  for operating a gas station. A government advisory panel is now  studying whether or not the requirement should be scrapped as  part of deregulation, Kumano said.</p>

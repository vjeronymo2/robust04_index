			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE BOTTOM IN NATIONWIDE DIAPER WARS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: DISPOSABLES ARE A BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS, AND MOTHERS LOVE THEM.  BUT THEY CREATE A TRASH NIGHTMARE.  </P> <P> It was test-marketed in 1961 in -- where else? -- Peoria, Ill.  </P> <P> And, oh, how well it played!  </P> <P> In the years since, the disposable diaper has been improved: There are  elasticized leg bands, gels, super absorbency, and anatomically efficient "his"  and "hers" designs.  </P> <P> It has become a $3.5-billion-a-year industry, and 85% of American mothers use  them.  </P> <P> In recent years, the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry  environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a throwaway  society. The problem is what to do with it once it has done its job. Throwaway  diapers are piling up in the waste stream.  </P> <P> The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has become a subject of hot debate in  statehouses and city halls. The issue has generated piles of reports and  pamphlets. Who would have thought the manufacturers of disposable diapers would  have to go to such lengths to defend such a wonder product?  </P> <P> Bills that would ban, restrict or tax sales of disposable diapers are before  the legislatures of a dozen states.  </P> <P> Meanwhile the controversy has breathed new life into the diaper service  business, and it could prove a boon to corn farmers.  </P> <P> Studies show that although disposable diapers are only about 2% of the nation's  trash, they last 500 years in a landfill. One proposed solution is a  more-expensive biodegradable diaper, and that's where the corn farmers come in.  </P> <P> Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste-reduction expert with the Environmental Action  Foundation, said the disposable diaper is the largest single one-use product  for which there is a readily available alternative -- cloth diapers.  </P> <P> But the convenience factor is extraordinary. Many day-care centers, for  example, will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers.  </P> <P> And, if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow, there would be chaos. There are  not enough cloth diapers or cloth diaper services in the country to accommodate  them. In environmentally hip Washington, D.C., 400 names are on the waiting  list for the one diaper service in town.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Diaper Services, after years of decline, reported a 38%  increase in business last year and a 13% rise the year before. The disposable  diaper makers, however, say they see no blip yet on their sales screen.  </P> <P> The debate has produced strange bedfellows. The six most active environmental  groups and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp., the disposable  diaper manufacturers who control more than 75% of the market, agree that  biodegradable diapers are not the answer.  </P> <P> Last December, environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers,  saying their use merely assuages the consumer's conscience. Biodegradable  diapers don't decompose in landfills because there is not enough moisture or  oxygen in a dump, they said.  </P> <P> Taking an opposing view is the National Assn. of Corn Growers, based in St.  Louis. Cornstarch is used in the degradables and this could open up a market of  150 million to 300 million bushels a year for the nation's corn farmers,  spokesman Tim Draeger said.  </P> <P> So far, the only state to enact legislation has been Nebraska, which passed a  law last session requiring the use of biodegradables by 1993. Nebraska, it  might be noted, is the nation's third-largest corn-producing state, just behind  Iowa and Illinois.  </P> <P> Draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology were improved, it  would mean America would be less dependent on foreign oil.  </P> <P> "We are in the infancy of this technology," he said. "We are at the Model T  level. We have to learn to walk before we can run."  </P> <P> Wirka said that is plain silly because the amount of "foreign oil" in diapers  is negligible and the so-called degradables also contain some oil.  </P> <P> Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, with a $1.65-billion slice of the  disposable pie -- compared to Kimberly-Clark's $840 million -- has taken a much  higher profile in its fight to keep baby's bottom in Pampers and Luvs.  </P> <P> Although close-mouthed about how much it is spending on the diaper wars, P  &amp; G is sponsoring two well-publicized projects, one in Seattle  demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and another in St. Cloud,  Minn., to show that diapers can be composted. The Seattle project is reputed to  be a $500,000 venture.  </P> <P> "If you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the trash problem in  America, we wouldn't have a trash problem," said Jeffrey Tryens of the Council  for Policy Alternatives, a Washington-based environmental group. "It's just  good public relations for Procter &amp; Gamble."  </P> <P> Wirka, however, thinks the St. Cloud project may have some merit, although, she  said: "That recycling project is just bogus.  </P> <P> "Procter &amp; Gamble is in a difficult position. They are always the target  here and they are applying their corporate good guy image on something that is  economically very dubious. I'm more willing to say that the composting project  is a more fruitful use of their resources."  </P> <P> P&amp;G, it should be noted, has been a leader in recycling plastic bottles for  its products, selling refills for the same plastic bottle and marketing  concentrates in smaller bottles where the consumer just needs to add water. Its  soaps are also biodegradable.  </P> <P> Since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows, politicians have  gotten bolder. Tryens said he called a meeting about a year ago, inviting  legislators, lobbyists, environmentalists and others concerned about the issue.  </P> <P> "At that time, nobody even considered discussing a statewide ban," he said.  "The feeling was that no respectable politician would even propose such  legislation and that it just wouldn't fly."  </P> <P> But one year later, the state of Vermont is proposing just such legislation as  part of a much larger environmental bill. If passed, no disposable diapers  would be sold in Vermont after 1993.  </P> <P> Nancy Alexander of New Haven, Conn., is one who's profiting by it all. She  started her own cloth diaper service in January and said clients are flocking  to her door.  </P> <P> "I've always wanted to go into my own business and this just sort of fell into  my lap," she said. "What's more is that all of my clients treat me like I'm  some kind of a hero."  </P> <P> One of her clients with a newborn baby said her 4-year-old was watching her  change the baby with a disposable diaper and had a quizzical look on her face.  </P> <P> "What is it?" asked the mother.  </P> <P> "Why don't they invent a diaper you could just wash and use over and over?"  asked the child.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disposable Diapers  </P> <P> How Single-use Diapers Work  </P> <P> Absorbent layer-filled with wood-pulp or acrylic polymer crystals that can  absorb up to 80 times their weight in moisture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tape  </P> <P> Elastic gathers-Fit snug around baby's legs to prevent leakage  </P> <P> Plastic Liner-Keeps moisture inside diaper  </P> <P> Liner-Holds absorbent layer in place and prevents moisture from flowing back to  baby's skin  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disposable diapers are a product with a possible 15-minute life span which will  last 500 years in a landfill.  </P> <P> More expensive degradable diapers may hinder future plastic-recycling efforts.  </P> <P> Disposable diapers make up 2% of the municipal solid waste we produce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Diaper Market  </P> <P> Kimberly-Clark (Huggies): 30%  </P> <P> Procter &amp; Gamble (Pampers): 25%  </P> <P> Procter &amp; Gamble (Luvs): 24%  </P> <P> Weyehaeuser (private label): 10%  </P> <P> Other: 11%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solid Waste and The Diaper  </P> <P> Estimated amounts of the trash we produce, based on waste characterization  studies, acknowledging single-use diapers contain overlapping categories of  waste.  </P> <P> Diapers: 2.0%  </P> <P> Paper: 36%  </P> <P> Plastic: 7.6%  </P> <P> Yard trimmings: 20%  </P> <P> Food: 8.7%  </P> <P> Glass: 8.4%  </P> <P> Metal: 8.9%  </P> <P> Other: 8.4%  </P> <P> Source: Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., Corn Growers Assn., The Garbage Project,  University of Arizona  </P></p>

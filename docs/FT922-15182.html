			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Delors may intervene over trade talks MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is expected to try to break the impasse in the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation negotiations in talks with President George Bush later this month. This emerged as a senior EC negotiator, Mr Hugo Paemen, called for 'last, ultimate efforts' to get a political breakthrough in the Round before the Easter deadline set by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Mr Paemen said a political accord would have to resolve the differences on agri - culture, services and market access, and that detailed 'implementing work' could be done in the following two months. Commission officials said Mr Delors was likely to try to get a mandate on the Uruguay Round from EC heads of government, before meeting Mr Bush on April 22, along with Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which currently holds the EC's rotating presidency. This meeting is one of the twice-yearly EC-US summits, but is now set to be the last chance for a Gatt breakthrough if none occurs by the April 19 deadline. It also emerged yesterday that EC-US negotiators may be making some headway on the farm subsidy row, which, along with US reluctance to open up parts of its service industries, is the main obstacle to a deal. In particular, there are signs of movement on the so-called 'green box' issue - whether Washington will consent to allowing payments Brussels wants to make to farmers, in compensation for big price cuts, to be considered as non-trade distorting. The US is understood to be considering a 'blue box,' whereby these payments would be unchallenged for six years, provided they then became degressive and the EC provided a framework ensuring they constrained rather than promoted production. There is so far no sign the US is prepared to meet EC objections to Gatt's formula to cut the volume of subsidised exports, in addition to the subsidies. The chances of the EC accepting some volume constraint depend, some officials now believe, on the US agreeing to a partial freeze on its cheap grain substitutes coming into the Community.

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Monopoly policy no less tough Sir, Robert Rice ('Watchdog barks but the MMC moves on', May 17) suggests that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has adopted a less interventionist approach since its 1989 report on beer was overruled by the government. May we, as two of the authors of the beer report, point out that the MMC has recently taken an equally tough line on another major industry? Last August's report on gas recommended enforced division of British Gas's trading arm from its transportation business - hardly evidence of a 'relaxed policy'. Some of the recent criticism of the MMC appears to ignore the legal framework in which it operates. The Fair Trading Act permits the MMC to make recommendations only where it finds a situation to be 'against the public interest'. In other words, there is no presumption that refusal to supply, tying of retail outlets, or any other practice is prohibited unless it can be shown to be positively good for consumers (as would be the case in European law). The presumption is that such practices are permitted unless they can be shown to be positively bad. We might not agree with every recent decision the MMC has made, but we are not convinced that there has been a change of policy or even approach. What would be very disturbing, however, would be any suggestion that the MMC's independence from political pressure was at risk. The great strength of UK competition policy is the major role it gives to an independent body with a statutory duty to publish its findings for all to see. This goes a long way towards de-politicising decisions on particular cases. Any threat to this independence should be strongly resisted.

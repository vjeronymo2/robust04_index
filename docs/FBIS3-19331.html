Thus, the wage level  in the new laender rose from 73 to 80 percent of the western  wages and salaries. This has been revealed by the annual  assessment of the wage settlements by the Labor Ministry.    Yet there are considerable differences between eastern and  western Germany concerning fringe benefits. The same applies to  the weekly working hours: In the west, the average was 37.76  hours, and in the east over two hours more. [passage omitted]</p>

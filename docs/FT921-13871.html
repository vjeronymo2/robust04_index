			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Books: Intoxicated by smoke TOBACCO: A HISTORY by VG Kiernan Hutchinson Radius Pounds 18.99, 250 pages DURING late Roman times, Boethius wrote his celebrated Consolations of Philosophy; a millennium-and-a-half on, the Scottish historian, VG Kiernan, has written a stimulating, amusing account of the consolations of tobacco, that palliative for our more troubled times. Tobacco was unknown outside the Americas until five centuries ago and it was Sir Walter Raleigh who was said to have popularised its introduction to these shores, smoking stoically as he witnessed the execution of Essex in 1601. The Indians of the Americas regarded smoking as a form of prayer; the mild intoxication that the drug induced brought one to the very threshold of the divine and - pipe-sharing being common amongst them - also served to promote a sense of primitive bondage. By the 18th century, snuff-taking had temporarily supplanted tobacco in popularity. According to our author, this quaint practice of drawing snuff up into the nasal passages lent itself to niceties of deportment; one contemporary writer even prescribed 14 separate movements of the hand, wrist, arm and nose. As further evidence of its popularity, the author cites Marie Antoinette, whose corbeille of wedding presents was said to have contained no fewer than 52 snuff boxes. And perhaps the fact that George III's consort was nicknamed 'Snuffy Charlotte' was more than the mere insult that it appears to be. By the time of the Napoleonic Wars, cigarettes had come into circulation, but they were long viewed with suspicion. One popular writer had a tellingly-simple explanation for the German victories of 1870: the philosophical Germans smoked pipes, the effeminate French their filthy little cigarettes. It is perhaps fighting men who owe their greatest debt to tobacco. Peter the Great, Frederick the Great, Napoleon; all these heroes smoked furiously as they fought and plotted. As the Sudan gradually fell into the hands of the Mahdi, Gordon, governor-general of Khartoum, stuff of schoolboy legend, 'chain-smoked fat cigarettes, rolled by a cavasse, standing behind his chair with one ready to slip between his fingers when he silently held up a hand for it.' Like many another man of action, Gordon smoked much and ate little. Of Napoleon, too, it was said by a contemporary: 'beaucoup de tabac, beaucoup de cafe.' And during the 1914-18 War the British public subscribed enough money to provide the men at the front with 232,599,191 cigarettes. This fact is almost as remarkable as the survival of this ridiculous statistic. But many writers, too, have insisted that there is a link between smoking and creative exertions. Bertolt Brecht advocated a 'smoking theatre' on the grounds that an audience could be got to think if it were allowed to smoke. Tennyson smoked and drank heavily throughout his long life and believed that his finest poetical moments were experienced when that massive, grey head was wreathed in impenetrable spumes of smoke. Anthony Trollop wrote in his autobiography that 'it has been the companionship of smoking that I have loved rather than the habit.' But tobacco has had as many detractors as champions. James I was a fanatical opponent of the habit and prelates down the ages have regarded smoking as a peril to health and morals. It is, of course, the poor who have sought most consolation in tobacco; anything that might help to soothe the ills that their fellow men have heaped upon their heads. Perhaps tobacco barons are acting philanthropically when they off-load cigarettes by the million upon the poor of the Third World.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RIA report under the "In Brief" rubric] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- On 9 June, enterprises of the Russian  defense complex will halt the output of civilian products and  consumer goods for five to ten minutes, and will accompany this  action by blowing their sirens. A decision to this effect has  been made by the Central Council of the sectoral trade union in  support of the initiative of "defense workers" of Novosibirsk,  Vladimir, Kirov, Moscow, and a number of other oblasts. "We  hope to impress the government, which continues to ignore the  needs of the sector's working people," said the union leader  Sergey Shuklin. Simultaneously, he intimated, it was suggested  that work collectives discuss at the rallies, meetings, and  conferences whether it is wise to go over to the extreme form of  protest -- a strike. In Shuklin's words, military-industrial  complex working people "do not demand any subsidies or  privileges, and only insist on the most essential thing -- to be  paid on time and to keep their jobs."</p>

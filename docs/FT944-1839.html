			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: JFK - the man behind the myth PRESIDENT KENNEDY: A PROFILE OF POWER by Richard Reeves Macmillan Pounds 12.99, 800 pages Washington, DC, January 26, 1961, early morning; snow swirling from high winds, 12 degrees of frost, the worst inaugural weather in 52 years; John Fitzgerald Kennedy, president-elect, sits down to breakfast. Richard Reeves describes the scene: ''Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country,' said John F. Kennedy. Then he paused, took another bite of bacon, and reached for his coffee.' A surprisingly banal account, perhaps, of a particularly propitious moment in the life of a professional politician, but one that captures the distinctive tone and ambition of Reeves' biography. It is a long and very detailed book (we are even told, for example, that the pope, in honour of inauguration day, had given Roman Catholics in the Washington area 'a special dispensation from the Church's stricture against eating meat on Fridays' and that Kennedy had consumed no fewer than three rashers of bacon that morning), and it devotes most of its narrative to the account of what Kennedy did at significant points during his three years in power. Reeves is not so much interested in the myth as in the man, and not so much in the fixed historical facts as in the feel that they must have had as they took shape at the time. What Reeves attempts is nothing less than a reconstitution of an historical present. In stark contrast to the countless studies, ranging from the reverential to the sharply revisionist, which have sought to place the Kennedy presidency in a definitive interpretive resting-place, Reeves' approach strives to re-animate the political context of the time, to unsettle the confident images formed by hindsight. The Kennedy of Reeves' narrative is a man who did not know what he was doing at the beginning, and in some ways never changed at all, 'reacting to events he often neither foresaw nor understood,' a man who was 'intelligent and detached' but also 'careless and dangerously disorganised.' Comparisons with more recent US political figures, although not attempted in the text, are certainly not discouraged. What emerges from Reeves' account as Kennedy's most striking quality is his imaginative grace, his readiness to believe, unreservedly, in certain ideas and images about himself and his political potential. The presidency, observes Reeves, 'is an act of faith;' Kennedy, he argues, 'believed (and proved) that the only qualification for the most powerful job in the world was wanting it.' It is this adamantine characteristic that becomes something of a leitmotif in Reeve's narrative: the man who suffered from Addison's disease; who sometimes needed crutches or a cane in private to rest his back; who needed medication every day, sometimes every hour; who had received the last rites at least four times before he was elected president; yet who still preserved a public image as a beacon of youthful hope. 'He had little ideology,' claims Reeves. 'And he had less emotion. What he had was an attitude.' Reeves is most effective as a biographer considering Kennedy's personal and political attributes. He is less convincing (sometimes disturbingly so) as an historian. His coverage of Kennedy's relations with the Soviet Union seems distinctly uneven, and his account of the Cuban missile crisis is incomplete and, in places, rather misleading. For someone who purports to be committed to the discovery of what Kennedy knew 'and when he knew it and what he actually did - sometimes day by day, sometimes hour by hour, sometimes minute by minute,' he is also capable of making some curiously injudicious remarks. When, for example, Reeves discusses the growing tensions in black America, it is unlikely that he intends to be taken literally when he asserts that 'President Kennedy found out there was a revolution in his country by reading The New York Times on May 15, 1961,' but neither is it very clear why he felt the need to employ such a misleading turn of phrase. As a serious work of history, therefore, President Kennedy is, in spite of its apparent attention to detail, disappointingly lightweight and unreliable. As a popular biographical study of a president in power, however, it is well-written and refreshingly imaginative and vivid in its efforts at rendering a little more real those events too often obscured by myth.</p>

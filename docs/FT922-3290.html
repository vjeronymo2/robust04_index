			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Variations shown in unit costs WIDE VARIATIONS in the unit costs of providing Youth Training and Employment Training across England and Wales were indicated by a Labour party survey of Training and Enterprise Councils, disclosed yesterday, Diane Summers writes. The figures appeared to show that in Suffolk, for example, a YT place cost Pounds 65.15 a week, while in South Glamorgan it cost Pounds 34.19. The Department of Employment has been concerned in previous years about these large differences in the cost of provision. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, said yesterday that these variations had in the past 'suggested we were paying some too much'. However, the department had 'negotiated hard' on unit prices this year. Tecs themselves pointed to technical reasons for the variations, as well as differences in local requirements. Mr Mike Bax, chief executive of Suffolk Tec, said his was one of 11 areas involved in the government's pilot training credits scheme, and extra money allocated for the pilot had been incorporated within unit costs. High travel costs in the large area covered by his Tec and a doubling of unemployment over the past year had also pushed up costs, he said. Department of Employment officials also suggested that some Tecs may have excluded 25 per cent bonuses related to qualifications achieved by trainees. Mr John Forsdyke, chief executive of Kent Tec, said his unit costs for YT were nearer Pounds 50 when the bonus was added in, rather than the Pounds 36.59 shown for Kent in Labour's survey.</p>

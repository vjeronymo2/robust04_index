			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Chirac refuses to lead conservative Euro-fight France's conservative coalition has been forced to continue its search for someone to lead its campaign into this June's European parliament elections following the refusal by Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR leader, to do so. Mr Chirac's refusal was couched in terms which made clear his determination to challenge any attempt by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, for the presidency in 1995. 'The constraints' of the Euro-election campaign would be 'a distraction', Mr Chirac said, from his goal of planning 'the big reforms of our time'. In fact, it was Mr Chirac's own aides who fuelled recent speculation that he might head a joint ticket of the Gaullists and the UDF centre-right, perhaps as a way of reminding the French electorate of the mayor of Paris's existence. For Euro-elections, French parties present national lists, often headed by notables who on election immediately pass their Strasbourg seats to underlings. In the end, Mr Chirac appears to have calculated that the risk of doing badly in the Euro-elections, which voters see as an opportunity to discomfit the government, outweighed his acute need for publicity. To preserve his government's unity and his own poll standing, Mr Balladur is urging RPR-UDF unity in the Euro-elections. But Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, insists the two parties must share what he calls 'the three unities' - a single programme, a single list of candidates and a single parliamentary group in Strasbourg. This would involve the RPR joining the UDF in the Christian Democrat group in the parliament.</p>

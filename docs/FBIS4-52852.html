			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuroiso, Tochigi Pref., May 14 KYODO -- Former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe urged the minority coalition  government Saturday [14 May] to seek cooperation from the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to tide over the  unstable political situation.    Watanabe, leader of the LDP's third largest faction, said in  a lecture that the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  "should not hate the LDP and (should realize that) it cannot  live without asking help of the LDP from the front entrance."    He apparently balked at coalition's attempt to lure the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) to return to the coalition and  pressed the government and the LDP leadership to promote  cooperation between the LDP and the coalition.    "The cabinet, with a support of only one-third (members) in  the House of Representatives, could not stand for the people's  view," Watanabe said.    He said that there is the possibility that the LDP will  propose a no-confidence motion against the cabinet following the  Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget.    In April, Watanabe threatened to leave the LDP in a bid to  seek the premiership, hoping to gain possible backing from some  of the coalition.    Despite the abortive bid for the premership, he has not lost  his aspiration for power, saying in Saturday's lecture "if there  are more stages to push through my own principles, I will do so."</p>

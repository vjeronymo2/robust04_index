			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENS: POINTS OF INTEREST;  </P> <P> IN THIS CLASSIC FORMAL GARDEN, STATUES AND FOUNTAINS LURE VISITORS EVER FARTHER  INTO THE LANDSCAPE  </P> <P> ROUNDING A corner on a certain stretch of Beverly Hills' Sunset Boulevard,  motorists can't help but be surprised at the audacity of the nicely dressed  couple trying to get a view of what is beyond a high stucco wall. They are  statues, of course, by Stuart Johnson, as are the wall's tireless painters and  the security guard by the gate.  </P> <P> But what is on the other side? A private residence with a garden that is as  classically formal as the statues on the street are modern. Statues are an  important part of the inner garden as well, but all within are antique,  purchased in Italy by the estate's owners. To a large extent, the landscape  architects, Galper / Baldon Associates, designed the garden around them.  "Remnants of an older formal plan" on the old estate, Cleo Baldon says, served  as the inspiration. Formal gardens such as this one are walking gardens,  designed for people to move through. The paths are straight and neat, and  objects such as fountains and statues are placed in the distance and along the  way to lure visitors ever farther into the landscape.  </P> <P> The most puzzling aspect of the redesign of this garden was to provide safe  access off a blind corner on Sunset. What Baldon calls an off-ramp feeds into a  sharply angled drive, which then leads to a small formal garden surrounding an  antique fountain. Broken concrete is the paving material, with dichondra  between the cracks to break up the monotony. The beds here are the most  colorful in the garden, filled during cold weather with tulips and  winter-spring flowers. When the jacaranda trees come into flower in early  summer, the beds are changed to marigolds and ageratum, which landscape  architect Alan Fleischacker of Galper/Baldon, who has been in charge of this  ongoing project for the last several years, specified to mimic the color of the  jacaranda blossoms overhead. From the side windows of the living room, there is  a perfect view of the fountain, which serves as a distraction from the bustle  of the busy street beyond the wall.  </P> <P> Walking through an arched passageway in a wall on the other side of the  fountain brings one to a formal rose garden off the mansion's terrace. Another  path runs a mighty distance between trees and spectacular Phoenix canariensis  palms, some of them remnants of the earlier garden. The view from there is as  straight as an arrow. Far in the distance is yet another antique figure that  draws you into the garden to investigate. Little statues stand all along the  way; another fountain marks the halfway point.  </P> <P> Near the end of the walk is the swimming pool. It is centered on the path as if  it were a reflecting pond. Just beyond it is a spa, disguised as yet another  small fountain. The classic beauty standing over the spa, another statue  protected by an arbor and only dimly visible from the house, is the reward at  the end of this garden walk.  </P></p>

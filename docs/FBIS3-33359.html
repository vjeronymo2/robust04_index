			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor of SEMANA by Prosecutor General </F> Gustavo de Greiff]    [Text] In these remarks, Mr. Editor, I refer to the note "A  Terse Send-off" in the "Confidential" column and the account  titled "De Greiff vs. Reno" in issue No. 611 [18 January]    1. It is absolutely untrue that there are differences  between  the government, "which maintains a tough stance," and the  Prosecutor General's Office, "which is ready to give in to a  substantial degree." There are no differences between the former  and the latter. With respect to the Prosecutor General's Office,  it is not a matter of giving in or not giving in. The Prosecutor  General's office must follow a set of judicial procedures, in  strict compliance with the law, and cannot be prejudicial So,  this terseness has its origin in this circumstance and not in  the differences invented in your "feverish" imagination    2. It is absolutely untrue that I told Mrs. Reno that "the  situation with the Cali cartel could be resolved by pardoning  its principle leaders." I cannot grant pardons. You, and the  source who was the originator of this information, should know  this. Allow me to recommend that you exercise caution with this  source because this person either harbors bad intentions in  giving you false information or is very poorly informed.    Furthermore, the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] has  officially told me that none of its agents said what you  attribute to "authorized spokespersons" from that agency of the  U.S. Department of Justice. Stop the irresponsible journalism!!!    [Signed] Gustavo de Greiff R., Prosecutor General</p>

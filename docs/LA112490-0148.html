			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO JAZZ SCENE HAS GROWING PAINS  </P> <P> San Diego's jazz club scene has matured, but not without growing pains.  </P> <P> In the past two years alone, clubs such as the Bella Via, Our Place, Vic's and  Diego's Loft have closed or discontinued jazz. But venues such as Croce's, the  Horton Grand Hotel and All That Jazz in Rancho Bernardo emerged to take their  places.  </P> <P> Other jazz spots, such as the Catamaran and Chuck's Steakhouse, switched from  traditional, straight-ahead jazz to light-contemporary jazz to lure larger  crowds. And thus began the great debate between the light jazzers and the  traditional purists.  </P> <P> Light, or "contemporary," jazz was popularized by KIFM (98.1) radio during the  1980s. You don't need a lot of patience or musical education to appreciate its  simple, predictable melodies, which are seldom interrupted by improvisation. By  contrast, spontaneous improvisation is the common characteristic of such  traditional jazz forms as Big Band music or the small-group be-bop originated  by players such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker during the 1940s. This  essential difference has left two camps of fans and musicians at odds.  </P> <P> "Some people take exception to the fact that they call that music jazz," said  Tony Sidotti, a disc jockey on KSDS-FM (88.3) who also books straight-ahead  jazz in local clubs. "However, I do feel that the end result of KIFM's music is  more positive than negative. You've seen some of that in the last year, with  (light jazz players such as) David Benoit and Lee Ritenour doing straight-ahead  jazz albums."  </P> <P> The KIFM-sponsored Lites Out Jazz club circuit now features jazz at the  Catamaran, Humphrey's, Anthony's Harborside and other venues six nights a week.  In some clubs, light jazz preempted other forms of jazz.  </P> <P> The Catamaran in Pacific Beach and Chuck's Steakhouse (not on KIFM's circuit)  in La Jolla, for example, were straight-ahead venues that went light.  </P> <P> "For some 20 years, we were sort of a (straight-ahead) jazz club," said George  Harrington, general manager at the Catamaran for six years. "When I got to town  in 1985, I met Art Good," who pioneered light jazz on KIFM. "We went over to  Humphrey's one night to hear light jazz, and the place was packed. We decided  to go with it at the Catamaran.  </P> <P> "There was no conscious decision to use contemporary jazz over straight-ahead.  It was just something that was happening in 1985, and it looked like a good way  to fill the room on Wednesday nights. It was a winner from Day One. The room  seats 350, and it has been full the last three Wednesdays."  </P> <P> Harrington doubts he will ever go back to straight-ahead jazz. He doesn't think  the light jazz and rock fans who now flock to the hotel's Cannibal Bar on  different nights would have much use for it.  </P> <P> "Lites Out Jazz is winning, unfortunately," said bassist Kevin Hennessy, who  plays a variety of jazz with several local bands. "I love to play  straight-ahead jazz, but I never get calls for it."  </P> <P> Yet some clubs have kept their traditional jazz, and persistence sometimes  allows them to build loyal followings.  </P> <P> "We've spent as much as $10,000 a month subsidizing our jazz, but now it pretty  much breaks even," said Ingrid Croce, who features local straight-ahead jazz  groups twice a day, seven days a week at Croce's, the downtown restaurant and  bar she owns.  </P> <P> One debate between fans of the two musics has centered on whether KIFM and  contemporary jazz can help bring new listeners to other forms of jazz.  </P> <P> "Does the popularity of light jazz help KSDS and straight-ahead jazz?" said  Tony Sisti, programming director at KSDS. "I don't know. The sense I get is  KIFM brings listeners to KIFM. Our audience doesn't tolerate much contemporary  jazz. A guy called in today while we were playing a Chuck Mangione song and  said, 'Do us a favor. No more Chuck Mangione.' We play a little fusion or  contemporary jazz, but we're very selective. We don't play Kenny G., but we  would play something like the Yellowjackets and Michael Brecker."  </P> <P> Kenny Weissberg, who prefers traditional jazz to the light jazz he presents  during the summer Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay series, nonetheless thinks  KIFM deserves some credit.  </P> <P> "They play a lot of music that doesn't get much radio play anywhere else. They  have more artists and songs on their list than Q-106, B-100, KGB or even 91X.  In terms of taking chances, no one in commercial radio takes chances, which  leaves it to college or nonprofit radio to play people like Jelly Roll Morton  or Miles Davis."  </P> <P> A healthy trend from all this is the blurring of borders among varieties of  jazz.  </P> <P> KSDS plays the top contemporary and traditional jazz albums of the week on its  "Friday Night Countdown" program.  </P> <P> Elario's, the La Jolla club that for years featured only veterans of  straight-ahead jazz, is branching out, even trying to lure KIFM's audience.  </P> <P> "Straight-ahead jazz is a very, very tough art form to make money in," said Rob  Hagey, who books Elario's.  </P> <P> Since Hagey began coordinating the talent last spring, Elario's has expanded  its lineup to include not only established, legendary straight-ahead players  such as Art Farmer, Benny Carter and Kenny Burrell, but also rising  straight-ahead musicians such as Christopher Hollyday and Marcus Roberts;  cutting-edge jazz musicians, including Sun Ra and Bill Frisell, and even KIFM  favorites such as Tim Eyermann.  </P> <P> "I think if KIFM's audience comes into the club to hear talent they recognize,  they might come back to hear a straight-ahead band and like it.  </P></p>

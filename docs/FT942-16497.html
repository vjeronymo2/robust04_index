			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Too discreet for comfort Could you tell me if any pamphlet is available explaining discretionary and other forms of trust? Discretionary and other trusts are notoriously complicated beasts and it is a little difficult to recommend anything other than to consult your legal advisor. As background reading, however, we would recommend the Equity and Trusts paperback by Paul Todd, published in the SWOT series of London legal publishers, Blackstone Press, price Pounds 8.95 (tel. 081-740 1173). (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management Ltd). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

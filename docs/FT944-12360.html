			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Israel reopens to workers Israel yesterday distributed the first batch of 8,000 entry permits for Palestinian building labourers from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The labourers will cross the old green-line border into Israel today for the first time since the Hamas suicide bombing which killed 22 bus passengers and wounded 47 in Tel Aviv two weeks ago. The number of permits will be gradually increased. The first group are married men aged 40 or over. Before the closure about 65,000 workers travelled daily to jobs in Israeli construction, farming and services. The reopening eases fears that keeping the workers from their livelihood fuelled support for the Islamic fundamentalists. In Gaza alone, unemployment was running at up to 60 per cent even before the closure. The Palestinian Workers Union estimated that the closure cost West Bank workers Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) a day. At the Erez terminal between Gaza and Israel, the Israelis are investing Dollars 30m in sophisticated computer equipment to combat a racket in forged permits. Once it is installed, every Palestinian worker will be checked on screen against his or her photograph and personal data. Ministers admitted that none of the recent attacks inside Israel was committed by permit holders. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said yesterday the closure had been necessary to restore calm. The Palestinian flag was raised yesterday alongside the Israeli flag at two border crossings from Egypt and Jordan. From now on entry through Rafah and the Allenby Bridge will be controlled jointly by Israeli and Palestinian police. In a complex arrangement agreed in Cairo six months ago, Israel retains overall responsibility for security at the crossings. Residents of the Gaza and Jericho enclaves, now ruled by Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestinian National Authority, will be checked only by Palestinians. Residents of the still-occupied West Bank will pass through Palestinian and Israeli counters. Israeli citizens will be checked only by Israelis.</p>

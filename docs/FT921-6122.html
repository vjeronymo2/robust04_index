			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (3): Legislators update the rules - The Channel Islands' sound regulatory framework is based on strict licensing THE CHANNEL Islands are fond of pointing out that they turned down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International's application to open an office. It was one instance of their regulatory framework not only working, but actually improving on the regulations in mainland Britain. They have built up a sound regulatory framework over the past decade, based on a strict licensing system. John Roper, director general of the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (FSC), sums it up: 'We control the formation of all Guernsey companies. Each one has to apply through the advocate's office.' A similar system of authorisation applies in Jersey, which updated its existing legislation last October with the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991. This replaces the Depositors and Investors (Prevention of Fraud) Law of 1967, and has been designed along the lines of the UK's Banking Act 1987 to bring the island into line with international standards. Guernsey, too, is introducing legislation to update its current banking law. Unlike Jersey, it is moving away from annual registration, partly because of the amount of paperwork involved. A draft is expected before the end of this year. So far, the Channel Islands have not joined the bandwagon, taking the view that it is preferable to play host only to top-drawer international institutions in the first place. However, Colin Powell, the Jersey government's economic adviser, comments that 'if deposit protection schemes become a symbol of international regulatory probity, then the island may well need to follow suit.' Jersey is also introducing new regulations on companies coming to the island, with a comprehensive new Company Law being brought into effect at the end of March. The legislation provides a framework for both starting up new companies and dissolving, winding up or amalgamating existing ones; it abolishes the doctrine of ultra vires, crystallises the responsibilities of directors, and gives parameters for investigation and inspection of companies. Trust formation is another area potentially open to abuse by unscrupulous elements, although the Channel Islands' longstanding tough admission policy for new businesses has helped in this respect. In order to set up or administer trusts, a trust licence must be obtained from the authorities, although there is currently no system of legislation requiring subsequent monitoring by them once the business is actually in operation. However, in Jersey, Colin Powell reports that the legislation currently in the pipeline to regulate the provision of financial services will cover trust and company administration. The aim will be for a renewable annual licence to enable a regular check to be made. Guernsey is also considering extending statutory regulation to 'fiduciaries'  -a collective term that will embrace trust companies as well as a range of other institutions managing customers' assets. But it is not looking at the licensing system favoured by Jersey. Belts are tightest as a result of the recession among the islands' fund managers. But 'hard times' is a relative term: total assets under management in Jersey rose to Pounds 7.3bn in September, from a nadir of Pounds 5.3bn the previous year. Guernsey, meanwhile, reports a 2.2 per cent increase in total asset value, bringing it up to almost Pounds 6bn in September 1991. Both islands report a move away from retail funds, where new competitors have emerged in the shape of Dublin and Luxembourg touting their European access advantages. As Colin Powell admits: 'Those inside Europe do have an advantage for retail funds .' That sentiment has been shared by some fund companies. Warburg and Fidelity took their retail funds to Luxembourg in 1990; Flemings followed suit in November 1991; Wardley moved the whole management operation over there. But wholesale emigration has not been a widespread reaction to the challenge presented by the European market. Some companies are working on joint ventures to sell through local banks in certain countries such as Spain and Portugal. And the authorities are themselves making approaches to EC member states, including Belgium, Spain and Denmark. A generally encouraging response from the various countries so far means that it's likely that companies will be able to gain authorisation to market retail funds direct to the public, on a fund-by-fund basis. While it has not been an easy market worldwide - David Clifford, of Invesco MIM, says it is simply harder to get customers to invest in funds - few of the islands' investment managers are deeply pessimistic. Jeffery Burton, managing director of Guernsey International Fund Managers, insists that 'it would be wrong to give an impression of gloom and despondency.' Val Goodwin, at Rothschild Asset Management, says that 'it has generally been the unit trust-driven fund managers who have had the biggest problems. We have not had the same difficulties, because our money funds have done very well and even increased in size over the past year (Dollars 1.2bn, compared with Dollars 1bn in October 1990).' Guinness Flight, which is also particularly strong on currency expertise, has had a successful year, too. The director of the Guernsey operation, Bruce Riley, believes the key in this respect is 'to invest in the markets you're keen on and in the currency that's performing well.' The company has been marketing energetically into the Middle and Far East in particular, and reckons 'there is still a lot of world apart from Europe'. Mr Riley attributes much of the company's impressive growth (60 per cent from September 1990 to December 1991 in both of its umbrella funds) to its marketing drive in these areas. 'All that comes to those who wait is old age,' he observed bullishly. Following this philosophy, the company has also linked up with a US-based company which is selling their products to expatriates in the States. Geographical specialisation has grown up over the years for many of the major firms - Kleinwort Benson is strong in southern and eastern Africa, for example, and Jersey-based Ashburton also has plentiful African contacts; David Hall, at Coutts in Jersey, highlights Israel as 'a good source of business'. But, as Jeffery Burton points out, 'many of us are broadening our areas of operation around the world.' One of the most often mentioned regions, in terms of potential, is the Far East, with an increasing number of Channel Island-base offices or representatives being established there. One significant development for the Channel Islands in 1991, with regard to possible new markets, was the agreement reached with the Japanese authorities, to the effect that Jersey and Guernsey SIB-recognised funds can be marketed to Japanese investors in Japan. This does not mean that the Japanese market will be cracked overnight. Retail funds especially are expected to take some time to get off the ground, given the challenge of practicalities such as the language barrier and the fact that the Japanese public are likely to be largely unfamiliar with the islands' reputation.

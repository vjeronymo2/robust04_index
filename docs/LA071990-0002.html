			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> More from those friendly East-West skies:  </P> <P> Air L.A., a local commuter airline, received a job application the other day  from Aleksandr Alekseyevich Kaminin of Moscow.  </P> <P> Kaminin, 39, said he's a qualified airline pilot and added that "my health is  good absolutely."  </P> <P> "I guess the world is changing," said Air L.A. Vice President Bill Wolf, noting  that Kaminin was his first Soviet job applicant.  </P> <P> Wolf said that he "certainly seems qualified -- but I can't pay his way here  for an interview."  </P> <P> Kaminin attached a postscript to his letter:  </P> <P> "Please use telex for communication since our post-office is not reliable."  </P> <P> The world may be changing, but lawyers don't seem to be getting any more  popular.  </P> <P> Now some Florida attorneys and judges are griping about so-called "S.O.B.  litigators" who display the same hard-ball tactics used by characters in the TV  show "L.A. Law."  </P> <P> Robert E. Beach, a federal judge, said the nastiest lawyers seem to come out of  the courthouse woodwork "the morning after 'L.A. Law."'  </P> <P> Clarence Booth has a different complaint about his lawyer. He can't find him.  </P> <P> Booth, a computer software designer, hired an attorney to handle his  back-injury claim before moving from L.A. to Boston. He said he has since  telephoned his lawyer more than 15 times without getting a reply.  </P> <P> Booth complained to the L.A. County Bar Assn. and was told that someone would  get back to him in about six weeks.  </P> <P> "When I asked why I'd have to wait so long," Booth said, "I was told that it's  because there are so many other complaints against lawyers."  </P> <P> You may recall a recent Times article on the LAPD's Immediate Booking and  Release Systems (IBARS), a program whereby officers book traffic violators at  the scene. It's interesting to note that the mobile unit isn't a new concept,  as the accompanying photo shows. Inglewood used one for several months in 1926.  It was probably such a good idea that it was discontinued.  </P> <P> Some personnel at St. Mary Medical Center will wear eyeglasses that impair  their vision today. Others will attempt to purchase items from a vending  machine while wearing gardening gloves. And others will be asked to order food  in a cafeteria line while sitting in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> It's all part of the Long Beach hospital's "Senior for a Day" program. Its  purpose is "to point out some of the difficulties older adults face," said Dr.  Timm Holt, a geriatrician. "It's important that we recognize and be sensitive  to their special needs."  </P> <P> Warren Meyer calls himself the "Junk-Mail King." He says he wants to give  something back to the community. So, his L.A.-based Meyer &amp; Son Mailhouse  is offering to handle any charity's bulk-mail chores for free during the month  of August. "He's giving the only way he knows how," explained publicist Mike  Venema. "By junk mail."  </P> <P> Walter Fluent forwarded a for-sale ad (see photo) from a local paper for a  Glendale house whose accoutrements include "lust" gardens.  </P> <P> In Glendale?  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Philippe's, the downtown cafe, has refused to serve ketchup since going into  business 82 years ago. Management still maintains that one simply shouldn't  spread the red stuff on French dip sandwiches.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marcela Gutierrez from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello Macias in  his first news conference said the events in Chiapas State have  adversely affected Mexico's image abroad. Mexico was seen as a  stable country where social stability prevailed, he said. Tello  Macrias also said Mexico has not taken into consideration the  possibility of requesting aid from the United States or any  other government. Tello Macias said Peace Commissioner Manuel  Camacho Solis is the only voice to explain what is being done,  how it is being achieved, and what is expected of the  reconciliation process. Let us listen to him:    [Begin Tello Macias recording] It would be advisable to  avoid  the proliferation of people playing the leading role in this  situation. I believe it would be much better for the national  and international public if there is only one voice. [end  recording]    Manuel Tello described as serious the possibility that other  governments are supporting the armed movement in Chiapas because  they would be hurting the country's sovereignty. He said that  even though there is no evidence, the Mexican Government does  not rule out the possibility that non-Mexicans are participating  in actions with the armed group. The Mexican foreign minister,  who until a few days ago was Mexico's representative at the  United Nations, said the Chiapas conflict adversely affects  various sectors of the population but said it is no reason to  paralyze the country.</p>

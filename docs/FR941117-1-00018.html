			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to meeting the PRTF requirements specified in these proposed regulations, as determined by the survey process, a State could also require Joint Commission accreditation or accreditation by any other accrediting organization determined appropriate by the State if it wishes to. The regulations at 42 CFR 431.51(c)(2) allow States to establish reasonable standards relating to qualifications of providers. We emphasize that accreditation by an organization would not, however, be considered a substitute for meeting the regulatory requirements in the proposed new subpart F of part 483. Reliance on varied and changing accreditation requirements in the past has led to widespread confusion about the requirements providers must meet as Medicaid participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to modify the certification requirements in &sect;441.152, Certification of need for services, by adding a requirement that the team or organization responsible for certifying the need for care must complete a comprehensive assessment as specified in &sect;441.45(a) prior to determining whether inpatient care is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we would require that the certification include the documented clinical evidence that serves as the basis for the certification. We wish to make it clear that certification of the need for inpatient care is not to be made unless inpatient care is medically necessary for treatment of the child or adolescent, as required by the statute. Section 1905(h)(1)(B) of the Act requires that ``physicians and other personnel qualified to make determinations with respect to mental health conditions and the treatment thereof'' certify the need for care which they have determined to be ``necessary on an inpatient basis and can reasonably be expected to improve the condition, by reason of which such services are necessary, to the extent that eventually such inpatient services will no longer be necessary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, we propose to delete the requirement in existing &sect;441.152(a)(1) that the certification include a statement that the ambulatory care resources available in the community do not meet the treatment needs of the recipient. This ``availability of ambulatory care'' requirement was designed to supplement the certification of the medical necessity for inpatient care. However, we are concerned that this requirement may have been misinterpreted as forming a basis for certifying that inpatient care was needed when, in fact, it was not clinically required. Inpatient care may have been incorrectly certified to be necessary only because the community services that would have been sufficient and preferable for that individual were not available in his or her community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the above circumstances, the current reference to ambulatory services may have contributed to the inappropriately high incidence of unnecessary inpatient care. HCFA believes that if the need for inpatient care is certified on the basis that ambulatory care is unavailable, this action would undermine an important impetus to developing needed community services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed certification statement would have to indicate which category of inpatient services are needed, i.e., acute psychiatric services or PRTF services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State Medicaid agency needs to ensure that the teams that develop the individual comprehensive services plans and assess the need for inpatient care are prepared to confer informally on a timely basis so that decisions concerning possible inpatient admissions can be made in times of crisis. Special procedures would be established for emergency admissions under the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit to psychiatric hospitals or inpatient units of general hospitals, as specified in &sect;441.152(c). Continued coordination and case management are vital in assuring that needed educational/vocational services are available in the community since these services are often critical in forestalling the need for repeated inpatient mental health treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

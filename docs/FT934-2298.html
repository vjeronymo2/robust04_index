			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: US busy having rapid second thoughts The Clinton administration was yesterday reassessing, with growing concern, its policies towards Russia. Officials travelling with Vice President Al Gore, who arrived in Moscow yesterday, conceded that the successes of the nationalist and Communist parties and the worse-than-expected performance of the reformist groups raised serious doubts about whether President Boris Yeltsin could achieve a working relationship with the new parliament. In Washington, the State Department spokesman for the first time directly attacked Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist leader, for holding views which were 'anathema to our principles of democracy, human rights and the democratic process, economic reform and relations amiong sovereign states'. On Monday, both President Bill Clinton and Mr Gore had taken consolation in the fact that the new Russian constitution, enhancing presidential authority, had been approved at the polls. Mr Clinton said Russian democracy had a new foundation and he was not particularly surprised at the rise of the nationalist groups given the recent suffering of the Russian people. Mr Gore, en route from Kazakhstan, even expressed the hope that if the reformers could bury their differences and assemble even a narrow parliamentary majority, then Russia could still be on course to a market economy. But the latest election returns have dampened even this guarded optimism. Mr Gore himself was reduced to comparing what might happen in the Russian parliament with the US Congress, where floating and narrow majorities on specific issues had become the order of the day. Other officials travelling with him were less philosophical. One was quoted as saying that the results were 'very bad' and 'a dramatic change'. Another noted that US policies were geared as much towards promoting economic reform as they were to supporting Mr Yeltsin. 'If one part of the government is against reform, we could not support it,' he said. Washington post-mortems were conspicuous for criticism of Mr Yeltsin for misjudging the electoral climate and deciding to stay above the fray. He was, it was freely said, the only populist counterweight to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and his refusal to campaign actively for Russia's Choice, his preferred party, had given the nationalist leader an opportunity to capitalise on popular discontent. The unspoken hope was that Mr Yeltsin would not take up the option of facing Mr Zhirinovsky in a presidential election next year but seek to soldier on until 1996, by which time economic reforms might be producing dividends. The State Department spokesman implied there was very little practical alternative to the US continuing to deal principally with the executive branch in Moscow. US contact with other power centres, specifically the nationalists and the Communists, has been minimal. Foreign policy concerns were given an airing yesterday when Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, met Mr Andrej Olechowski, the Polish foreign minister, who has been outspoken in demanding a closer relationship between eastern European countries and Nato, up to the point of eventual membership.</p>

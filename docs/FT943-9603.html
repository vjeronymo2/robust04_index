			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK visible trade deficit widens to more than Pounds 1bn A big jump in imports of precious stones pushed the UK further into the red in May, with the visible trade deficit widening to Pounds 1.03bn from Pounds 770m in April. However, the Central Statistical Office estimates that the trend is for a narrowing visible deficit, with exports rising faster than imports. If oil and erratic items, such as precious stones, are excluded, the trade deficit increased only slightly from Pounds 1.44bn in April to Pounds 1.5bn in May. The May deficit was in line with City expectations. 'Many commentators warned that as we came out of the recession the trade figures would not be particularly good, but in fact the figures show a continuing upward trend,' said Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister. But Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'These trade figures are disappointing news for the economy. They are yet more evidence of how weak and sickly the recovery really is.' Figures for Britain's worldwide trade are released around three months in arrears, thanks to the European Union's single market. Information on trade among EU countries takes longer to collect than figures for trade outside the Union. Britain's trade with its EU partners is growing strongly. In the three months to May, export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, were 6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, while imports were up 4.5 per cent. However, the UK's deficit with EU countries widened slightly in May, to Pounds 377m in May, from Pounds 304m in April. Of UK imports from the EU, half of the growth came from Germany, while growth in exports was concentrated on Ireland, Italy and Spain. Outside the EU, there was a marked increase in imports from other OECD countries, a category dominated by Japan. The UK is continuing to benefit from a rise in North Sea oil production, which has boosted oil exports. The UK had a trade surplus in oil of Pounds 1.13bn in the three months to May, the highest three-monthly total since 1987. The CSO said its estimate of the trend showed export values were rising at 1 per cent a month and imports at 0.5 per cent per month. In volume terms, the improvement is less marked. Excluding oil and erratics, export volumes are rising by just over 0.5 per cent a month, while imports are increasing by just under 0.5 per cent per month.

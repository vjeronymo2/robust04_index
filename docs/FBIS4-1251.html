			<p>BFN     [Text] The executive committee of the Uma People's  Democratic Movement, UPDM, has officially announced the  dissolution of the organization effective 18 April. The UPDM's  executive committee decided to dissolve the organization at its  meeting held in Awasa town. The executive committee made the  dissolution of the organization known in a letter addressed to  the ETHIOPIAN NEWS AGENCY. The movement also noted that the  movement's official documents, along with its seal and insignia,  would be illegal as of that date.    The movement was formed to unite and organize the various  nationalities in southern Omo Region and struggle for a common  cause. But, since the various nations and nationalities have  organized themselves, the movement unanimously resolved to  restructure the movement's multinational structure to suit  present political trends and to address the basic issues of the  various nationalities.</p>

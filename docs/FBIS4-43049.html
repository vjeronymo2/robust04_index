			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed by "uhl": "Waigel: The Budget Will Be </F> Consolidated Further"]    [Text] Bonn -- The finance ministers of the laender  governed by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] have  described the projected budget presented by Finance Minister  Theo Waigel, Christian Social Union [CSU], for the years 1995-98  as "unrealistic." What they have criticized above all is that  the constitutionally necessary tax-free status of minimum  incomes has not been considered and the fact that the Nuremberg  Federal Office of Labor's budget is too low.    Waigel stressed that the government will firmly adhere to  consolidating the budget over the next few years. The overall  minimum expenditure that has been agreed for 1994 will be  remain. Despite increasing signs of economic recovery, there is  no basis for relaxing fiscal policy. CSU politicians have once  again rejected an increase in taxes and dues. Johann Eekhoff,  state secretary in the federal Economic Ministry, has reported  that one can expect a increase in Germany's real economic growth  of between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent. An increase of about 3  percent should be possible in the years 1995 to 1998.</p>

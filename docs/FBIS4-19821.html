			<p>BFN     [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- The Duesseldorf police  president has banned a "demonstration with subsequent children's  festival" that was planned by Kurds in the North  Rhine-Westphalian capital for Saturday [23 April]. To justify  this ban, it was said on Thursday that this event could be  organized by the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). This,  however, would be a direct danger to "public order and  security." A large number of policemen will, if necessary,  enforce the ban "consistently," it was said. Participants who  travel to Duesseldorf from outside are to be "caught" when  entering the city.</p>

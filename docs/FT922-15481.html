			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Wellcome names lead managers for share sale WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, has appointed lead managers for its planned international sale of shares in Wellcome, the drugs group. The trust is aiming to reduce its stake from 73.6 per cent to under 50 per cent and possibly as low as 25 per cent. The sale is expected in July, although timing will depend on market conditions. At yesterday's closing share price of Pounds 10.49, up 27p, the sale could raise Pounds 4.4bn. That would make it the largest private-sector sale in the UK. As such, it carries a lot of prestige and may prove to be a highly profitable sale for the lead managers. Although all the managers appointed are leading houses, there will be disappointment among those that have not been selected. Salomon Brothers, for example, was understood to have hoped to manage a portion of the US tranche. However, Salomon was apparently ruled out because its analysts had not written research on Wellcome in the US and under US rules could not start doing so when an offer was under way. The trust must gain the consent of the High Court to cut its stake below 50 per cent. A hearing is expected in the second half of April. The share sale is to be run along the lines of the BT sale last autumn when a substantial stake in an already quoted company was sold. In that sale, large investors were asked to put in bids for shares in order to assess demand and set a price. The final structure of the sale has yet to be determined. The proportions allocated to different markets will depend on local demand, but the same price will prevail in all markets. Wellcome was involved in the appointment of the lead managers and said yesterday that it gave full support. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, had already been appointed as global co-ordinator for the sale while Baring Brothers advises the company. The regional syndicates' lead managers are Cazenove and S G Warburg Securities in the UK; Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch in the US; Nikko Securities and Nomura Securities in Japan; Swiss Bank Corporation in Switzerland; Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez in France; Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank in Germany and Jardine Fleming for the Pacific Rim. Robert Fleming will cover the rest of the world including European countries not covered individually, Canada and the Middle East.</p>

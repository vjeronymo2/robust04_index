			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Hague, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Macedonian Foreign  Minister Stevo Crvenkovski stressed here Tuesday [22 February]  that his country was prepared to hold negotiations with Greece  on all aspects of embargo-tainted bilateral relations.    The offer, repeating a similar one made Monday, came hours  after the European Commission sent a letter to Athens demanding  an explanation for the controversial trade blockade it imposed  last week against the Former Yugoslav Republic. Crvenkoski said  Skopje had never called for an end to negotiations with Athens  and was "ready to continue them at any time."    Crvenkoski, who is on a two-day official visit to the  Netherlands, said his country was ready to talk over "all  aspects of bilateral relations" to try to normalise links.  "Nothing can be ruled out," he added.    The EC, currently headed by Greece in the revolving  six-month  presidency, is using a mixture of threats and offers of  mediation to get Athens to abandon its hard-line policy, which  poses an unprecedented problem for the 12-country union.    Tuesday's letter started a procedure which could end with  the  executive Commission taking Athens to the European Court of  Justice.    The letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou,  signed  by Commission President Jacques Delors, expressed "serious  concern about the legality of the measures taken by the Greek  Government" and asked it to indicate what measures it would take  to resolve the situation.    Athens last week blocked all trade to Macedonia [the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] through the  northeastern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the  country's imports including oil, and subsequently tightened the  blockade to include frontier posts.    Greece justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual  provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and claims  that Macedonia has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek  province of the same name.    Most of Greece's European Community partners recognised  Macedonia before Greece took over the EC presidency in January.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BET settles pay-off for director at Pounds 450,000 Mr Bob Mackenzie, who on Friday left his post as finance director of BET, is to receive a pay-off of about Pounds 450,000, according to sources in the business services group. The settlement, which is substantially higher than earlier reports, could anger institutional investors who are beginning to take a tough stance on large pay-outs to directors. Insiders say the size of the pay-off was due mainly to the three-year rolling service contract which Mr Mackenzie signed in November 1991. It guaranteed him three years' notice from BET. Mr Mackenzie's basic annual pay was increased to Pounds 222,000 this year, theoretically entitling him to a Pounds 666,000 pay-off. However, he appears to have settled for a package equivalent to two years' basic salary. BET says it will disclose the exact amount in next year's annual report. The development follows BET's decision to appoint Mr Keith Payne, who joined the main board last year as director of strategic planning, to the post of director of finance, planning and development. Mr Mackenzie said on Friday that his resignation was 'mutually agreed' with BET. He wanted 'to explore other opportunities' but would be staying on as a consultant to BET until December. Last month Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive, in an attempt to reduce pay-outs to directors, announced a policy of voting against the re-election of directors with rolling contracts longer than two years. Two BET directors have three-year rolling service contracts - Mr John Clark, chief executive, and Mr John Allan, marketing director, who earns a basic salary of Pounds 178,500. Mr Payne has a two-year rolling contract and basic salary of Pounds 184,000. Mr Clark's basic salary is Pounds 396,000. He also has the potential to earn a bonus of up to Pounds 237,600 through a management incentive plan.</p>

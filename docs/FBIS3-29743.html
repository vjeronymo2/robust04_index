The government,  which sees improvement in the current procedures for government  procurement as the centerpiece of the package of new measures to  open the Japanese market, plans to take steps in 1994 to improve  the procedures. The government also has begun to study ways to  set up a grievance body to be mandated to handle complaints  about government procurement by the end of March. Prime Minister  Hosokawa plans to issue a statement announcing that his  government will carry through the policy of "indiscriminate  procurement" of domestic and foreign goods.    The package of new measures to open the Japanese market is  to  include specific measures in four points to improve the current  procedures for government procurement, promote deregulation,  increase imports and domestic investment, and adopt a  competitive policy.    The government procurement action program implementation  committee, which is made of administrative vice ministers from  government ministries and agencies, is now at work to map out an  action program to 1) strictly enforce the new open competitive  tender system and expand the line of business accessible to the  grievance body. With the United States increasingly taking a  hard-line posture toward Japan, the government has decided to  map out the action program earlier than scheduled. Regarding the  government procurement of medical equipment and  telecommunications gear whcih has been under discussion at the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the government plans to  improve the current procedures for their procurement as Japanese  negotiators have promised at the talks. The government will  procure goods worth more than 100,000 SDR (the IMF's special  drawing rights, approximately 15 million yen) through bidding  and to adopt a "comprehensive appraisal formula" under which  consideration is given not only to prices, but to function for a  final choice of successful tenders.    As for the insurance sector, on which negotiations have  broken down at the economic framework talks, the government  plans to announce plans to reform the current insurance system.  On the automobile and auto parts sector, the government intends  to promote industrial cooperation between Japanese automakers  and American auto parts makers after choosing specific items of  auto parts for such industrial cooperation. The government also  plans to improve the current certification and standard for  automobile imports.</p>

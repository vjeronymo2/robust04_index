			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-ENTREPRENEUR PARLAYS EXPERTISE ON ASIAN BUSINESS INTO A TV SERIES;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: YUE-SAI KAN SAYS PATIENCE AND KNOWING THE CUSTOMS ARE CRITICAL. SHE  LEARNED THOSE LESSONS FIRSTHAND BEFORE BECOMING A BROADCASTER.  </P> <P> With viewership as large as 400 million, you might think American broadcaster  Yue-Sai Kan would be content with the size of her television audience.  </P> <P> However, that audience lives in mainland China, and although Kan appreciates  the viewer support, she also has been thinking about an audience closer to  home. Kan is happy about the popularity of her commercially sponsored series on  the Chinese government network, a broadcast monopoly that had not previously  allowed ads. But she has long wanted a chance to make a splash on American  network television.  </P> <P> That opportunity has come. Kan is producer and on-camera host of "Doing  Business in Asia," a four-part series airing this fall on America's Public  Broadcasting Service. The woman who brought commercial-sponsored television to  China is beginning to bring Asian capitalism to non-commercial television in  the United States.  </P> <P> The series is designed to help American business people succeed in four Asian  markets: Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Out of it comes a message  that stems from Kan's experience in Asia: take time to learn more about local  customs and potential contacts and customers before pursuing a deal.  </P> <P> Each half-hour program discusses the etiquette and social customs particular to  each of the Asian locations. The weekly segments explore the historical factors  affecting business practices, the cultural psychology involved in business  conduct and the language problems. Beginning this week, KCET-TV will broadcast  the series locally at 2:30 p.m. Saturdays.  </P> <P> Shot on location, each program presents case studies of Western companies and  entrepreneurs who are succeeding in Japan, South Korea and the capitalist  enclaves of Taiwan and Hong Kong. Subjects range from corporate giants such as  Estee Lauder, Citibank, Coca-Cola and International Business Machines to small  providers of services to American importers with Asian operations.  </P> <P> The series expands Kan's presence. Her company, the New York-based Yue-Sai Kan  Inc., has published guidebooks and textbooks and produced television specials  related to China for Western audiences. Kan is now offering instructional books  and videotapes of her "Doing Business in Asia" series to corporations.  </P> <P> Kan, ebullient in manner and speech, said she has tried to bring to the series  insight from her years in trade and television production. For example, it's  important to develop strong relationships with potential customers in Asia, she  said.  </P> <P> "Maintaining a personal touch on a face-to-face level is very important because  (Asians) need to feel that they can trust you," Kan said. "The more you get to  know someone, the better the business prospects."  </P> <P> Kan's business contacts in Asia and her reputation as a producer of documentary  series were selling points when she approached Seattle public television  station KCTS-TV about co-producing the programs, said Jessica McCann, a  spokeswoman for the station. KCTS, a leading producer of programs on Asian  life, wanted an opportunity to present Kan to a wider American audience, McCann  said.  </P> <P> "It was an ideal offer because Yue-Sai is an Asian expert, and she's done so  many programs in the past," McCann said. "She's also dynamic, and that's  important because it's hard to keep this kind of series entertaining and  intelligent simultaneously. She brings a freshness to the subject of doing  business in Asia."  </P> <P> Kan's route to business and the West was circuitous. Born in Guilin, China, in  1948, she was raised in Hong Kong after her parents fled the mainland during  the Communist revolution. She later moved to the United States -- first to  study music in Hawaii, then to New York in 1971.  </P> <P> Kan and her sister Vickie took the entrepreneurial plunge in 1976, launching an  import-export company in New York. They dealt consumer products like typewriter  ribbons, clothing, pillowcases and hardware to customers in Asia. By  cultivating contacts, Kan and her sister quickly turned their fledgling firm  into a multimillion-dollar business.  </P> <P> While the business grew, so did Kan's interest in television. Her involvement  began when she accepted a position as television news anchor on a Manhattan  cable program in 1972.  </P> <P> Gambling that she could be more successful in television, she sold her interest  in the trading company in 1980 and invested $500,000 in a television production  company. The company's "Looking East," a 1981 series on Asian culture, is now  in syndication.  </P> <P> Kan's big break came in 1984, shortly after the Public Broadcasting System  agreed to broadcast two hours of live satellite feed from Beijing of events  commemorating the 35th anniversary of China's revolution. PBS discovered just  two days before the broadcast that the satellite relay would include no English  translations. PBS searched for someone who could translate and explain the  nuances of Chinese culture. They found Kan.  </P> <P> Chinese government officials were so impressed with the broadcast that they  awarded Kan a contract for a series on Western life. The series, "One World,"  was the first program produced by a foreigner for China's government-run  network. The programs and commercial messages from sponsors like Proctor &amp;  Gamble, General Foods and Gillette have been broadcast in uncensored form since  1987.  </P> <P> As a result of "One World," Kan collected enough Chinese government guanxi --  "connections" -- to secure approval for a number of projects. Recently, for  example, she produced a syndicated special called "Journey Through a Changing  China." Kan's ABC-TV network special, "China: Walls and Bridges," won an Emmy  last year.  </P> <P> "From my television production, I learn that you need to get in touch with  high-level people (in Asia) to get things done," Kan said. "It's important to  find someone reputable to introduce you, because this person becomes your  guarantor."  </P> <P> Building trust takes time in Japan and South Korea, Kan said, adding: "If you  expect to . . . do business on your first trip, don't go to Japan or Korea --  because it just won't work."  </P> <P> In fact, patience is one of the five keys to success in Japan -- keys that Kan  dubs the "five Ps." The kind of product exposure she calls "presence" is a  second. Strategy or "preparation" is a third. Quality of the "product" is the  fourth and observing "protocol" the fifth, Kan observes in one series segment.  </P> <P> Kan has produced a separate program on each of the four Asian markets because  protocol and business cultures vary. For example, deals can be consummated  relatively quickly in Taiwan because the overwhelming number of businesses are  small and entrepreneurial. However, Japan is dominated by big firms that  require managers at various levels to sign off on a deal, she said.  </P> <P> "You have to be sensitive to local customs and 'do as the Romans do,' " Kan  said. "For expansion into Asia and (financial) globalization, you need  localization. You must localize your thinking, localize your product and  localize your strategy."  </P></p>

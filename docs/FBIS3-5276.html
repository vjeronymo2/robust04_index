Australia plans to  be a Security Council member in the future. During my trip, we  assessed the tasks before the United Nations in the coming  period and the viewpoint of the UN Security Council regarding  the developments taking place around Turkey. The issues of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nagorno-Karabakh, the developments in the  Middle East, and the embargo on Iraq are issues that closely  concern Turkey and that are on the agenda of the United Nations.  We held a very close exchange of views on these topics. [end  recording]</p>

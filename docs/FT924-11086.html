			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Average pay advantage in public sector revealed AVERAGE weekly pay for full-time workers in the public sector has been higher than the average in the private sector for every year since 1973, excluding the years 1988 to 1991, according to previously unpublished figures from the Department of Employment. The figures also reveal that average pay in the public sector remains at a low point, relative to the private-sector average, compared with much of the 1970s and 1980s. Both sides in the current debate about a public-sector pay freeze will draw some comfort from the figures. The government has been basing its case for a pay freeze, or squeeze, on the fact that public-sector pay has been rising much faster than that in the private sector in the past two years. It also points to the findings of its New Earnings Survey - published last month - that from April last year to April this year average pay in the public sector once again overtook that in the private sector. Union officials in the public sector, however, will point to a less favourable relative position. In 1976, for example, average pay in the public sector was 113.7 per cent of average pay in the private sector and in 1981 it was 110.4 per cent. It fell to a low of 96.5 per cent in 1990 and rose in 1991-92 to 101.5 per cent. Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, the independent research body, said the swings in average pay were largely due to political pledges made to win the votes of public-sector workers at general elections. The highpoint of 1976 was reached following pay-review pledges for the public sector made by the incoming Labour government in 1974. Similarly, in 1981 the first Thatcher government had just implemented the pay rises recommended by the Clegg Commission. Some pay analysts believe that it is not illuminating to look at average pay in the two sectors and point out that average pay for male workers in both blue-collar and white-collar jobs is higher in the private sector. The reason for the higher overall average in the public sector is the higher proportion of white-collar jobs , generally better paid than blue-collar jobs, and the much higher pay for women in the public sector. Pay analysts also point to the fact that averages can be misleading at both ends of the spectrum. Lower-paid workers tend to do well in the public sector while higher-paid workers do much less well in comparison with the private sector. Nonetheless Mr Trinder highlighted the much bigger average rises in pay in the public sector in the last two years compared with the private sector. He also stressed that every increase of 1 per cent in the public sector's Pounds 70bn pay bill adds Pounds 750m to the total. 'A 1 per cent increase in pay is equivalent to about 60,000 jobs,' he said. 'If the government can present that trade-off effectively then it may be able to sell a squeeze on public-sector pay.' The first real test of the government's resolve on public-sector pay will come early next month when the pay formula for firefighters - which since 1978 has guaranteed them a pay rise in line with the upper quartile of male manual workers - is due to be implemented.</p>

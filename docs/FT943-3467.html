			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Regulators criticised over competition role Utility regulators concentrate too much on promoting competition and not enough on the strategic development of the industries they regulate, a think-tank close to the Labour party said yesterday. The report from the Institute for Public Policy Research, says regulation should aim to raise the international competitiveness of UK utilities and their suppliers. The government should set industrial policy objectives for each sector, which the regulators should implement. At present they are inventing industrial policies for the utilities they regulate, it says. The report calls for individual industry regulators to be replaced by four regulatory commissions covering energy, communications, transport and water. The commissions should include representatives of stakeholders in the industries such as customers, suppliers and employees. They should operate much more openly, with accountability to parliament through a new select committee. Mr David Souter, head of research at the NCU telecommunications union and one of the authors of the report, said yesterday that the promotion of competition by regulators was a form of 'industrial policy by default'. He called for an 'industrial policy by design' for utilities that affected the quality of life of every citizen and provided the infrastructure on which businesses depended. He said: 'Competition won't deliver important public policy objectives such as energy-efficiency and regional fairness.' A less adversarial relationship was needed between regulators and the utilities. Professor Michael Waterson of Warwick University, the other author, said regulation by price-caps was reaching the end of its usefulness. It allowed some utilities to pass on certain costs to the consumer, and was inappropriate where companies were diversifying. Regulating Our Utilities. IPPR, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA.

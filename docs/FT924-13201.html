			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: First Chicago plunges into red FIRST Chicago suffered a loss of Dollars 365.1m, or Dollars 4.65 a share, in the third quarter, after taking a special charge of Dollars 625m to cover loan losses and the restructuring of its commercial property portfolio. The bank said in September it would take the charge as part of a decision to accelerate the disposal of Dollars 2bn in commercial real estate exposure. However, analysts said an unexpected additional loan-loss provision of Dollars 145m lifted the Chicago-based bank's third-quarter loss above most Wall Street projections. In the third quarter of 1991, First Chicago had earnings of Dollars 24.6m, or 19 cents per share. For the first nine months of this year, the loss was Dollars 15.9m, or 65 cents per share, compared with a profit of Dollars 131.4m or Dollars 1.55 per share. An accounting change added 10 cents per share to third-quarter earnings, and Dollars 3.07 per share to year-to-date results. First Chicago's bond and foreign exchange trading sectors and its credit card division performed well during the quarter. Trading profits were Dollars 103.3m, against Dollars 65.7m last year, and credit card revenues rose to Dollars 138.6m, from Dollars 108m. However, operating costs continued to escalate, rising to Dollars 473.8m in the quarter, from Dollars 405.3m a year ago. Continental Bank reported third-quarter income of Dollars 53m, or 82 cents, against a loss of Dollars 185m, or Dollars 3.61, a year ago. The 1991 loss included a Dollars 204m provision for credit losses and charges for corporate restructuring. The Chicago-based bank holding company reported earnings of Dollars 161m, or Dollars 2.50, against a loss of Dollars 123m, or Dollars 2.79 a share, for the first nine months of 1991. Continental said third-quarter operating expenses were down 9 per cent from a year ago, and revenues from loan syndications, structured finance, trading activities and equity investments increased.</p>

"However, there has been a worrying mounting of  the number of thefts from the commercial companies (from 456 in  January 1993 to 1015 in January 1994, especially because of the  companies' failure to secure their own guard and protection), as  well as with corruption, as 218 persons were accused of bribery  and 69 of peddling influence. In terms of social category, 51  offenders are public servants, 19 are company managers and  general managers, 17 bank functionaries and 20 private economic  agents."

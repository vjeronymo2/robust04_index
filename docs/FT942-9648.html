			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Appleby Westward Appleby Westward, the USM-traded grocery distributor, saw profits before tax drop from Pounds 1.28m to just Pounds 221,000 over the 12 months to February 28. The outcome took in some Pounds 205,000 of non-recurring costs and Pounds 371,000 in sub-contract commissions associated with the agreement last year with Watson &amp; Philip. Mr Roger Harvey, chairman, described conditions in the food industry as 'difficult and more competitive than ever with the change in Sunday trading removing some of the advantage our retailers had'. Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 71.7m over the year; directors said that sales in the current year, excluding the commercial vehicle repair division which was sold after the year-end, were showing a 21 per cent advance. Earnings per share dropped to 2.7p (15.7p). The recommended final of 5.8p keeps the year's total at 9p.</p>

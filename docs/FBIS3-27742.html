The paper continues:    "Public opinions in Asian countries and even in the United  States protest against the decision. Many people held that the  setting up of 'Radio Free Asia' in the form of Cold War is no  longer useful and suitable, especially when the economic  relations between the US and Asia are increasing".    The paper recalls that spokespersons for the Foreign  Ministries of Vietnam, China and Democratic People's Republic of  Korea and Myanmar [Burma] have expressed their indignation  against that move.    "Asia has emerged as a region of relative peace, stability,  cooperation and dynamic development, the common aspiration of  all nations in the region is to expand multilateral and  diversified cooperation in order to defend peace, security and  socio-economic development on the basis of mutual respect for  independence and sovereignty, without interference into each  other's affairs, and cooperation for equal benefit", the paper  notes.</p>

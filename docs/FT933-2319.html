			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Heitmann criticised by Free Democrats MR Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's candidate for federal president when the post is vacated next year, yesterday came under criticism from the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, for remarks he made about the Holocaust, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung daily, Mr Heitmann, justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony, said: 'The time has come - now that the post-war period is finally over after German unification - to put this event (the Nazi period) in its proper place.' He said the killing of 6m Jews by the Nazis was a unique event, but that Germany 'must not have a special role until the end of time'. The Christian Social Union, sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, still has to decide whether to back the CDU's candidate. But the controversy surrounding Mr Heitmann may persuade the Free Democrats to apply more pressure on Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, to stand, despite his reluctance.</p>

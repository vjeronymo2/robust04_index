			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOCK TRIBUNAL SEEKS TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON GUATEMALA ABUSES  </P> <P> It was a mock tribunal, a staged courtroom drama designed to bring justice to a  world that has none.  </P> <P> But the tears the witnesses shed were real, as was the litany of horrors  presented to the 150 people who gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to  listen to tales of torture, murder and kidnaping that have become part of daily  life in Guatemala.  </P> <P> There was Nineth de Garcia, telling of the day in 1984 her husband was kidnaped  by military police and dragged off to a secret prison. He was a trade union  activist the government accused of being a communist. He has not been seen  since.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Son Arrested  </P> <P> And there was Margarita Garcia, whose son, Raul, was arrested by military  police seven years ago while attending classes at a university. Like de  Garcia's husband, he has disappeared.  </P> <P> But recently, dozens of others victims have been found: shot, stabbed and  mutilated. The recent upsurge in violence against civilians prompted some of  Guatemala's leading human rights activists to travel to Los Angeles last week  to seek support for their efforts to end the bloodshed.  </P> <P> "We're here to raise the consciousness of the American people to the pain and  suffering being felt by the Guatemalan people," de Garcia said during a break  in the mock tribunal. "We've tried everything else, and nothing has worked."  </P> <P> De Garcia is president of Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo, a human rights group she  co-founded with four other women she met during the search for her husband. She  said the women kept running into each other at morgues, prisons, churches and  hospitals, so they decided to organize to streamline their efforts.  </P> <P> Today, the group has about 2,500 members, all of whom have had a relative  killed, tortured, imprisoned or "disappeared." The group was one of several  represented at the mock tribunal, one of a series of political and cultural  events sponsored by the Voices of Justice and Solidarity for Guatemala and the  Guatemala Information Center in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We demand a stop to the oppression and a return of our civil and human  rights," said Marvin Perez, one of several speakers who said they had been  kidnaped and beaten by the military police. Perez and others condemned  Guatemala's civilian president, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, for doing little to  halt the upsurge in violence and blasted the U.S. government for its "attitude  of indifference" toward the plight of Guatemalans.  </P> <P> "We've been harassed and threated for the past five years, ever since they took  my husband," said de Garcia. "But even though we are worried about what will  happen to us when we return home, we felt it was necessary to come here and let  people know what is happening."  </P></p>

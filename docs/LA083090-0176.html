			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> NO. 2 CITY OFFICIAL LOSES BID FOR TOP CINCINNATI POST  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager John F. Shirey recently lost a bid for the city  manager's job in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> A recruiter there said Shirey, the second-highest Long Beach city official, was  one of two finalists interviewed for the Cincinnati post earlier this month.  </P> <P> After two days of interviews, Gerald Newfarmer, former city manager of San  Jose, was selected.  </P> <P> "Close, but no cigar," said Shirey, 41.  </P> <P> Shirey said the job appealed to him because "it gave me the opportunity to run  a city rather than having the No. 2 job." He has been assistant city manager in  Long Beach for three years.  </P> <P> Recruiter Norman Roberts said that he had tried to lure Shirey away from Long  Beach several times before the Cincinnati opening but that Shirey was not  interested.  </P> <P> "I have an excellent job in Long Beach," Shirey said. "I'm not looking for  another job. But I'll keep my eyes open."  </P></p>

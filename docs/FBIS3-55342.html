			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Kozyrev by Ivan Pankov on </F> 10 January; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Pankov] What happened in Latvia?    [Kozyrev] In Latvia, judging by everything, there has  occurred a most flagrant provocation, perpetrated by armed  representatives of the land guard [okhrana kraya], that is, the  government forces. But today towards the end of the day we  received an official apology via the Embassy of Russia which  intervened in this situation and it is possible that it is a  question of a provocation also against the line of the Latvian  authorities themselves, the President.    And the factual aspect is very simple and crude. These armed  gangs surrounded and blockaded military facilities which they  claim constitute a threat to Latvia, but which in actual fact  involve a stadium, a swimming pool, and the residence of the  Russian ambassador in Riga, which of course cannot in any way  constitute a danger to anyone.    The two generals which were sent by the Russian command in  order to assess the situation on the scene were subjected to  insulting behavior, virtually arrested, taken somewhere into the  forest, subjected to threats, they were even handcuffed.    This is absolutely impermissible, intolerable behavior  towards representatives of the Russian Armed Forces which have  been placed on heightened combat alert. The embassy immediately  undertook measures to clear up the situation. And we must with  all resoluteness warn that Russia will take all necessary  measures to protect her citizens especially those in military or  diplomatic uniform, indeed simply any of her citizens, from such  attacks and once again I repeat, we expect, at a higher level, a  more extensive explanation, apology, and punishment of those  guilty for this incident.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Inflation on rise in Germany German inflation probably bounced back up to 3 per cent in August from 2.9 per cent last month, according to price data from two key west German states. In July, German inflation fell below 3 per cent for the first time in three years, but high coffee and oil prices meant that the trend to falling inflation was reversed this month. Yesterday, North Rhine-Westphalia reported that prices in the state were up 0.1 per cent in August for a year-on-year increase of 2.8 per cent. Prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.2 per cent for an annual 3.1 per cent increase. These two states, together with Bavaria and Hesse, form the basis from which the government produces provisional inflation data for all of west Germany each month. Analysts said the expected rise was not surprising and partly reflected seasonal factors. The rate was likely to remain around 3 per cent for the rest of the year before falling to around 2.5 per cent at the start of 1995. Dutch industrial production slipped 1 per cent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis from May, but was 3 per cent higher than 12 months earlier, the central statistics bureau reported. Adjusted industrial output for the first half rose 1.8 per cent from a year earlier. Switzerland's current account surplus fell to SFr4.7bn (Pounds 2.35bn) in the second quarter, down SFr1.7bn from the same period last year.</p>

On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council,  Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, expressed greetings to all  workers involved in the renovation.    The Potala Palace in Lhasa city, capital of Tibet Autonomous  Region, had not been renovated for 300 years.    In 1988, the Chinese government decided to set up a leading  group, headed by Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee, to take charge of the renovation  program.    The central government also allocated more than 50 million  yuan and large quantities of materials to the project.    Work began in October 1989. By now 86 projects in the  renovation program have been completed, and work on 17 is still  going on.    Hu said that the Potala Palace is the outstanding work of  Tibetan culture and one of the treasures in the culture of  Chinese nation.    He said that the palace is not only the symbol of Tibet, but  also marks the unity of the Tibetan people and the Han people.    He said that the palace renovation showed that the CPC and  the government respect the excellent cultural tradition of Tibet  and it also showed the party's policies toward nationalities and  religion.    He urged the people working on the renovation to make  greater  efforts to complete it. After the renovation is completed, all  departments concerned should strengthen the management of the  palace so as to promote the unity of nationalities and to  contribute to the development of Tibet.    Li Tieying, who is also a state councillor, said that the  renovation program is a rarely-seen project in the world.    He said that the renovation with modern science and  technology and Tibetan traditional techniques will certainly  produce important impact at home and abroad.    According to a renovation group leader, in the past five  years of renovation work, no ancient art or religious objects  were damaged or lost.    When the renovation of the palace is completed, the  government of the Tibet Autonomous Region is planning to hold  celebrations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources once again confirmed that there is no  emergency situation around the Komsomolets nuclear submarine  which drowned in the Norwegian Sea in 1989.    At the same time, the ministry considers it possible to  carry  out works on encasing of the front section where two torpedoes  with nuclear charges are located. Experts are particularly  concerned about the possible escape of radioactive plutonium  from these torpedoes. The torpedoes have been partially  destroyed as a result of the ship going under and an explosion  in the front section. The nuclear reactor was taken out of  operation before the sinking and any negayive effects on the  environment is ruled out.    This was said at a press conference in Moscow on Wednesday,  dedicated to Russian press reports about the allegedly critical  situation around the submarine.    First Deputy Minister Aleksey Poryadin, referring to the  conclusion of the state ecological investigation, noted that at  the depth of 1,700 meters, where the submarine is lying, fishing  is not being carried out, therefore "a radioactive and  ecological threat posed by the release of substances after  plutonium decay of the nuclear explosives" does not exist. At  the same time, experts of the ministry consider it necessary to  constantly check the ecological situation in the region around  Komsomolets before and after installment of localizing systems.    Poryadin pointed out that localization of the front section  will be carried out with the purpose of preventing the release  of radioactive substances, the probability of which, in his  opinion, is very low. He said that the cost of the works had  been estimated approximately, but it is too early to speak about  a concrete sum.    Poryadin said, referring to the London Convention on  prevention of water pollution from waste and other substances  (1972), that "force-majeur circumstances to which the death of  the submarine is related" exclude presenting claims to Russia  from other countries.    Poryadin said that in three weeks a Russia expedition on  board the Mstislav Keldysh ship will head for the place of the  Komsomolets accident in order to control the radiation and  ecological situation in the area.    According to the ministry, the expeditions in 1988,  1991-1993, did not find increased levels of plutonium in the  water or on the sea's bottom.</p>

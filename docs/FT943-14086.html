			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Berlusconi's long run of luck hit by dispute: Resignation of magistrates will embarrass Italy's PM In the shadow of Italy's participation in the World Cup final, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, has become involved in a dangerous confrontation between the executive and the judiciary. The disagreement centres on a decree that drastically reduces the scope of investigating magistrates to use preventive detention of those suspected in cases of corruption. The outcome could for the first time dent Mr Berlusconi's remarkable run of popularity since he took office two months ago. The institutional conflict also risks causing sharp divisions among Mr Berlusconi's allies in his right-wing coalition. At the same time it could side-track the government's attention from formulating economic policy with the budget plans promised next Thursday. The decree, signed into force late on Wednesday by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, permits some 2,000 people under preventive detention to leave prison. If it had existed 2 1/2 years ago, before the anti-corruption investigations, none of the more than 600 accused of various crimes would have entered prison. They would at best have been confined to house arrest. The restriction on the powers of arrest was however only one of the reasons behind Thursday's resignations of the anti-corruption team of Milan magistrates led by Mr Antonio Di Pietro. They claimed the decree was deliberately intended to curb their investigations - preventive detention being necessary to stop tampering with evidence and people fleeing from justice. While there is considerable public sympathy for the government's move to end what was seen as often arbitrary use of arrest, the government will not find it easy to justify its tactics. A decree with immediate effect, which then has to be cleared by parliament within 90 days, appeared an overhasty means of dealing with an issue that was not top of the agenda. Indeed, it could only be considered an immediate priority if the government feared the magistrates might be about to make more high-profile arrests affecting its supporters. This has been much rumoured in recent days, following the breaking of a corruption ring among the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, that allegedly condoned tax evasion on a huge scale. Mr Berlusconi also has much explaining about conflict of interest to do, because the Milan magistrates who have resigned were investigating the prime minister's Fininvest empire. The issue of arrest directly affected Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising arm, and a close colleague of Mr Berlusconi. He has challenged an arrest warrant in the courts. Already government ministers are suggesting the decree can be altered in parliament - especially that part saying crimes such as corruption against the state do not warrant preventive detention. But Mr Berlusconi is unlikely to alter the substance of the decree. He recognises that Mr Di Pietro is one of the most popular figures in Italy, as a result of his work unmasking corrupt politicians and businessmen. But he also has opinion polls which indicate the public is no longer so interested as before in the corruption issue; it was barely raised in the March general elections. The public reaction will be crucial, and the generally hostile response of the press yesterday was perhaps not an accurate measure of opinion. A compromise is possible, but if none is sought and the public comes behind Mr Di Pietro, the populist Northern League will be the first to break ranks within the government. Until now Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, has been looking for firm ground on which to challenge Mr Berlusconi and reduce his ever-growing authority. This could be just such a pretext. Meanwhile Mr Berlusconi, will not make a move until he sees how Italy fares in the World Cup. He is banking on Italy winning.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) on Tuesday [14 June]  underscored the importance of Japan beefing up its  "techno-infrastructure" in a guideline for research and  development of industrial and scientific technology.    The government should "drastically" expand budgetary  appropriations for reinforcing Japan's overall technological  foundation in line with the guideline, a MITI official told a  press conference. The official said the level of a country's  techno- infrastructure can be enhanced by improvements in  various factors, such as human resources, information, facility  construction, fund raising, protection of intellectual property  rights and the deregulation of research activity.    Japan's technological standards should be raised through  active research activity, not only by specialized organs like  MITI institutes but also by private-sector research entities,  the official said. The public sector should devote itself to  improving the general research environment for private organs  and universities, the official said.    The guideline cited nine major industrial and scientific  sectors as areas of priority study. Among them are new  materials, biotechnology, space technology, medical equipment,  clean energy development, new resources and information and  communications.</p>

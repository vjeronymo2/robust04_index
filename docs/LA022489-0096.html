			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEETENED DEAL APPROACHES $3 BILLION;  </P> <P> WEST POINT-PEPPERELL ACCEPTS FARLEY INC. OFFER  </P> <P> Farley Inc. won a four-month battle for West Point-Pepperell Inc. Thursday as  the textile giant accepted a sweetened buyout bid of nearly $3 billion by the  Chicago-based conglomerate.  </P> <P> Pepperell and Farley said in a joint announcement that Farley will pay $1.53  billion, or $58 per share, in cash for Pepperell's outstanding stock and  refinance Pepperell's debt.  </P> <P> Farley will contribute about $300 million in equity, with the remaining being  financed by high-yield bonds and bank loans, Chairman William Farley said.  </P> <P> He said the resulting company would be the world's largest textile and apparel  firm.  </P> <P> Farley, manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme boots, initially  offered $48 a share, or $1.4 billion, for Pepperell on Oct. 24, and later  raised the bid to $52 per share, or a total of $1.54 billion.  </P> <P> Pepperell's board turned down both offers as inadequate during an often bitter  struggle with Farley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Terms Called Fair  </P> <P> However, Thursday's announcement said Pepperell's directors "determined that  the terms of the offer and the merger are fair" to shareholders.  </P> <P> Pepperell stock closed Thursday at $57.25 a share, up $1.25 in New York Stock  Exchange trading.  </P> <P> At an Atlanta news conference, Farley said there would be no production line  layoffs. But he said Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier Jr. and President  Donald J. Keller will leave the company after the merger is completed, within  30 days.  </P> <P> Asked if he would need to sell parts of the company to pay off the debt, Farley  said: "I love all the company and I haven't made any decision on what part, if  any, I would sell."  </P> <P> But he later identified Saturday's, a high-fashion line produced by Pepperell  subsidiary Cluett-Peabody, as a likely candidate to be sold.  </P> <P> The companies said they agreed to cancel a special shareholders meeting set for  March 2.  </P> <P> The meeting had been called at Farley's request in a bid to unseat the  Pepperell directors and replace them with a board more sympathetic to the  conglomerate's bid.  </P> <P> Farley said it has received commitments from Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bankers  Trust Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. for financing necessary to  complete its tender offer for Pepperell stock.  </P> <P> Pepperell, founded in 1886, became the nation's largest publicly traded textile  company last year through the acquisition of most of J. P. Stevens &amp; Co. It  was left with about $1.1 billion in debt from that deal. Pepperell has 41,000  employees and 22,000 stockholders. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, the  company had revenue of $2.15 billion and earnings of $84.36 million.  </P></p>

The news analyst goes on:    As many Asian countries have recognized, the Radio "Free  Asia" which the United States is going to start broadcasting is  intended to spread the socalled "outlook on the value of  American democracy" and bourgeois ideology. National disputes  and confrontation have resulted in bloodletting and ruthlessly  destroyed the economic and social life now in the region and  countries which had been influenced by such radio waves in the  past.    Through the Radio "Free Asia" the United States is seeking  to  reproduce such a reality in the Asian region and thereby  disorganize and destroy the socialist and independent countries  in this region from within.    Even if it started broadcasting tricky programmes against  Asian countries, the United States will have nothing to gain  therefrom.    As expressed clearly and repeatedly, the Korean and other  Asian people will defend their national sovereignty with the  firm stand of masters being responsible for their own destinies,  and staunchly struggle against the Yankee-style culture and in  defence of their traditions, culture and way of life.    The United States must immediately stop the farce of  launching into the broadcasting of the Radio "Free Asia".</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Tories 'need killer facts' to stop electoral death: Backbench 'yobbos' urged to hit back at Blair - Warning given that small businesses feel let down 'Killer facts' are what the Conservative party needs if it is to win the next general election, according to a strategy paper produced by Mr John Maples, the party's deputy chairman and a former Treasury minister. The facts are soundbites, such as: 'Since 1980, the UK economy has grown faster than Germany and the gap is widening.' They need to be trumpeted 'ad nauseam' because, as the market research appendix to the paper shows, a core element of the Conservative party's support, those on average incomes, perceive the government as 'ineffectual and unable to deliver its promises'. Written on September 30 and based on extensive research among people who 'voted Conservative in April 1992 but now say they might or would not', the paper shows the large extent of the challenge faced by the party to reverse Labour's lead in the opinion polls and plots a possible communications strategy. It throws light on the usually obscured relationship between party machinery and government departments. As the introduction to the paper says: 'If the ideas set out are accepted by ministers then detailed programmes will need to be developed with relevant departments.' Because the paper was intended to be read only by Mr John Major and a restricted circle in Conservative Central Office and Downing Street, its language and tone are rather more frank and perhaps cynical than the normal ministerial soundbite. To give one example, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, would probably not wish to be caught saying: 'The best result for the next 12 months would be zero media coverage of the National Health Service.' However, that is Mr Maples's conclusion to a long analysis of what the party should do to reduce Labour's opinion poll lead over the Tories on which of the parties would manage the health service better. Nor would Mrs Bottomley opine publicly that 'we can never win on this issue', as does Mr Maples. His paper says Labour's lead on this issue is 55 per cent and that a realistic target would be to reduce this margin to 30 per cent by October 1995. The basis of the paper is a qualitative research programme - market research which attempts to give a more detailed account of how individuals think and feel than mainstream quantitative opinion polls. The target of the research was two groups of Conservative voters: those in the middle-income, white-collar 'BC1' category and those in the 'C2' top end of the blue-collar group. Both have been a vital element in the party's last three general election victories. The purpose was to 'explore in depth why their support had slipped'. Opinions were solicited from eight groups of eight people, with equal numbers of men and women in each, divided between BC1s and C2s. The discussions were held in Oldham, Birmingham, London and Brighton and participants fell into one of two age groups: 25 to 40-year-olds and 40 to 60-year-olds. There were also two pensioners' groups. There is a widespread conviction among senior Conservatives that the party must keep the votes of individuals in these categories if it is to win the next general election. At first glance, therefore, the results make grim reading for the party. Mr Maples provides points of the 'general picture' emerging from the interviews. As the views of Conservative voters, they are slightly surprising: 'There is a feeling of powerlessness and insecurity about jobs, housing, health service, business, family value, crime etc and no vision of where we are heading.' 'Although in the 1980s the Conservatives seemed to promise a classless society of opportunity, the reality is now that the rich are getting richer on the backs of the rest, who are getting poorer.' 'Privatisation has not been popular and small businessmen in particular feel 'let down'.' 'Very few people think we are out of recession.' 'The Conservatives have let voters down: they have been in government too long, are complacent and have lost a sense of direction. They fail to fulfil promises, are clumsy at implementing policy and 'shoot themselves in the foot'.' However, many of these individuals' other views - 'very rightwing views on crime and immigration, deep disapproval of 'scrounging' on social security . . . deep fear of 'loony lefties', distrust of politically-correct, liberal-minded 'do-gooders'' - make them 'natural Conservatives'. The market research identifies 'failure of communication' as at the heart of the disenchantment. 'What we are saying is at odds with their experience, which leads them to conclude that we are 'out of touch', 'lying', 'don't care', 'think they are stupid',' it says. That is why Mr Maples believes a detailed communications plan is important. The period between now and the election, which 'could be as little as 20 months away and no more than 30 months' is divided into four phases in the fledgling communications plan - up to the 1995 party conference; from then to the start of a short pre-election campaign; a third phase, the pre-election campaign, four to six months before polling day; and the election campaign. The 'phase one' proposal is to overtake or reduce the Labour party's opinion poll lead in four crucial policy areas for these average income supporters, as identified by the research. 'We should . . . by the 1995 conference . . . seek to re-establish polling leads on the economy and law and order while reducing our deficits on education and health.' The messages should be positive in this initial phase. In stage two, the party will 'need to scare the voters about Labour and the Liberals'. The process of getting the message across has several strands, ranging from party political use of the parliamentary timetable to a more ruthless approach to relationships with press and television. On the latter Mr Maples says: 'We should not just concentrate on political and specialist correspondents but on columnists, leader writers and editors.' 'We need to set and control the agenda as much as we can and be much less 'reactive'.' 'We need to feed our friends and potential friends in the press with good stories.' 'For television and radio, we should use good performers ruthlessly.' 'The ability to react rapidly to events and Labour allegations is vital. They are much better than us at this.' 'A programme of 'marking' and building relationships with proprietors, editors, correspondents etc needs planning and implementation.' A section on the style of a media campaign suggests Mr Maples may not have learned one lesson of the research, which is not to patronise these middle and lower income groups: 'While ABC1s can conceptualise, C2s and Ds often cannot. They can relate only to things they can see and feel. They absorb their information and often views from television and tabloids. We have to talk to them in a way they understand.' However effective any campaign to bring round the media may turn out to be, the party also needs to regain control of the political agenda. Mr Maples urges that the parliamentary timetable is managed far better so that popular measures, relevant debates and ministerial statements receive public attention, and are not crowded out by news of uncontrolled events. One technique for propagating good news is to identify a series of 'killer facts'. The paper says: 'We need to develop say five facts in each key area which are positive and which we repeat endlessly eg 'One million more patients treated annually since NHS reforms'.' A series of policy changes are suggested to defuse the main criticisms of disenchanted supporters. These include slowing the pace of NHS reform, postponing the second instalment of value added tax on fuel and reform of the system of taxing executive share options to deter some of the excesses of executive pay packages. Another important strand in the campaign is to solicit 'endorsements' from 'friends' such as the police and the Confederation of British Industry. The main objective, underlying all strands of the communications strategy, is to make sure that what the party says corresponds to supporters' real experiences. Mr Maples identifies the economy as an important area of weakness. He points out: 'While we trumpet the recovery, the voters do not think the recession has ended. They still fear unemployment, have no more 'money in their pocket' etc. What we are saying is completely at odds with their experience.' The reason for this mismatch is that, because of tax increases, real take-home pay is falling this year and 'will fall again in 1995 to 1996. We have to see this rise soon or we will have had four or even five years of recovery with no rise in living standards'. The problem of matching ministerial claims to reality is less acute in law and order. Mr Maples says: 'We cannot be tough enough for our audience (on law and order) but they do not know what we are doing and all the real evidence says to them that crime is worse.' One solution is to 'stop or at least criticise those responsible for light sentences, safari trips, prosecution of people 'who have a go' at criminals, early release from prison etc'. Reversing Labour's 39 per cent poll lead on education issues will be tougher. The market research survey showed that 'talk of competition, budgets, management etc triggers negative perceptions of treating education like a business'. However, it continues: 'It does not matter that much of the education establishment is hostile - they are rightly seen as part of the problem.' The gravest problem of all for the government is perception of NHS reforms: 'People perceive the reforms as clumsy and believe what doctors and nurses say about them, which is almost universally hostile.' Apart from a total media blackout of NHS coverage, the next best strategy is to identify a few 'killer facts' for 'endless repetition'. But these should be more than national statistics: 'Could we have a number per month (of patients treated) for a typical hospital, or even for particular local hospitals.' It would also help to dam the flow of bad news. 'We must think about what we can do to stop the staff being so critical to patients.' The paper devotes little attention to two traditional battleground areas - the unions and Europe. Of the unions, the paper says: 'This issue is low on people's priority lists.' The market research says: 'These (unions are no longer seen as a threat, indeed people feel that employees now have little or no protection against employers and need more.' Europe, too, is said to be 'very low on their list of concerns'. The ingredients for campaigning success are a united party and 'that we remain more Eurosceptic than Labour'. Apart from these individual issues, the paper urges a coherent strategy for dealing with the Labour party. The research shows that 'apart from the NHS, Blair is the only thing they really have going for them'. He says of the Labour party leader: 'If Blair turns out to be as good as he looks we have a problem.' The traditional method of attacking a Labour leader is redundant because the Conservatives 'cannot paint Blair as a left winger'. They should, however, be 'constantly throwing his past views at him and trying to create and exploit the huge gap between Blair and most of his party'. Mr Maples has a suggestion: 'Could we set some backbenchers on to this? Maybe a few yobbos of our own to try to knock him about a bit and another team to operate more subtly on the changes of mind and differences of view.' He says the government should introduce legislation likely to split Mr Blair from the rest of his party. 'A proposal on ID cards and/or further industrial relations legislation (eg to reballot on public service strikes) would force them to take a view. Either Blair will support our proposals and divide his party, or oppose us and show he does not really mean what he says about strikes and crime,' he says. Mr Maples sums up the campaign in a section headed 'listen'. He says that too often the party appears not to be listening to its supporters and is too didactic. Instead he recommends: 'Listening, explaining, being honest and open, inviting feedback and dialogue.'</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Scheme to finish Dockland properties A SCHEME to rescue bankrupt properties in London's Docklands has been announced following the news that the largest collapse, Canary Wharf, may come out of administrative receivership at the end of October, Stewart Dalby writes. Investment advisory group Matrix Securities is to try to capitalise on renewed interest by investors - prompted by a possible Tube extension and a proposed Pounds 1.1bn bank rescue package - with the launch of a Pounds 95m trust. The Matrix South Quay Trust plans to finish developing three buildings opposite Canary Wharf by using enterprise zone tax concessions - available for buildings started before the area's enterprise zone status ended last year.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metra and Securitas plan security system alliance A plan to create one of Europe's leading companies in locking and access control systems was yesterday unveiled by Metra, the Finnish industrial group, and Securitas of Sweden. Metra's Abloy Security division will merge with the Securitas Lock Group to form Assa-Abloy AB, a company with SKr3.5bn (Dollars 443m) in annual sales and 4,600 employees. The aim is to list the company on the Stockholm and Helsinki stock exchanges next spring. Metra said the merger would create a strong company, capable of expanding and competing in Europe, due to synergy benefits and access to capital. It will be Europe's biggest manufacturer of cylinder locks. The arrangement enables Metra to focus on diesel engines and bathroom ceramics, while allowing Securitas to concentrate on guard services and alarm systems. The Finnish company will initially hold 55 per cent of Assa-Abloy and will receive a cash payment out of the new company to compensate for the size difference between Abloy Security and Securitas Lock. Abloy had 1993 sales of SKr2.5bn and a SKr46m profit, compared with profits of SKr78m on sales of SKr1bn at Securitas Lock. When the merged company is listed, Metra's holding is expected to fall to 40 per cent, but it will remain the largest single owner. This is because Securitas intends to distribute its 45 per cent stake to shareholders in what is effectively a demerger. Securitas said its net debt would fall to nil from SKr400m giving it a strong financial base from which to expand. It holds more than 5 per cent of the European security market. Assa-Abloy will be based in Stockholm and Mr Carl-Henric Svanberg, first executive vice-president of Securitas, will be its first president and chief executive. The Nordic region will account for almost half of total sales, but the US will be the largest single market with 1993 pro-forma sales of SKr860m.</p>

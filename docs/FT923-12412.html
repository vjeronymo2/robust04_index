			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / World financial markets tumble: Gloomy economic news heightens fears of further rises in European interest rates GROWING FEARS of more European interest rate rises, after Thursday's discount rate increase in Germany, sent world stock and bond markets tumbling yesterday. Against a background of gloomy economic news and fears that Germany may lift its key Lombard rate before long, European share markets suffered their worst losses for eight months. The D-Mark rose further against the dollar and sterling. Nervousness also spread across the Atlantic, where US Treasury bond prices came under pressure, while on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down almost 30 points at 3,331.64. In London the FT-SE 100 fell 51.5 points to close at 2,431.9. Downing Street officials tried to spread reassurance on the UK economic outlook, insisting that Britain would maintain its central DM2.95 central rate in the exchange rate mechanism. However, as sterling gave up Thursday's hard-won gains against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.8475, speculation grew that the UK government may soon engineer an increase in bank base rates to defend the pound. On London money markets, the three-month interbank rate rose to 10 5/16 per cent from 10 1/4 per cent, indicating a possible  1/4 point increase in base rates from the current 10 per cent. Market pessimism was deepened by disparate international developments, ranging from further financial scandal in Italy to a widening in the US trade deficit for May. Sentiment on the UK government bond market was depressed by the surprise announcement of higher mortgage rates by the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society. Across the continent, most financial centres showed bond prices slumping, with nervousness particularly marked in Milan and Madrid. Italian stock and bond market prices were hit not only by worries about the weak lira, but also by the arrest of the financier Mr Salvatore Ligresti on alleged corruption charges. The Frankfurt stock exchange's DAX index fell 2.2 per cent, the steepest fall this year, to close at its lowest since the August 1991 Soviet coup. Conditions on the Frankfurt money market - which in effect sets the interest rate floor throughout Europe - remained tight. The Bundesbank added funds at close to the current 9 3/4 per cent Lombard rate. This strengthened market belief that a rise in the Lombard rate may be only a matter of time, as the Bundesbank maintains its battle against 4 per cent German inflation. The dollar dropped nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs in heavy trading in New York, falling at one stage to DM1.457, only slightly more than a pfennig up from its record low, before closing at DM1.459. There was heavy demand for the Swiss franc and gold, both appearing to profit from their traditional role as safe investment havens. Gold rose to a five-month high of Dollars 358.25 an ounce. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, suggested 'a dollar crisis' was brewing after the 4 pfennig fall in the US currency this week. In Germany, there was further criticism of the Bundesbank's action, although it remained low-key. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, said he wished the Bundesbank had veered 'more towards the promotion of growth'. Ms Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, told a Norwegian newspaper that Chancellor Helmut Kohl - who visited Norway this week - had 'personally advised' against the interest rate rise. Bonn officials, however, could not confirm this. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's IG-Metall metalworkers' union, said the discount rate rise would lead to higher prices and rents, increase the number of bankruptcies and exacerbate the unemployment situation.

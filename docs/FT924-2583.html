Mr Ridder said Knight-Ridder hoped to sign a deal with a leading US book publisher by the year end and that it aimed to publish more than a half dozen books annually. He declined to identify the publisher they were negotiating with. Ridder said the pending arrangement was inspired by the success of two recent books.</p>

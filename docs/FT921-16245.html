			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Rise in joblessness for former trainees THE NUMBER of adults out of work three months after taking part in the government's main training programme continued to increase in 1990-91, according to internal government figures published by the Unemployment Unit, an independent research group. The figure of 58 per cent for those leaving Employment Training was 5 percentage points worse than for the year to July 1990. ET has been a controversial scheme. The Treasury last year unsuccessfully sought to cut its budget, justifying the move with its forecast that fewer than three people out of 10 would find a job after completing the scheme in 1992-93. Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which now administer the scheme, are seeking to reform it. Many are trying to relate ET more closely to real job opportunities. At present the long-term unemployed may achieve training in skills for which there is no local demand. According to the ET leavers survey for 1990-91, the proportion out of work after completing the scheme in the west Midlands and the north of England rose to more than 60 per cent, and in London unemployment grew from 53 per cent in June 1990 to 63 per cent in January last year. According to the figures, the situation was worse in some Tec areas, including South Thames Tec, which includes Lambeth and Southwark. The survey also showed marked regional variations in participants working towards qualifications. In London only 37 per cent of trainees worked towards a qualification, compared with 47 per cent in the north. The Department of Employment said rates of employment after ET were affected by unemployment generally. Working Brief. Unemployment Unit, 409 Brixton Rd, London SW9. By subscription.</p>

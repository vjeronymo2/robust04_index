			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS PAY LAST RESPECTS TO BRADLEY  </P> <P> With the flag at the Capitol flying at half staff, the state Assembly was quiet  during normal working hours Monday as many colleagues of the late Bill Bradley  flew to San Diego to pay their respects at the funeral of the San Marcos  Republican assemblyman.  </P> <P> Bradley, 70, died Thursday morning after a nearly four-year struggle against  cancer, which was complicated by a chronic bleeding ulcer.  </P> <P> Out of respect to the well-liked Bradley, lawmakers put off their business  until Monday night or today.  </P> <P> "As soon as we learned what time the funeral would be and we knew that  everybody or most everybody wanted to attend because Bill Bradley was very  popular, then we started making arrangements to change the session around,"  said Susan Jetton, press secretary to Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco).  </P> <P> Assembly committee meetings scheduled for Monday afternoon, normally a light  work day anyway, were postponed until this morning. Usually, no committees meet  Tuesday mornings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspension Not Unusual  </P> <P> In addition, Brown convened the full Assembly at 5 p.m. -- late enough to allow  lawmakers to scramble back from San Diego -- to finish deliberations over a  $50-billion version of the state budget package before it is delivered to an  Assembly-Senate conference committee for final revisions.  </P> <P> Suspending legislative business during the funeral of a lawmaker is not  unusual, said R. Brian Kidney, the assembly's chief clerk.  </P> <P> "Whenever they've had a funeral of one of their own members, usually an  extremely large contingent of the membership go," said Kidney. "If need be,  they will work around that."  </P> <P> Kidney said that the last time the Assembly suspended proceedings was when  Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) died last June.  </P> <P> Bradley, a civil engineer and former San Marcos city manager who was first  elected to the Assembly in 1982, was known more for his candor and low-keyed,  nuts-and-bolts style than for legislative accomplishments. An ardent backer of  property rights, Bradley often fought environmentalists over the right of the  California Coastal Commission to restrict development along the coastline.  </P> <P> Bradley also helped free state funding for dyslexic students and advocated the  mandatory death penalty for people convicted of killing children 7 years or  younger.  </P> <P> When he first learned in 1985 that he had terminal cancer of the liver and  colon, Bradley announced that he would serve out his term and then retire. But  he changed his mind and easily won re-election in 1986 after doctors  successfully implanted a pump in his stomach to send chemotherapy to his  afflicted liver.  </P></p>

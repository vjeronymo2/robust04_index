			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Take a share in the drama of owning a racehorse - Why part of a horse need not cost an arm and a leg Time was when owning a racehorse was the preserve of kings, plutocrats, potentates, sheikhs and pop-stars. In other words, it was a conspicuous part of the way of life of the most conspicuous consumers in the land. These days, however, owning a racehorse, or more accurately a part thereof, has become a much more democratic option. It is no longer the exclusive preserve of the seriously rich and can be enjoyed for an annual sum that need not amount to very much more than the cost of a car or a long-haul holiday. The racing fraternity has laboured long and hard to find these new recruits. The budget of two years ago, which decreed that VAT could be reclaimed on both the capital and training costs, has effectively reduced the cost by 17.5 per cent and this, coupled with the fact that the old snobbish taboos are gradually being eroded, means that there is a new breed of racehorse owner around. From nurses and builders to sub-postmistresses and civil servants, they are as diverse a bunch as can be found anywhere. The one thing they have in common is a love of horses and a desire to get closer to the world of racing than writing out a betting slip on a Saturday afternoon. Like an actor who craves the hot lights and grease-paint, they want to be in the stands cheering on their very own fancy, chatting up the jockeys, sizing up the form, sharing in the tips and gossip of the saddling ring. Unlike the Aga Khan or Sheikh Mohammed these new-style owners are seldom seen swapping anecdotes with the queen and they are happy to own a mere portion of a horse. They belong to partnerships which, under racing authority rules, can never be larger than 12. For this they get almost all the fun that sole owners do. They get to help choose the racing colours, to discuss intricate matters of training, to visit the stables, to discuss racing tactics and, most importantly for many, are allowed in the owners' enclosures at race meetings. As the traditional land-owning classes have become less involved in the sport, almost every trainer in the land has had to seek new patrons and hardly any of them get by without partnership-owned horses. The new-style owner is seldom to be found at Ascot: National Hunt racing is less expensive for those working within a budget, while some, of course, prefer it. National Hunt racing is, in racing terms at least, a kind of counter-culture. It has its roots in farming, raising stock and hunting and at race meetings it shows. Here are not the big hats and swanky frocks of the smart flat-racing season. There are no Aga Khans and Maktoums flying in from Paris and Dubai. National Hunt racing is for fun, a hobby. Prize money is lower (on average Pounds 2,000 over hurdles where the young horses start and Pounds 3,000 over the jumps to which they graduate). And the male horses are nearly always gelded so there is no chance of a great payback at stud. But against that, all being well, the racing life of a jumper is usually much longer - on average something like seven or eight years as opposed to two on the flat. Buying into a partnership can be had these days for a rock-bottom starting price of about Pounds 1,200 a year in training costs and vet bills and an initial outlay of not much more - though if you are buying the equine equivalent of a Rolls-Royce your capital costs will be hugely different from those who are buying a Mini. Two people with experience of sharing a horse are Alan and Sarah Waller, two senior administrators with the National Health Service. They say they are well-paid but would never describe themselves as rich. They have a quarter share in Montagnard, a 10-year-old jumper. A builder owns a half and a racing journalist the other quarter. Montagnard is trained at Mark Bradstock's yard at Letcombe Bassett in Berkshire. Alan got into racing because his parents took him racing as a child. 'I had loved everything about it. I wanted to feel a part of that world. We started by leasing a horse that belonged to somebody who had lost all his money in BCCI. We didn't have much luck with it but it gave Sarah and me a taste for the sport. 'We enjoyed saying we owned a horse, we liked visiting it, checking on its form. We got to know the trainer and met lots of friends. Now having a share in Montagnard has increased the fun. It's a hobby for the whole family.' Another of the horses Mark Bradstock is training - Garston le Gaffe - is owned by 25 people in the village of Garston (for these purposes they turned themselves into a limited company, which is another route into horse ownership). From the postmaster and mistress, a security guard and salvage consultant to an Irish County sheriff and a local solicitor, most of the village seems to have a share. The horse is the last racing relative of the great steeplechaser Arkle and he has not raced as much as Bradstock would have liked. But for the Pounds 10,000 it cost six years ago and the Pounds 10 a week each for training fees, the village has had a lot of fun. It has won a novice hurdle at Uttoxeter and been placed more than a dozen times. Vets' bills can make the real costs a little open-ended, however. Alan Waller is rueful about the vet bills that Montagnard seems to be running up. The National Hunt season is only just under way and the Bradstock stable has made a good start. Go Universal won at 12-1 at Chepstow, bringing intense excitement to the small company that owns it, and The Millwright, owned by Sue Mills (she and her husband are the only owner/breeders at the Bradstock stables) came in at 9-2 at Cheltenham last week. Paddy Whitby, assistant trainer at the Bradstock stables, believes that even those who could afford to fund a whole racehorse might have more fun by owning a 12th share in each of 12 horses - this offers twelve times the drama and 12 times the chance to win. All the owners stressed that one of the most important aspects was to choose a trainer who was close enough to visit easily - being part of the training set-up was a large part of the fun. They are all also at pains to point out that the rewards of owning a horse are seldom financial. For instance, something like 90 per cent of owners never get a win and 70 per cent never get a place in any one year. As Alan Waller said: 'All you need is two wins a season to break even with your training fees, or three wins to cover all the costs.' Or as another owner put it: 'You have got to be prepared to take the rough with the rough.' And the Mills, owner of The Millright, warned: 'There are the bad days, the endless disappointments, the driving all over the country to race-meetings - you have to be an optimist. But the good days, when your horse wins . . . then you know it's the sport for you.' It was George Raft who had a perfect explanation for how he got rid of his fortune. 'Well, some went on women, some on gambling, and some went on horses; the rest I spent foolishly.' If you feel like him, then racing could be for you. For those who fancy giving it a whirl, Mark Bradstock has put together a proposal for a Three Horse Partnership. For a capital outlay of Pounds 12,400 and monthly training fees of Pounds 712.50 you get a 20 per cent share in each of three young horses, all five-year-old geldings. For a pamphlet including photographs and costings, write to: Mark Bradstock, The Old Manor House, Letcombe Bassett, Wantage, Oxon. Tel 0235-760780. The Racehorse Owners Association 071-486 6977 publishes 'The Thrill of Ownership' a leaflet which takes would-be owners through the stages from buying a horse to choosing a trainer. The British Horse Racing Board, 44 Portman Square, London W1, is another source of valuable information.</p>

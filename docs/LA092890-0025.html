			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR BEATS LA HABRA  </P> <P> Newport Harbor High School scored twice in the first half and that was enough  to hold off La Habra, 14-6, in a nonleague game Thursday night at La Habra.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor (3-1) didn't do much, however, toward derailing Jason Johnson,  one of Orange County's leading rushers.  </P> <P> Johnson gained 140 yards in 26 carries and scored the Highlanders' only  touchdown on a 35-yard run with 8 minutes 25 seconds left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The lack of a consistent passing game offset Johnson's performance. La Habra  (3-1) was forced to substitute Grant Mitchell at quarterback for his brother  Greg, who injured his shoulder last week. Grant Mitchell completed only six of  15 passes for 51 yards.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor's two touchdowns came in a span of a little more than a minute  in the first half.  </P> <P> Russell Olshefski scored on a two-yard run with 6:52 remaining to put the  Sailors ahead, 7-0. Following an interception by Michael Stipe, the Sailors  scored again on a 30-yard pass play from quarterback Steve Walker to tight end  George Greenwalt.  </P> <P> On the downside, the teams combined to commit 15 penalties for 137 yards.

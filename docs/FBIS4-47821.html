			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- The Pan-Africanist Congress  [PAC] has been admitted as a member of the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC]. According to a proclamation by  President F. W. de Klerk in a special government gazette of  Tuesday, the PAC is now a participant.    Although TEC sittings have finished -- its management  committee may meet on Monday -- the move will give the PAC a  seat on the joint military command council which is planning the  new South African National Defence Force [SANDF].    The PAC will now be entitled to have its Azanian People's  Liberation Army cadres included in the new SANDF.</p>

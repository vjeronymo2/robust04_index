			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in  Cambodian on 25 May reports the following in its  economic-business section on page 4:    On the issue of a cash-trapped state-run factory in Phnom  Penh, the paper says Factory No. 8, which produces girders and  iron sheets and which has been closed for nearly a year due to  the lack of raw materials and funds, has finally been rented to  a company named Hassan, owned by a group of local Muslims.  According to an agreement signed on 29 April 1994, the Ministry  of Industry, Mines, and Energy has granted the company the right  to run the factory for a period of 20 years.    Concerning the income earned by the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry, the paper quotes Kev Vutthin,  deputy director of the ministry's Planning, Accounting, and  Finance Department, as saying that during the first four months  of the year -- from early January to late April -- the ministry  collected earnings of $8.5 million and over 431 million riels  for the state coffers. The deputy director has further said  that the revenue is from the sale of postal stamps and fees  charged for local and overseas telephone calls.    Finally, commenting on the issue of renting state-owned  factories to private companies, the paper says the problem is  now becoming increasingly complicated. It quotes a report as  pointing out that at present, 15 companies still owe a total  amount of $185,000, the rental in the first quarter of the year,  to the State. So far, 40 local and overseas firms have hired  factories from the State, but only 10 of them are operative.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCRIPPS WANTS TO MAKE IT BIG IN MICROSURGERY;  </P> <P> COMPETITORS FEAR A GLUT OF SPECIALISTS  </P> <P> Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla has begun a drive to become the leading  microsurgery center in southernmost California.  </P> <P> An important use of microsurgery is reattachment of severed limbs, and Scripps'  move has raised concerns that too many San Diego-area hospitals may be getting  into that field.  </P> <P> But Dr. Stephen M. Krant, a plastic surgeon who heads the new Scripps unit, has  a different view. "We are not creating a new science at Scripps," he said. "We  are creating the availability of the microsurgeons. People will know that, if  you have an accident or fire, you call 911, if you have an amputation the first  thing you think about is Scripps Memorial Hospital-La Jolla Microsurgery and  Replantation Center."  </P> <P> However, critics of the proliferation of such high-profile programs as  microsurgery worry that having too many of them will dilute their efforts and  might lower the quality of overall care. Furthermore, it would limit the  ability of UC San Diego Medical Center to train surgeons in the microscopic  intricacies of reattaching severed limbs, some doctors say.  </P> <P> "What you're dealing with is a lot of administrators trying to play  one-upmanship on the next hospital down the street," Dr. Jonathan Jones said of  the boom in new programs. A plastic surgeon, Jones heads the Mercy Hospital  &amp; Medical Center replantation team.  </P> <P> Microsurgeons, viewing the field of surgery through a microscope and using  sutures so fine that they can float in the air, are able to sew tiny blood  vessels together and restore circulation to newly connected tissue.  </P> <P> Microsurgery is useful in a variety of specialty operations, including breast  reconstruction after a mastectomy and transplanting tissue from one part of the  body to another to repair birth defects, cancer damage or chronic wounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dramatic Results  </P> <P> Some of the technique's more dramatic results come in emergencies when it is  used to reattach fingers, hands or limbs and make them functional again. Such  operations are done by teams of rotating doctors, and can take more than 24  hours.  </P> <P> San Diego County's first limb reattachment unit was at UCSD Medical Center,  which began performing the operations in 1977. By the early 1980s about 60 a  year were being performed at the center. When the unit was too busy to handle a  case, it was usually referred to surgeons in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The number of amputation cases in San Diego County has fallen, microsurgeons  say, apparently because of safer equipment in industry and home shops.  Nevertheless, replantation programs have proliferated.  </P> <P> Three years ago Mercy Hospital set up a replantation unit that Jones said was  intended to handle UCSD's overflow. Then, a year ago, a surgeon trained at UCSD  began setting up a program at Grossmont Hospital. It is gearing up for a major  marketing push to industrial employers in eastern San Diego County and,  possibly, Baja California.  </P> <P> Together, those two hospitals handle about 2 dozen major replantation cases a  year, and the UCSD total has dropped to about 30, doctors there say.  </P> <P> In that competitive milieu, Scripps is using a San Francisco hospital as a  model for what it would like to become: the private hospital that draws  patients from a wide region because of its medical reputation and no-nonsense  efficiency.  </P> <P> "Even though microsurgery has been done in San Diego for a while, this whole  unified concept hasn't been done," Krant said. "It is an all-inclusive program  because we are organizing a complete team approach with social service,  psychologists, rehabilitation, occupational therapy -- because all of that is  really involved with these patients that are injured."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Willing and Committed'  </P> <P> Even as UCSD Medical Center and other hospitals in San Diego County back away  from drawing in no-pay patients, Krant said, the Scripps program won't set up  financial roadblocks to replantations.  </P> <P> "We are willing and committed to taking all comers -- insurance, no insurance,  whatever," said Krant, who has a private plastic surgery practice in La Jolla.  </P> <P> He hopes this policy will help Scripps become the best-known replantation  center in both San Diego and Imperial counties, which would then draw in more  paying replant operations as well as non-emergency microsurgeries.  </P> <P> Allen Yearick, associate administrator at Scripps, said the unit is a logical  extension of reconstructive microsurgical work the hospital's doctors already  are doing related to cancer surgeries, birth defects and the trauma unit. It  also will offer an opportunity to educate the public about what to do when an  accident at home severs fingers or limbs.  </P> <P> The Scripps model for its unit is Davies Medical Center in San Francisco, a  private hospital where microsurgery pioneer Dr. Harry J. Buncke leads a team  that does 150 replantations and 200 other microsurgeries a year.  </P> <P> That is despite the fact that there are competing centers at UC San Francisco,  Stanford University and UC Davis. Scripps' replant team has consulted with UC  Davis and sent nurses there for training, Krant said.  </P> <P> "A lot of the industry workers' compensation cases don't go to UCSF. They go to  Buncke because they know from the time you make that phone call there's no  hassle," Krant said.  </P> <P> He contrasts this to what he characterized as bureaucratic roadblocks, based on  financial issues, that an employer with an injured worker faces at a university  hospital such as UC Davis or UCSD. Already, the Scripps replant team has drawn  one such case from El Centro, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gearing Up for 2 Months  </P> <P> For the patient, the difference between a replant operation at a public  university and one at a private hospital is "the difference between a bed and  breakfast and the Hyatt Regency," said Michelle O'Hara, coordinator of the  Davies replant center.  </P> <P> As the Scripps team was gearing up over the last two months, it did three  replantation operations, about the same rate as Mercy and Grossmont. Krant said  he hopes the center will do 10 to 15 replants a year and an additional 40 to 60  elective surgeries involving microvascular techniques.  </P> <P> If that goal is met, it should be enough to keep Scripps' four plastic and  reconstructive surgeons in good enough training through elective surgeries to  assure they have good results with the emergencies, Mercy's Jones said. As in  any complicated surgery, the more practice a surgeon gets, the better the  outcome.  </P> <P> But Jones and others worry that too many programs might mean too few elective  cases at any one hospital to keep the doctors in good training -- leading to  unsuccessful reattachments of fingers and limbs.  </P> <P> "The tragedy of it will be that, if Grossmont gets their big program going and  all their PR, and Scripps has theirs, and Mercy and University, you're going to  find that each hospital with their well-advertised program does two cases a  year, and they may not be successful," he said.  </P> <P> Whether that becomes a problem will depend on how many non-emergency  microvascular surgeries the hospitals attract, Jones said.  </P> <P> "If the person doing them does free tissue transfers and regularly does  microsurgery procedures then this is just a spinoff from that, and then it can  be successful in all the centers," he said.  </P> <P> Dr. Ephraim Zinberg, chief of the Hand and Microvascular Surgery Service at  UCSD Medical Center, said UCSD used to be the only hand and limb replantation  center in the county "and, as far as we're concerned, we're still the only  one."  </P> <P> He questioned whether a replantation program should consider its doctors  qualified to do replantations if they have not done one-year fellowships in  hand surgery to gain experience in the complicated surgical and follow-up care  such cases need. Zinberg has done so, and UCSD also trains two hand fellows  annually.  </P> <P> Zinberg noted that the American Society for Surgery of the Hand appears likely  to establish the one-year training program as a requirement for eligibility to  take a new board-certification exam in the specialty.  </P> <P> Of the private microvascular centers, only Grossmont's has a surgeon who has  done a one-year hand fellowship. He is Dr. Ronald Vandell, who was trained at  UCSD.  </P> <P> At Scripps, Krant's training included a three-month hand fellowship in a  community hospital while he was a resident at Yale University, plus many  microsurgeries at Yale. His three plastic surgeon colleagues on the Scripps  team have not done one-year hand fellowships, but they have extensive  experience in complicated microsurgeries.  </P> <P> For instance, Dr. Ned Garrigues started the microsurgery program at Naval  Hospital San Diego in 1982 and had a six-month specialty training in skull and  face reconstruction in Paris.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people that are excellent hand surgeons who are not going  to take those boards and have not had a special fellowship," Krant said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worries About Training  </P> <P> Some doctors also worry about UCSD'S ability to train hand fellows if the  number of replantations there falls because patients are being drawn by private  hospitals.  </P> <P> "When you begin to have it all over the place, things get fragmented. When I  started practice here, having trained at UCSD, I took all my replants to  University Hospital . . . because my concern was that that is a training  program," Vandell said. "If these injuries are now going to be taken care of in  the private hospitals, then that significantly injures the training program."  </P> <P> Despite his involvement in the Grossmont program that will compete with UCSD  for patients, Vandell continues to be involved in the university's efforts as a  hand surgery teacher at the UCSD Medical Center and the VA Hospital.  </P> <P> One solution to the potential dearth of patients at UCSD would be cooperation  among the various centers to train doctors in microsurgery. UCSD and Grossmont  recently announced a joint training program to teach microvascular surgical  techniques to doctors in the community. Beginning in September, the program  will offer a five-day course.  </P> <P> Krant said he would be interested in cooperative programs between Scripps and  the university too, but said the option has not yet been explored.  </P> <P> In the end, whether there are too many microvascular/replantation programs in  San Diego County may be settled Darwinian style, with the survival of the  fittest.  </P> <P> "I don't think UCSD's our competitor," Krant said, but added: "I think we can  blow them out of the water in terms of quality of care."  </P> <P> "It's the same as in any specialty or sub-specialty," he said. "Those guys who  do good (heart operations) are going to be very, very busy. And those who don't  do good hearts and don't have good services are not going to be very busy."  </P></p>

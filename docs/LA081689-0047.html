			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS URGED TO BOYCOTT JOBS TO PROTEST NEW ID CARDS  </P> <P> Leaders of the anti-Israeli uprising on Tuesday ordered Palestinians in the  occupied West Bank to boycott their jobs in Israel for a week to protest  restrictive new measures imposed on Arabs in the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The order for a seven-day strike, which would be the longest in the  20-month-old uprising, came along with a call for "more stones and knives" in  fighting Israeli occupation.  </P> <P> A Palestinian man died Tuesday of a gunshot wound suffered a day earlier in a  clash with soldiers, the army said.  </P> <P> Sixteen other Palestinans were reported shot and wounded Tuesday in  confrontations with soldiers in the occupied lands, according to Arab reports.  One of the victims, a 14-year-old girl from the Askar refugee camp near Nablus,  was reported in critical condition with a bullet in the head.  </P> <P> The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising said in a communique that  the strike should begin Friday, the day the army begins enforcing a new rule  that requires Gaza Strip Palestinians to show computerized ID cards to enter  Israel.  </P> <P> Cards are denied anyone considered a security risk.  </P> <P> More than 50,000 Gazans work in Israel, as do about 60,000 Palestinians from  the West Bank.  </P></p>

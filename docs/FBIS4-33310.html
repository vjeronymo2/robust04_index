			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio returned to  Guatemala last night after attending the inauguration of new  Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol.    De Leon's arrival, initially scheduled to be at 17:30 local  time, was delayed for two hours, causing the suspension of a  pre-announced news conference.    Presidency spokesman Felix Loarca indicated the president's  delay was due to a last-minute meeting he had before leaving El  Salvador. Nothing bad happened, he was delayed because of the  meeting and that is why we canceled the news conference, Loarca  stressed.    According to Loarca, during de Leon's visit to El Salvador,  the Central American presidents held meetings in which they  discussed topics related to the upcoming Ibero-American Summit  to be held in Cartagena, Colombia.    We have confirmed that President de Leon will attend the  Ibero-American Summit. At the summit, the initiative for the  Alliance for Sustained Development will be discussed. The  Central American presidents are expected to present this  initiative jointly, he added.    Meanwhile, Loarca noted that de Leon Carpio will host today  a  dinner in honor of Taiwan's Prime Minister Lien Chan. Chan has  been visiting the country since yesterday afternoon.</p>

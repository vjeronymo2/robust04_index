			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKE MY WORD!: SOME LINGUISTIC ISSUES WITH WEIGHT  </P> <P> "God said, Let there be light, and there was light."  </P> <P> That was long, long ago. More recently, some advertising man said, "Let there  be lite," and, God help us, there was lite." Lite, presumably, was created to  make life easier for people who have problems with spelling and pronunciation.  Lite obviously rhymes with bite. It also rhymes with byte, bight, and indict --  and, appropriately, with blight.  </P> <P> For what seems like a decade, we've been bombarded, especially if we are fans  of televised sports, by a surfeit of what I think of as Three-Stooges-class  humor involving the confusion of various kinds of lights with an abomination  labeled light or lite beer. "Gimme a light," says some poor boob, and millions  of dollars' worth of all hell breaks loose in the form of theatrical lighting,  when all the guy wants is "a light beer."  </P> <P> Light beer (some beers seem to be light and some lite, and I'm not going to  write lite unless I have to) is generally touted as light not because it is  lighter in color than regular beer, nor even because it has fewer calories, but  because it has "less calories." Well, I suppose beer advertising is designed to  appeal to those of us with a Three Stooges mentality, so less calories is  probably appropriate. Highfalutin words like fewer could be jarring and thus  counterproductive in the old Three Stooges Taproom.  </P> <P> The reason light beer has fewer calories than regular beer is probably that it  has less alcohol by volume. I've tasted light beer a couple of times, and to me  it tastes like nothing but watered beer. I could be mistaken, but I've been  drinking beer for at least 45 years, and while I don't consume nearly so much  now as I did in the '40s and '50s, the old taste buds are still active, and my  first taste of light beer led me to refer to it as a "beer highball." Light  beer costs the same as regular beer, so it seems to me that if you buy light  beer you could economize by changing to old-fashioned beer and adding water.  </P> <P> Obviously, light is a versatile word. Regarding "light beer," it means  "containing less alcohol." About 10 years ago, light beer had a different  meaning. You might remember that back then, most of the brewers, at least here  in California, changed the size of the standard beer can from 12 ounces to 11  ounces. With no fanfare whatsoever, they simply shrank the cans. I guess beer  drinkers caught on. Twelve-ounce cans have been back for some time now.  </P> <P> Have you noticed that the coffee companies have pulled a similar stunt lately?  I noticed that one brand of coffee cost almost 20% less than the one I usually  bought. Naturally, I switched to the cheaper brand. I could at least give it a  try, and I admit that I'm not a critical connoisseur of coffee. Today, I'll  admit with some embarrassment that I actually continued to buy the cheaper  brand for several weeks until I just happened to notice that the can, which  looked like all coffee cans, said on its label "13 Oz." Some sharp entrepreneur  had made a breakthrough: the 13-ounce pound of coffee. No wonder the can cost  almost 20% less. It contained almost 20% less.  </P> <P> Such a brilliant invention -- the 13-ounce pound -- could not be kept  exclusively by the Folger's folks (for it was they who introduced it, at least  to me). Nowadays, the only coffees I can find in my local supermarket that stay  with the old unimaginative 16-ounce can are French Market and Martinson's. All  the others seem to have discovered the advantages of the 13-ounce pound of  coffee. Again, they haven't put forth a big publicity campaign announcing the  new, easier-to-carry size.  </P> <P> I've switched to the 16-ounce brands. They may be heavier, but I can use the  workout.  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool WOOL Prices at auction sales last week were looking a little shaky, and the British Wool Marketing Board lowered its reserves by about five per cent without leading to any improvement in the clearance to the trade. This week Australia opened more definitely easier and prices for a wide range of wools were down in the 10-15 Australian cents a kg range. With the season now having only a couple of weeks to run, and official forecasts indicating a higher clip than first expected this season and next, price prospects are being adjusted downwards. The AWC market indicator closed 9 cents down at 577 cents a kg.</p>

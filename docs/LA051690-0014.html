			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> Thoughts inspired by "Officials Abandon Spraying Deadline" (Part A, May 5):  </P> <P> Long before aerosol spray cans filled with exotic chemicals became the  commonly-accepted weapon in the war on insects, around the house and garden, a  labor-intensive, hand-pump spray gun was used on the home front, accompanied by  the battle cry, "Quick, Henry, the flit!"  </P> <P> Today, given Gov. Deukmejian's stony support of the indiscriminate aerial  dousing of residential areas with a pesticide in the futile war on the Medfly,  the slogan is now, "Quick, Duke, the malathion!"  </P> <P> When China's teeming population was fast becoming outnumbered by flies, Mao had  fly swatters issued to every household with orders for everyone to meet a daily  fly-kill quota. Presto! Soon no more flies.  </P> <P> Deukmejian should take a page from Chairman Mao's book and order Southern  Californian homeowners to take to their gardens armed with this fail-safe  weapon. Medflies wouldn't stand a chance against such an invincible Swat Team.  </P> <P> KYLE T. SCHWIMMER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

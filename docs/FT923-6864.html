			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Closer look at Alzheimer's Until recently the only accurate means of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia affecting between 5 and 10 per cent of the population over the age of 65, was by post-mortem examination. Now scientists at SIBIA, a biopharmaceutical company founded by the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California, have developed a test which allows diagnoses to be made in patients with symptoms or before symptoms appear, Jennie Lynch writes. The test uses a highly-specific antibody which recognises a human protein, soluble APP, found in the fluid of the spinal cord. The antibody is at least 20 times more sensitive than any previously made to detect soluble APP. In Alzheimer's patients levels of this protein are reduced and, according to a study in today's Lancet, the diminishing levels of protein correlate with increasing severity of the disease.

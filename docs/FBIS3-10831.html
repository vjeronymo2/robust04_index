			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano] </F>   [Excerpts] According to an announcement by Gustavo Rossen,  president of the Banco Latino intervention board, Banco Latino  could resume operations in 24 days as result of the new  Emergency Banking Law recently signed at the Miraflores  Presidential Palace. This morning, the president signed the  Banking Emergency Law, thereby approving a new legal framework  aimed at providing financial assistance to all financial  institutions confronting a liquidity crisis like the one  plaguing Banco Latino. In signing the new law, President Rafael  Caldera said it is a decision of solidarity toward thousands of  Venezuelans affected by the Banco Latino crisis. [passage  omitted]    Delegations representing the banking sector, the National  Congress, and members of the intervention board were present at  the signing ceremony. Congressional representatives explained  some of the benefits the law offers. In addition, the president  of the Venezuelan banking association said the law establishes a  framework allowing for the renewal of confidence in the  country's banking system.    [Begin recording] [Democratic Action Deputy Omar Barboza]  Starting with 10 million or more bolivares, the intervention  board will be able to limit the application of this index or  rate in order to repay interest to deposit holders. One thing is  the guarantee, which amounts to 4 million bolivares, and another  is the possible limit in applying the consumer price index to  determine interest. Starting at 10 million bolivares, the  intervention board is free to apply the interest rates it  believes to be most applicable to the bank's reorganization  plans.    [National Banking Council President Jose Bouzas] This law  establishes a framework that will allow solutions to the crisis  the Venezuelan banking sector is going through to be found. As  members of the banking sector, we seek to establish guidelines  allowing the bank's reorganization and the adoption of adequate  solutions to protect deposit holders thereby enabling them to  recover all their savings. On the other hand, this law provide a  legal reference to support and sustain the entire banking  system, which is currently being assisted by FOGADE [Deposit  Guarantee Fund]. In other words, if we can ensure joint actions  between the public and private sector, basically from national  private banks, I then believe we will be able to establish joint  programs between the banking superintendency, the Venezuelan  Central Bank, FOGADE, and national private banks. In addition,  there will also be the possibility of helping Banco Latino's  depositors, helping with the bank's reorganization, and in  finding a solution to the banking system crisis. [end recording]    The Central Bank president, who was also present during the  Emergency Banking Law signing ceremony, insisted this  institution has carried out its duties according to the law, and  she indicated that she has all necessary documents to support  her statements. The documents will be given to the courts soon.    [Begin recording] [Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy]  Through out the process, the Central Bank of Venezuela has  conducted itself strictly in accordance with the law, with  absolute objectivity. The bank has also promoted immediate,  timely solutions to all difficulties it experienced. The Central  Bank has extensively explained its performance to the  congressional commissions. We also intend to provide all  necessary details requested by the courts relating to this  institution's performance. In this respect, I can say that from  an ethical as well as a banking and monetary policy point of  view, the Central Bank of Venezuela has conducted itself in  accordance with the law, and we are willing to prove it to  whatever level may be necessary. [end recording]    Gustavo Rossen, president of the Banco Latino intervention  board said there are some legal loopholes, which Congress will  solve soon. At the same time he insisted that Banco Latino  depositors can rest assured the bank will be bank rolled within  a very short period.    [Being recording] [Rossen] The request we plan to make of  deposit holders, when the reorganization plan is finally  approved, is to have confidence that once Banco Latino has been  bank rolled by the government, then it will once again be one of  the most solid banks in the country.    Deposit holders should not be apprehensive about leaving  their deposits in the bank because they will be entirely paid  back. In addition, they are essential if Banco Latino is  expected to be the type of bank its long time clients want it to  be: successful, versatile, and a bank capable of providing good  service to its clients.    [Pachano] You have already decided on the details of the  reorganization plan? It has...    [Rossen, interrupting] Yes, we have.    [Pachano] Has the plan been presented to President Caldera?    [Rossen] No, there is no need to present it to the president  because it is not up to him to decide. The reorganization plan  will be presented to the Central Bank of Venezuela in accordance  with the law, and also to FOGADE.    [Pachano] Is it going to be presented this afternoon?    [Rossen] This morning we presented it to the Central Bank  and this afternoon we will present it to FOGADE.    [Pachano] Both institutions must approve the plan?    [Rossen] That is correct.    [Pachano] If they ...    [Rossen, interrupting] Because both institutions will  provide  the funds to implement the program.    [Pachano] If the plan is approved today, how soon will it be  implemented?    [Rosses] The reopening or reorganization plan, whichever you  prefer, will be implemented in approximately 24 days as of  [words indistinct]. In his address to the nation, President  Caldera spoke of 30 days. If I am not mistaken, six days have  gone by since his address to the nation, therefore we still have  24 days to reopen the bank. By reopen, we mean reorganize. [end  recording]    Once the Banking Emergency Law signing ceremony concluded,  Gustavo Rossen headed to the Central Bank of Venezuela to  present details on the Banco Latino reorganization. During the  afternoon hours, he will also meet with the FOGADE board of  directors to explain the reorganization program. If the plan is  approved, Banco Latino could resume operations in 24 days.</p>

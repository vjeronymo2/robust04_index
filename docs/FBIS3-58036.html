			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD (SVD): "Mr. Delcroix Speaks of </F> Withdrawing Blue Helmets"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 5 Jan 94 (BELGA) -- Belgian Defense  Minister Leo Delcroix threatened on Wednesday [5 January] to  withdraw the Belgian Blue Helmets from Bosnia-Herzegovina, where  they are 300 of the 12,000 soldiers in the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in this former Yugoslav republic.    France, Spain, Great Britain, and Canada, the principal  suppliers of men to Bosnia, have begun to reexamine the mission  of their Blue Helmets. Lord David Owen, the European mediator  for the former Yugoslavia, believes the UN forces may withdraw  next spring if no apparent progress is made in the peace talks  within the next two months.    Interviewed on Wednesday evening by RTBF [French-language  Belgian broadcast media] Television, Mr. Delcroix also spoke of  the possibility of withdrawing Belgian forces from Bosnia in the  absence of a "political solution" to the civil war between the  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. "We must wait until the end of the  winter," the defense minister added. In March or April, we will  have to "think of new means (of continuing the UNPROFOR mission)  or withdraw," he stated.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures, and has determined that it is not ``significant'' under them. NHTSA has prepared a regulatory evaluation for this action which discussed the potential costs, benefits and other impacts of this rule. A copy of this evaluation has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking action. Interested persons may obtain copies of it by writing to the docket section at the address provided at the beginning of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To briefly summarize the evaluation, NHTSA estimates that the consumer cost of the labeling requirements of this rule ranges from $0.09 to $0.17 per rear-facing infant restraint. The total annual cost for all infant restraints will range from $350,280 to $661,640. This cost is expected to be even smaller if the warning statement is placed on the existing FMVSS No. 213 label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation also estimates that, assuming that the warning is effective at preventing any placing of rear-facing restraints in air bag positions, 2 to 4 lives will be saved and 445 injuries will be reduced a year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Of the 11 current child restraint manufacturers known to the agency (not counting vehicle manufacturers that produce and install built-in restraints) there are three that qualify as small businesses. This is not a substantial number of small entities. As to vehicle manufacturers that produce and install built-in restraints, most of those restraints are forward-facing restraints and are installed in a rear seating position. Further, those manufacturers are generally not considered small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the number of small entities, the rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities. Infant restraints range in cost between $20 and $70, with the average price about $39. Convertible seats range in cost between $45 and $120, with the average price about $79. If the entire $0.17 cost of the rule were added to the cost of the restraint, the typical infant restraint will increase in price by only 0.44 percent and the typical convertible seat, by only 0.22 percent. Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions might be affected by the rule if these entities procure child restraint systems for programs such as loaner programs. While the cost of the restraint could increase, loaner program procurements will not be significantly affected. A program that had a fixed amount of money for procuring child restraints will have its procurements reduced by only 0.34 to 0.57 percent. Thus, regardless of the number of small organizations and governmental jurisdictions, NHTSA concludes the rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. The agency has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The agency has determined that implementation of this action will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA amends 49 CFR part 571 as set forth below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 571_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Simic, who  also heads the Federal Committee for the Normalization of  Relations with Croatia, told TANJUG that all controversial  issues on the exchange of POWs had been resolved in the talks  with Kostovic which had taken place in Budapest.    The talks covered the destiny of 999 Yugoslav citizens who  disappeared in the territory of Croatia in 1991 (they are mostly  members of the former Yugoslav army who were captured during the  war for Croatia's secession from the former federation and were  sentenced to long prison terms on groundless charges), while the  Croatian side seeks information about some 700 people. Croatia  informed the members of the Yugoslav delegation about the fate  of a certain number of the listed persons, but there are no  details about most of the missing.    Simic said that it had been agreed that the talks would  continue on January 10 in Geneva with Croatian Vice-Premier and  President of the Croatian Committee for the normalization of  Relations with Yugoslavia Mate Granic. Simic assessed that  today's talks in Budapest, during which the two sides also  considered other humanitarian and controversial issues, `do not  anticipate the resolving of political issues in relations  between the two countries, but do create suppositions for such  activities.'    The Geneva meeting with Granic will be a new chance to put  on  the agenda some other important questions of the normalization  of overall relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  and Croatia, such as the re-establishment of telecommunications,  highway and railway traffic, Simic specified.</p>

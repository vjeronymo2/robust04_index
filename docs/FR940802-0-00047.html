			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Blendstock Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposed oxygenate rule would have only allowed refiners to include in renewable oxygenate compliance calculations the renewable oxygenate that is added by downstream oxygenate blenders where the refiner carried out an appropriate quality assurance program over downstream oxygenate blenders. A quality assurance program is intended to ensure that when refiners claim credit for downstream blending of renewable oxygenate that the oxygenate added is renewable, that the renewable oxygenate is added to the RBOB produced by the refiner, and that the volume of renewable oxygenate claimed is correct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received several comments from refiners regarding renewable oxygenate blendstocks in response to this proposal. Some commenters felt that the proposed renewable oxygenate requirement would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement as it would force refiners and importers to implement costly oversight programs over independent blenders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter also stated that the proposed renewable oxygenate rule's reliance on RBOB availability is ``at odds with'' the reformulated gasoline program requirements for RBOB production and handling. Under the final reformulated gasoline rule, the commenter notes, RBOBs having different oxygenate requirements are segregated to the point of oxygenate blending. For example, the commenter points out, ``any oxygenate'' RBOB must be segregated from ``ether-only'' RBOB. The segregation requirements, combined with the renewable oxygenate mandate, will (according to the commenter) exacerbate the problems associated with supplying the needed amount of RBOB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees for the most part with these comments and has provided for greater downstream oxygenate blending of renewables similar to the final reformulated gasoline rule. As explained in greater detail in the general overview section (``A,'' above), the final renewable oxygenate regulations allow for two compliance options. The first option permits the refiner to claim the actual amount of renewable oxygenate added by the downstream blender and requires that both a contractual relationship and a testing and oversight program exist. The second option allows the refiner to designate RBOB as one of two generic renewable types <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and to claim credit for downstream blending of renewable oxygenate based on specified assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  For areas which have been granted an extended non-commingling season, there are three generic RBOB types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;80.83(f), oxygenate blenders are required to maintain and, upon request, deliver to the EPA Administrator, or the Adminstrator's designated representative, records demonstrating the renewable nature and source of the oxygenate used; characteristics in terms of volume, type, and purity; and product transfer documentation for renewable oxygenate, reformulated gasoline, or RBOB for which the blender acts as transferor or transferee. Although these blender recordkeeping requirements vary from the renewable oxygenate proposal, they are consistent with recordkeeping requirements associated with other reformulated gasoline requirements and will not impose a significant additional recordkeeping burden. As discussed in greater detail in ``A. Overview of the Enforcement Scheme,'' above, EPA has created new categories of renewable RBOB to allow greater refiner flexibility in the renewable oxygenate requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. The Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for California Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The renewable oxygenate requirements apply to Federal reformulated gasoline sold in the two covered areas in the State of California, Los Angeles and San Diego. However, refiners who produce reformulated gasoline for use in California are exempt from most reformulated gasoline enforcement mechanisms beginning in 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;80.81. This California exemption is based on the fact that beginning in March 1996, all gasoline used in California will be subject to the California Phase II reformulated gasoline standards (``California gasoline''), which EPA has concluded are at least as stringent as the federal Phase I reformulated gasoline emissions standards. As a result, refiners who produce California gasoline are exempt from most federal reformulated gasoline enforcement requirements, including designating gasoline as either reformulated or conventional gasoline, recordkeeping <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and reporting. Refiners of California gasoline are not exempt, however, from meeting the federal reformulated gasoline standards, including the renewable oxygenate standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Refiners of California gasoline are required to keep records required by California State law for five years, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, EPA suggested a simple method to ensure that an appropriate volume of California gasoline meets the renewable oxygenate requirement. Specifically, EPA proposed that each refiner who produces California gasoline be required to meet the renewable oxygen standard for 54% of its volume California gasoline. The 54% figure was derived from the historical volume of gasoline used in the Los Angeles and San Diego markets as a portion of the entire state's market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received several comments with respect to the ``54% proposal.'' Some commenters, including industry and trade associations, felt that EPA has no legal authority under &sect;211(k) of the Clean Air Act to require all California refiners to meet the renewable oxygenate standard for 54% of their entire volume of California gasoline. These commenters argued that imposing the renewable oxygenate requirement in this manner would amount to requiring renewable oxygenate in Federal non-reformulated as well as reformulated gasoline. Two other commenters expressed support for EPA's 54% proposal, however, as a simple solution to a difficult program issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The prime minister stressed that the decision was based  on a legal statement of opinion submitted by the attorney  general and backed by reports from the Shin Bet and the police.  When asked whether the cabinet's decision would be upheld by  the High Court of Justice, Mr. Rabin said he assumed that the  attorney general and the Justice Ministry had ascertained that  these steps were legal. Our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon reports  that the prime minister was speaking at a memorial ceremony for  deceased Israeli presidents and prime ministers.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that movements which  promulgated violence should be outlawed. Netanyahu, however,  added that there should be legal restrictions limiting the term  of such steps to six months in order to examine their  effectiveness.    NRP [National Religious Party] leader Zvulun Hammer said  that  the path chosen by the Kahana activists was wrong, asserting  that anyone inciting to murder, racism, or the undermining of  democracy should be punished. However, Hammer noted, it would  be better if such steps were taken by the courts and not by a  government with political leanings.    Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan criticized the decision saying  that only people who violate the law should be dealt with  legally.    Labor party secretary Nisim Zvili said that one should not  judge the entire settler community on the basis of activities  carried out by the extremist movements in the territories. Now  more than ever, Zvili said, it was time to establish a dialogue  with the settlers so as not to turn them into enemies of peace.</p>

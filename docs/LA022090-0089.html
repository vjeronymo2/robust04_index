			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> BIDS SOUGHT FOR WIDENING OF BRIDGE  </P> <P> The city is seeking bids for the widening of Rancho Viejo Road's Trabuco Creek  bridge.  </P> <P> As projected in the city's master plan, the 25-year-old, two-lane bridge,  originally built by Caltrans, will be widened to four lanes with a median and  space for a bicycle path.  </P> <P> The 211-foot-long bridge is located near Rosenbaum Road in the northern part of  the city.  </P> <P> When completed, the bridge will be 84 feet wide between curbs, and Rancho Viejo  Road will be four lanes all the way to Junipero Serra Road, according to Tom  Lynch, a consultant for the city.  </P> <P> The project will also include remodeling a small section of the county bicycle  trail that runs along Trabuco Creek beneath the bridge. The trail is part of  the county master plan of trails and winds up at Doheny State Beach.  </P> <P> Lynch estimates that the new bridge will cost about $1.8 million. The city has  set an eight-month deadline for completion of the project. Sealed bids are due  by 2 p.m. March 15.  </P> <P> Concurrently, the city is seeking a state grant to build an equestrian bridge  next to the new Trabuco Creek bridge, Lynch said. State officials have  indicated that $90,000 has been added to the state budget for the equestrian  bridge but the money has not been allocated, Lynch said.LEN HALL  </P></p>

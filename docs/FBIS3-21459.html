Despite four tests in the last two days on the advanced  projectile, the weapon may have to wait two years before it is  inducted in the country's arsenal, the Defence Ministry  indicated.    The tests follow the successful induction of the 150 to 250  km range, Surface to Surface Prithvi missile in the forces.  India's efforts to develop a 2,000-km range IRBM, "Agni" is also  expected to take a step forward. Postponed recently, a third  test on the Agni is also widely anticipated.    Capable of piercing the most advanced of tank armours, the  missile can be launched either from a tracked vehicle or from a  helicopter. In the recent tests, it was fired from a tracked  vehicle, developed by the DRDO in partnership with Indian  industry.    The missile's 4 km. range is matched by a "fire and forget"  capability. Once a target is sighted, the missile automatically  aligns to it. The time saved in engaging targets allows the  weapon to be fired at a rapid rate, thereby adding to its punch.    Among other capabilities, the Nag has "top attack" features.  Taking advantage of the fact that the armour is the thinnest at  the top, it homes on to upper areas of a tank (usually the  turret).    To make the missile light without reducing strength, its  airframe is made of composite materials. Foldable wings enable  the missile to be launched by a tube. The casing of the  propulsion system is made of high strength aluminum alloys.    A tandem shaped charge warhead is made of a thinner front,  shielding the main charge. Since reactive armours feature on  most contemporary tanks (this armour explodes on impact thereby  neutralising an incoming charge) the front portion of the  warhead on the Nag has been designed to take this impact. Having  seen through the reactive armour explosion, the full caliber  main charge thereafter breaches the tank.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME SERVED  </P> <P> A slap on the wrist for a stab in the back:  </P> <P> When I saw the headline "Junior High Student Who Stabbed Teacher Given 8-Year  Sentence" (Metro, May 26) I immediately scanned the article to determine the  true sentence.  </P> <P> I was not surprised: "Although committed for a maximum detention time of eight  years at a California Youth Authority facility, a prison for young people, the  boy could be eligible for parole in two to four years, authorities said."  </P> <P> No doubt the boy needs help, and the state will give it.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the teacher cannot be paroled from her injury and suffering, and  it is doubtful if the state will be as ready to help the teacher as it is to  help the student.  </P> <P> EUGENE B.

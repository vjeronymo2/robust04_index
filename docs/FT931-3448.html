			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Amato says Italy faces north-south break-up MR GIULIANO AMATO, the Italian prime minister, yesterday said his country faced the risk of a break-up between north and south unless it made urgent changes to its electoral laws. Mr Amato coupled his warning of possible secession with a strong call for the establishment of a new political class to steer the country out of its crisis over corruption. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Amato said revelations of widespread illicit financing in business and politics gave Italy no choice but to 'renew its ruling class'. If elections were held now under the proportional electoral system, dissatisfaction with established parties would lead to 'the inevitable success of extremist parties'. The right wing Lombard League, which favours detaching the prosperous north from the poor south, would probably be the strongest party in parliament, Mr Amato said. 'If we can change the system towards the smallest amount of proportional representation that Italians are capable of introducing, then the danger (of fragmentation) would be smaller,' Mr Amato said. Italians vote in a national referendum on April 18 on a series of constitutional issues, including reforming the electoral system. The outcome is expected to increase pressure for an early general election. Mr Amato, who has already announced his prospective retirement from politics, spelt out his vision of a 'peaceful revolution' throughout Italy's ruling elite. His eight-month-old coalition has been at the centre of the political storm. Several ministers have been among more than 1,000 politicians, businessmen and officials implicated in the scandals. As the scale of corruption unearthed during the last few weeks has increased, expectations of the future make-up of the Italian political system had 'changed totally', Mr Amato said. The aim in coming months was to 'get new people out of the professions - ordinary citizens - into parliament, because the old people will not be acceptable any more,' he said. Speaking of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties at the centre of scandals, Mr Amato said: 'I don't expect these parties to be players in the new game. I don't expect these men (the parties' present leaders) to be leading figures in the new system.' Mr Renato Altissimo, leader of the small Liberal party, yesterday became the third head of an Italian political party to be caught up in the net of investigations. Magistrates said he had been told he was under investigation for alleged corruption. He was one of at least seven new parliamentarians served with such notices yesterday.

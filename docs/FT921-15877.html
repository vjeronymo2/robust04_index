			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Regional division 'impeding Czechoslovak reform': OECD report praises federal government for overcoming political handicaps SUBSTANTIAL economic costs have been incurred and Czechoslovakia's structural reform delayed by a failure to define the post-communist constitutional relationship between the Czech and Slovak parts of the country, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warns in its first economic survey of the federal republic, writes Anthony Robinson, East Europe Editor. However, 'a great deal has been accomplished in a short time' despite this political handicap, the report says. Achievements include the liberalisation of prices and foreign trade, a sharp reduction in subsidies, and the creation of 'key elements' of a legal basis for private-sector development. The Paris-based think-tank also points to the groundwork laid down for an ambitious privatisation process through vouchers offered to all citizens to buy shares at a discount. Czechoslovakia embarked on its reform process from a far less promising base than Hungary and Poland, which were able to build on substantive earlier reforms begun under former communist governments, the report notes. The orthodox socialist policies followed after the Soviet invasion of 1968 ensured the starting point for market reforms after the 'velvet revolution' of November 1989 was 'an economy almost completely dominated by central planning, with little experience of markets and almost no legal and institutional base for a market economy'. However, the conservatism of the former rulers left Czechoslovakia with a lower foreign debt, lower inflation and lower government debt than either Poland or Hungary. It also gave the newly democratic state a more solid macro-economic base than its central European neighbours. Against this background the reform strategy of the government is 'clearly appropriate', the report says. It defines the policy as 'libties, tight macro-economic policies to sustain stability and privatisation to transform the fundamental structural conditions for economic activity'. One of the notable achievements of the first phase of reform has been 'the preservation of macro-economic stability in the face of liberalisation'. A key contribution to stability has been 'the apparent willingness of the population to accept one-time substantial declines in real wages'. The combination of wage restraint with tight budget and monetary policies in 1991 has yielded benefits. 'By not allowing the price surge associated with liberalisation to become embedded in an inflationary spiral, the authorities have avoided the intractable economic management problems that arise in high inflation situations.' Under the government's attack on the old planning system the percentage of gross domestic product under regulated prices fell from 85 per cent in 1990 to 5-6 per cent by October 1991. As a result prices rose 49.2 per cent over the first six months of last year but stabilised during the summer and rose by no more than 5 per cent from June to the end of the year. Planned increases in house rents will put unavoidable pressure on the consumer price index in 1992, the report says. But 'it should be possible to keep inflation in single digits'. However, this will partly depend on workers who are expected to try to recoup part of last year's fall in incomes. Real wages fell 27 per cent over the first half of 1991, when personal consumption fell 37 per cent. GDP fell 9.2 per cent in the period and net material product (GDP less services) declined 13.8 per cent. The OECD survey points to the problems presented by poor statistics and the need to concentrate western technical assistance on improving this service. Official figures probably over-estimate the decline in output by not recording growth in the private sector. The organisation estimates the number of private entrepreneurs rose from 86,000 in 1989 to 921,000 in August 1991, when the private sector accounted for only 1.2 per cent of industrial production but 13 per cent of domestic trade and 5-6 per cent of construction. The survey notes that the government's small-scale privatisation plans got off to a quick start, while plans for large-scale privatisation are 'on track'. Voucher books have been distributed, company lists published and the physical infrastructure for the bidding process is in place. 'There can be little doubt that the strategy of privatising quickly is basically sound.' But success, the survey cautions, 'will be determined by three factors - administrative feasibility, effective monitoring and establishment of the rules of the market game'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 17 (XINHUA) -- U.S. public  confidence in President Bill Clinton's handling of foreign  policy has declined sharply, according to the latest WASHINGTON  POST-ABC news poll.    The poll, which was conducted from May 12 to 15 and based on  telephone interviews with more than 1,500 adults, showed that a  majority of Americans now question whether Clinton understands  difficult foreign policy problems.    About 53 percent of those interviewed disapproved of  Clinton's handling of foreign policy, with only 40 percent  saying they approved, the lowest rating the President has  received since the deaths of 18 American soldiers in a raid in  Somalia last fall.    The survey shows that 37 percent said Clinton does not have  a  clear foreign policy, with only 13 percent saying he does, and  full half saying they have no opinion.    The critics said Clinton's foreign policy lacks coherence  and  has been marked by flip-flops.    Overall, 50 percent disapproved of Clinton's handling of  Haiti, compared to just 31 percent who approved.    But two-thirds of those surveyed said the United States does  not have a clear policy on Haiti.    In comparison with his predecessor, Clinton comes off badly.  Half of those surveyed said he is doing a worse job on foreign  policy than George Bush, while only 28 percent said he is doing  a better job.    The survey also showed that Clinton's overall approval  rating  has fallen from 57 percent in March to 51 percent this month.    The erosion in support for Clinton's health care plan  continued, with 50 percent now saying they disapproved of the  plan, compared with 44 percent who approved.</p>

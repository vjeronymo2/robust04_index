			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sir James Goldsmith trims Newmont Mining stake IS Sir James Goldsmith, the retired international deal-maker, losing patience with gold? That was the question being asked by mining analysts after 1.8m shares in Newmont Mining, representing 2.6 per cent of North America's biggest gold mining company, were placed with 50 institutions. Sir James paid Dollars 1.1bn cash for a 42 per cent stake in Newmont in October, 1990, saying that the world monetary system was in a mess and that gold would return to favour. The first sign that he might have changed his mind came when his General Oriental Investment, which holds the Newmont shares, sold 1.8m in November last year. Then, on Thursday, came news of the placing. On Friday, the shares closed at Dollars 39.50, down Dollars 2.375 in two days. Analysts suggested there could be only one source of so many Newmont shares  - Sir James's General Oriental. One said: 'We know that he was no lover of equities and quite a fan of gold when he acquired the Newmont stake. It looks as if he is still negative on equities but is losing patience with gold. It looks as if there is a tap on the (Newmont) market.' However, Sir James insisted at the weekend there was no change in his strategy or his views about gold and the monetary system. He said it had been made clear at the time General Oriental bought the Newmont stake that in due course the shareholding would be reduced because the investment was too large for GO. No more than 1.8m shares had been sold by GO and he guessed that the Newmont share placing by Salomon Brothers last Thursday was simply the same tranche 'going into firm hands.' He rejected suggestions that the sale indicated he was losing faith in Newmont. He was 'very pleased' with changes that had taken place in the company since he joined the board in July 1991. Sir James added: 'I continue to be a bull of gold -  it has just taken longer than I expected to come into its own. I continue to be a bear of equities. I continue to believe the world's monetary system is in a mess.'</p>

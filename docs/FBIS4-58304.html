			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi gave a long interview to  APS and AL-SHA'B newspaper in which he talked about the main  facing his government. Here now are the main points of this  interview, read by our colleague Ahmed Souq:    Regarding the main tasks as announced by the prime minister  during his first statement in the post, that is, mainly,  consolidation of the state's institutions, revival of the  national economy, and the enhancement of national solidarity,  Mr. Mokdad Sifi said in response to a question on the methods  which he sees as necessary to achieve these goals: To boost the  state's intitutions is to enable the personnel to shoulder their  responsibilities; to take measures to free them from bureaucracy  and the shackles and pressures of past tutelage; and to open the  door for free expansion of initiatives in the field.    Work should be carried out to encourage and protect  personnel, especially at the local level, either with regard to  special laws or the financial aspect. To this end, the prime  minister, added we have created of the post of a minister  delegate in charge of local communities and administrative  reforms. The municipalities are also a fundamental  preoccupation of the government.    As for the revival of the national economy, the prime  minister said that it is a paramount priority, and that we have  the will and the necessary means to achieve this revival. What  is important is that our workers, entrepreneurs, traders, and  industrialists are able to achieve the required production  level. We will work to gradually eliminate all the obstacles  that are hampering productive economic activities, and we will  encourage all initiatives. He added that there will be no room  for speculation or the black market which has greatly harmed the  country and its citizens. We will also considerably reduce the  rate of unemployment.    Regarding national solidarity, and in addition to the  economic measures that the government will take in favor of the  socially deprived classes, the prime minister said that boosting  this solidarity should take place not only through collective  action but also within the family and inside the school.  National action should become a part of civic action. He added  that the State Secretariat for National Solidarity and the  Family will coordinate with all appropriate circles to include  the notion of national solidarity in the government's agenda.    During the interview with APS and AL-SHA'B, Prime Minister  Mokdad Sifi talked about several national issues. With regard  to implementation of the agreement with the IMF and its impact  on the national economy, the prime minister said that the  program of stability that we have adopted will radically change  the conditions of management of the economy. It goes without  saying, as he put it, that there is a need for restructuring of  the state's role within the overall framework of national  economy. The private sector should be allocated an important  position on condition that all economic operators, irrespective  of their legal position, should adhere to the same market rules.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life exercises Halifax option Standard Life, the Edin-burgh-based life insurance company, said yesterday that it had exercised its option to buy the joint venture investment company it had formed with Halifax Building Society. Halifax last year made a decision to end its tied relationship with Standard Life under which it sold Standard Life's retail financial products exclusively. That agreement formally comes to an end in January 1995, but Standard Life said it was making the announcement of the purchase now 'to allay any uncertainty among existing and new investors about the ongoing investment management of their savings.' The joint venture company, which manages the investment of two unit trusts - Income Advantage and Global Advantage - has 68,000 customers and funds of more than Pounds 300m under management.</p>

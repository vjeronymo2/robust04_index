			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (19): Don't get poor, get savvy THE NEW PENGUIN GUIDE TO PERSONAL FINANCE, 1993/4 EDITION by Alison Mitchell Penguin Pounds 9.99 370 pages INVESTORS CHRONICLE BEGINNERS' GUIDE TO INVESTMENT, 2nd EDITION by Bernard Gray Century Business Pounds 12.99 433 pages The British retain a more sheepish attitude to money than their American cousins. Talking about money is still seen as rather parvenu; wanting to be rich is an ambition best kept to oneself. The difference is particularly marked when it comes to books on personal finance and investment. The Americans lap up books on the subject with titles such as How to Get Rich in 10 Easy Lessons; books by fund managers such as Peter Lynch can become best-sellers. In Britain, books in the field tend to be less flamboyant. Often they are manuals, which work their way methodically through the subject matter, with one chapter on pensions, another on mortgages and so on. Two of the best examples of the genre have just appeared in updated editions. Alison Mitchell's Guide to Personal Finance is written in a common sense, chatty style. Sentences are nice and short; jargon is kept to a minimum and explained properly where it does occur; there are plenty of lists and tips to break up the text. Such advice as is given seems sound (or at least coincides with this writer's prejudices). I could only spot the odd mistake, such as the assertion on page 40 that 'income tax at 25 per cent is automatically deducted from all dividends before they are paid to you.' Since the correct information (that tax is now deducted at 20 per cent) is given later in the book, it does not really matter. In any case, personal finance involves such a mass of detail that it is probably beyond the wit of mortal man or woman to produce a book on the subject without at least one error. Mitchell's book covers such a wide field that it is only for dipping into, rather than reading in full. The Beginners Guide to Investment by Bernard Gray (now an FT journalist) is more precisely targeted at the individual who wants to know more about investment. There can be few private investors who would not reap some benefit if they read it from cover to cover. The second edition still includes such useful features as a list of stockbrokers; it has also expanded its coverage on Peps and Tessas. Most usefully, given the current surge of interest in equities and some recent corporate disasters, the book has revised its section on interpreting company accounts in the wake of recent changes in accounting practice. Unlike their American equivalents, these books do not claim to be able to make you rich. But in their modest British way, they should help prevent anyone who reads them from becoming poor.</p>

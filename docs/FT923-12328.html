			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Verdi Requiem - The Proms On Friday the 98th BBC Promenade Concerts season was launched with splashes of ceremony: the Princess of Wales (vigorously cheered) and the Prime Minister (cheered and booed) arriving in the grand tier, Britten's ingenious arrangement of the National Anthem to open the three-month festival, the Albert Hall brilliantly lit - the concert was being transmitted live on television and radio. A splashy send-off was deserved. Judged from the printed schedule, this summer's mixture of works and performers has been gauged by John Drummond, the Proms Director, with as much skill and cunning as ever. The opening evenings afforded a choice example of that scheduling skill  - each filled, entirely or in large part, with one of the large-chorus, large-orchestral Proms staples that reach out to fill every corner of the great hall with exhilarating sound. On Friday it was the Verdi Requiem, in which the BBC Symphony Orchestra and BBC and LSO choirs were conducted by Andrew Davis; on Saturday, in a Royal Philharmonic Orchestra concert of English music conducted by Vernon Handley, it was the Vaughan Williams Sea Symphony, sung by the Brighton Festival Chorus and London Choral Society. Neither concert lived up to its printed-page promise; nevertheless, the feelings of gladness that surge in every Prommer's breast as the season begins, and gratitude for the largesse, idealism and flair that continue to mark the whole enterprise, survived untarnished. The best thing about the Verdi was the unvaried excellence of the combined choirs: disciplined across an extraordinarily wide dynamic range, sharp of word and pithy - but also appealingly delicate - of tone and line, never lapsing into the enthusiastic imprecision that so often afflicts British choral groups in such circumstances. The playing of the BBC orchestra was similarly controlled, but tended to point rather more clearly to what I sense were the limitations of Davis's approach. It was an expansive interpretation of the Requiem, sensitively and warmly felt, of a soft-focused, generalised kind. Movement followed movement in a mode of textural blandness; the Latin temperament of the music - the instrumental detail and singing line that cry out to be urgently seized and shaped for dramatic ends - was consistently smoothed out and petted down. The quality of the solo singing did nothing to restore the balance. This was, indeed, one of the less well-assorted Verdi Requiem quartets in Proms history; it was capped by the American Susan Dunn, a soprano whose youthful vocal velvet, so beautifully demonstrated on records a few years ago, has got badly frayed in the alarmingly short time. The best thing about Saturday's RPO concert was Mr Drummond's lively and affectionate post-interval tribute to the late Charles Groves, who should have conducted it. The programme was unified by - to put it crudely - second-rate-ness rather than national identity: Walton's wearisomely rogueish and cliche ridden Scapino Overture, Delius's mildewed, occasionally radiant Concerto for Violin and Cello (Tamsin Little and Raphael Wallfisch the admirably convinced soloists), and then the Sea Symphony in all its plodding predictability. Here likewise, an occasional moment of inspired invention comes to provide relief. But perhaps blame for the overall want of 'lift' in the experience deserves to fall on the conductor and his executants (hit-and-miss choir, meat-and-two-veg. orchestra) were responsible: I recall that when Bernard Haitink and the LPO revived this symphony, some years back, its horizons appeared far wider, its rhythmic energies far less four-square. At least the two solo singers, Joan Rodgers (soprano) and Simon Keenlyside (baritone), brought a touch of unfailing distinction to the proceedings.</p>

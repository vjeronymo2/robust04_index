			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Gulf war bill expected to top Pounds 1.4bn THE NET cost to Britain of the Gulf war early last year is expected to exceed Pounds 1.4bn, in spite of more than Pounds 2bn of financial assistance from other countries. A report by the National Audit Office, parliament's public-spending watchdog, includes estimates of up to Pounds 850m the Export Credits Guarantee Department may have to pay on insurance claims connected with events in the Gulf in 1990-91. The watchdog notes that the Ministry of Defence's accounting and forecasting systems did not always readily provide the information it needed to compile the report, saying the final costs are 'still subject to uncertainties'. It puts the net military cost at a minimum of Pounds 615m, although at one stage it seemed that the ministry might register a profit from the campaign. The total military cost of Britain's participation in the campaign is put at Pounds 2.64bn. That includes a bill of Pounds 529m for replenishing stocks after the war and Pounds 200m worth of aircraft and munitions the ministry decided not to replace. It also includes an estimated Pounds 336m worth of savings the ministry lost by having to defer cuts planned under its Options for Change programme. Against those costs, a total of Pounds 2.15bn has been received in cash contributions from allies, principally from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Germany and Japan. Almost Pounds 1bn was spent on procurement for the campaign, including special armament purchases, repairs and modifications to equipment. Transport of personnel and supplies alone cost Pounds 270m, and the forces ran up a Pounds 24m telecommunications bill. The watchdog says 19 of the 1,200 civilian vehicles leased or hired during Operation Granby - the British contribution to forces in the Gulf - have still not been traced. It acknowledges that the armed forces were faced with 'an enormous task' in planning and managing deployments on such a scale. It says that many early contracts in Saudi Arabia were 'drawn up by service personnel inexperienced in contractual issues and under operational pressures.' That included paying 'very large annual rents' totalling some Pounds 35m to secure property requirements. Ministry of Defence: The Costs and Receipts Arising from the Gulf Conflict.

By contrast, the Norwegian delegation stated that it was  disappointed by the EU's position on farming subsidies and  regretted that the Twelve were unable to reach a common position  on the thorny question of fishing, an essential economic  resource for Norway.    "We have achieved major progress on the question of capital  movements, secondary residences, and fishing, for which we have  obtained a transitional period equal to that granted to Spain  and Portugal," stated Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto.    On the other hand, invoking the extremely harsh climatic  conditions in Finland, the minister had asked the Twelve that  special arrangements in the matter of farm subsidies be extended  to Finnish agriculture as a whole, and not limited to farms  located beyond the 62d parallel.    He declared, however, he was satisfied by the Union's  proposal to create an "objective 6" allowing sparsely populated  areas to benefit from Community regional aid.    The Norwegians were much less enthusiastic. Trade and  Maritime Transportation Minister Grete Knudsen stuck to her  demand that the country's four Nordic regions benefit from  structural fund "objective 1," which is aimed in principle at  regions with a GDP below 75 percent of the Community average.  It was not possible to discuss this question on Tuesday, but  will undoubtedly be returned to the negotiating table when talks  resume in Brussels on Saturday for negotiations "to the finish."  The Greek presidency still aims to conclude the negotiations by  the scheduled 1 March deadline.    The fishing question also poses major problems. The Twelve  have not yet been able to adopt a common position on questions  of access to fishery product resources and markets. Spain  claims access to fish stocks in Norwegian waters, and France  demands guaranteed market access for eight sensitive categories  of fish, notably salmon, mackerel, herring, and shrimp.    EU ministers will meet on Friday evening in order to try to  arrive at a common position allowing them to negotiate on this  sensitive subject with Norway on Saturday.    Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who is presiding  over the negotiations, stated he was "much more optimistic than  a few days ago" on the chances of concluding negotiations by the  date set.</p>

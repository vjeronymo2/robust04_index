			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Observer: Grave return Betting on celebrity deaths is a bigger sport than Observer realised. Since yesterday's note concerning the New York commodity traders who wager on the Great Beyond, the postbag has been brimming with regional variations. An English version 'differing in matters of taste and concern for fair play' is proving popular at a merchant bank in London which for some reason asks to remain nameless. Inclusion of the Queen Mum is off limits, of course, and it goes without saying that no money is involved. 'One plays the game for its own sake.'

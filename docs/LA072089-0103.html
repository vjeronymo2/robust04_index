			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILFREDO GOMEZ SPURS COMEBACK BY SCORING A KNOCKOUT IN SECOND  </P> <P> Former three-time world champion Wilfredo Gomez of Puerto Rico overcame a  sluggish first round to stop Mexican journeyman Mario Salazar in the second  round of their lightweight bout Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Gomez, attempting to win a world title in his fourth weight class, was sent to  the ropes early in the second round as Salazar tried to take advantage of  Gomez's recent ring inactivity.  </P> <P> But Gomez (44-3-1), who hadn't fought in a year, was able to counterpunch off  the ropes.  </P> <P> A short right floored Salazar (28-11) midway through the round and Gomez sent  his opponent to the canvas twice more before the bout was stopped at 1:45 of  the round.  </P> <P> "I know my time away from the ring hurt me tonight," Gomez said. "At first, a  few months ago I was weighing 180 pounds and had to lose more than 40 pounds to  make the weight (139) tonight."  </P> <P> Gomez held the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight title from 1977 to 1983.  He also held the WBC featherweight title and the World Boxing Assn.  junior-lightweight championship, but was retired nearly two years before he  returned last July.  </P> <P> Gomez said he wants a title shot against WBA lightweight champion Edwin Rosario  early next year.  </P> <P> "To fight Rosario, I'm going to need to be in the best condition of my career,"  Gomez said.  </P> <P> Gomez was scheduled to fight Arturo Hernandez, but Hernandez pulled out because  of a hand injury.  </P></p>

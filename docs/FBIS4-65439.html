			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Saarland will not deport  any Kurds who originate from southeastern Turkey until further  notice. This was announced by State Interior Minister Friedel  Laepple (Social Democratic Party [SPD]), on Wednesday [18 May].  He stressed on Saarlaendischer Rundfunk that Saarland supports  the halt to deportations which the SPD-governed states of  Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein have decided on.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ulises Canales] </F>   [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- American members of the  Venceremos Brigade today accused the U.S. media of manipulation  and lack of objectivity in reporting issues related to Cuba's  current status.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ayda Lucero, an activist of  the Venceremos Brigade National Committee, pointed out that U.S  newspapers and radio and television stations normally report the  difficulties the island is going through, yet fail to provide  in-depth reports on issues such as the economic blockade and  Washington's hostility toward Havana.    Lucero, a member of the Brigade's 25th contingent who  arrived  yesterday in Havana from Mexico, described the lack of  objectivity and misleading information on Cuba's status.  According to Lucero, the reports ignore satisfactory conditions  in areas such as health, education, social security, and  employment.    The group, which includes 142 persons, stated that its  objective is to challenge regulations restricting U.S. citizens  from freely traveling to Cuba. In addition, it plans to urge an  end to the economic restrictions affecting Cuba for the past  three decades.    In this respect, Lucero pointed to the growing movement  within the United States favoring normalized relations between  both countries, which, she said, includes the Solidarity with  Cuba National Network organizations. In addition, she also  mentioned some Cuban-Americans who help to let the truth be  known about Cuba.    In her opinion, U.S. citizens and the Cuban community in the  United States are also suffering the consequences of the  blockade. Members of the latter group are prevented from  traveling, seeing their relatives, or having close ties with the  land in which they were born.    That is why, she added, I, as well as the other brigade  members, agree with having The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference, which the Foreign Ministry organized to find  mechanisms of understanding between the government and  expatriate Cubans, take place in Havana.    Ayda Lucero was also in Cuba this past October as part of a  group of U.S. pacifists who support the "freedom to travel"  project. In a gesture of solidarity, she then decided to spend  her honeymoon in this country despite pressures and penalties  she may encounter, which according to current U.S. legal  provisions could range from fines of up to $250,000 and prison  sentences of up to 10 years.</p>

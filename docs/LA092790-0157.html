			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAND JURY WON'T RULE ON PARKING GARAGE DISPUTE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Grand Jury has decided not to get involved in a  longstanding dispute between Monterey Park and several residents over a parking  garage, city officials announced.  </P> <P> In July, the City Council asked the Grand Jury to look into residents'  complaints that a new parking structure at Garvey Medical Center violates the  city's three-story maximum for that area.  </P> <P> City officials say it is legal because it is a parking structure, not a  commercial building, and is exempt from the three-story rule.  </P> <P> But the Grand Jury's government operations committee said that although it  found no misconduct when the city approved construction of the parking garage,  ruling on its legality is not within its jurisdiction, Mayor Judy Chu said.  Grand Jury officials could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Herve Algalarrondo: "The Confusion of Headmaster </F> Balladur"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] It was a prime minister  singularly ignorant of French passions that was present all  through the remake of the school war [reform of the Falloux law  providing for state financing of private schools]. Of course,  Balladur can argue that he did not like the reform. He gave into  his majority. But the lay torrent that was unleashed plunged him  into an abyss of perplexity. An eminently reasonable man,  Balladur is fearful of the irruption of the irrational in the  political debate.    The mastery of communication skills he has shown since March  1993 has obscured the fact that the prime minister is a neophyte  in politics. Unlike Francois Mitterrand or [Rally for the  Republic leader] Jacques Chirac, he lacks decades spent in the  provinces in his background. His knowledge of France is not  carnal. A simple councilman in Paris, he cannot even be seen as  really locally chosen. Outside ministerial cabinets, Balladur  has only frequented the world of the companies. [passage omitted]    Today, Balladur has learned to consult polls. But let their  predictions not come true, and the prime minister finds himself  without a compass.    All the more so since he has formed a cabinet in his image.  While agile spirits abound around him, most are known for their  total lack of knowledge of the terrain. A very "Balladurian"  minister noted last week that the "Matignon" [prime minister's  office] lacks one or two experienced men who would anticipate  low blows. Such sentinels would be useful because, contrary to  common belief, Balladur grants a lot of freedom to his flock.  Because he has learned to like television platforms and eclipsed  the government, some people deduced that the ministers were only  shadows. Wrong: they have regained a power lost since Pompidou.  A member of a ministerial cabinet under Giscard d'Estaing notes:  "At that time, a minister was unable to promise a cent without  the green light of an Elysee [president's office] adviser. On  the contrary, Balladur has let his ministers become responsible.  He trusts us."    The prime minister told the members of his cabinet that they  should not be replacements for the government. He himself opted  for rather loose control. Balladur preaches  "interministeriality." In his view, the prime minister's  intervention is only justified if there is a conflict between  two ministers.    But let a minister propose an apparently well-planned  project  and claim it can be carried out, and Balladur easily gives the  green light. [passage omitted] This is one of the main reasons  for the infatuation numerous ministers feel for their leader.  They have the feeling of being real bosses, not just simple  cogs. But it is surely also one of the reasons for the  dysfunctions noted in the government's action in the last nine  months: the absence of a filter. An absence all the more  damaging given that a number of ministers have revealed  themselves to be inexperienced, if not downright deficient. With  the Matignon's lack of flair, this will probably remain the main  lesson of the Falloux episode: Professor Balladur is singularly  lax with his small governmental class.</p>

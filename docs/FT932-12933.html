			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Daf vans plant to be sold to MBO team A MANAGEMENT buy-out team from Leyland Daf Vans reached agreement with the administrative receivers at the weekend to take over the Birmingham-based van operations of the failed Dutch commercial vehicle maker. A separate management buy-out of Leyland Daf's truck factory in Lancashire is also expected to be announced this week, securing the plant's remaining 900 jobs. The van deal is supported by funding of around Pounds 45m, including equity support from a venture capital consortium led by 3i, UK government financial aid including regional selective assistance, and bank facilities provided mainly by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The total funding includes the purchase price, working capital, and financing of dealer stocks. Equity in the venture is understood to total around Pounds 7.5m in both ordinary and redeemable preference shares. The deal marks the first rescue of part of the Leyland Daf truck and van operations in the UK, which plunged into receivership at the beginning of February as part of the financial collapse of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker. Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen, one of the joint receivers, said the rescue of the van operations had 'put a whole corner of the (Leyland Daf) jigsaw firmly into place'. The MBO has saved around 975 jobs at the Birmingham plant, with workers agreeing to a pay cut as part of the rescue. Separate negotiations are under way for the rescue of the other parts of the failed UK Leyland Daf business including the Multipart parts warehouse and distribution operation at Chorley, Lancashire, the Albion axle and components plant at Glasgow, the marketing and sales operation at Thame, Oxfordshire, and the individual international businesses in several African countries. The rescue marks a more interventionist approach by the UK government. The deal has received UK state funding both through regional selective assistance totalling around Pounds 4m from the Department of Trade and Industry, and through additional finance of Pounds 4m provided to the Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation to purchase 42 acres of surplus land at the Leyland Daf van plant site at Washwood Heath in east Birmingham. The business plan prepared by the MBO team is far more modest than the failed van strategy developed by Daf in the wake of its takeover of the former Freight Rover van operations in 1987 as part of its acquisition of Leyland Vehicles. The MBO team plans to concentrate on the sale of basic, low-cost utility panel vans to large UK fleet customers. Trucks buy-out near, Page 18</p>

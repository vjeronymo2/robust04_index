			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: I don't like this white wine but . . . - Sauvignon Blanc does have infinite possibilities at this time of year I do not like Sauvignon Blanc. That is my official position and, being one of those annoying people who can usually see both sides of every argument, the silver lining in every cloud, etc, I do rather cherish this, my only wine prejudice. But even I have to admit that at this time of year, or at least in very hot weather, the uncomplicated, nose-clearing, whistle-whetting, disarmingly simple aromatic acidity of Sauvignon Blanc comes into its own. It may not be complicated and intriguing, but who, when hot and fractious, needs complication and intrigue? The piercing perfume of gooseberries, currant bushes and cats pee will do the trick. Fortunately, there are relatively cheap, perfectly acceptable Sauvignons in the shops at the moment. The classic choice was always Sancerre or Pouilly-Fume, but in my recent experience it is usually necessary to buy the very best (such as Henri Bourgeois's Sancerre and Didier Dageneau's Pouilly-Fume) to get a thrill to match the price. Much better value than most classic Loire Sauvignons are those made by the best-known 'flying winemakers' (who, since they have been accused of making all wines taste the same - wrongly in my view - are now busy repudiating the term). Domaine St Francois Sauvignon Blanc 1993, just Pounds 3.25 from Asda for example, is a fragrant, lively, very slightly fizzy, New World sort of wine made by Hugh Ryman at the Foncalieu co-op in the Languedoc. His Entre-Deux-Mers, Duras and Bergerac bottlings are also trustworthy, if a little more expensive. Jacques Lurton's Sauvignon Blanc Rueda 1993 is a defiantly pungent example of the variety from north central Spain, sold by Sainsbury's at Pounds 3.99 and Oddbins at Pounds 4.29. Peter Bright's Bright Brothers Ribatejo Sauvignon Blanc 1993 (Pounds 3.39 Sainsbury's) is not nearly as dramatic but tastes pure, lively and entirely unexpected from Portugal, (Sainsbury's Chilean Sauvignon at the same price is, on the other hand, pure tom cat to me). Racy, appetising winemaking techniques are now much easier to find in south west France, where there is a vast acreage of Sauvignon Blanc (and Semillon) just waiting to be transformed into user-friendly refreshment. Safeway's Bergerac Sauvignon 1993, at Pounds 3.49, is a fruity, please-all example from the Sigoules co-op, surely known personally to a few Dordogne-visiting FT readers. Safeway also has Ch de Plantier 1993 Entre-Deux-Mers at Pounds 3.79 as an encouraging, well-balanced example of the miracles that have been wrought on dry white bordeaux very recently. Lots of Sauvignon flavour has been leeched into this wine which is bolstered by the body of Semillon. Neither of these wines is nearly as exciting as Waitrose's best two dry white bordeaux, however. Ch de Haut Rian 1993 Bordeaux at Pounds 3.99 is even better than Michel Dietrich's 1992 made in the Premieres Cotes de Bordeaux. Another Pounds 2.46 buys real class in the form of Ch Carsin 1992 Cuvee prestige 1992, available at the top 85 Sainsbury's for Pounds 5.45. It is an intriguing oak-matured dry white bordeaux made by Australian Amanda Jones. Lively, scented, delicate fruit deepened but not overwhelmed by top quality oak. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is another obvious choice, although only Montana can provide a consistent product for fans of the tinned asparagus style for less than Pounds 5. Top bottlings include Cloudy Bay, Hunters, Jackson Estate, Vavasour, and Wairau River. They usually sell in the Pounds 27 to Pounds 29 range and are more usually found at independent merchants than in the chains because of the quantities available, although Thresher, Bottoms up and Wine Rack have a better selection than most. South African Sauvignon can be extremely punchy. The allocation of Mulderbosch at John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727 6846) is worth seeking out, at around Pounds 90 a case. But there is a host of wines other than Sauvignon capable of providing the same refreshing effect. Vinho Verde from northern Portugal, Albarino from Spain's Atlantic coast are obvious possibilities. Bottoms Up lists the nervy, sought-after Rias Baixas Albarino, Lagar de Cervera 1993 at Pounds 8.49. And then, if it is high acid and refreshing aroma you are after, there is that grape they call Riesling . . . the under-used resource of the wine world. Thanks to turmoil in the German fine wine market, there are some stunning German wine bargains around. Perhaps best value is Asda's Hochheimer Holle Riesling 1992 Aschrott at Pounds 4.99. It is not bone dry, more like zesty grapefruit, but would make great sipping in hot weather. Waitrose is selling Erdener Treppchen Riesling Spatlese 1986 Monchhof for only Pounds 5.95, presumably because Monchhof has been particularly keen to sell. Winemaking wizard Ernie Loosen has now taken over these vineyards. The previous owners have given up the struggle to make these superb vineyards pay. Delicate, mature, light, refreshing essence of top quality middle Mosel; you would not find a fine, eight-year-old chardonnay at less than three times this price.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Mortgage interest tax relief is cut MORTGAGE LENDERS and housebuilders greeted the chancellor's measures to limit mortgage interest tax relief next year, while doubling stamp duty threshold immediately, with cautious approval and relief that changes were not more severe. Building societies had feared a more decisive move against mortgage interest tax relief, but said they believed the delay in the move to next year would limit any potential to depress transactions in a fragile housing market. The doubling of the stamp duty threshold to Pounds 60,000 follows a temporary abolition of stamp duty at the end of 1991, which was judged a failure because it led only to a temporary surge in transactions followed by a steep fall. Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, said the limitation of tax relief was 'not unexpected'. The delay would allow time to re-adjust to the Pounds 10 increase in most borrowers' monthly payments. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said a phased withdrawal of mortgage tax relief would lead to 'a more equitable and rational balance of UK housing subsidies and encourage greater mobility'. He said the society believed the proposals would 'give short-term encouragement to the housing market and continue the gradual approach to structural reform'. Mr Roger Boyes, executive director of Leeds Permanent Building Society, said permanent adjustment of stamp duty had been wanted by the industry for a long time. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, said the measures were 'about the best we could have hoped for. The changes in tax relief system will only have a small impact, and will be more than offset by raising of the threshold.' Wimpey, the UK's second largest housebuilder, which yesterday announced a Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss for 1992, said its house sales had risen by a third in the first 10 weeks compared with the corresponding period last year. Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said that there did not appear to be anything in the Budget 'to stand in the way of the first flickers of recovery in the market place'. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which represents 8,000 estate agents, said the raising of the stamp duty threshold would 'boost the housing market, particularly among first-time buyers - who hold the key to revival'.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> $25 MILLION IN POT SEIZED  </P> <P> Federal and county agents seized 8,049 marijuana plants with a potential value  of $25 million in a Placer County barn and made two arrests in what they  described as the largest indoor pot-growing raid in California history. Bob  Burns of the Placer County Narcotics Task Force said the barn had all the  latest technology for indoor growing, including fluorescent grow lights and  fans to replace carbon dioxide with fresh air. Arrested were Timothy Edward  Wolford, 26, and Cheryl Marie Chrisman, 25. They were charged with suspicion of  cultivating marijuana and possession of marijuana for sale. Chrisman's father,  Richard, 47, was being sought for questioning.  </P></p>

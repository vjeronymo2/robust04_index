"As soon as the man pulled out the pistol, the crowd rushed  towards him and pushed the pistol barrel towards the air as a  result of which four bullets were fired which hit the ceiling of  the shrine," Major Mohammad Panahi said.    The incident took place when President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani was addressing a large crowd of people on the  occasion of the beginning of the ten-day-dawn celebrations  marking the 15th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic  revolution. After being disarmed, the man was dragged out of the  shrine and handed over to Law Enforcement Forces.    The officer, who is in charge of providing security for the  revolution victory celebrations at the shrine of Imam Khomeyni,  lauded the people for their quick reaction and vigilance. "In  fact, the Iranian people are the main protectors of the Islamic  revolution and republic," the officer said.    After the shooting incident, the crowd chanted "Death to the  U.S," and "Death to Hypocrites" a term used for members of the  terrorist Mujahideen Khalq organization.</p>

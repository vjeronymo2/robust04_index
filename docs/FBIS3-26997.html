But the unofficial wink  at the new primary school -- intended for the children of Taiwan  investors in the area -- was obtained only on condition that the  Shenzhen government appoint the headmaster.    Taiwan's national flag and song will be forbidden. Set to  open next year with about 200 students, the school has become a  symbol of the sensitive nature of cross-straits relations.    The head of Shenzhen's Taiwan business association, Wu  Sheng-shun, spent a year convincing Beijing that primary schools  were no threat to communism.    "I told them that up to lower middle school, education has  no  political implications," he said.    The school will be allowed to use Taiwan teachers and  schoolbooks, provided they are screened beforehand. But Beijing  has warned that teachers must avoid spreading "political and  ideological influences".    Wu needed longer to convince Taipei, where education  officials feared the pupils might be polluted by communism. But  last week he won guarantees that the students would be able to  enter middle school in Taiwan automatically, without any testing.    In a symbolic tit-for-tat, Taipei demanded assurances that  the mainland teachers at the school would not teach simplified  Chinese characters, which the Communists introduced to fight  illiteracy.    Education is not the only reason for setting up the Shenzhen  school, which will be enclosed in a compound with 210 luxury  homes for the families of students.    Taiwan investors on the mainland, especially those in  Guangdong, have suffered from countless kidnappings, robberies  and beatings in recent years. Security and comfort will be  assured inside the fortified compound.    "I've been living in my factory ever since I came here six  years ago," said Wu, whose company makes bicycles. "There's  nowhere else safe at the moment."    After the school is built, at least some of the 10,000-odd  Taiwan managers and technicians working in Shenzhen and Dongguan  will find safety in numbers. "We'll all be together. That's  one of the main benefits," Wu said.    But, to Beijing, that is one of the dangers. The  establishment of Taiwan-run organisations in the mainland has  long been blocked for fear they may become touchstones for  pro-Nationalist, or at least anti-Communist, sentiments. Taiwan  business groups are required to have a mainland Chinese as head.    Beijing's approval for the Shenzhen school appears to be  part  of its courtship of Taiwan investors, many of whom are reluctant  to bring their wives and children to the mainland.    Wu says it was the lure of more Taiwan investment that won  the school the support of the head of the Chinese Communist  Party's Taiwan Affairs Office, Wang Zhaoguo, whom he met in  November.    "I told him that if you want to improve conditions for  Taiwan  investors, you had better pay attention to the Taiwanese men in  their thirties and forties, whose children are still young," Wu  said.    Taiwan officials, led by the secretary-general of Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation, Li Ching-ping, will visit the  mainland next month to discuss primary schools with Beijing.    Wu says if the Shenzhen school proves a success, other  mainland cities could have Taiwan-run primary schools.</p>

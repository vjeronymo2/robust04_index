			<p>BFN     [Text] Valeriy Eksuzian, Director General of the Russian  Airlines (RAL), told Interfax that the crew of the A-310-300  airliner was not to blame for the crash in the vicinity of  Mezhdurechensk on March 22. Nevertheless, Eksuzian emphasized,  it would be premature to make any final conclusions. What  happened immediately before the crash could not be determined  before the "black boxes" are completely decoded. That  information must be brought from Paris to Moscow by members of  the investigating commission.    Eksuzian believed that two or three days might be needed to  have the full story known and determine the cause of the crash.  What data was available now suggested that the situation was  highly complicated.    From the analysis of the radio exchange, "the plane started  to act in ways which were not programmed into the autopilot.  Judging by their exclamations, the crew was initially greatly  surprised." Then the plane suddenly turned left and continued  spontaneous maneuvers which resulted in an abrupt plunge and the  eventual crash.    The whole chain of events took two minutes and 13 seconds.  The navigation equipment did not allow for sudden left turns of  the plane. Eksuzian said, however, that no conclusions could be  made at this moment. He said that the investigation had been  joined by test pilots of the Gromov Institute in the town of  Zhukovskiy, Moscow Region. It is not until the conclusions made  by the test pilots and the investigation commission members are  compared with the decoded data of the "black boxes" that a final  judgement could be made. Eksuzian described as crude  falsification the report of the French TF-1 channel which had  quoted an anonymous witness as saying that none of the crew  members had been present in the cockpit immediately before the  crash. Eksuzian also said that a chemical analysis of internal  organ and brain tissues of the crew had shown a high, about six  percent, content of carbon monoxide. The gas had also been  found in three or four passengers. The causes of this remained  unknown, Eksuzian said.    As of today, 45 out of the 63 bodies of passengers have been  identified. A total of 75 passengers and crew were killed in  the crash of the plane en route from Moscow to Hongkong.</p>

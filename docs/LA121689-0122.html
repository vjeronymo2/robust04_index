			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TONY EASON RELUCTANTLY ASSUMES ROLE AS JETS' STARTING QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Tony Eason, the former New England Patriots quarterback who at first refused to  sign with the New York Jets six weeks ago because of his close friendship with  Ken O'Brien, the Jets' No. 1 quarterback, reacted with reluctance Friday when  it became obvious that he would start against the Los Angeles Rams Sunday.  </P> <P> "We're leaning to Eason right now," a seemingly dispirited Coach Joe Walton  said as he walked toward the practice field. "They (O'Brien and backup Pat  Ryan) will probably both be ready Sunday, but they haven't had a lot of work  and they're banged up a little bit."  </P> <P> Eason didn't come right out and say he didn't want to start, but he wasn't  exactly thrilled by the prospect of his first start as a Jet. He acted like  someone who had more to lose than gain. He refused to say it might affect his  future, but it appears he doesn't want to look bad in case the Jets make a  coaching change.  </P> <P> "I have mixed feelings," Eason said. "Our best chance of winning is if Kenny  plays, or Pat. Everybody realizes that it's just a tough situation. It's  different in this league. It's not like baseball; you don't come in and take  your at-bats, and that's it. People just take it for granted, but you got to  know your plays, and if you have to think about your offense, it takes away  from what you have to do."  </P> <P> In other words, Eason feels he should be so familiar with the Jets' offense and  the defense they're facing, that he doesn't have to think twice about things  that come naturally to seasoned quarterbacks. But it appears he'll be thrown  into the fray.  </P> <P> Walton uncharacteristically brushed by the media as they waited for him. When  told that Eason appeared reluctant to play, he said, "He knows enough of the  offense. He hasn't had a lot of work and a lot of repetitions, but he's  concentrating on a specific game plan."  </P> <P> "As for my playing," Eason said, "my main goal is to get the play called in the  huddle. That's not a good way to start things off."  </P> <P> Eason last played against the Rams during the Patriots' 1985 Super Bowl season.  He threw a "Hail Mary" pass that was caught by Irving Fryar for the winning  touchdown. "I can still see Stanley Morgan jumping eight feet in the air, at  least it seems like that, and tipping that ball to Fryar," Eason said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ryan, who left practice Thursday after experiencing headaches  related to his sixth concussion in 12 seasons as a Jet, was upgraded to  probable. He said he felt fine and could play if needed.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Jets owner Leon Hess and team president Steve Gutman were expected to meet with  Patriots director of player development Dick Steinberg this weekend regarding  the Jets' general manager position.  </P> <P> Asked what it's like to play when changes appear inevitable, Pat Ryan said,  "Nobody knows what's going to happen. I have the same idea that everybody else  has: wait and see."  </P> <P> Wide receiver Al Toon, according to Walton, should start Sunday. Toon practiced  at full speed Friday after being upgraded from questionable to probable.  </P> <P> Guard Mike Haight (neck) was downgraded from questionable to doubtful, and will  be replaced by Dave Cadigan or Adam Schreiber.  </P></p>

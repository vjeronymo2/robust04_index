			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2,554-UNIT PROJECT OKD IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Thursday unanimously approved a  2,554-unit housing development in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The project is part of the Dale Poe Development Corp.'s plans to build at least  10,000 units in its giant Stevenson Ranch project west of the Golden State  Freeway and south of Six Flags Magic Mountain.  </P> <P> The area school districts dropped their opposition to the project after the  company agreed to donate land and cash to the schools worth $29.3 million.  </P> <P> Officials of the nearby city of Santa Clarita, however, testified on Thursday  against the proposal. They said the county was not requiring the company to  make enough provisions to handle the extra flow of traffic. Opponents also  wanted a new environmental impact report written, to replace one completed in  the mid-1980s.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ferai Tinc: "Green Light to </F> Massacre"--punctuation as published]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry disclosed  last week that he is opposed to intervention in Bosnia. He is  the person who is mainly responsible for the Serbian attacks on  Bosnia. Apparently, while attempting to have the peace agreement  between the Bosnians and Croatians implemented, the United  States has yielded to the blackmailing activities of the Serbs  to convince them to participate in the peace talks.    The UN officials moved to force the Serb troops, which  besieged Sarajevo, to withdraw some time ago. Meanwhile, they  warned the Serb armed units to lift their blockade against other  Bosnian cities, one of which was Gorazde. Later, that position  was completely abandoned. The Serb units shelled Gorazde's  suburbs with artillery guns for many days. The aggression  coincided with the arrival in Sarajevo of Serbian commanders to  hold talks with the Bosnian and Croatian representatives. The  Croatian, Bosnian, and Serb representatives were finalizing the  cease-fire agreement when exploding artillery shells resounded  from the direction of Gorazde last night. Obviously, the Serbs  employed the tactic they have used right from the beginning of  the war in Bosnia. Apparently, their principle is to occupy as  much territory as they can before a cease-fire agreement is put  into effect. In fact, they have gained from that approach  within a short period of time.    The Bosnian Serbs, who have taken over 70 percent of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, wish to use the question of territory as a  trump card when they finally agree to hold talks with the  Bosnian majority for a federation. They hope to use that trump  card to maintain an advantage in the talks that will be held on  the establishment of a federation and to demand concessions for  each and every inch of territory they will give back to the  Bosnians.    Whether or not the Serbs used chemical arms against Gorazde  was not established when this column was written. However, it  is a fact that the Islamic population in Bosnia has been  subjected to a major attack.    Turkey drew the international community's attention to the  developments in Gorazde during the past week. The Belgrade  Administration, which has moved to establish a high-level  dialogue with Turkey, was also cautioned on the matter.  However, the world preferred to seal its ears once again, and  Turkey was right again.    The way to bargain with an aggressor force is to employ  similar tactics. William Perry gave the "green light" to the  massacre by saying: "I will not allow even a single U.S.  aircraft to take off for Bosnia in the future."    Let us wait and see how he will account for that.</p>

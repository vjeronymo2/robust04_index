The POO describes the proposed mining development activities and operational and reclamation procedures for the DASH Mining Project. The proposal includes developing two open pits and mining of reserves by underground methods. Waste rock dumps, soil stockpiles, pit backfills, ore stockpiles, haul roads and support facilities would also be developed. Ore would be processed at the existing Jerritt Canyon Millsite located on BLM administered lands adjacent to the project site. The proposal would affect approximately 700 acres of public and private lands. Preliminary internal scoping has identified several issues which would be addressed in the analysis process. The following list of issues is not intended to be all inclusive. They are: impacts to ground and surface water resources; impacts to grazing resources; impacts to Waters of the United States including wetlands; mine economics; threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and wildlife species; and visual resources. These issues and any others identified during the scoping process may be used to develop alternatives to the proposed action. In addition, the No Action alternative will be considered in the analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public participation is important during the EIS scoping process. As part of the scoping process, the Forest Service will be seeking information and comments from Federal, State, County and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed actions. This input will be used in the preparation of the draft EIS and final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several government agencies will be invited to participate in this project as cooperating or participating agencies. These agencies include, but are not limited to, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Nevada Division of Wildlife, and Elko County Board of Commissioners. In addition to the Plan of Operations, various Federal, State, and local permits and licenses may be required to implement the proposed action. These may include, but are not limited to, a Section 404 permit, Water Pollution Control Permit, Reclamation Permit for Mining Operations, and a General Discharge Permit for Stormwater. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service is the lead agency for this project and R.M. ``Jim'' Nelson, Acting Forest Supervisor of the Humboldt National Forest is the responsible official. He will make a decision to approve the proposed Plan of Operations or one of the alternatives analyzed. IMC's rights under the 1872 Mining Law as amended, applicable Forest Service regulations and the Humboldt National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (1986) will be taken into account throughout the analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and be available for review in June of 1995. At that time, EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the Draft EIS will be at least 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated or discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> R.M. ``Jim'' Nelson, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Forest Supervisor, Humboldt National Forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28237 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

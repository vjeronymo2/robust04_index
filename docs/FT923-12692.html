			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Disappointment follows the brief honeymoon - But UK savers can still earn 9 per cent on fixed income investments, with inflation only 4 per cent / Keynote IT WAS a nice honeymoon, while it lasted. But somehow the same old economic problems have remained to perplex the new John Major government on its return to power. So the second quarter in the financial markets ended on a disappointing note, especially given that it had begun so ecstatically after the unexpected outright Conservative victory on April 9. Certainly, the month after the election was highly bullish. The London stock market leapt back to life, fuelled by hopes that the return of the Tories would boost business and consumer confidence and jolt the British economy back to life. From a low of 2382.7 on April 3 the FT-SE 100 Index advanced to an all-time peak of 2737.8 on May 11, a gain of nearly 15 per cent. The rise in share prices was boosted on May 5 by a post-election cut of  1/2 per cent to 10 per cent in sterling short-term interest rates, reflecting the British currency's much stronger position within the European exchange rate mechanism. Meanwhile, the authorities got on energetically with the task of selling the huge volume of gilt-edged securities needed to finance the projected government deficit. A public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn is officially forecast for 1992-93, and even more next year. As the recession bites deeper, moreover, many outside forecasters are increasing their estimates of just how big these deficits will turn out to be in the next few years. In post-election conditions, however, the Bank of England, as the Treasury's agent in the gilt-edged market, was able to get busy with bond sales, starting with a Pounds 1.6bn surge on election night itself. There have subsequently been several individual auctions of up to Pounds 2.75bn of gilts, and it is estimated that the Bank sold about Pounds 12.5bn gross of bonds in the April-June quarter. The government has also given the orders for National Savings to go out on an aggressive sales drive in the retail market place. Thus National Savings has been pulling in about Pounds 400m a month recently, enough to embarrass the building societies which, in a very tough housing market, are finding it difficult to compete for funds. But as the stock market boom continued into May, cracks began to appear in the enthusiasm of investors. It became clear that company results were coming in below expectations. Economic statistics were disappointing, and the fall in the first quarter's national income turned out to have been worse than expected at 0.5 per cent for the quarter and 1.5 per cent over twelve months. The 'green shoots' of recovery had failed to appear. By the end of May, the full disaster of the Canary Wharf project became apparent as the development followed its Canadian parent Olympia &amp; York into bankruptcy. Overseas, the Tokyo market began to resume its devastating fall, reaching a level some 60 per cent below its all-time high at the beginning of 1990. Not that Tokyo's agony has had much impact on markets elsewhere, and indeed Wall Street managed to struggle to a new all-time peak at the beginning of June. But that was only on the basis of the 30 constituents of the Dow Jones Average, and the more broadly-based equity market US indices have remained below their January highs. Closer to home, German overheating remained a big problem and hopes of further interest rate cuts within the ERM have faded badly. Then, at the beginning of June, came a bolt from the blue: the Danes narrowly rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum. Expectations of a steady advance by European Community member states towards monetary union were suddenly dashed. Sterling was one of the currencies to suffer as the Deutsche Mark once again strengthened. Finally, at the end of June, the former prime minister Lady Thatcher delivered another blow to confidence in the pound, by attacking Maastricht and saying there could be no economic recovery for the UK while interest rates were held so high by the requirements of the ERM. All in all, June was a bad month for the markets. While the currency and gilts came under pressure, the stock market too was troubled. Over-optimism about prospects became exposed as leading companies like ICI and Pilkington warned that no recovery was in sight. Big new issues planned in a more buoyant period, or postponed until after the election, arrived just as sentiment crumbled; the Pounds 430m GPA flotation had to be embarrassingly abandoned at the very last moment on June 18. A boardroom upheaval on June 25 at troubled BP saw the share price tumble amidst fears of a slashed dividend. Suddenly the market began to fear a whole wave of dividend cuts as prudent distribution came back into fashion. By the end of the month, the Footsie index had lost about 8 per cent compared with the May high. However, there remained a small gain on the quarter as a whole. The rate of return - capital gain plus dividend income - on equities for a standard rate taxpayer for the three months was about 4 per cent. You would have done better in fixed-income securities, however. The return on 15-year gilts was about 9 per cent during the quarter. This continues a pattern which has been seen during the 1990s so far, that equities have proved to be disappointing and bonds have provided a better return. But even bonds have failed to match the outstanding investment returns which were seen during the 1980s. Little is likely to change. The British economy faces a long process of adjustment to lower inflation and lower levels of private debt. The world economy offers little hope of external assistance, with Japan running into trouble and the United States facing its own problems of too much debt and too little growth. The huge selling pressure from the Bank of England in the gilt-edged market will continue to dominate the investment scene. British companies are going to find it very hard to earn returns on capital which could enable them to pay the progressive dividends needed if the stock market is to perform strongly compared with gilts. Sterling may be marginally weak against the DM, but it is very strong against the dollar, so British companies are losing competitiveness in dollar markets. For the time being, the newly-elected government is under no significant pressure to do anything about the continuing recession. The second quarter GDP figures may show a marginal pick-up when they are eventually calculated in September, but independent economists now calculate that the British economy will show just about zero growth in 1992 as a whole. The near-term question is whether the government will announce major public spending cutbacks in order to prevent the public sector borrowing requirement from ballooning still further. Eventually there may be a more serious debate about whether the government should cut and run from the ERM, Thatcher-style. If this happens, it will have very important investment implications. But at present it is still scarcely above the horizon. For the moment, the stock market should be treated with caution, and investors should think themselves lucky that they can still earn 9 per cent on fixed income investments when inflation is only 4 per cent, and on a slowly falling trend.</p>

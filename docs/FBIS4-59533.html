			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Coordination Between Parties and the  Masses, Organizations, and Nationalist Citizens in Aden  Governorate has sent a telegram to brother Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Arab League. The  telegram calls on the secretary general and the Arab member  states to intervene, directly, effectively, and quickly in order  to halt the fighting between the Yemeni military forces and  secure towns and citizens from any acts of aggression. Also, it  asks the League to pave the way for the political forces to hold  dialogues about the implementation of the document of pledge and  accord, considering that that document is the sole solution, and  to seek a new formula for unity.    The telegram said it was necessary for the Council of  Coordination to address this direct call to the secretary  general of the Arab League at a time when Yemeni weapons were  being pointed at other Yemenis and when Yemen was being  destroyed and its people exterminated after the achievement of  unity.</p>

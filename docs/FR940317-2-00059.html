Section 1871(c) of the Social Security Act requires that we publish a list of Medicare issuances in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at least every 3 months. Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing, we are including all Medicaid issuances and Medicare and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed and final) published during this timeframe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are also providing the content of revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual published between October 1 and December 31, 1993. On August 21, 1989 (54 FR 34555), we published the content of the Manual and indicated that we will publish quarterly any updates. Adding to this listing the complete text of the changes to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual allows us to fulfill this requirement in a manner that facilitates identification of coverage and other changes in our manuals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret Cotton, (410) 966&hyph;5260 (For Medicare instruction information)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Walter Rutemueller, (410) 966&hyph;5395 (For Medicare coverage information)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pat Prete, (410) 965&hyph;3246 (For Medicaid instruction information)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jacqueline Kidd, (410) 966&hyph;4682 (For all other information)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Program Issuances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which pay for health care and related services for 36 million Medicare beneficiaries and 33 million Medicaid recipients. Administration of these programs involves (1) Providing information to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients, health care providers, and the public; and (2) effective communications with regional offices, State governments, State Medicaid Agencies, State Survey Agencies, various providers of health care, fiscal intermediaries and carriers who process claims and pay bills, and others. To implement the various statutes on which the programs are based, we issue regulations under authority granted the Secretary under sections 1102, 1871, and 1902 and related provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) and also issue various manuals, memoranda, and statements necessary to administer the programs efficiently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1871(c)(1) of the Act requires that we publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least every 3 months a list of all Medicare manual instructions, interpretive rules, statements of policy, and guidelines of general applicability not issued as regulations. We published our first notice June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21730). Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing of operational and policy statements, we are continuing our practice of including Medicare substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed and final) published during the 3-month timeframe. Since the publication of our quarterly listing on June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24797), we decided to add Medicaid issuances to our quarterly listings. Accordingly, we are listing in this notice Medicaid issuances and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations published from October 1 through December 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Medicare Coverage Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We receive numerous inquiries from the general public about whether specific items or services are covered under Medicare. Providers, carriers, and intermediaries have copies of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual, which identifies those medical items, services, technologies, or treatment procedures that can be paid for under Medicare. On August 21, 1989, we published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 34555) that contained all the Medicare coverage decisions issued in that manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In that notice, we indicated that revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual will be published at least quarterly in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . We also sometimes issue proposed or final national coverage decision changes in separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices. Readers should find this an easy way to identify both issuance changes to all our manuals and the text of changes to the Coverage Issues Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual are not published on a regular basis but on an as-needed basis. We publish revisions as a result of technological changes, medical practice changes, responses to inquiries we receive seeking clarifications, or the resolution of coverage issues under Medicare. If no Coverage Issues Manual revisions were published during a particular quarter, our listing will reflect that fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not all revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual contain major changes. As with any instruction, sometimes minor clarifications or revisions are made within the text. We have reprinted manual revisions as transmitted to manual holders. The new text is shown in italics. We will not reprint the table of contents, since the table of contents serves primarily as a finding aid for the user of the manual and does not identify items as covered or not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. How To Use the Addenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is organized so that a reader may review the subjects of all manual issuances, memoranda, substantive and interpretive regulations, or coverage decisions published during the timeframe to determine whether any are of particular interest. We expect it to be used in concert with previously published notices. Most notably, those unfamiliar with a description of our Medicare manuals may wish to review Table I of our first three notices (53 FR 21730, 53 FR 36891, and 53 FR 50577) and the notice published March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16837), and those desiring information on the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual may wish to review the August 21, 1989, publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To aid the reader, we have organized and divided this current listing into five addenda. Addendum I identifies updates that changed the Coverage Issues Manual. We published notices in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that included the text of changes to the Coverage Issues Manual. These updates, when added to material from the manual published on August 21, 1989, constitute a complete manual as of March 31, 1993. Parties interested in obtaining a copy of the manual and revisions should follow the instructions in section IV of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

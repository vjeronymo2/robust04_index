This  present would be the most suitable for the Navy, which has  somewhat under 19,000 personnel and is currently the branch of  service with the largest shortfall in technical investment.  Almost half of the 70 combatant units and about 60 auxiliary  units have by all possible yardsticks exceeded their service  lives, and, with an average age of 18 years, the shock core of  the force makes the Navy of the Republic of Poland the oldest in  the Baltic. In terms of personnel strength, our Navy is the  third largest, behind those of Russia and the Federal Republic  of Germany, but, in terms of equipment, it ranks next to last,  ahead of Finland's, not counting the "pocket" navies of  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.    There is little prospect for any radical improvement in the  situation because expansion, to say nothing of modernization, of  a fleet usually takes anywhere from 10 to 20 years in view of  the tremendous costs involved. And usually, as the last units of  the new generation are coming into service, the first are  nearing the end of their service life. The fleet modernization  program that was started in 1980 was gradually put on hold as  the crisis grew worse and ultimately fell victim to the  draconian budget cuts of recent years.    This neglect contributed to a drastic reduction in the  fighting power of the Navy of the Polish Republic, as is  especially evident now that we have to worry about defending our  borders ourselves. In any case, the aid from our recent ally  mainly took the form of deliveries of inferior-quality equipment  and the imposition on us of the offensive doctrine of the Warsaw  Pact. According to its precepts, a disproportionately large  amphibious group numbering 40 units (23 landing craft and 17  cutters) was set up, whose mission, together with the East  German Volksmarine [People's Navy] and the Baltic Fleet, was to  seize the Danish Straits. Today all that is left of that  impressive armada is the solitary ORP [Ship of the Polish  Republic] Grunwald, but the money spent on those "amphibious  forces" still haunts the remaining forces of the Polish Navy.    In conformity with this same doctrine, during the latter  half  of the 1970's the coast guard removed the coastal artillery  batteries deployed at Miedzyzdroje, Kolobrzeg, Ustka, Gdynia,  Wisloujscie, Rozewie, and Hel Peninsula, and the Sopka  shore-to-ship missiles that were expended were not replaced.    According to the prevailing naval doctrine, a small, closed  body of water such as the Baltic requires the use of fast,  powerful weapon systems, as well as compact units, small  submarines, enhanced mine-warfare forces, and modern naval  aviation. Specialists have a saying that the best type of naval  unit for the Baltic is really...an aircraft. Unfortunately,  right now we can only dream of creating a real naval aviation  force. No one can take seriously the sale of 30 obsolete  MiG-21's and An-2 reconnaissance biplanes. The only modern  element is 10 Mi-14 PL antisubmarine helicopters. Four other  Mi-14's, along with four Anacondas (a variation of the famous  Sokol) and several obsolete Mi-2RM's comprise the  search-and-rescue flotilla. To set up a search-and-rescue  station on the western coast, the need for which was forcefully  demonstrated by the disaster of the ferry Jan Heweliusz, the  purchase of additional Anacondas is needed. There is no chance  of this, however, without special budgetary assistance, because  the Navy cannot afford to maintain a naval rotary-wing  search-and-rescue system on its own. In spite of the meager  resources, the cooperation between the Navy and the national  manufacturers of aviation equipment is good, increasing the  chances of the survival of the defense plants. In the very near  future, this may lead to series production of the patrol version  of the An-28 Bryz, produced in Mielec, and the combat sister of  the Anaconda from Swidnik, equipped for conducting antisubmarine  search operations.    Warships are the heart of a Navy, however. The flagship of  the Polish Navy, the destroyer Warszawa, is a large unit but is  equipped with basic weaponry and electronics that date back to  the late 1950's. Because today it is not the calibers and  numbers of the guns and missiles but, rather, the parameters of  the combat electronics, the ranges of the radars, the weaponry  reaction time from the instant the enemy is detected until the  unit opens fire, and the resistance of the electronics to enemy  jamming that are decisive as regards the combat value of a  warship. Otherwise, its role is reduced to that of conducting  training and ceremonial duties. The counterpart units of this  warship, which was finished in 1970 as the Smielyj, have now  been decommissioned from the Russian Navy.    The only modern submarine (ORP Orzel) is basically too large  for the Baltic, but the two other submarines and two-thirds of  the missile ships are basically museum pieces. The others,  despite their good speed and excellent handling characteristics,  are of low fighting quality due to the purchase of substandard  electronics and a shortage of specialists. The reduction in the  basic military obligation for the Navy did not help at all. It  takes years to train specialists in this highly technical branch  of the armed forces. The now-common practice of contract-based  service is turning out to be the best and most cost-effective  way of professionalizing the crews. We are, however, far below  the standard of, for example, the Bundesmarine [German Navy]  where draftees make up only 29 percent of the personnel  strength, contract personnel account for 46 percent, and 25  percent are professionals.    The newest motor torpedo boat, Orkan, admittedly has a full  and highly qualified crew (of 36 hands, 22 are cadre) but does  not have such a basic item of weaponry as antiship missiles. The  Russians do not want to supply the Urans that it had promised,  we cannot afford the ones from the West, and installing the  obsolete and jamming-prone Styx missiles that have been used on  the other ships makes no sense, either.    The complement for hunting submarines numbers 20 units "on  paper." Unfortunately, 19 of these vessels are worn out or  small, and, during a "surge," only two can be used to chase  submarines--the Warszawa and the really substandard patrol  corvette Kaszub.    As far as minesweepers, or ships that are designed for  clearing mines from sea lanes, are concerned, we have 25.  Because they are limited to operating under sea conditions of no  more than 3 on the Beaufort scale, 15 of the new vessels with  nonmagnetic plastic hulls are suited for the Gdansk Bay and the  Szczecin Straits rather than the high seas. Because of wear and  tear and the development of mine weapons, the rest are virtually  worthless. To supplement the regular minesweepers, two fishing  trawlers have been adapted for mine-hunting tasks. If need be,  there is the possibility of mobilizing 70 similar fishing  vessels. Compared to the warships, the force of  search-and-rescue, auxiliary, and special-purpose ships is  relatively new and fairly well equipped.    Of the Z3.8 trillion allocated this year for the purchase of  equipment and weaponry for all branches of the armed forces,  more than half has to go to the purchase of spare parts and the  complete overhaul of equipment. The sum of Z3.8 trillion will  purchase three-quarters of a submarine of the Kilo class (ORP  Orzel), but the needs of the Navy are only a fraction of that  amount. The services must carefully husband their resources in  order to cover the costs of commissioning the motor torpedo boat  Huragan and two minesweepers at about Z180 billion apiece and  still put resources toward the purchase of the above-mentioned  missile system. Next year, the last in the motor torpedo boat  series and possibly two minesweepers will be completed. There is  no way to hope for anything more than that. To be sure,  consideration was being given to the possibility of immediately  making up for the shortfalls through the purchase, if available,  of East German corvettes, but the Germans torpedoed the deal by  inflating the price and, subsequently, some of the ships were  sold to Indonesia.    Since the change in the geopolitical situation, there is no  longer any pressure to rely on the services of a single  exporter, the former Soviet Union. The switch to calculating in  dollars, quality that is below world standards, and the  inability to guarantee the continuity of deliveries of spare  parts for equipment that is already in use are making the CIS  [Commonwealth of Independent States] a less than reliable  partner. In view of the high prices, it does not appear feasible  to import finished warships from the highly developed countries.  A kilogram of warship minus combat equipment and electronics,  costs more than 100 German marks [DM]. The price for one  kilogram of this kind of equipment exceeds DM7,000.    The national shipyards (Polnocna, Marynarki Wojennej, Wisla)  have the appropriate experience and, in the absence of orders,  could immediately pick up the construction of the warships  needed by the fleet, except for submarines. Even if resources  were unexpectedly allocated to a program for modernizing the  naval forces, given the current traditional structure that has  resulted in a collection of highly specialized, obsolete  warships and replacing them with new ones would take at least  several years.    Possibly the way out of the situation would be to look to  the  Danish experiments. Faced with the necessity of replacing a  large portion of the Danish Navy, instead of designing new types  of traditional warships, they shifted away from the previous  approach and decided to limit the number and variety of ships  without reducing the capabilities of the naval defense forces in  the process. This was accomplished by building a series of  all-purpose Standard Flex warships that can, in a few hours,  alter their functions by installing modular containers holding  items of equipment and weaponry. Depending on what is needed, a  ship can operate as a patrol vessel, a search-and-rescue unit, a  pollution-control vessel, a missile unit, a subchaser, a  minelayer, and a minesweeper. For a country that has scarce  budget resources and a relatively small fleet, this approach is  virtually ideal. However, even in the event that the national  shipyards are commissioned to build the ships, if we dreamed of  owning ships of close to world-class level, there is no getting  away from importing the electronic-warfare equipment. The  country produces modern radars, good sonars of the Flaming  series, and highly accurate Szop navigation gear (accurate to  within 0.5 meter), but these are only a few of the items that  are needed.    The situation is worse with regard to weaponry because, for  example, the Wrobel surface-to-air missile-artillery system has  a long reaction time, on the order of tens of seconds, and can  be used only against a target that has already launched an  attack and is flying away. The Russian "last chance" guns  currently in use are not economical, and Western ones (for  example, the Goalkeeper, firing 4,200 rounds a minute, with a  reaction time of 1 second) are excessively expensive. Work on  the Polish Nawalnik was halted four years ago due to a shortage  of funds.    How can we think of modernizing the fleet when there is not  even enough money for fuel? The destroyer Warszawa has an engine  with an output of 94,000 horsepower, or the same as 1,150  1.5-liter Polonaise cars. Sailing "100" [kilometers] at cruising  speed requires 11 tons of fuel; at top speed it takes 36 tons.    To be sure, Polish warships did take part this year in joint  maneuvers with NATO units and in several of their own exercises,  such as "Reda" and "Rekin," but this does not change the fact  that the number of training cruises was cut back considerably. A  sailor can gain skills through "dry-fire" training on  shore-based simulators, but knitting a crew into a unified team  can be done only over the course of long hours at sea. It should  therefore come as no surprise that achieving combat readiness  now takes not just hours but also dozens of hours, and units  that are sent out after the unidentified submarines that appear  from time to time in Polish waters return empty-handed.</p>

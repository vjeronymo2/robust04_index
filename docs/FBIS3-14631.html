			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Mashhur, Muslim Brotherhood deputy </F> leader: "The People's Will Conquers, O Clinton"]    [Text] We thought the United States had learned a lesson  in Vietnam, but then it got involved again in Somalia. Now it  is facing a more bitter experience by adopting an explicit  position in favor of the Zionist enemy and extending strong  support to it. Clinton has repeated the Zionist enemy's  statement that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Zionist  entity. The United States has also postponed the adoption of a  resolution at the UN Security Council condemning the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre in Hebron, although more than three weeks have  elapsed since the carnage. At the same time, the United States  has prevented the UN Security Council from adopting a resolution  lifting the sanctions against Iraq in order to sell its oil.  Thus we see that the United States is adopting a double  standard.    This policy is unacceptable. The United States will only win  the anger of all the Islamic peoples with this policy.    Has Clinton forgotten that there is a UN Security Council  Resolution No. 252 from 1968, which confirmed the legal status  of Jerusalem and stated that any measures aimed at changing the  status of Jerusalem are invalid? This resolution called on the  Zionist enemy to immediately refrain from any action that could  lead to a change in the status of Jerusalem.    Do we understand from this that the United States has the  authority to impose resolutions and cancel resolutions of the  Security Council whenever it wishes?    We would like to ask Clinton: Would he accept it if some  Jews or people from any other nationality were to occupy any  U.S. state and do to its American citizens what the Zionists are  doing to the Palestinians and establish settlements against the  will of its people? Or would the situation be different?    Let Clinton know that people are brought into this world  free  and will not accept being treated like slaves. Every person is  proud of his freedom. Freedom will triumph, and blood will be  shed freely for the sake of freedom. The will of the peoples  will conquer, and injustice will have a terrible end.    The United States had paved the way for the cancellation of  the United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism. Is  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident considered racism or democracy?  Are these blood-smeared hands considered the source of  terrorism, violence, and extremism? This U.S. policy is  rejected by all the Islamic peoples. It implements the wishes  of the Knesset which is seeking to establish a state from the  Nile to the Euphrates.    We said before that this enemy is full of hatred toward the  Muslims. The Koran acknowledged this when it said: "Strongest  among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and  pagans." But there are people, may God forgive them, who have  sought to establish reconciliation and peace with them. The  al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident revealed some of the hatred and  rancor the Jews have in their hearts. They even regarded the  settler who killed this large number of Muslims as their patron,  because the killing of Muslims is considered a cult. One of the  rabbis even said with complete insolence that a finger of a Jew  is worth one million Muslims. This is despicable and rejected.  The Muslim's blood is precious. Glory is to God, his  messenger, and the faithful.    Perhaps those who have been deceived by peace and  negotiations with this enemy have awakened from their  heedlessness and have realized that it is impossible to achieve  peace with it. The responsibility for the massacre was not  limited to this settler. Others participated in it, and some  soldiers also colluded with him. The responsibility is  collective, involving even the head of the state. Otherwise,  how can we explain the instructions to the soldiers to kill the  Palestinian stone thrower and not to kill the Zionist settler  who kills with bullets?    They are the killers of the prophets. Who knows, perhaps  they are planning to accomplish something momentous with the  advent of the year 1997, the 100-year anniversary of the Basel  conference in Switzerland in 1897. After the massacre, they  also provoked the Palestinians, killing and wounding scores of  them. Furthermore, a curfew was imposed on Hebron from the day  of the incident.    We then saw that all that Rabin and Clinton are concerned  about is for the negotiations and the peace process not to be  halted because of the massacre.    These negotiations do not represent the Palestinian people.  The Palestinian issue is not the issue of some Palestinians or  some Arab rulers, but it is the issue of all the Muslims. We  know that the United States resorts to the carrot and stick  policy with some of these rulers and the few Palestinians  represented by the PLO.    Let the United States and the Zionist enemy know that rulers  change, but the peoples stay, and that the peoples' will  conquers. Let them review their position on the Palestinian  issue and the issues of Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque, the  third holiest shrine. The Muslim peoples will not forsake the  issue of Palestine and the al-Aqsa Mosque, irrespective of time  and sacrifices.    To the Palestinians: We say to the Palestinians: Do not  allow the Zionists to kill you from behind, but face them and  defend yourselves and your land. This is a legitimate right.  Know that your dead are in paradise and their dead are in hell.  "So lose not heart, nor fall into despair, for ye must gain  mastery if ye are true in faith. If a wound hath touched you,  be sure a similar wound has touched the others. Such days (of  varying fortunes) we give to men and men by turn that God may  know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from  your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to truth). And God loveth not those  that do wrong. God's object also is to purge those that are  true in faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist  faith." And slacken not if following up the enemy. If ye are  suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but  ye have hope from God, while they have none." [Koranic verses]    To the Muslims in general: O Muslims, Islam is not a  personal  religion. It is the religion of one nation, one group, and even  one body. If one member of this body complains, the entire body  comes to help. O Muslims, appreciate the meaning of the one  nation and one body. Do not slacken, weaken, or keep quiet. You  must rise up from your sleep. The matter is very serious. The  enemies of Islam have underestimated you and undervalued your  lives as we have seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, and other  places. They were disgraced as they left hundreds of thousands  of men, women, and children to be killed and tens of thousands  of women to be raped and killed.    O Muslims, do not believe in the international institutions.  They have become puppets in the hands of the arrogant forces.  Call on your rulers to play a strong role in these  institutions. Otherwise, establish an Islamic league that cares  for and manages the affairs of the Muslims, protect and defend  them.    The enemies of Islam are after their own interests. The  Muslims in the world can use the weapon of popular boycott of  enemy goods. It is an effective weapon against them. We warn  against the issues of the Middle Eastern market, normalization  with the enemy, and ending the boycott of Israel. These are  extremely important matters, because they work for the benefit  of the enemy. The economic issue will be followed by political  hegemony.    It is not becoming of 1.2 billion Muslims to surrender to  slaughter, displacement, and rape. We must act, contemplate,  and think about what must be done to fortify ourselves before  what happened in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina is repeated  against us. The first thing we must do is return to God and fear  Him, and then equip ourselves with all the means of strength.  The first of these is strength of faith, then the strength of  unity, the strength of weapons and education, and so forth. We  must then have confidence that Almighty God will support us and  make us triumph. God's book tells us about victory, God  willing: "Until there is no more tumult or oppression, and  there prevail justice and faith in God." "Fain would they  extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will not allow  but that His light should be perfected, even though the  unbelievers may detest (it). It is he who hath sent His apostle  with Guidance and the religion of truth to proclaim it over all  religion, even though the pagans may detest (it)." [Koranic  verses]    God has granted victory to his messenger and the few  believers with him against the pagans in the Arabian Peninsula  and against the Jews, Persians, and Greeks. If we follow the  same path of God's messenger, may God's prayers and peace be  upon him, God will grant us victory.    To the rulers of the Muslim countries: O rulers of the  Muslim countries: Sense your responsibility for your Muslim  peoples and cooperate with them. "Let not the strutting about  of the unbelievers through the land deceive three: Little is it  for enjoyment. Their ultimate abode is hell. What an evil bed  (to lie on)." Purge your countries from what is objectionable  and sinful that angers God. Educate your peoples about  strength, fortitude, good character, and zeal for religion and  your peoples will support you in the face of the enemy's  treachery and even sacrifice their lives for you.    O rulers, all sedition fanned by the enemies between the  Muslim countries and among the Muslims in the same country or  between them and their rulers must be stopped.    Close your ranks according to God's book and his messenger's  teachings and mend your differences. Respond to your Lord's  order: "The believers are but a single brotherhood. So make  peace and reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers;  and fear God, that ye may receive mercy." "And hold fast, all  together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be  not divided among yourselves. And remember with gratitude God's  favor on you, for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in  love, so that by His grace ye became brethren." [Koranic verses]    This is the way, and there is no other one. Avoid violence  and counter violence. Avoid anything that could weaken our  Islamic countries.    God be my witness, I have conveyed the message.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Coping with water supply problems The Isles of Scilly is set to become the first UK local authority to buy a desalination plant to beat the drought in the south of England. The island's council has agreed to spend nearly Pounds 200,000 on a high technology water-making system similar to one used by British troops in the Gulf War. The plant will be supplied in five weeks by a Scottish company, WEIR WESTGARTH, which has also made desalination equipment for the Channel Tunnel. It will use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater taken from beach wells into drinking water, and is designed to produce 50,000 gallons a day - about two-fifths of the island's peak summertime needs. The extra water would supplement supplies from underground boreholes and should avoid rationing on the island, whose 1,500 population trebles in August. The council decided to buy the plant because its natural supply of water from wells has been drying up over the last five years due to dry winters and lack of rainfall. The desalinated water will be blended with well water to reduce nitrate levels, which are presently higher than European Community limits.</p>

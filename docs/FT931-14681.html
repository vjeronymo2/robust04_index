			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: News in Brief CONFEDERATION PEP Managers is launching an income Pep, which gives investors the choice of three unit trusts: high income, growth and smaller companies. The high income trust is eighth out of 30 in the UK balanced sector over three years to January 1, with growth of 16.1 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested). The yield is 5.9 per cent. The growth trust is 38th out of 93 in the UK general sector over three years, with a rise of 15.6 per cent. The yield is 3.9 per cent. In a poor period for smaller companies, Confederation's fund is 26th out of 56 in its sector over three years. All three trusts have initial charges of 5.7 per cent and annual charges of 1.25 per cent. The only further charges for PEP investors are Pounds 25 plus VAT for second (and subsequent) withdrawals within a year, or for those who want annual reports. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.                             *      *      * Scottish Life is offering a product to help the calculations of those who are not in a final salary pension scheme. Talisman Retirement Targeting will work out what level of contributions into a personal pension are needed to get a given percentage of salary at retirement. The system will allow for factors such as the need for a spouse's pension.                             *      *      * Northern Rock Building Society has relaunched Go Direct, its instant access postal account. It is paying 8.55 per cent gross on Pounds 20,000 and above, 8.3 per cent gross on Pounds 10,000 to just under Pounds 20,000 and 8.05 per cent gross on a minimum investment of Pounds 2,000. Coventry Building Society is offering a limited issue two year fixed rate account which pays 8.7 per cent gross on Pounds 40,000 and above. The rate on Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 40,000 is 8.5 per cent gross and on a minimum balance of Pounds 1,000, it is 8 per cent gross. Withdrawals during the fixed rate period will be subject to 90 days' loss of interest.                             *      *      * Family Assurance has launched an ingenious new pension fund, aimed at people in the last decade before retirement. It will use both cash funds and index-tracking equity funds to offer an alternative to more traditional 'with-profits' contracts. The Retirement Countdown Bond can be used either as a personal pension or as a free standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC). A proportion of money invested will be placed in a fixed interest and cash fund managed by Family, while the remainder is invested in the Morgan Grenfell FT-All Share index tracker fund. For those within two years of retirement the fund is entirely invested in cash. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Charges include a Pounds 60 start-up fee 5 per cent bid-offer spread, a 1 per cent fund management charge and monthly administration charge of Pounds 1.50.</p>

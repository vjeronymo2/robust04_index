			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's responsibilities are mandated by statute, Presidential direction, and Congressional authorization and appropriation. Other activities may be directed by regulatory mandates identified in compliance agreements or orders or other enforceable documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nevada Test Site occupies 1,350 square miles in southern Nevada, and is located approximately 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The Nevada Test Site is bordered to the north, west, and east by the Nellis Air Force Range, and on the south by Bureau of Land Management-administered lands. To the east, the Nevada Test Site shares a nearly contiguous border with lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Desert Game Range. The western half of the Game Range is also used by the U.S. Air Force, which shares a contiguous boundary with the Nevada Test Site. The Nevada Test Site is a remote, secure facility for conducting underground testing of nuclear weapons and for evaluating the effects of nuclear weapons on military communications systems, electronics, satellites, sensors, and other materials. Since the signing of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1974, it has been the only site used by the United States for underground nuclear weapons testing. In September 1992, Congress, within the framework of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, imposed a nine-month moratorium on underground nuclear testing. President Clinton extended the moratorium in July 1993 for an additional 15 months and subsequently, in March 1994, extended the moratorium through September 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing land use on the Nevada Test Site falls into four general categories: Testing Areas; Reserved Areas; Industrial/Research Areas; and Waste Management Areas. Most of the work on the Nevada Test Site has been and continues to be related to national defense, with a growing emphasis on environmental restoration and waste management programs. Changing world conditions and national policies have reduced the need for testing programs, and other DOE and non-DOE activities are now being considered for siting at the Nevada Test Site. A map showing existing land use at the Nevada Test Site and the locations of the off-site tests is available on request to Donald R. Elle at the above address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nevada Test Site is a unique facility. It is a large remote area with tightly controlled access, with a substantial infrastructure, and the capability to conduct tests with hazardous and radioactive materials. The southwest region of the Nevada Test Site provides support for nonweapons and nonnuclear weapons programs and for short term activities such as the nuclear weapons accident exercises conducted by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. In 1993, DOE designated the Nevada Test Site as a National Environmental Research Park. The Research Park is available for use by the scientific community as an outdoor laboratory for research on the effects of human activities on the desert ecosystem. Land not used for mission or other purposes has been designated as reserved areas, available for future development. The northern part of the Nevada Test Site is reserved as an underground nuclear weapons testing area. Nuclear test locations are at Yucca Flat, Pahute Mesa, Rainer Mesa, and Buckboard Mesa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waste management activities have been ongoing at the Nevada Test Site since 1952. For ease of identification, the Nevada Test Site has been divided into numbered geographic ``Areas''. Waste Operations are conducted in several areas. Sanitary and solid waste are disposed of in Areas 23 and 9. Hydrocarbon-contaminated soils are disposed of in a permitted landfill in Area 6. Radioactive waste management sites are located in Areas 3 and 5. Area 5 is also the location of a 90-day hazardous waste accumulation site. Waste streams continue to be generated, stored, and disposed of at the Nevada Test Site. Radioactive wastes are also shipped to the Nevada Test Site for disposal from other Department and Department-authorized sites. Waste management operations at Nevada Test Site include: Accumulation of hazardous waste; disposal of low-level radioactive waste including some classified waste; management of mixed radioactive and hazardous waste; storage of mixed transuranic waste; and disposal of sanitary waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

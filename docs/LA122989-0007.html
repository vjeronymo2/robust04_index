			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN OF THE DECADE'S CHALLENGE  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is a few days away from the most severe  test of his six incredible years in office. Ironically, passing the test would  probably mean pushing aside the Communist Party in the Soviet Union farther and  faster than seemed possible just months ago.  </P> <P> The test involves a decision by the Lithuanian Communist Party, made just  before Christmas, to break away from the Soviet Communist Party. The vote in  Vilnius left the first visible crack in the national party since Lenin's  revolution. The defection by one of the Soviet Union's tinier republics seems  to have rocked the Kremlin more than the collapse of communism in all six  Warsaw Pact nations since August.  </P> <P> Moscow is taking the defection hard because now, more than at any time since  the Soviet government abandoned the brute force it inherited from Stalin, the  Communist Party is what holds the Soviet empire together. Gorbachev himself  subscribed to that during this week's emergency meeting of the party's Central  Committee, drawing no line between the party and the state. Calling the  Lithuanian vote to break away "illegitimate," he said that "the current party  and state leadership will not permit the breakup of the state."  </P> <P> The committee could not decide exactly how to react, choosing instead to send  Gorbachev to Lithuania to see whether the considerable powers of leadership and  persuasion that make him Time Magazine's Man of the Decade can coax a reversal  from the Lithuanians. The numbers are against him. Fewer than 20% of  Lithuania's party members voted against the break, mostly Russian or Polish  nationals or military officers.  </P> <P> Three things make Lithuania such a severe test for Gorbachev. One is that his  reform policies encouraged the break. Lithuanians live better than most  Soviets, partly because they work harder. Some months ago, Gorbachev persuaded  the new Soviet Parliament to give Lithuania economic autonomy, partly so its  people could show Soviets how market socialism can work.  </P> <P> Another is a fear among leaders in Moscow that if the Soviet empire is allowed  to chip itself apart one republic at a time, the common Russian house will turn  into a common vacant lot. Lithuania's neighbors along the Baltic coast, Latvia  and Estonia, are prepared to follow suit.  </P> <P> The third factor, the nationalities problem, intensifies the others. The  Republic of Georgia, in the far south of the Soviet Union, has served notice  that it wants out. If Lithuania's Communists can peel away, Armenia's will  certainly try.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is Time's Man of the Decade largely because he has made a case with  actions and not just words that he is serious about ending the Cold War. That  the United States misjudged its own surrogate forces in Afghanistan does not  cancel the fact that he did pull his troops out of that country. He didn't lift  a finger to save communism in the Warsaw Pact nations. Taking the first of what  he says will be many troops and tanks from Europe is another example.  </P> <P> But Lithuania may be intractable, and one bad move could weaken much of the  goodwill he has built up in the West. If Lithuania's Communist leaders refuse  to back down, he could fire them. But there is no sign that new leaders would  be more effective in stifling the republic's yearning for independence. He  could declare martial law, but that would bring out centuries of bad blood  going back to the days of Peter the Great and would surely lead to violence.  </P> <P> It may be too much to expect an answer for every problem from this remarkable  man whose energy and gift for surprise have dominated global politics for the  latter half of the 1980s. But we would not be surprised to see him pull this  one out. He might, for example, tell Lithuania's leaders that if they want to  set a pattern for breaking away, they owe him a pattern for staying in. If they  want to pull out of the Soviet Communist Party -- a step that others republics  are certain to follow -- they must draft a framework that the others could also  use to remain part of a Soviet federation. Nothing in real life is ever quite  that tidy. But Gorbachev must find a better option than martial law if he is to  keep skeptics in the West persuaded that his goal remains ending the Cold War.  </P></p>

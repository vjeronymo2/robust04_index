			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ismet G. Imset: "Southeast Burden To Grow"] </F>   [Text] The strongest repercussion of the newly announced  economic package is to be observed in the impoverished Southeast  region of Turkey where Kurdish separatists have been fighting a  bloody war since 1984 at the cost of more than 11,000 lives.  Poverty and unemployment is high in this region where some  400,000 security forces consisting of soldiers, policemen and  paramilitary village guards have been deployed.    Reports from within the military is that Ankara is currently  considering to send some 150,000 additional troops to the region  this summer in a bid to deliver a final blow to the outlawed  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).    News is that security forces are currently sweeping the  mountainous areas and the PKK death toll is quite high. But  there is a general consensus--even among security commanders in  the region--that the campaign is not solving the problem but  serving only to postpone it for the future. Just like Turkey's  crackdowns on 28 separate Kurdish uprisings in its republican  history.    Each and every measure, meanwhile, is increasing the cost of  this undeclared war--which the military, as in many countries  where guerrilla wars are fought, insistently refer only to [it]  as an armed conflict or "limited warfare."    Turkey's military commanders and state officials naturally  avoid accepting the concept of war for the crisis, aware that  this would not only give legitimacy to the other side of the  conflict but also turn it into a counterpart.    Counterpart or not, the PKK has become a major problem for  Turkey in many fields. Observers of the conflict argue it would  be a severe mistake to insist on seeing the current problem as  one of a terrorist nature alone.    Indeed, Ankara's approach to the crisis has been a highly  hypocritical one over the past two years, and this alone has put  into force a military campaign without any economic, social or  cultural backing. The promise, year after year since 1984, has  been to "break the backbone of the terrorists."    The argument, one which has gone bankrupt, has been that the  problem: is a) One which stems not from Turkey but from foreign  countries with foreign support; b) A problem of terrorist nature  alone; and c) A problem which will surely be solved without  having to "give in" to international demands aimed at "dividing  Turkey."    In other words, despite what Turkish representatives recite  in foreign capitals with regard to Ankara's recognition of the  "Kurdish identity"--a recognition which lacks any  substance--Turkey insistently denies recognizing it is dealing  with a Kurdish problem.    Unfortunately, the "Kurdish problem," which Ankara fails to  recognize, is not a problem of terrorism. Nor is it a problem  created by "a handful of bandits" as claimed repeatedly by  officials over years of ignorance. Fortunately for Turkey,  though, it is not only a "PKK problem" either.    As a moderate pro-Kurdish magazine recently summarized it,  "The Kurdish problem is the problem of 20 million people (in the  Middle East) wanting to live freely and like human beings." The  problem, which started off as one based on demands for further  rights, equality and even autonomy, has now turned into a battle  on the Kurdish part for the restoration of principal human  rights and the right to live.    PKK attacks, mainly on Kurdish civilians, and  counter-terrorist operations in the region have literally  suffocated the local population--best expressed in increased  migration to the cities, depopulation of villages and new deaths  every day.    Recently, SABAH newspaper columnist Hasan Cemal wrote after  visiting the region and holding talks with the most senior  officials there that Turkey had decided to introduce "bitter  medicine" in the Southeast.    According to him, the evacuation of villages, razing them to  the ground, forceful depopulation of certain areas and "mystery  killings" which are observed every day are part of this bitter  medicine.    In other words, what has taken place until now is being  regarded only as mild medicine despite its results and the  bitter dose is newly being injected.    Thus, the people of the Southeast now face two doses of  bitter medicine in contrast to Turks living in other parts of  the country.    On one hand, they have to suffer the "bitter medicine" in  the  military field and with military measures. On the other, they  will suffer from the "bitter medicine" Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller offered the nation on April 5. A medicine which even  World Bank officials said was "medicine by the bottle rather  than the spoon."    Economic hardships are to be felt even more in this troubled  region where unemployment is hovering at around 70 percent and  investments and business have come to a halt owing to terrorism.  All of the pain inflicted nationwide with the new austerity  package is bound to be doubled, or even tripled, in this region  where salaries are relatively low and opportunities are scarce.  <H5>  The Situation </H5>   Since 1984, when the PKK launched its first attacks on two  Turkish targets, Turkey has been seeking to solve the crisis in  the region through military policies alone, refusing to see into  the realities of the crisis, correctly diagnose it and treat it  accordingly.    The result of this policy can be summarized in three parts,  disregarding how the PKK itself regards the situation. First of  all, the mistaken policy put into force in the region and  Turkey's insistent refusal to grant the Kurds their cultural and  social rights has led to a strengthening of the PKK over the  past decade. This strengthening has further been boosted by  widespread human rights violations in the region. Despite the  violations by the PKK, including the mass killing of Kurdish  women and children, Turkish violations have received more  coverage in the international media. Having accepted that the  PKK is a "terrorist" organization, many Non-Governmental  Organizations (NGOs) and even foreign governments have started  to see PKK violence as "a natural phenomena of terrorism" but  have rightfully expected Turkey, a state, to live up to the  standards of being a state. This situation, on one hand, has  strengthened the PKK's popular support in the Southeast and, on  the other, has boosted international sympathy for the Kurds  altogether-- often being mixed up with sympathy for the PKK,  which claims it represents Turkish Kurds.    Secondly, through its insistence on a military solution to  the crisis and despite all that has been said, Turkey has been  forced to change its overall approach to the Kurds in the recent  years. Although officials may dislike the current position  Ankara has fallen into, it is evident that PKK attacks and a  constant wave of violence has a) Pushed Turkey into lifting a  military-imposed ban on using the Kurdish language; b) Accepting  the "Kurdish identity" although it has still not done anything  about it and c) Debating the overall problem more freely even  though "unwanted opinions" are still being repressed immediately.    Turkey, in its failure to take any cultural, social or  economic steps to lift the burden off the shoulders of its  Kurdish people, has had to make concessions instead, ending up  indexing its own "Kurdish policy" on the PKK alone. This is a  concession which no state should end up making.    Thirdly, the military solution sought for the Kurds of  Turkey has not only strengthened the PKK, hurt Turkey's own  image abroad and pushed Ankara to the point of concessions, but  has also yielded some frightening results:    1. There has been an immense alienation between the Turkish  and Kurdish people who have created this country hand in hand  and who share 1,000 years of a joint history. Turkish  frustration at terrorist attacks by the PKK has been channeled  into reaction to the Kurds in general and vice versa. This  alienation is now systematically being fanned by activists of  the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and certain local forces.  2. The failure of the military policy put in force since 1984  has finally forced Turkey's civilian administration into giving  a major concession to the Army, allowing military commanders  once again to play a dominant role in all national affairs. In  the absence of any alternative and in the form of "a last bid,"  the civilians have surrendered authority to the military,  believing "this time" again that the latter will be able to  solve the problem.  3. Aware that it cannot tackle the Kurdish issue having  strengthened the stance of the military to this extent, Turkey's  civilian administrators have yielded to pressure for further  authority and agreed with military plans to force the local  populace "to make a choice." Currently, the 1994 campaign aims  at forcing the civilian populace in the region to "decide which  side they are on" and act accordingly. Both the PKK and Turkish  security forces are against "undecided masses" and aim at  forcing them to their sides. If this systematic campaign cannot  be prevented, there will be no "undecided" or "innocent"  civilians in the region and the society will be broken into two  major parts, the village guards and the militia.    4. There has also been an increase in regional support to  pro-Islamic policies in the region which, in the absence of a  pro-Kurdish political formation, has led to a major victory of  the Welfare Party. All of Turkey's past "Kurdish uprisings"  have been Islamic in nature, and there is concern that this new  development may trigger an even more serious crisis.    5. Finally, the cost of the military campaign on terrorism  has grown by the day and continues to increase. It has now  turned into an incredible burden on Turkey and the Turkish  people.  <H5>  The Burden </H5>   The burden is, to be frank, far greater for Turkey than any  "political solution" to the problem could have brought forth  until now.    Whether Turkey is truly aware of the cost of this undeclared  war is not quite clear although it is evident that the crisis is  serving the interests of at least some regional circles such as  the feudal landlords who are following Middle East fashion and  are creating their own small-scale armies and making a great  profit out of them.    And, there have been those countries who have unwillingly  participated in the conflict. Countries which are now  exploiting their past decisions to blackmail Turkey on the  international platform.    Germany, for instance, is Turkey's largest light arms  supplier in the sense of weaponry used in the Southeast "border  region" and is now making trouble for Ankara, claiming its  weapons have been used against the PKK while they were delivered  only for NATO-related defense purposes.    According to independent figures, Germany has delivered DM  [German Mark] 3.6 billion worth of arms in the form of grants to  Turkey in the 1985-1991 period. But it was only after the Gulf  war that East German weapons were spotted widely in the region.  A grant of 256,125 Kalashnikov-type assault rifles, 100,000 RPG  Bazookas, 300 BTR 60 type armored vehicles and 450 million  ammunition is part of this grant. The estimated cost of the  package is somewhere around DM 1.5 billion.    On top of this, it is noteworthy that Germany (or rather  German companies) were those who supplied the  weapons--especially chemical weapon components--needed in Saddam  Husayn's past campaign against the Kurds. A campaign which, in  Halabjah in 1988 alone, wiped away a total of 5,000 Kurdish  civilians who were gassed to death.    Western countries clearly have their "own" interests in the  regional Kurdish conflict and often play a vital role in shaping  events. But in the case of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, not  even foreign assistance or grants have lifted the burden off  Turkey.    Ciller, while in Diyarbakir on Dec. 31, 1993 just before  some  150,000 new troops were sent to the region, told journalists  that there were a total of 160,000 military personnel and 40,000  village guards in the Southeast. Since then, many more  villagers have been forced to take up weapons against the PKK,  and the number of village guards, according to a REUTERS report  on Wednesday, has reached 58,000.    Now with these new troops deployed to the region, the cost  of this decade-old "operation" is even higher. Special police  crack teams, policemen, National Intelligence Agency (MIT)  personnel and special squads have to be added to this cost in  1994. According to Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, Turkey has  spent a total of TL [Turkish lira] 800 trillion on the Southeast  campaign since 1984. HURRIYET newspaper columnist Nese Duzel  recently wrote that Turkey was spending an annual $7 billion for  the security campaign, the equivalent of DM 120 billion.    In 10 years, this would make up a total of $70 billion  disregarding increases in prices and the increase in the cost of  the campaign.    In 1993, the predicted inflation rate was at 53 percent but  according to official figures was realized at 71 percent with  the undeclared war making its impact on the overall economic  situation of Turkey. The same year, the Istanbul Chamber of  Commerce put the inflation rate at 80 percent.    Turkey's economic problem is great, but problems are even  greater in the Southeast where the economy has come to an end.  Now, with the government trying to tackle what Ciller has  branded as "economic terrorism," the crisis is to deepen even  further.    By Thursday, it was evident that Ciller's bid to build a new  structure on the one she herself ruined was not working out as  planned. The wave of price hikes had increased public suffering  throughout Turkey but appeared to be close to being worthless  with the dollar rate soaring and reaching TL40,000 by Thursday  morning compared to the TL23,000 on Monday.    Even now, approximately $1.3 billion is being paid to  village  guards in the region while reports are that the secret budget  allocated to Southeast officials is around TL6.6 trillion.  Aside from these, the state is compensating and awarding  security officials in the region. Policemen based there are  receiving a monthly salary of TL20 million and senior soldiers  are getting some TL19 million, around 10 million more than their  colleagues based in other parts of the region. According to  information with the Turkish Human Rights Association, there are  100 warplanes, 40 Cobra, 35 Sikorski and 230 classic helicopters  in the region aside from hundreds of armored personnel carriers,  trucks, jeeps and tanks. The approximate cost of one takeoff for  a warplane is reportedly $4,000. Turkey's recent air raid on a  PKK camp in northern Iraq some 500 kilometers away cost Ankara  TL22.7 billion disregarding personnel costs. But even this  amount was met with salary cuts from ordinary, compulsory  soldiers who earn around $1 per month these days.    Recently, the state issued 27,100 Kalashnikovs to villagers  in Erzurum and Erzincan, in eastern Turkey. A total of 112,500  mines were planted on the Iraqi border and so on.    The cost of the war is growing in a bizarre way each and  every day. While the Turkish nation has paid for this war for  10 years, both with its martyrs and taxes, Kurdish citizens of  the republic who live in the region have had to suffer the  consequences in many ways.    Says a recent issue of DENG magazine, believed to be  affiliated with the moderate Kurdistan Socialist Party: "The  Turkish state is cornered. It is not capable of meeting the  economic bill of this warfare. Inflation and unemployment is  spreading wildly. Investments have come to an end. Although the  state is channelling all of its means to this unjust and dirty  war, it is bound to be crushed by the economic burden of this  war."    On one hand, hundreds of innocent people have been killed.  On the other, hundreds of Turkish soldiers have been martyred.  Meanwhile, everyone is now "paying" for the policy currently  underway.    The people of the Southeast are to pay even more than the  others in the days ahead. For they are to suffer both from the  PKK's terrorism and the indiscriminate campaign said to be  against terrorism. They are also going to suffer more under the  new austerity package.    Whichever way the Kurdish people turn, the locals of  southeast Turkey face only one alternative: taking bitter  medicine. The PKK is bitter medicine. The security clampdown  is bitter medicine. And, economic austerity is bitter medicine.  The people have been forced into becoming patients. But all  prescribed treatments until now have been based on mistaken  diagnosis.    This problematic situation has already yielded its first  result which some believe is even a greater threat for Turkey  than the PKK. Islamic activism is on the rise in the region.  Aside from the PKK, which is a "separatist" phenomenon against  the establishment, there is now a Kurdish-Islamic outlet against  the establishment. One which, in the past history of Turkey,  has led to several severe Islamic Kurdish uprisings.    The general feeling is that the Welfare Party will be  skillfully exploiting the consequences of Ankara's so-called  austerity package from now on and that it could gain more  sympathy, not only among the Kurdish people, but also within the  security apparatus in the region--claiming to be the only  legitimate alternative to end the bloodshed.    The impact of the new austerity package is bound to triple  in  the Southeast, where the pain is felt greater than in other  parts of the country. Poverty is to be greater there.  Unemployment is to soar. Businesses will go bankrupt.  Villagers will be suffering and the anti-establishment trend  will find optimum space to flourish more and more, with the  touch of the green crescent. There, the burden is too great for  everyone....</p>

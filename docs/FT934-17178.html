			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Japanese warn of further downturn THE Japanese government warned yesterday that the economy might be entering a new phase of downturn, as a fall in job openings reflected the pressure on many companies to cut costs by dismissing workers. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the international trade and industry minister, asked that companies attempt to solve their surplus labour problem 'internally,' meaning that they should transfer staff within the company rather than cut the workforce. His comments reflect widespread concern that dismissals could further undermine consumer confidence and cause deeper social damage by ending the promise of lifetime employment in Japan. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, also said he was very worried by signs that the job market was deteriorating, as highlighted by a fall in the job offers to applicants ratio from 72:100 in July to 70:100 in August. New job offers in manufacturing fell by 26 per cent year-on-year, while new offers in the service sector fell by 13.8 per cent, surprising government officials who hoped that this sector would absorb surplus labour. The Management and Co-ordination Agency said the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August was 2.5 per cent, unchanged from a month earlier, though the government tends to regard the job offers ratio as a more accurate reflection of labour market trends. Most large companies have reduced their annual intake of graduates and plan to trim the workforce through natural attrition, but the government fears that the yen's rapid appreciation and weak domestic demand will force further job cuts. Japanese manufacturers, responding to the yen's rise, have recently rushed to invest in lower-cost east Asian sites, and Mr Kumagai warned that the investment flow could lead to a hollowing-out of the technology industry. The pressure on manufacturers was indicated by a 5 per cent year-on-year fall in new vehicle sales in September, the sixth consecutive month of decline. The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said passenger car sales dipped 2.5 per cent, while truck sales slipped 9.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the Labour Ministry said overtime hours worked in the manufacturing sector contracted 10.9 per cent from a year earlier, continuing a fall that began in December 1990.</p>

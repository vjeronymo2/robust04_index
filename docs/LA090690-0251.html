			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHANGING THEIR WAYS;  </P> <P> BABY HELPS TANYA TUCKER WIPE OUT HER IMAGE AS A PARTY GIRL  </P> <P> In country music circles, Tanya Tucker has a reputation as a hell-raiser, but  the brand is fading.  </P> <P> Country music's original party girl became a mother last year, and she makes it  clear to anyone who will listen that daughter Presley Tanita is No. 1 in her  life these days.  </P> <P> The two are never far apart. A crib was even built into Tucker's touring bus so  the two could be together during a coast-to-coast promotional tour of the  singer's latest album, "Tennessee Woman."  </P> <P> Motherhood apparently has proved inspirational for the 31-year-old Tucker.  </P> <P> "Walking Shoes," a cut from the new album, topped the country charts recently,  and she's up for two Country Music Assn. Awards for top female vocalist as well  as vocal event of the year for a duet performance of "Don't Go Out" with T.  Graham Brown.  </P> <P> "She's really a joy. She loves people," Tucker said of her first child. "I  think she's musical. I can tell by the way she reacts to music."  </P> <P> Be that as it may, Tucker isn't entirely sure she would encourage her daughter  to pursue a music career.  </P> <P> "It's complicated and difficult. It's an extreme lifestyle," said Tucker, who  has spent only two of the last 48 days at her Tennessee home. "I'm pretty  jaded.  </P> <P> "Not only that, but all eyes are upon you all the time. I prefer her to have  more of a private life, to not be affected by what people think," Tucker said.  </P></p>

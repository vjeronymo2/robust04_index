He said that his optimism is based on the developments that  took place between the two sides in November 1993 when Iraq  approved Resolution 715.    He said: My feeling is that we have started well and that  progress has been made. He said that his talks with Iraqi  officials will deal with political and technical issues,  including the application of long-term monitoring, which is  related to Resolution 715.    He said: For our part, we will explain the situation at the  UN Security Council as well as the prospects for development and  progress. Our hope is to make progress as soon as possible so  that the committee would be able to submit its report to the UN  Security Council and so that it would be able to affirm that  Iraq has honored its obligations. Thus, we can do something to  pressure the UN Security Council to take the necessary measures  to lift the oil embargo against Iraq.    He explained that his visit to Iraq is part of the dialogue  that started in July 1993 and to maintain the momentum of the  positive developments that have been realized.    In response to a question on the duration of his visit to  Baghdad, Ekeus said: This depends on the talks that we will  hold with the Iraqi side.    He said: The talks will certainly cover the issue of lifting  the embargo against Iraq, but I cannot make any comments because  the process is continuing and we hope that it will become more  extensive.    The delegation includes John Scott, the committee's legal  adviser; Tim Terevan [name as received], the committee  spokesman; and Maurizio Zifferero, deputy chairman of the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    The first session of talks will begin at the Foreign  Ministry  at 2000 today.</p>

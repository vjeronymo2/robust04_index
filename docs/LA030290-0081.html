			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: 'SEVEN SCULPTORS' OFFERS ENGAGING SAMPLING  </P> <P> In David Engbritson's "Cone," part of the "Seven Sculptors" exhibition at UC  San Diego's Mandeville Gallery, an opening roughly the size of a human head  hangs at eye level, beckoning our gaze within. What we see when we peer through  the wood slat construction is a charred interior -- at odds with the gold  painted exterior -- and a small segment of the gallery floor, visible through  the cone's open point.  </P> <P> Silhouetted against this patch of floor are two small spiders that have taken  up residence in the artwork. Their presence there, however unintentional,  nevertheless satisfies a desire, shared by most of the sculptors here, for  their work to be encountered in real space. No pedestals here; the work either  stands freely on the floor or hangs from the wall or ceiling. These artists  dissolve the distanced, protected realm of traditional sculpture and situate  their work within our casual grasp.  </P> <P> Sculpture now, more often than not, exists in the same physical and  psychological domain we inhabit daily. It aims to expand that realm, to stretch  its boundaries to embrace metaphor, magic, mystery and memory. Of the seven  artists in this show -- an annual, invitational exhibition featuring emerging  and mid-career artists -- most do enrich that space. They fill it with curious  visual presences and catalysts of the imagination. Together they present an  engaging sample of sculptural possibilities.  </P> <P> The show's only disappointments come in the form of technical theatrics that  aspire to no real meaning, as in the case of Carol Hepper, or that aspire to  more meaning than they deliver, as in Yolande McKay's work. Thick bunches of  bent willow twigs spew out of the curved metal pipe joints in Hepper's work,  stretching and twisting to make the next turn. Though physically commanding,  the work's dialogue between the organic and the artificial stops just past the  point of introductions, leaving little for the viewer to mull over.  </P> <P> McKay's weighty concrete forms have the imposing but ultimately powerless  presence of blind authority. Each contains a clear glass window allowing a view  of its interior, empty but for the interesting tones and textures of the walls.  McKay alludes to a more pointed purpose in her work and to the threat of  danger, but she never follows through.  </P> <P> Slighter in substance but far more enveloping sensually and intellectually are  Wade Saunders' small bronze "Water Drawings." Part of a much larger series,  these 15 objects grouped on the floor resemble tools, musical instruments,  internal organs, plant forms, all of which are capable of being vessels or  channels for fluids. A tight cluster of pod-like forms, a curved pipe, a wheel  with knobby spokes -- each bears the imprint of the human hand, having first  been molded in wax, then cast in bronze.  </P> <P> Their gray, smoky surfaces and irregular, hand-wrought textures assert an  affinity with the Earth, and they sit here as if freshly emerged, evidence of  an earlier, simpler era. Tangible sketches of another time, they soak in the  aura of history and human use. Shades of whimsy and mystery also graze across  the work, giving it a refreshing breadth of interpretations.  </P> <P> Works by both Zizi Raymond and Michael Peed reach backward, too, into a  personal past laced with both nostalgia and tension. Both artists also defy  expectations of their materials.  </P> <P> In one of Raymond's witty constructions, a stream of steel wool pours from an  old-fashioned milk bottle into a limp heap on the floor. The bottle rests on  its side on a wooden table that has been sliced in half and mounted high on the  gallery wall. The proverbial spilled milk elicits no tears here, only a cry of  surprise at the disjunctive play of materials.  </P> <P> Raymond's "Secrets" has richer narrative potential as well as several of the  same challenges to gravity, stability and logic. Here, half of a short ladder  leans into empty space, its forward pull offset by a metal case a few feet  away, to which it is attached by string. The case, closed with a padlock, sits,  tilted, on a rolling pin. Ladder, case, rolling pin and string are all painted  black, which shifts their significance from the functional to the metaphoric.  Atop the ladder rest two clear glass jars, each holding a little girl's black  patent leather shoe. The shoes are preserved, relics, perhaps, of a thwarted  journey toward maturity.  </P> <P> Two of Peed's works also address memories of youth, but in a more lighthearted,  sentimental manner. In one scene, father and daughter drive through the "Garden  of the Gods," Dad wide-eyed and gesturing broadly, the daughter holding the car  door with a tentative hand and glancing at the spectacles outside with equally  reticent eyes. In "Merle's House," two boys peer into the bedroom window of a  young man who has just stripped to his underwear to pose before the mirror,  flexing his nonexistent muscles.  </P> <P> The cartoon-like quality of these subjects is matched by their simplified  forms, carved out of wood in low relief, then painted or varnished. The works  address the viewer as paintings, rectangular windows on the world, but they  also possess a weight and physicality exclusive to sculpture. The  sophistication of Peed's dialogue with technique jars with his childlike,  cliched images, yielding a style that is clever and catchy.  </P> <P> Creighton Michael and David Engbritson refer to organic forms and geometric  shapes in their work, but both remain purposefully vague. They invite our  musings on the notion of gravity and challenge our expectations of materials,  making the solid fluid and the common precious. Together with the other artists  in the show, which continues through March 25, they spread a varied and often  tantalizing feast of sculptural possibilities.  </P></p>

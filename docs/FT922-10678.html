			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Smith backed by most of the shadow cabinet THE CREDENTIALS of Mr John Smith as the leadership candidate of Labour's establishment were underlined yesterday with the publication of the list of MPs making nominations for the election. All but three of his shadow cabinet colleagues were among the 162 MPs who nominated him. He also captured most of the new MPs and almost the entire Scottish party, including its hard left. His rival Mr Bryan Gould counted only two shadow cabinet leftwingers - Mr Michael Meacher and Ms Jo Richardson - among his 63 supporters, as well as his shadow environment colleagues and campaign managers, Mr David Blunkett and Mr Clive Soley. His other prominent supporters included the prominent Euro-sceptic and former senior Cabinet minister, Mr Peter Shore, and Ms Clare Short from the national executive committee. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary and Mr Smith's campaign manager, said some 15 other MPs had indicated that they would support Mr Smith after consulting their constituency parties. Mr Ken Livingstone, the candidate of the left-wing Campaign group, captured only half the faction's membership. In the deputy leadership race, the bulk of the front bench formed the core of Mrs Margaret Beckett's 89-strong support. Mr John Prescott, the third challenger for deputy, won many of his 64 nominations from leftwing northern and Scottish MPs. The annual conference of the AEU engineering union, the third-largest union affiliated to Labour, yesterday backed Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett as leader and deputy leader of the party. The AEU decided not to ballot its members.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: House acts to regulate rent-to-own A BILL to regulate the US rent-to-own industry, dominated by Thorn EMI's Rent-A-Center, has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee. The bill aims to safeguard consumers who purchase items on credit - known in the US as rent-to-own. The measures would limit interest and other fees, provide mandated disclosures and warranty protections, and prohibit abusive collection practice. Mr Gonzalez acted after the committee heard that US consumers were often forced to pay three to four times the value of an item before gaining ownership in rent-to-own transactions. The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story about Rent-A-Center, which provided an account of the company's collection practices and marketing techniques.</p>

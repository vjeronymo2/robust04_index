			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALCOLM X  </P> <P> I am white. For a long time my color has hampered me from voicing my opinion of  Malcolm X.  </P> <P> I have never been against his teachings.  </P> <P> On the contrary, I believe that his views of black suppression and how to  remedy the situation are just.  </P> <P> Thank you, Charisse Jones, for the clear and precise article "The Rebirth of  Malcolm X." I hope that my white contemporaries have taken the time to read it  in full, instead of banishing it to the wastepaper basket -- as has been done  many times before with anything that has contradicted popular white beliefs.  </P> <P> MONICA BLUMENTHAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

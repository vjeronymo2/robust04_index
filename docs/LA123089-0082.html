			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUEL PRICE HIKES MAY BRING AIRLINE TICKET SURCHARGES;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THE FEES WOULD BE THE FIRST IMPOSED SINCE THE OIL CRISIS OF THE  EARLY 1970S.  </P> <P> Several airlines, including United and Continental, said Friday that they were  considering placing surcharges on tickets to cover recent sharp rises in jet  fuel costs.  </P> <P> If imposed, the special fuel charges would be the first since the oil crisis of  the early 1970s.  </P> <P> It wasn't clear whether the airlines would decide to impose the special charges  -- and thus raise ticket prices -- after reducing fares earlier this week. Most  of the nation's airlines have dropped excursion fares by as much as 30% to help  fill planes during the slow winter months.  </P> <P> It was speculated that calling a fuel-related fare hike a surcharge might make  it more palatable to consumers.  </P> <P> Several airlines said Friday that they were concerned about the jump in fuel  prices, which are up 40% from a year ago. Spot prices of jet fuel in New York  have soared 70% this month, caused in part by Gulf Coast refinery fires and an  Eastern cold snap that have strained oil supplies.  </P> <P> "The price of fuel has been going crazy," said Art Kent, spokesman for  Continental Airlines. "It is a serious problem. We are looking at a number of  options; obviously a fuel surcharge is one of them."  </P> <P> The increase in jet fuel prices has already prompted two airlines -- Trump  Shuttle and Pan American World Airways -- to raise fares on their Northeastern  shuttles by 20%, starting next Wednesday.  </P> <P> However, Pan Am said it isn't considering a fare increase on its other more  competitive routes.  </P> <P> The cost of fuel has a direct impact on profits, because fuel accounts for  about 15% of an airline's operating costs. A 1-cent rise in fuel prices costs  the industry $150 million a year, according to the Air Transport Assn., an  industry trade group.  </P> <P> Robin Mattel, spokesman for Continental's sister airline, Eastern Airlines,  said a possible fuel surcharge is under study. A fuel surcharge is also one  option under consideration at United Airlines, said spokesman Joe Hopkins.  </P> <P> Don Morrison, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines, said a fare increase is  possible if fuel prices continue to rise but that the airline isn't considering  a surcharge.  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and USAir said they were not studying a  surcharge or a fare hike.  </P> <P> Though the airlines regularly pass on cost increases to customers, the industry  hasn't imposed a fuel surcharge since 1973, when oil prices rose steeply and  the federal government allowed the airlines to raise fares a few dollars to  help cover costs.  </P> <P> The industry was deregulated in 1978, and airlines can impose fare hikes, or  surcharges, without government permission.  </P></p>

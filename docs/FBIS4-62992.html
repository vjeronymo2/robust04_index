			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RIA NOVOSTI correspondent Leonid Laakso report for </F> ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI of Finnish President M. Ahtisaari's meeting  with group of Russian journalists; date and place not given:  "Martti Ahtisaari: Finland Could Become Russia's Nearest Outlet  To Europe. The New Finnish President's First Official Visit to  Moscow Begins Today" -- first three paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] On the eve of his visit to Moscow President Martti  Ahtisaari met with a group of Russian journalists. During the  conversation he gave his assessment of the current state of  Russian-Finnish relations and shared his vision of their future,  and answered questions, including those posed by ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI.    In particular, describing the current phase of  Russian-Finnish relations, Martti Ahtisaari said that he  considers them to be exceptionally good, and hopes that his  forthcoming visit will promote their further development. In  addition, Martti Ahtisaari expressed the hope that, as a result  of his forthcoming meetings in Moscow, he will be able to deepen  his understanding of the processes which are taking place in the  social, economic, and political life of Russia.    The meeting with President Martti Ahtisaari left an  impression of him as a calm, balanced person, that is to say the  classic model of the Nordic person. At the same time his manner  of speaking reveals the experienced diplomat. He undertook to  answer all the questions posed directly, but to some of them he  gave only pointers, leaving the interlocutor himself the right  to draw conclusions.    [Question] Are there any unresolved problems between Russia  and Finland? In particular, is the so-called "Karelian  question" pertinent?    [Ahtisaari] It all depends on what we mean when posing it.  In may view, it is above all a question of developing relations  between Finland and the Republic of Karelia as adjacent regions  of two countries, and we could have a lengthy conversation on  this subject. On the whole I would describe the problems which  exist as natural ones for partners, that is to say, they are the  sort of problems which arise to confront the sides, to be solved  as their cooperation develops. For example, questions connected  with the need to open new border-crossing points require  constant negotiations at various levels of state power. But we  have no problems that could be called insoluble.    [Question] How do you see the main, priority avenues of  economic cooperation between Russian and Finland in the light of  the fact that Finland, all the signs suggest, is going to join  the European Union?    [Ahtisaari] Last year was marked by the exceptionally  favorable development of trade relations between our countries.  Exports from Russia increased by one-third, and Finnish imports  almost doubled. In addition, there was a significant broadening  of the range of goods. The latest customs department statistics  testify that this trend in trade development is continuing in  the current year.    In my view, this means that Finnish and Russian enterprises  have found one another. I think -- and this finds confirmation  in the trade statistics -- that we have already reached the end  of the initial learning curve, which is necessary for the  transition from state jurisdiction over foreign trade to the  establishment of foreign trade at the level of enterprises.  Hence it is no accident that there is no shortage of business  representatives in the delegation which is coming with me to  Moscow.    As for Finland's future of as regards the EU, the question  of EU entry will be finally settled -- positively, I hope --  during a referendum on this question in the fall. I believe  that even bigger opportunities for extending and deepening  cooperation between our countries open up as a result of our  probable entry into that organization. If Finland becomes an EU  member, it will be Russia's nearest outlet to the European  market. I hope that we Finns will be able to use our "know-how,"  our experience of conducting business with Russians, for the  further development and stimulation of cooperation in new  conditions.    [Question] What can you say about the current state of  cooperation between adjacent regions?    [Ahtisaari] Finland's cooperation with St. Petersburg,  Leningrad Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, and Murmansk Oblast  has already outgrown the framework of the interstate protocol,  and it is frequently impossible to keep up with the speed of  developing cooperation. This is just as it should be between  neighbors, and here the main thing is that state organs manage  to create the prerequisites for further cooperation at the level  of enterprises and firms.    However, despite the scale of the market between adjacent  territories, Finland's interests extend further. The Finnish  economy contains priority sectors whose achievements can be used  far more extensively. I have in mind the timber and  paper-making industries, ship building, electronics, chemicals,  and other sectors. I believe that cooperation in these sectors  could be of interest not just to nearby regions.    [Question] Finland and Russia are neighboring countries;  what happens in Russia is not a matter of indifference here.  How will events in Russia develop, in your view?    [Ahtisaari] I would be pleased to answer that question after  the end of my visit, but I will try to give you my impressions  right now. Russia has a material base in the shape of vast  natural resources, and this is a basis for the development of  the economy. As for sociopolitical development, this is always a  complex process, especially in periods of radical change. For  example, unemployment in Finland currently stands at almost  500,000, and this is painfully reflected in society. It is very  important that Russia undertakes a search for paths of accord in  order to maintain stability in society.    As neighbors, we follow Russia's efforts to transform its  country with great sympathy. Therefore, within the limits of  our existing resources, we would like to take part in this  process. It is important that cooperation develops in all areas  of vital activity. In this respect it is gratifying that  lively, active relations have been established between Finnish  parliamentarians and the deputies of Russia's revived Duma; also  pleasing is the growing cooperation between the governments of  our countries. I hope that all this will enable our peoples to  respond properly to the challenge of the times.</p>

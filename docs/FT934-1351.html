			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Boost for SPD in state election Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) yesterday unexpectedly stemmed the advance of the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism by winning the key city of Potsdam in the eastern state of Brandenburg, according to exit polls. Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD's incumbent mayor of Potsdam, the state capital of Brandenburg, gained a projected 56 per cent of the vote, 10 points ahead of his main contender, Mr Rolf Kutzmutz of the PDS, who had been tipped to clinch the post of mayor in the city in this second-round election. The recent series of local government elections, the first in eastern German states since unification, have shaken the established parties as the PDS, the successor to the former Socialist Unity (communist) party, gained 21 per cent of the first-round vote, while the governing Christian Democrats, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, received only 22 per cent. The defeat of Mr Kutzmutz, who, in the first round, polled 43 per cent of the vote, ahead of Mr Gramlich's 30 per cent, is an obvious setback for the PDS, which believed that it was set to become the strong regional party for eastern Germany. Mr Kutzmutz, an admitted informer for the former east East German secret police, the Stasi, had run an efficient campaign aimed at the unemployed and those who felt aggrieved that Germany's established parties failed to consider the particular social and economic problems of eastern Germany since unification. However officials at Brandenburg's SPD, which had managed to secure about 34 per cent of the vote in the first round, were determined to prevent the PDS from becoming an established political force in Potsdam, and a potential threat in next year's marathon round of local, state, and federal elections. For its part, the CDU secured the industrial city of Cottbus. Exit polls gave the party a comfortable lead of 71 per cent over its main PDS rival which by last night had 29 per cent of the vote. The SPD clinched a landslide victory over the PDS in Brandenburg, the other main city included in the run-off.</p>

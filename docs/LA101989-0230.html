			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICES UP MODEST .2% FOR SEPT.;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: CLOTHES PRICES RISE SHARPLY, BUT ENERGY COSTS FALL FOR THE FOURTH  CONSECUTIVE MONTH.  </P> <P> Consumer prices in September rose an unexpectedly modest 0.2%, with most prices  virtually unchanged except for a sharp rise in clothing costs, the government  said today.  </P> <P> Energy prices, which had climbed sharply at the wholesale level, raising the  expectation of an increase on the retail level, fell for the fourth consecutive  month in September, the Labor Department said.  </P> <P> Jittery stock and bond markets rallied on the news, taking the favorable  inflation number as a sign the Federal Reserve Board has leeway to nudge  interest rates lower.  </P> <P> Also, the report triggered an announcement that the nation's 38.9 million  Social Security recipients will get a 4.7% benefit increase in January to  offset the effects of inflation over the last year. (Story, P1)  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a separate report, the department said Americans' average weekly  earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.3% in September following a  0.7% decline in August.  </P> <P> Average weekly earnings in September were $338.67, up 3.5% from a year earlier.  But, when inflation is taken into account, real weekly earnings were down.  </P> <P> Consumer prices rose at a high annual rate of 6.7% for the first five months of  the year, driven up by rising gasoline prices.  </P> <P> However, the index has risen only 0.2% or remained flat in each of the last  four months, bringing the annual rate down to 4.4% for the first three  quarters, the same as the rate for all of 1988 and 1987.  </P> <P> "This shows clearly that inflation is under control. . . . Under these  circumstances, there is no question that interest rates will fall," said  economist William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> But economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago said the  September report overstates the decline in inflation and warned of higher  energy prices ahead.  </P> <P> "There has been an abatement, but it hasn't been to the degree this number  would suggest. We're likely to have some less attractive numbers in the fourth  quarter," he said.  </P> <P> Gasoline prices, down 2.2% in September, have declined 9.3% in the last four  months after increasing 21.2% in the first five months of the year.  </P> <P> Food prices, which were surging earlier in the year, rose a moderate 0.2% last  month, in part because of a 1.1% decline for fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> Clothing prices, after falling in the three previous months, rose 1.7% in  September. Apparel for women and girls, reflecting the introduction of new fall  and winter fashions, were up 3.6%.  </P></p>

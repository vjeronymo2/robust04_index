			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Appointments: IT man to be i/c IFM ICCH Financial Markets (IFM), the systems subsidiary of the International Commodities Clearing House, has named Wal Reisch to succeed Martin Eades as chief executive. Eades, whose three-year contract is up, arrived at ICCH as group managing director, encompassing both the clearing house, which clears and guarantees trades executed on London futures and options markets, and IFM. In September 1990, David Hardy took over as managing director of the London Clearing House, leaving Eades in charge of IFM. With his skills more pronounced on the selling than on the man management side, Eades, 50, who had previously worked in Tokyo, is credited with successfully introducing several Japanese commodity exchanges to ICCH's clearing and trading systems. But attempts to float IFM off from ICCH, which is owned by a group of UK banks, have so far failed. Reisch, a 45-year-old Australian, has been with ICCH since he joined the Sydney branch office in 1974. Like Eades, he is an information technology boffin, and has been responsible for group IT strategy. The two men also share a concern for assuring their personal succession; Reisch has six offspring, and Eades has seven. ***** Lawrence Churchill has been appointed as the first chief executive of National Westminster Life Assurance, the newly created life assurance subsidiary of NatWest, the second largest UK bank. NatWest Life opens its doors at the beginning of 1993 with capitalisation of Pounds 150m - 92.5 per cent NatWest-owned and the remainder Clerical Medical. Churchill joined NatWest from Allied Dunbar last September. He was director in charge of information technology, administration, and pension and management services. A devoted rugby enthusiast and Oxford-trained classics scholar, Churchill says his goal is to ensure that NatWest Life becomes the outstanding life assurance company of the 1990s. ***** Alan Thomson, previously finance director of Courtaulds Coatings for five years, started yesterday as the new finance director of The Rugby Group. His predecessor, Barry Hardcastle, 56, retired for health reasons at the end of last year. Thomson, a Scottish chartered accountant, who had been with Rockwell International in Switzerland, France and the US before Courtaulds, says he has been hired to develop Rugby's international side, particularly within Europe. Coatings has a very similar international portfolio to that of Rugby  -with operations in North America and Australia - but is much stronger in Europe, according to the French-speaking Thomson. ***** First Leisure, Lord Delfont's discotheque, ten-pin bowling and tourist attractions group, is to lose its finance director, Nick Irens. Irens had decided he would like to manage a company himself and with John Conlan, First Leisure's chief executive, firmly in place, there seemed little early prospect of Irens taking the top job there. Instead, after what all sides insist is an amicable departure, Irens will become chief executive of a new company to be formed via an agreed takeover of an existing company. Irens says, however, that although his company will be in the leisure sector, it will not compete directly with First Leisure. First Leisure is looking internally and externally for Irens' successor. ***** Peter Long has been appointed capital projects controller of SEVERN TRENT and finance director of Severn Trent Property, not of Severn Trent, as reported yesterday. ***** Larry Wilton is appointed md of PHILIPS Domestic Appliances and Personal Care division. ***** HEYWOOD WILLIAMS has promoted Matt Hankins, Tony Cox and Gillian Cruse as director of sales and marketing, operations and finance, respectively of Thurgar Bolle. ***** Gary Iceton has been appointed chairman of ST IVES web division. ***** Roger Ford moves from ICI to be NORTH WEST WATER's research and development director; Frank Toner moves from Cooper Industries to be finance director of the process engineering division. ***** John Cohlan and Kevin Gregory have been appointed directors of MOUNTLEIGH. ***** James Havard has been appointed a director of RANK XEROX (UK) with responsibility for total quality. ***** Peter Hare, formerly sales and marketing manager at National Power, has been appointed md of SCOTTISH POWER's energy trading division. ***** Stuart Guthrie-Brown, a director and company secretary of BOOKER, is leaving to resume a legal career. Guthrie-Brown had been deputy chairman of Fitch-Lovell, which was acquired by Booker in 1990.</p>

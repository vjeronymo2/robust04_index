			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 2 June CHUGAN CHOSON on page 70  reported that the National Security Planning Board [NSP] is  carrying out Director Kim Tok's promise to make it a respectable  agency. It will concentrate on gathering information that will  enhance South Korea's competitiveness. According to CHUGAN  CHOSON, a 30-page NSP publication "International Industry and  Business Information Report," carries information about  international business and trade, industrial technology,  resource materials, energy, and environmental issues. The  article pointed out that the high-quality information is  gathered by NSP agents worldwide which is unavailable to other  government agencies such as the Korea Trade Promotion  Corporation [KOTRA]. Much of it comes from specialized  magazines, technical journals, and newspapers where NSP agents  are stationed. The publication also provides medium and  long-range forecasts.    The NSP printed approximately 500 copies of its publication  and distributed it to government agencies, the Korea Chamber of  Commerce, the Federation of Korean Industries, and various  economic research centers. The article reported that consumer  response has been excellent and demand is so great that,  beginning this month, an additional 170 copies will be printed.  The NSP plans to pay special attention to disseminating  information needed by small to medium-size businesses and  regional university research centers.       The article praised the NSP for this worthwhile service, the  first of its kind in the agency's 33 years of existence.</p>

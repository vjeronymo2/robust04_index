			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered chief to quit - Management changes will result in splitting of leadership roles MR RODNEY GALPIN is standing down as chairman and chief executive of Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group. From the beginning of the year, the post of chief executive will be held by Mr Malcolm Williamson, currently Standard's managing director. Mr Galpin, who is 60, will hand over the chairmanship in May to Mr Patrick Gillam, former managing director of British Petroleum. Mr Gillam is currently Standard's deputy chairman. Mr Galpin joined Standard in July 1988 and became chairman and chief executive three months later. His appointment was encouraged by the Bank of England, which feared that confidence in Standard was eroding as a result of its poor financial performance. Immediately before he joined the bank, Standard had narrowly escaped being taken over by Lloyds. However, its shares were controlled by three Far Eastern investors, the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, Mr Tan Sri Khoo Puat and Sir YK Pao, known as the White Squires. Since then Mr Galpin, who had been an executive director of the bank with responsibility for supervision, reorganised Standard's management and has overseen a steady improvement in profits. He also reduced the influence of the White Squires over Standard's affairs. However, investors became concerned in the spring that Standard was still prone to accidents, when the bank became embroiled in an Bombay stock exchange scandal involving the forgery of securities. Standard has been forced to make a Pounds 100m provision to cover the risk of losses from its exposure to these securities. Mr Galpin said yesterday that he had been thinking about retiring for two months. The management changes at Standard were approved by the board on Tuesday. He said he had recommended that Mr Gillam should succeed him. He described the Indian losses as 'very annoying' but said he was confident that the bank was now robust. Standard also disclosed that two of its executives, Mr David Moir and Mr David Brougham, were also joining the board.</p>

Net profit was CDollars 5.8m (USDollars 4.2m), or 37 cents a share, against CDollars 2.4m, or 17 cents, on revenues of CDollars 180m, up 4 per cent. The quarterly dividend is being raised to 7 cents a share from 5 cents. SNC-Lavalin plans to buy control of several local engineering firms in Latin America and south-east Asia. It is well-established in western Europe and has operated in Russia for many years.</p>

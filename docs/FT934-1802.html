			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: Trenchant fixer who masterminded deal / Interview with Gatt chief Peter Sutherland Peter Sutherland, second cigar of the afternoon rolling between his fingers, leant back in his armchair in Gatt headquarters in Geneva. 'I think this is the first day in weeks when I can honestly say we haven't had a crisis,' he said. The nearest thing to crisis was a Christmas party for the staff of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Otherwise, this lakeside setting for the last dramatic weeks of negotiation of the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation had the air of a football stadium two hours after the end of a big match. In just six months, Mr Sutherland has taken the long-delayed negotiations by the scruff of the neck and wrung a conclusion where none had been possible for three Decembers. Perhaps history will say the round was by now ripe for plucking, but the importance of Mr Sutherland's role cannot be underestimated. Even before his appointment was formally announced at the end of June, he was putting in place a strategy for completion of the Round that has barely needed to be changed since: fix the December 15 deadline as firm and final; raise the profile of the Round to the highest possible level; and set a clear working agenda that paced progress from July. 'There was a point very early in July when I took what I felt was a very bold decision,' he recalls. 'It proved crucial. I simply recognised that unless the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in July did not come up with a clear, specific initiative, the Uruguay Round process was potentially destroyed: simple repetition of the generalised rhetoric of recent summits was simply not adequate.' So he met secretly with Japanese ministers in Paris at the annual conference of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim of ensuring that the Uruguay Round was 'the only issue for Tokyo'. That succeeded. The Tokyo summit, and the Quad ministerial before it including Japan, the US, the European Union and Canada, focused almost entirely on the Round. From there, he flung himself into a fearsome globetrotting agenda that began in the UK, moved on to South-East Asia and Latin America and the fringes of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank summit in Washington. He saw Germany's Helmut Kohl and France's Edouard Balladur, then leaders from the eastern and central European countries. He took individual trips to Japan and to India. 'This was not an ad hoc process,' he says. 'It was deliberately planned, calculated to get a certain momentum going - to create a political focus based on publicity that would ensure the maximum degree of movement.' In this he appears to have been a brilliant success. His public comments have never failed to be trenchant. His private comments appear to have been even more colourful. He has bawled out world leaders on the telephone; carpeted lobbyists and politicians of any creed that seemed inclined to block progress towards completion of the round. He wrought patience from irritable and frustrated leaders from developing countries who watched helplessly as the US and the EU wrangled over bilateral disagreements until the sand had almost run out of the hourglass. But behind the public relations, he put in place a work programme that remained in place up to the close of negotiations on Wednesday. He appointed deputies (there were none in place when he arrived). He appointed four 'friends of the chair' to chisel at specific problem issues such as market access, dumping, and trade in services. He set up daily strategy meetings to define blockages and to deal with them. He launched open-forum 'heads of delegation' meetings for negotiators to air frustrations. And he set firm rules for debate. But it was only on Sunday, with the breakthrough solving the dispute over US demands to change the rules regulating anti-dumping, that Mr Sutherland realised the deadline was in his grasp. 'This was an absolutely crucial breakthrough,' he said yesterday. 'We managed to convince the EU and the US that the longer they left it before they settled their differences, the greater the resistence there would be any proposals - even reasonable ones,' he said. The result was the dramatic US-EU 'agreement to disagree', which in reality dumped on to the Gatt secretariat five large problems to negotiate at the last minute in a multilateral context. These ranged from financial and audio-visual services, to shipping, textiles and intellectual property rights. Then he started to 'gavel through' approval of different parts of the negotiated text of the 550-page final act at a hectic pace. 'At one point, we were gavelling through at a rate of one article every five minutes - it became a matter of immense amusement,' one participant recalled. No-one paused to recognise that the gavelling process in fact had no legal authority. Yet the myth of the unchallengeable authority of the gavel remained intact right through to Wednesday evening, when the entire text was gavelled in a piece of pure theatre. 'Up to this moment, we have been firefighting,' Mr Sutherland said yesterday. 'The agenda has been driven by the Uruguay Round. From here on, we will be able to examine matters issue by issue.' He insists he has not yet charted a strategy for the future. A two-day retreat in January for himself and a small group of colleagues is intended to get that in place. But a more-powerful World Trade Organisation is likely to be a very different animal from the Gatt of the past 45 years. Planning the new structure and functions of the WTO will absorb much time. Perhaps Mr Sutherland's fighting qualities will be in less demand. 'If we were worried about the occasional fight, we would not have appointed an Irish rugby player as director general,' a colleague noted. Not just a rugby player - but a prop forward too.</p>

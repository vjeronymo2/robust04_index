			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Unease awaits Tokyo SE floats - Privatisations are putting prices under pressure History, said Karl Marx, tends to repeat itself twice - the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Investors in the Tokyo stock market, though improbable candidates to heed those words, are increasingly nervous that shares there may be about to prove the veracity of Marx's theory. The fear is that the market may be about to repeat its precipitous fall of last year, on the back of a substantial increase in equity supply. Last autumn, the Nikkei index lost more than 20 per cent of its value in a month, following the ill-starred debut on the stock exchange of the privatised railway company JR East. An already nervous market was flooded with Y1,000bn (Dollars 10bn) worth of shares from the floated company. The extra supply was too much for a weak market and it collapsed under the weight. This year, if Marx is right, tragedy could lurk in the form of a pair of companies with the identical acronym JT: Japan Telecom and Japan Tobacco. The first of the JTs tests the market today, when shares in Japan Telecom start changing hands. Traders yesterday were anxiously awaiting the listing  -which represents a cash call of more than Y150bn and is thought by many to be overpriced. However, next month an even tougher test will be set by the arrival of Japan Tobacco, the privatised tobacco and foods manufacturer. That flotation will drop more than Y900bn on the market. What worries investors is that between them, the two companies will inject even more equity into the stock market than JR East last year, and that that can have only dire consequences for share prices again this year. 'When you increase supply by that amount into a market where demand is still very weak, you could be in for trouble,' says Mr Neil Rogers, equity strategist at UBS Tokyo, Analysis by Nikko Securities Research suggests that share prices are put under extreme downward pressure when annual equity financing by Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed companies is greater than 15 times the value of average daily turnover. Without the two JTs, the total value of new equity financing for the current year would be about Y4,600bn, with an average daily turnover of about Y250bn to Y300bn. These figures already suggest a strain on prices. However, the extra injection of funds from the two issues raises the total financing figure to Y5,700bn - substantially more than 15 times trading levels. That may be too much for the market to tolerate. And there are additional concerns that the prices set for both Telecom and Tobacco are too high. At Y4.7m and Y1.44m per share respectively, most analysts agree the offer prices are well above fair values, and are nervous about the trend among many institutional investors to bid well below those prices in the auctions. Some analysts, however, are eager to point out important differences between this year's and last year's offerings. They say there are reasons to believe the market may find the JTs more digestible. For one thing, institutions are much more cautious about the issues this year, and that may itself limit any damage should they not go well. Last year, investors were convinced that the JR listing would bolster the wider equity market. As a result, there was heavy futures buying shortly before the listing. The substantial premium on equity futures encouraged traders to short the futures against the underlying stocks. When the JR stock disappointed, these investors were forced to sell their positions at a loss. This itself added about another Y1,000bn to equity supply. This time, institutions are less optimistic about the issues, and have not built up the arbitrage postions of last year. 'If you look at the big investors' positions this year, you can see that they have been much more cautious than they were before the JR listing,' says Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. Perhaps the main reason for believing that history may not repeat itself, however, is that Japan's economic fundamentals are in better shape this autumn than last. The JR East difficulties came at a time of growing unease about the pace of recovery, a sentiment that was exacerbated by the disappointing autumn interim results season. This year, there is more optimism that recovery is broadly-based and that it will be reflected in corporate earnings. However, there remains a nagging suspicion among traders that a poor performance by the two JTs could swing sentiment firmly against equities again. The level of individual interest in the Japan Tobacco issue in particular has been high. A big disappointment when the shares begin trading could set back the prospects of a wider return to the equity market by individuals for a long time. Without that investor confidence, the prospects for the Nikkei are highly uncertain.</p>

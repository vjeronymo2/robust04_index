			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pressac funds buy with Pounds 10m rights Pressac, the Nottingham-based manufacturer of automotive, telecommunications and lighting products, is buying McGavigans, another big UK supplier of automotive components, for Pounds 9.53m. The acquisition is being funded with a 1-for-2 rights issue of up to 12.3m new shares, priced at 85p apiece, to raise Pounds 9.75m. Pressac shares fell 10p to 100p following the announcement. The takeover of privately-held, Glasgow-based McGavigans is an important step for Pressac in broadening its components range as the car industry moves to reduce its supplier base. McGavigans, established in 1860, makes printed displays for dashboards, membrane switches for steering wheel horn pads and moulded three-dimensional displays. Sales and pre-tax profits were Pounds 7.2m and Pounds 937,000 respectively in the six months to August 31. 'It's an obvious fit,' said Mr Geoff White, Pressac's chief executive. For example, McGavigans makes the front panels for dashboard instrument clusters, while Pressac makes the printed circuit board that goes underneath. Mr White said Pressac would retain McGavigans' Kirkintilloch factory in Glasgow but may begin manufacturing some of its products in the US, where the Scottish company's presence is relatively weak. Pressac also reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 2.21m for the year ended July 31, and a raised final dividend of 2.08p to make a total for the year of 2.83p (2.57p). It believes the acquisition of McGavigans will have a beneficial impact on earnings per share in the current year to July 1995. Earnings per share rose from 4.86p to 5.6p in 1993-94. Overall turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 37.9m. The automotive business was the best performer, with turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 18.3m, reflecting improved market share and the introduction of new products, notably a heated mirror circuit board. On trading prospects, Mr White said the first quarter of the current year had started extremely well, especially in the automotive business. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 4.4m.</p>

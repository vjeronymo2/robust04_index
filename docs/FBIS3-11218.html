Baena said: "Issues such as the gap between those having too  much and those having nothing and the lack of equal  opportunities must be addressed to consolidate democracy."    He said: "I have noticed that there is growing awareness of  this problem among governments, which appear to have the  political will to address it in an orderly fashion."    Commenting on Cuba's readmission to the OAS, Baena said the  issue "is generally discussed in the hallways" of the OAS.    Baena noted that there are two positions on the subject: On  the one hand, there are those contending that "the time has come  to review the situation," while on the other there are  governments, such as that of the United States, that "contend  that first there must be internal changes in Cuba before  reconsidering its readmission."    Baena said he is in favor of revising the Inter-American  Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (TIAR), which was unsuccessfully  invoked by Argentina to obtain U.S. help during the Malvinas War.    Baena, who is a Brazilian diplomat, added: "Just as the OAS  amended its charter three times during the past 10 years, it is  necessary to revise the TIAR, which was signed under very  different circumstances than those prevailing today. We must  give new answers for new circumstances."</p>

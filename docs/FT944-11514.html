			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US jobs data fail to motivate Dow Wall Street After holding their own for most of the day in the wake of a broadly encouraging October employment report, US share prices dropped sharply in late trading as bond yields climbed to their highest levels in more than three years, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 38.36 at 3,807.52. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 5.63 at 462.28, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 1.66 lower at 452.91 and the Nasdaq composite down 6.02 at 766.08. Trading volume on the NYSE was 283m shares. The market opened in an uncertain mood after the eagerly-awaited October jobs figures proved a mixed bag for equity investors. The good news was that the labour market continued to grow last month, but not so strongly as to raise fears of resurgent inflation. The Labor department reported that non-farm payrolls increased by 194,000 in October, well below most Wall Street forecasts. The national unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell unexpectedly from 5.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent. Overall, the report was encouraging for stocks. Share prices, however, were unable to capitalise on the figures because bond prices fell for the fifth consecutive day. The bond market was upset by particular details within the jobs report, namely stronger than expected manufacturing employment and wage levels. As bonds dropped further in the afternoon, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year government issue to a new three year high of 8.16 per cent, stocks moved lower in tandem and the market closed at its lowest point of the day after a wave of late program selling. Among individual stocks, several prominent Dow issues took a beating in late trading. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 7 5/8 , International Paper lost Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 71 5/8 , and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 53. Eli Lilly fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 after the drugs group announced a deal with the Federal Trade Commission that will allow Eli Lilly to purchase the drugs distributor PCS. The company's share price had risen earlier in the week in anticipation of the agreement. Oil stocks, which were higher earlier this week, ran into selling, with Exxon falling Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 , Philips Petroleum Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 7/8 and Royal Dutch Petroleum Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 111 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Biogen dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 38 in volume of 3.2m shares as investors reacted to the news that the company had been served with several class-action lawsuits alleging federal securities law violations in connection with Biogen's plans to shut down activities related to its Hirulog product. Canada Toronto stocks posted solid losses with continued weakness in bonds and the US dollar. The TSE 300 index dropped 28.19 to 4,198.63 in volume of 52.7m shares. Thirteen of the 14 sub-indexes were down, led by transportation, metals, conglomerates and industrial products. Only paper and forest stocks posted gains, up 0.35 per cent on the day. Venezuela Caracas dipped another 2 per cent, this time as fund managers studied the government's new resolution on repatriation of profits, announced five weeks ago in an attempt to bring foreign investors back into the market, but only published this week. The fund managers thought that there would be big problems in implementing the resolution, and the Merinvest composite index fell 2.84 to 138.84.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERIAN TROOPS ATTACK, SEND REBELS RUNNING;  </P> <P> CIVIL WAR: GOVERNMENT OFFENSIVE GIVES PEACEKEEPING FORCES MORE TIME TO ARRIVE.  </P> <P> Government troops mounted a successful counterattack Sunday, dashing rebel  hopes of seizing the capital before a West African task force arrives to impose  peace. Troops also fired on civilians, and refugees said that at least 18 were  killed.  </P> <P> Bodies of refugees and pieces of clothing from their bundles of belongings were  seen scattered in the streets.  </P> <P> Troops from the government's 72nd Battalion advanced behind an armored car  Sunday morning from their camp in the Paynesville suburb on Monrovia's eastern  outskirts and cut off a group of rebels trying to take Spriggs Payne airfield.  </P> <P> The rebel troops ran away as government troops advanced. The government forces  opened fire on fleeing civilians.  </P> <P> Journalists counted the bodies of 15 people, including those of small children,  lying in a half-filled culvert where they had tried to seek cover. Three other  bodies lay in the road nearby.  </P> <P> Most of the 5,000 people who have died in the civil war to date were civilians  slaughtered by both sides because of their tribal affiliations. The war began  eight months ago, and today two rival rebel armies are fighting to overthrow  the government of President Samuel K. Doe.  </P> <P> In neighboring Sierra Leone, meanwhile, three ships carrying 1,000 Ghanaian  soldiers arrived in the capital of Freetown, after the leader of the  five-nation West African peacekeeping force launched an urgent appeal for a  cease-fire in the conflict.  </P> <P> West African leaders decided at a June 6 meeting in Gambia to send the  peacekeeping troops to Liberia. And on Saturday, the commander of the West  African force, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quianoo, called for the fighting to end  immediately.  </P> <P> "The situation in Liberia creates profound anxiety not only in Africa, but in  the entire international community," he said.  </P> <P> Prince Johnson, chief of one of the rebel armies, said Saturday that he was  sending a delegation to Freetown to make arrangements for the peacekeeping  force to land in Monrovia's port, which he has controlled for the past two  weeks.  </P> <P> Quianoo has not announced a date for deployment of the force. Military sources  in Freetown said departure of the force has been delayed by the need to carry  all its own supplies to Monrovia, which has been without fresh food, running  water, electricity and regular telephone communications for more than a month.  </P></p>

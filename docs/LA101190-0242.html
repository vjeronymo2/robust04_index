			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FRENCH FIRM TO CUT BRAZIL STAFF  </P> <P> The French chemical and pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc SA said today it  will slash 3,500 jobs from its Brazilian work force due to government austerity  measures that are crimping business activity there.  </P> <P> Voluntary layoffs are being conducted at the Sao Paolo-based Rhodia SA, which  makes chemicals, fibers and medical products, a company spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> "People that leave simply won't be replaced," she said.  </P> <P> About 2,000 workers have already left since Brazilian President Fernando Collor  de Mello instituted his anti-inflation austerity program last year. Another  1,500 are expected to go over the next two years, the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Rhone-Poulenc's first-half profits were off 13% from a year ago, partly due to  a $58.7-million loss at Rhodia. It was the first loss recorded by the Brazilian  division, which had been a jewel in Rhone-Poulenc's crown during the 1980s.  </P></p>

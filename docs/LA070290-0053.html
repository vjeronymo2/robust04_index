			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEN'S BEACH VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> KIRALY AND FROHOFF RISE TO OCCASION  </P> <P> Karch Kiraly was a bit worried before Sunday's Manhattan Beach Open final that  he and partner Brent Frohoff would still be in a "nap stage" when the  championship match began.  </P> <P> As it turned out, Kiraly and Frohoff woke up just in time -- when they were  down, 10-5 -- to top-seeded Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos.  </P> <P> Kiraly and Frohoff battled back to win, 15-13, and take the title in one of pro  beach volleyball's most prestigious events.  </P> <P> The winners split the first-place pot of $13,200. The winning point came when  Stoklos tried to go over Kiraly's block and missed wide with a spike.  </P> <P> It was also Kiraly who got his team even, 11-11, when he faked Stoklos to one  side, and dropped a shot into the open court.  </P> <P> "My goal for this summer is for Brent and me to come out as the best team on  the beach," Kiraly said. "Sinjin and Randy have been great for a long time, but  everybody wants to be No. 1."  </P> <P> Sunday was another big step in that direction for the sport's hottest new  tandem.  </P> <P> Kiraly and Frohoff have reached six consecutive finals, winning three, since  Kiraly switched from partner Kent Steffes in late May.  </P> <P> The pair practiced for only one game before teaming up to win the Venice Open  on May 29 with a 15-2 victory over Smith and Stoklos. They also won the Cape  Cod Open last weekend at West Dennis Beach in Massachusetts.  </P> <P> "We're really starting to click as a team," Frohoff said. "We're playing off of  each other really well right now, and that fires both of us up."  </P> <P> Smith and Stoklos have been the sport's dominant team for the last decade. But  they lost twice to Kiraly and Frohoff in Sunday's double-elimination  tournament, the first time in the winner's bracket final, which knocked Smith  and Stoklos into the consolation round.  </P> <P> Kiraly and Frohoff waited almost two hours for Smith and Stoklos to come  through the consolation bracket, setting up the final matchup.  </P> <P> Smith and Stoklos advanced to the final with a 15-10 victory over Tim Hovland  and Mike Dodd.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Kiraly napped.  </P> <P> "Sometimes a team can be a little too rested," said Kiraly, a two-time Olympic  gold medalist. "Then they never really snap out of it."  </P> <P> Kiraly and Frohoff did.  </P></p>

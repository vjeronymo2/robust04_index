Reports were delivered by  Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko and First Deputy Economy  Minister Valentyn Popov.    The Economy Ministry worked out two versions of the main  indices of the plan for 1994 on the basis of different price  rise indices against 1993, one estimating that prices will rise  7.4 times and the other 4.45 times. The intention of the  government and the Ukrainian National Bank to operate a tough  monetary policy in 1994 was taken into consideration, and the  indices under the second version were submitted for the Cabinet  of Ministers' consideration.    During the discussion of the plan It was stated that the  gross domestic produce last year exceeded 100 trillion [as  received] karbovantsi at current prices. The national income  generated fell 13 percent against the 1992 level and labor  productivity 10 percent. The catastrophic decrease in investment  activity continued. Due to growing inflation, last year's  volume of investments from the state budget turned out to be  exhausted almost entirely as early as in the first six months of  1993. Agricultural producers completed last year in difficult  conditions, and none of the beet growing regions, in particular,  fulfilled the state order.    The overall progress of denationalization, privatization,  and  corporatization of enterprises was held up by the imperfect  legislation and partial blocking of small-scale privatization by  local councils, state administrations, and ministries.    The meeting determined seven state priorities in the economy  for 1994, ranging from speeding up the development of  agro-industrial sectors, to designing and manufacturing weapons  and military hardware. Bilateral and multilateral trade and  economic relations between Ukraine and the CIS and Baltic states  are expected to improve in 1994. It is forecast that the volume  of foreign credit that will be attracted this year will be $697  million. In 1994 the policy of further delimiting state and  enterprise finances will continue.    It is planned to hold a news conference when the Cabinet of  Ministers' meeting ends. UNIAN will have the details in the  evening bulletin.</p>

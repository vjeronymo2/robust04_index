			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Rail sell-off campaign targets Tory marginals TWO RAIL unions yesterday entered the pre-election campaign with a warning that rail privatisation could cut services to Tory-held marginal constituencies. The campaign, which will cost Pounds 70,000, urges voters in the 62 most marginal Tory-held constituencies not to return candidates who support privatisation. The initiative is part of the rail unions' Campaign for Better Railways, which was launched two years ago. It began yesterday with the distribution to all BR employees of a leaflet setting out the unions' view of what privatisation will mean to them. The unions will use posters, advertising and leaflets to drive their message home to voters in the selected constituencies. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said the Conservative party was planning to include rail privatisation in its election manifesto. 'We know that the privatisation of British Rail will result in the destruction of much of our rail network,' he said. 'There will be closures of lines, fewer trains, much higher fares and, when the drive for profit takes over, safety margins will become depressed and narrower.' He said privatisation would push passengers away from trains and lead to further congestion on roads. Privatisation threatened the jobs of a third of RMT members, about 40,000 rail staff. Mr Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white-collar rail union, said: 'We know many passengers are saying 'anything is better than this'. We will show them that things are as bad as they are now because BR is already being forced to operate as a private company.' He said a white paper detailing government plans had been expected by the end of last year. 'So the first one to fail to achieve a Citizen's Charter target is the prime minister himself.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport minister, yesterday said privatisation would lead to an expansion of the railways. The white paper is expected this month. A confidential BR document leaked to the Labour party last month warned that privatisation would mean the loss of InterCity links for dozens of towns and cities in the UK, many in Conservative-held constituencies.</p>

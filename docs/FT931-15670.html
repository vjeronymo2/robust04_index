			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Invesco MIM expects to face disciplinary process INVESCO MIM, the fund management company, is under investigation by regulators and expects to face disciplinary proceedings. In a letter sent yesterday to shareholders in City and Commercial Investment Trust, an investment trust managed by Invesco MIM, the directors of the trust said: 'The directors of City and Commercial. . . have discussed with Invesco MIM an investigation which the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) is undertaking with Invesco MIM. The outcome of this inquiry is unknown but it is considered likely that it will result in some form of disciplinary process against Invesco MIM.' City and Commercial shareholders are shortly to approve a reorganisation of the investment trust, which is approaching its wind-up date. The investigation and probable disciplinary proceedings are considered material information which must be given to shareholders. The information was not disclosed in the original prospectus sent to shareholders in December, but City and Commercial's directors decided to release the information after taking legal advice. Officials at Invesco MIM would not comment yesterday. The investigation is believed to involve a general review of all the company's internal procedures and controls, and to have begun about a year ago. Imro is believed to have notified Invesco MIM in the second half of last year that it was likely to be the subject of disciplinary proceedings. In October 1991 Invesco MIM was fined Pounds 75,000 by Imro for poor administration of personal equity plans. It is also the subject of a writ by trustees of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme, a portion of whose assets it managed, in connection with the disappearance of more than Pounds 11m in assets via unusual stock lending deals. Last autumn Invesco MIM became the first UK fund manager to pay compensation to shareholders for mismanagement of an investment trust in its charge. It paid Pounds 9.5m to shareholders in Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust. The compensation stemmed from Invesco MIM's decision to invest Pounds 43m in a troubled company and its failure to disclose the extent of that investment to Drayton's shareholders and directors.</p>

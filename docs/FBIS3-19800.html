			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Potsdam (DPA) -- After the collapse of the  Potsdam coalition between the Social Democratic Party [SPD],  Free Democratic Party [FDP], and Alliance 90, the SPD and the  FDP have concluded an agreement about the continuation of their  coalition. SPD Landtag Group Chairman Wolfgang Birthler said on  Wednesday morning [23 March] that the current course of the  government will be continued. Speaking to the Landtag, Minister  President Manfred Stolpe (SPD), too, stressed that the Cabinet  is able to function. He did not rule out early new elections,  but a decision will be made by parliament. Normally, a new  Landtag would be elected on 11 September.    The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Landtag group, which is  in opposition, announced that it will not tolerate a minority  SPD-FDP government. New elections must provide clear conditions  in the land, CDU Group Chairman Dieter Helm said. He will  suggest to his group to put forward a motion for parliament to  dissolve itself on Wednesday if possible. Helm accused Stolpe  of trying to get by an "untenable situation" in an undemocratic  way. The CDU will not, however, put forward a motion for  no-confidence vote.    The Party of Democratic Socialism group wants to decide at a  special meeting this evening whether it will put forward a  motion for new elections in parliament. [passage omitted]</p>

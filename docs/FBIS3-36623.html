			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rasa Verseckaite: "The Independence Party Did </F> Not Commit Suicide"]    [Text] On Saturday [29 January], the Independence Party,  founded by V. Cepaitis [former leader later accused of  collaboration with the KGB], held its fifth congress in the  Teachers' House. The congress was attended by 99 delegates,  while the party itself has 316 members. Opening the congress,  party leader V. Sapalas (by the way, he was reelected for  another term) expressed his delight with achievements and his  distress with losses. He called the results of the elections to  the Seimas [parliament] the greatest political disgrace --  Lithuania was the first to declare independence and elect  communists to power. V. Sapalas regretted the humiliating  behavior of the right-wing parties before the elections who were  embarrassed to accept the Independence Party to their bloc.  "Our brothers in ideas turned away, while the Nationalists'  Party was the only one to extend a helping hand," said V.  Sapalas. He admitted that many people were waiting for the  Independence Party to destroy itself and merge with some other  party.    Maybe, not only then, but even now many people expected that  the Independence Party would sign a verdict for itself. "One  can call your party a team of persistent people," praised them  R. Smetona, leader of the Nationalists' Party. He added that  the plan of the Homeland Union to use Sajudis as a means of  annexing other smaller parties was unacceptable. It was also  incorrect to revive Sajudis at the cost of smaller parties.  Addressing the congress, however, Homeland Union leader V.  Landsbergis repeatedly proposed to rally together and join other  parties, maybe, the Homeland Union because it will be a force in  the future. According to V. Landsbergis, circumstances in  Lithuania decided the domination of two political blocs, and one  had to take this into account. As the best proof of his  statements, V. Landsbergis presented the results of the Seimas  elections -- about 15 percent of the votes were lost because  they were distributed among small parties and organizations.  Both V. Landsbergis' propaganda and A. Terleckas' [leader of  the Freedom League] opinion (the latter proposed that the  Independence Party merge with the nationalists and the  Democratic Party and elect R. Smetona leader) were dismissed.</p>

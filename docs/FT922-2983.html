			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / The Long View: No recession here, thank you THIS IS an uncomfortable time for the people who run Britain's privatised utilities - the results season. The companies are making good profits, their top executives are earning juicy bonuses; what a scandal, say the newspapers, when the country is languishing in the depths of the recession. Until British Telecom was floated in November 1984, there was no utility sector to speak of in the London stock market. After 7 1/2 years - comprising BT, British Gas, the water companies and the electricity industry  -it represents some 10 1/2 per cent of the All-Share Index capitalisation. It is bigger in stock market terms than banks, chemicals and construction all put together. Various political glosses were put on the privatisation programme, some of them retrospective: once out of the public sector the big utilities would be freed from the inappropriate public spending constraints laid down by the Treasury and moreover they would have a bigger incentive to run themselves efficiently. But one of the most important driving forces in the early days was purely financial: at the time the government still had a big deficit to finance and after ten years of huge issuance the investment institutions were satiated with conventional government securities. They wanted equities, and the pension funds and high income unit trusts in particular wanted those which paid high and growing dividends. So the government duly created some. The achievements of these designer equities have been well up to specification. The UK stock market might have been in a poor state without them. For example, their dividends have continued to grow at about 10 per cent a year - the size of Northumbrian Water's increase this week, for instance - but the All-Share dividends in aggregate have only increased by about 1 per cent over the past 12 months. So non-utility dividends have not grown at all. Utilities now pay out 13 per cent of the dividends distributed by the 655 All-Share constituents and they account for 18 per cent of the total earnings. Given that, say, 40 per cent of profits are earned abroad, utility profits represent about 30 per cent of all the domestic earnings of British quoted companies. This is not just good, it is much too good. Admittedly this is a somewhat distorted picture in the depths of a recession which has reduced the profits of the bulk of the corporate sector. But this, too, raises the question of why utilities are able to escape the agony of so many of their business customers - a question highlighted this week by the battle between British Telecom and the retiring telecommunications regulator and new Office of Fair Trading boss, Sir Bryan Carsberg. Gross trading profits of the corporate sector peaked at 15 per cent of GDP in late 1988, but have now fallen to about 11.5 per cent. Utilities have not shared in that squeeze. The worry is that the creation of a profit-conscious utility sector ready to exploit its monopoly position for commercial gain is doing serious harm to the competitiveness of the rest of the economy. Now, the arguments here are complex. Privatised utilities have been subjected to regulators in order to prevent monopoly abuse. In these areas Britain has adopted an RPI minus x formula for regulation, which in some cases has become very tight: at BT, x started at 3 per cent at the time of the 1984 prospectus, but has since grown to 6 1/4 per cent and is proposed at 7 1/2 per cent for next year. Whatever the precise figures, this is a better approach than simple cost-plus, especially for industries where technology is changing fast. Under the RPI minus x formula utility companies have an incentive (and maybe a necessity) to cut their costs and reap rewards. But it is hard for regulators to judge just how much scope there is for improving efficiency. The old nationalised industries, apart from being under the thumb of price-fixing politicians, often seemed to be run for the sake of a quiet life at the top and to reward huge workforces. The bigger the workforce the more likely was the boss to get a knighthood. Now, it seems, the priorities are different. PowerGen cut its workforce by some 25 per cent last year. And as the x factor bites the P45s are proliferating at BT too: its UK payroll numbers have shrunk from 239,000 at the end of 1990 to 221,000 last year, and expected to fall to under 190,000 by the spring of 1993. To the extent that the labour force is bearing the pain, the extra profits earned by the utilities may not, after all, be at the expense of the rest of the company sector. Yet in a low growth economy the case for high utility profits is weaker because investment requirements are lower: the UK economy will only achieve about the same output in 1992 as in 1988, so there is scarcely the same need to expand the infrastructure as there seemed to be in the mid-80s when an economic 'miracle' had propelled growth to 4 per cent a year. Where does this leave shareholders? One reason for distributing shares around millions of Sids was to ensure that there would be a more influential constituency than just the pension funds. Even so the political risks have seemed scary at times: water was under a particular cloud ahead of the election, but the sector index jumped by a third afterwards. Besides the electoral risks, investors will probably become aware of other cycles as they acquire experience. The economic cycle will be at its most favourable during the downturn when utilities are faring much better than most other companies. During a general period of earnings recovery they will appear rather dull. Fundamentally, however, you would expect utility company shares to be sensitive to economic growth, or the lack of it. That is why it is worrying that share prices in the sector appear to have been sustained by backward-looking dividends rather than by forward-looking growth projections. But there is no need to be a killjoy: if you see Sid, don't tell him.</p>

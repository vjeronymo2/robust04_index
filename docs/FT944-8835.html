			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Saudis due to start Gulf payments Saudi Arabia will next week pay back part of a Dollars 4.5bn sovereign loan it took out in 1991 to help cover the costs of the Gulf war, bankers said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. They said the payment was due on November 21 or 22, the third of five quarterly instalments of Dollars 900m each. Bankers said the repayments were watched carefully as evidence of Saudi Arabia's financial health after reports in the west that Riyadh might try to delay payments. The Saudi government made the first payment last May on its first-ever sovereign loan.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car industry issues aluminium warning The use of aluminium in European car manufacturing should only grow slightly in coming years because of price volatility and competition from steel, said Mr Patrice Natier, general manager of Sogedac, the purchasing arm of the Peugeot Citroen group, Reuter reports from Paris. 'Aluminium's share of the European car market is likely to remain relatively close to current levels, at least for the next four or five years,' Mr Natier told a Metal Bulletin conference. Mr Natier cited 'erratic fluctuations in aluminium prices' as one of the main obstacles to an increased use of aluminium in the European car industry. 'Everyone in the car industry is looking for more stable aluminium prices to be able to make the right long-term decisions,' he said. 'If aluminium prices return to Dollars 1,800-2,000 per tonne, this is likely to put a strong hold on aluminium use in the car industry,' he added. He called for co-operation between the car industry and aluminium producers for 'fixing purchasing contracts unconnected to short-term developments in market prices'. Mr Natier predicted that over the next 10 years, aluminium's share of total vehicle weight would increase from 6 per cent to around 10 per cent, or from 60kg to 100-110kg. Only government regulations limiting fuel consumption could boost the use of aluminium in the European car industry, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An official Chinese delegation led by Prime  Minister Li Peng arrived in Almaty this afternoon for a four-day  visit. At the airport of our capital, which was decorated by  the state flags of the two countries and welcoming slogans, the  delegation was met by President Nazarbayev and other officials.  Kazakhstan Ambassador to China Murat Auezov and Chinese  Ambassador to Kazakhstan Chen Di were also present. [passage  omitted]    The program for the visit envisages talks between Nazarbayev  and Li Peng in a narrow circle as well as talks between the  delegations. The prime minister will hold a meeting at the  business center with representatives of the business circles of  Kazakhstan and a large group of their Chinese counterparts who  have arrived in Almaty. Li Peng will visit the Merey furniture  production joint stock amalgamation, hold a news conference, and  familiarize himself with places of interest in our capital.    An agreement on the Kazakh-Chinese state border is expected  to be signed as result of the talks, as well as agreements  related to a commodity loan and humanitarian aid given by China  to our Republic. These documents will be added to the range of  joint agreements which have been signed concerning bilateral  political, trade and economic, scientific and technical, and  cultural relations. These include the joint declaration on the  foundations of friendly relations, which is the main document  determining future cooperation between the two neighboring  states. This was signed last October, when Nazarbayev visited  China.</p>

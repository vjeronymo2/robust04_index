			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / PM's entourage hedges export bets MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, could find himself in the centre of a commercial dogfight when he arrives in Kuala Lumpur next week on the second leg of an official visit to Japan and Malaysia. In line with his policy of making every overseas trip a flag-waving exercise for British industry, Mr Major will be accompanied by a dozen leading businessmen, led by Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and a former Tory cabinet minister. Downing Street has refused to release the names of the others involved. However, Japanese officials confirmed that Mr Major will be accompanied by Lord Young of Graffham, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless and former trade and industry secretary, and Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications. Cable &amp; Wireless and BT are understood to be pursuing a share of a potentially lucrative contract to provide a second telecommunications network to compete with Telekom Malaysia, the monopoly domestic carrier. Telekom Malaysia is also seeking overseas partners to help develop its internation operations. Lord Young would say only that Cable &amp; Wireless was 'trying hard' to win a share of the contract. Mr Vallance was not available for comment. However officials confirmed the companies were 'not entirely happy' about the presence on the trip of both chairmen. 'Frankly, it is bizarre,' said one. 'This sort of thing really confuses foreign governments. How are they supposed to know which company is representing Britain? This sort of trip is quite important when you are dealing with government licences, but it's anyone's guess what the Malaysians will make of this.' The prime minister may also find himself mediating in Tokyo, where Mr Anthony Greener, chairman of Guinness, will press hard for changes in Japanese excise laws, which discriminate against imported spirits such as Scotch whisky. Guinness wants Tokyo to follow its decision earlier this year to abolish import tariffs on spirits by removing the excise tax advantage enjoyed by Japanese spirits. 'Hopefully, the fact that we are going with the prime minister will underline our view that it is time for Japan to do this,' Mr Greener said. 'It cannot be allowed to stand in the way of good relations between Japan and Britain.' The other businessmen accompanying Mr Major will be: Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce; Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry; Mr John Russell, a former chairman of ICI Japan; Mr Peter Williams, chairman of Oxford Instruments; Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the construction company; Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas; Mr Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever; and Sir David Scholey, chairman of securities group SG Warburg.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 15, BNS -- The Episcopal Conference of  Lithuania, the highest governing body of the Lithuanian Catholic  Church, expressed regret about "how irresponsibly the press,  radio and television use freedom and mislead the public."    In a statement circulated Tuesday [15 March], the conference  said Lithuania is flooded with various religious cults and sects  that "reject the teaching of the Christian Church, disseminate  the ideas and superstitions of `the new age,' which are  extremely dangerous to those who do not have deep Christian  fundamentals.    "We regret that even priests sometimes irresponsibly use  public communication means and spread ideas that cannot be  reconciled with the Christian doctrine." The statement mentions  a case when a priest on television spoke about contacts with  extraterrestrials.    The Episcopal Conference urged media sources to be more  responsible and not to dig up sensations about "travels in  space" and other miracles, "which deliberately or  unintentionally ruin the true faith and contradict the teaching  of the Church."</p>

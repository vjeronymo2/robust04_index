			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Right chemistry? At last Fisons gets a new finance director. Tipped as a takeover play since a profits warning in December - coinciding with the early retirement of finance director Roy Thomas and red card for chief executive Cedric Scroggs  -Fisons has nominated David Hankinson as finance chappie. He's been around a bit - Fisons will be his seventh job in 15 years - and tends to end up at companies which have a record of attracting the predators. Having jumped ship at Lucas, he had hardly settled into his job at Ranks Hovis McDougall when it was taken over by Tomkins a year ago. Still, Fisons' shares moved not a jot yesterday, so perhaps the waters have calmed a little.</p>

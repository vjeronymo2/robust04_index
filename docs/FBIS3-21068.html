What sounds like warning a given  today about the consequences of destroying the environment is in  fact already 86 years old. In the year 1907 President Theodore  Roosevelt expressed his concern about this in his message to the  United States Congress.    The admonition is still as timely. It was established at the  1992 United Nations Conference on "Environment and Growth" in  Rio de Janeiro that "the world must now face the beginnings of  an ecological revolution or will risk an ecological collapse and  economic demise."    There have been warnings, action is now called for. In order  to ensure that damages to the environment do not become  irreversible, it is necessary to institute unavoidable  fundamental changes in the production, consumption, and disposal  of goods. Society must place a higher value on conservation and  efficiency, and to an even higher measure emphasize renewable  energy sources. As a rule of thumb, for every ton of waste  material from a product at the end of the latter's useful life  there were five more tons of tailings lost in manufacture of the  product and 20 tons of the material lost during during its  shipment. Doubling the average useful life of a product not only  would cut in half the energy consumption and the amount as well  as pollution but also would delay depletion of natural resources.    Environment-friendly production technologies need to be  developed and products need to be made more durable, i.e., their  useful life needs to be lengthened and their repair, i.e.,  maintenance needs to be simplified. Engineering diagnosis, by  the way, can be helpful in optimizing the design of products for  a longer useful life and their easier maintenance.</p>

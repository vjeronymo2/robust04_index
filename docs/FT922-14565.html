			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / UK Gilts: Prospect of Labour win hits prices A WEEK of trepidation looms for people in the government gilt-edged securities market. Many gilt specialists reckon a Labour win in Thursday's general election will cause a run on sterling, higher interest rates and increased public sector borrowing - all of which would push up bond yields. As results from opinion polls indicating a Labour lead fed their way into market thinking, prices for gilts fell last week by up to  3/4 of a point, continuing the poor run for the securities which started in the week prior to Budget day on March 10. Since then, 10-year gilt yields have risen by 80 basis points - 0.8 of a percentage point - to about 10 per cent, with a consequent reduction in prices. A big fear for the market concerns sterling, which some gilt investors believe would come under pressure following a Labour victory. Base rates might then have to rise to defend the currency, an event which would push up gilt yields along the yield curve but especially at the short end and depress prices. Farther in the background, but no less of a problem for the market, is the size of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). In the Treasury's latest prediction, this is likely to rise to Pounds 28bn this financial year and Pounds 32bn in 1993-94, from Pounds 14bn in 1991-92. To fund the PSBR, the Bank of England will probably have to sell Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn worth of gilts a month over the next year or so, a huge selling programme that will almost certainly push up yields and depress prices. While the Treasury's prediction assumes Tory policies, should Labour form the next government, public-sector borrowing might be forced up still more. According to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, Labour policies could add Pounds 15bn to the figure over the next two years, leading to a further drift downwards in prices. Mr Briscoe assumes Labour would cancel privatisation sales planned by the Tories, reducing government revenues by Pounds 7bn over the two years and pushing up borrowing by the same amount. Further, he thinks Labour's proposal to let local authorities spend cash obtained from sales of houses and other assets during the 1980s would add a further Pounds 8bn to the PSBR during the two-year period. Assuming a Labour victory or a Labour-led coalition, Mr John Smith, the new chancellor, would have to introduce a Budget, probably before the end of May. Ahead of this event, according to Mr Andrew Bell, a strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the gilt market would be affected by great uncertainty while the Bank would have to proceed with its large programme of gilt sales which has already been interrupted by the election. That could lead to the Bank attempting to sell up to about Pounds 5bn of gilts during a time of weak demand for the securities, events which could depress market conditions. During last week, such gloomy thoughts preoccupied many gilt traders, with short-dated gilts bearing the brunt of the decline in prices. The benchmark 10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1994 fell by nearly 3/4 point to 98 13/16 , with a rise in yields from 10.2 per cent to 10.55 per cent. Longer maturing stock was better protected from the price fall; the 9 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2008 saw a fall of about  1/2 point, closing on Friday at 94 1/8 for a yield of 9.7 per cent. With gilt prices having tumbled so much recently, some believe buying support will rally as investors pick up what could be perceived as bargain stocks. Mr David Boardman, head of fixed income at Fleming Investment Management, a big bond investor, said: 'At the prices we have seen recently, gilts are beginning to look attractive.' From the point of view of the Bank, which badly needs to get on with its funding programme, indications of heightened interest in gilts would be welcome. The Bank would like to see a return to the position in February in which, according to the latest funding statistics, it sold to the market a hefty Pounds 1.6bn worth of gilts, with purchasing from overseas investors especially strong.</p>

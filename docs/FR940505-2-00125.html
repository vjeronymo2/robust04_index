The complete application may be obtained for a fee from SEC's Public Reference Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant is a diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On April 25, 1986, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1993. The registration statement became effective, and applicant's initial public offering commenced, on June 17, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On July 29, 1988 and October 1, 1988, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution whereby applicant would be restructured as an operating company by reincorporating it as a Cayman Islands corporation that would engage in the secured lending business. Preliminary proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were filed with the SEC on August 2, 1988. Amended proxy materials were filed on or about October 11, 1988. A pre-effective amendment was filed on or about November 23, 1988. Proxy materials were mailed to shareholders on or about December 8, 1988. The reorganization was approved by applicant's shareholders at a meeting held on February 3, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On February 21, 1989, applicant transferred all of its assets, which consisted of cash, to a Cayman Islands corporation, The Scandinavia Company, Inc. (the ``Company''), in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. At the time of the exchange, applicant had outstanding 6,415,810 shares of common stock with a net asset value per share of $8.41. Applicant's shareholders received one share of the Company's common stock for each share of the applicant's common stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In connection with the liquidation and dissolution of applicant, expenses due and payable before the reorganization were paid by the applicant, and expenses due and payable after the reorganization were paid by the Company. Such expenses were as follows: Legal fees_$447,397; accounting fees_$39,700; printing_$21,084; mailing_$13,633; proxy solicitation fees_$10,500; exchange agency fees_$1,080; and proxy statement filing fee_$8,264; for a total of $541,658.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. As a result of the liquidation and dissolution, applicant, the Company, the applicant's former director, and applicant's majority shareholder were named as parties to three class action lawsuits filed by applicant's shareholders in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits alleged, among other things, that the proxy materials mailed to shareholders in December 1988 were false and misleading, that the conversion of applicant's assets to cash without shareholder approval violated section 13 of the Act, and that the Company violated the Act by adopting a stock option plan and by filing periodic reports with the SEC as an operating company rather than an investment company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On May 20, 1991, the parties signed an agreement settling the suits. The settlement was approved by the court on July 30, 1991, and it became final on August 30, 1991. For purposes of the settlement, all persons who owned shares of common stock of the applicant or the Company (other than the defendants and their affiliates and those persons who submitted valid and timely requests for exclusion) during the period February 1, 1988 through June 30, 1990 were deemed ``Settlement Class 1.'' All persons who owned stock of the Company at the time of the public announcement of the settlement were deemed ``Settlement Class 2'' (the members of Settlement Class 1 and Settlement Class 2, collectively the ``Class Members'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company paid $.085 for each share of applicant's common stock that the members of Settlement Class 1 held as of February 1, 1988 and sold at a loss before December 10, 1988. The Company also paid to Class Members who held shares of applicant's common stock as of February 1, 1988 and sold such shares for less than $6.00 per share during the period from December 10, 1988 to September 26, 1989, an amount equal to $.25 per share. Pursuant to the foregoing, the Company paid claims aggregating approximately $32,500. The Company also agreed to commence an issuer tender offer to purchase 952,500 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price equal to the market price increased by a premium of 16% of the market price, but in no event more than $5.25. The offer was commenced on May 24, 1991 at a purchase price of $4.07, and was consummated on July 22, 1991, resulting in the purchase by the Company of 609,613 shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $2,481,125. The Company also paid the legal fees of counsel to the plaintiffs and certain expenses of settlement in the total amount of approximately $280,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In consideration of the settlement, the Class Members discharged the defendants of any claims arising from conduct relating to the management or operations of applicant or the Company, the use and investment of their assets, the preparation and dissemination during the settlement class period of false or misleading proxy materials and annual or periodic reports, and the failure of the applicant or the Company to conduct their businesses as investment companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. As of the date of the amended application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. As a condition to the application, applicants expressly agree that all books and records required to be kept pursuant to rule 31a-1 under the Act will be preserved for a period of not less than six years after the date of applicant's liquidation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

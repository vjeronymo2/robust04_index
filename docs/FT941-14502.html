			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / MPs attack powers given to ministers: De-regulation bill will make it easier to repeal laws - Employers will be able to 'override agreements' on job shedding MPs yesterday hit out at the powers the bill will give ministers to repeal regulatory measures without primary legislation. They also questioned parliament's ability to subject the government's actions to adequate scrutiny. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Labour would resist the government's attempt to take the power to overturn acts of parliament by order of ministers. 'These laws were passed . . . to improve safety at work and to give the consumer a fair deal,' he said. 'They should not be torn up without the same full parliamentary process.' Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the bill gave ministers 'staggering' powers to 'axe' legislation and bypass the floor of the House of Commons. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said parliament's role would be 'drastically reduced'. Mr Bob Cryer, Labour chairman of the Commons statutory instruments committee, said it was 'a bit rich' for the government to say it was removing regulations by giving ministers' powers to make more. The scrutiny of delegated powers was 'not adequate in parliament at the moment', Mr Cryer said, predicting that the bill would make matters worse by adding to the 'tidal wave' of regulations the government was producing. Under scrutiny procedures set down in the bill ministers would have a duty to consult those likely to be affected by a proposal before making an order to put it into effect. They would then be required to lay a draft order before parliament, with an explanatory document setting out the reasons for the measure and other details. Forty days would have to elapse before the final order was submitted for debate and approval in both houses of parliament. Pressure on parliamentary time is such that it is usual for orders and statutory instruments to be debated in the obscurity of a Westminster committee-room rather than the main debating chamber. It is also common practice for them subsequently to be nodded through rather than going to a formal vote. But mechanisms do exist for MPs to force both a debate on the floor of the House and a formal vote where the issue is deemed serious or controversial enough to warrant it. Once submitted, however, orders cannot be amended in the way that bills can be. According to the government the interim 40 days would provide an opportunity for additional parliamentary scrutiny. It suggested yesterday that this might be undertaken by new scrutiny committees, with powers to question witnesses, in both the Commons and the Lords. Under the government's suggestion it would be 'appropriate' for these committees to be able to recommend either that a proposal should not proceed in the way intended or that it should go ahead only if amended. Ministers acknowledge that the final decision on what form parliamentary scrutiny should take rests with the cross-party procedure committee. Sir Peter Emery, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said yesterday it would start considering the matter next week. The bill states that ministers should 'have regard to' any representations made during the period for parliamentary consideration.</p>

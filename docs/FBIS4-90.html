			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria, March 31 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on  Thursday [31 March] announced a state of emergency in  kwaZulu/Natal.    He said he had communicated his decision to African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday morning.    The state of emergency would come into operation as soon as  the necessary regulations were published.    Mr de Klerk was of the opinion that the state of emergency  was necessary because circumstances in the region threatened  public safety. Ordinary law was inadequate to ensure pulic  order, he said.    Mr de Klerk told a news conference at the Union Buildings  that negotiations with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Mr  Buthelezi should continue despite the decision to declare a  state of emergency over kwaZulu/Natal.    Mr de Klerk said it was important that the position of the  Zulu monarch should be accommodated constitutionally.    He was of the opinion that the state of emergency would  create the opportunity to find solutions, and that it would  bring about an atmosphere that would facilitate free and fair  elections.    He declined to say how Mr Buthelezi and Mr Mandela had  reacted to his decision, saying they would respond themselves.    President de Klerk said the state of emergency, which would  apply to Natal, including the self-governing area of kwaZulu,  would see a substantial increase in security force manpower  levels in the province.    However, Mr Buthelezi would remain chief minister and run  his  own administration.    Mr de Klerk also said the election would continue on the  scheduled dates of April 26-28, and there was no need for the  South African public to panic. Sufficient numbers of security  forces would be deployed in South Africa to ensure law and  order, and government would not allow anarchy to develop.    He said there was no need for people to store up food as  though they were preparing for a siege.    Mr de Klerk said he envisaged that the state of of emergency  regulations, which were still being drafted, would provide for  stricter control of marches, public meetings, and would provide  for the detention of people.    There would also be "some form of prohibition" on the  carrying of weapons, but this was still subject to discussion.    It went without saying that there would be good co-operation  between the South African security forces and the kwaZulu Police.    The actual management of the state of emergency would be  left  in the hands of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the  police.    He said had the state of emergency not been declared, there  would have been a serious deterioration in the security  situation in kwaZulu/Natal.    There were strategies from more than one side towards  destabilisation, he said.    He did not foresee a need for the call-up of additional  part-time SADF members.    Mr de Klerk said no date had yet been set for the meeting  between himself, Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, and the Zulu king.    Mr de Klerk was accompanied to the news conference by  Justice  and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee, a police General van der  Merwe, and the chief of the army, Gen H Pretorius.    Mr de Klerk said the state of emergency may be promulgated  later on Thursday.    He had only decided to declare the state of emergency on  Thursday morning, and only he, as head of government and head of  state, could declare a state of emergency.    The decision was not initiated by any outside party or  institution.    The perception that the state of emergency had been ordered  or requested by an outside source was wrong, he said.    It had not been taken at the behest of the Transitional  Executive Council, but on the advise and analysis of the  government's intelligence services and security advisers.    It was also wrong to see the development as a first step  towards destabilising the kwaZulu government. The decision had  nothing to do with any such goal, said Mr de Klerk.    "I will only make inroads on their authority if there is  maladministration and i have no evidence of that."    He would also intervene if the kwaZulu government did not  co-operate in making free and fair elections possible, but the  kwaZulu government was giving its full co-operation in this  regard.    The state of emergency would help to protect the kwaZulu  government against any threats or efforts to destablise its  position, Mr de Klerk said.    Action in terms of the state of emergency would be taken  against anybody involved in any actions which constituted a  threat to the security of kwaZulu/Natal, or a threat of  violence, he said.    Free and fair elections in the region would be compatible  with the state of emergency, because free political activity and  meetings would be allowed. But advance notice would be required  in terms of the regulations, Mr de Klerk said.    The declaration was made in terms of the legal prescriptions  for interaction with the TEC, he added.    The declaration would also enable the IFP to be free to  continue democratic and peaceful opposition to the election, Mr  de Klerk said.    The state of emergency would see the deployment, on an  incremental basis, of fairly large numbers of SADF [South  African Defense Force] troops.    In terms of the law the state of emergency would apply for a  year but it would be lifted as soon as circumstances permitted.    Mr de Klerk said the regulations might affect the freedom of  the press.    "It might, I do not know of any specific regulations in the  draft regulations at this time. In the past it has. I do not  think that the press has anything to fear however in this  regard."    Mr de Klerk had considered also placing the Witwatersrand,  where unrest areas had been declared, under a state of emergency.    "I would not say that it is probable that at this stage  parts  of the Witwatersrand would also be changed to a state of  emergency, but we will continue to keep a close watch."</p>

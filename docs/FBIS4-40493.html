			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Kotov] </F>   [Text] Delhi, 17 June -- India is seriously interested in a  dialogue between the Government of Tajikistan and opposition  groupings on national reconciliation, which is being conducted  at the United Nation's initiative. However, the Indian  Government has decided to leave open the issue of its  participation alongside with Pakistan and Iran as an observer at  these talks, a regular round of which will take place in  Islamabad soon.    Salman Khurshid, Indian minister of state for external  affairs, stated this position of the Republic during his visit  to Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was informed by sources in the Indian Ministry of  External Affairs that the minister of state informed Prime  Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in detail about the results of his  talks with the leaders of the central Asian countries and in  particular about the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. In  the opinion of sources at the Indian Ministry of External  Affairs, the situation on the border between Tajikistan and  Afghanistan will be discussed during the upcoming visit of the  head of the Indian government to the Russian Federation 29  June-2 July.    India intends to maintain close contacts with all the  participants in the inter-Tajik through its embassy in Dushanbe  talks because it is very concerned about the situation on the  border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. In New Delhi's  opinion, it influences the situation in the entire region and  can affect India's security, which is anxious that the conflict  in Tajikistan not become threatening and not become a repeat of  the bloody Afghan war.    Nevertheless, representatives of the Republic's Ministry of  External Affairs stressed that India's official participation in  the talks between the Tajik Government and opposition as an  observer is deemed inexpedient as such a precedent may lead to  Pakistan intensifying its demands to be included in possible  talks between the Indian Government and Muslim political  groupings on normalizing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

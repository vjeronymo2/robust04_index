			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUY STOCK, CHRYSLER EXECS TOLD  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca today urged nearly 100 top company managers  to buy Chrysler stock in order to give them more of a direct personal stake in  the auto maker's fortunes.  </P> <P> Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said the executives were being asked to spend up  to a "certain percentage" of their salary on shares in the No. 3 auto maker.  </P> <P> He declined to name that percentage.  </P> <P> Automotive News, a trade publication, called the program unprecedented in the  auto industry.  </P> <P> "The theory essentially is that, as a matter of company policy, you like to  have top people in the company have an even more vested interest in the  performance of the company and its future," Houston said.  </P> <P> While the move follows a significant drop in the value of Chrysler stock -- 37%  from its 52-week high according to Automotive News -- Houston insisted that the  two developments are not connected.  </P></p>

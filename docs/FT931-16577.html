			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Heathrow acts over jet vortex damage A Pounds 5M programme to prevent low-flying aircraft sucking the tiles off roofs was announced yesterday by Heathrow Airport. Hundreds of houses in the Heathrow area will be protected after the first comprehensive study of the vortex phenomenon. Vortices are circulating currents of air generated by aircraft. The study found that fewer than 0.1 per cent of aircraft movements (about 400 a year) cause damage and that is usually limited to about six tiles. Now houses, mainly in the Cranford, Hatton and East Bedfont areas, as well as churches, hospitals and schools near Heathrow, will have metal clips fitted to hold down the tiles.</p>

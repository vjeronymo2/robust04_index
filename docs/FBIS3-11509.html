			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Terrorist Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias  Feliciano, who is considered to be the new Shining Path chief,  limps on his right leg and is totally bald. Police intelligence  sources believe he uses a toupee or wig.    The intelligence services indicate that Feliciano, the son  of  a well-known retired Army general, is the most influential  leader in the collective national Shining Path leadership, the  main unit of that organization since the capture of its founder  Abimael Guzman Reinoso.    Various departments of the National Intelligence System  (SIN)  have, until now, been unable to obtain any new information on  the whereabouts and the physical appearance of the terrorist.    Latest reports suggest that he is in the southern part of  the  country, but this is unconfirmed. There is also evidence that  his hideout is in metropolitan Lima.    The PNP [National Peruvian Police] and the SIN only have two  photographs of Feliciano: One is 12 years old, and the other  dates back to 1988. This second photograph was taken from a  video tape confiscated at the house in San Borja where it is  believed Guzman took refuge.    The photograph is blurred and his physical aspects are not  shown clearly. Ramirez uses glasses in both photographs. He  wears glasses and is in a stage of advanced baldness.    The only new aspect to now is information regarding the limp  and the toupee, according to details obtained from Shining Path  members captured during the past few months.    No one close to Ramirez has yet been captured who could help  draw an identifiable picture of his physical appearance.    It is not exactly known how he obtained the limp, but it is  known that it was acquired some years ago.    One police officer commented that it is possible he is now  completely bald and that he uses a toupee. "It is not  inconceivable for him to be walking about Lima with a false  identity and new physical features," the source added.    Analysts suggest Feliciano leads the hard line -- Pol Pot  style -- sector of the terrorist group because his position is  opposite to that of Guzman and of the main "historical leaders"  of Shining Path. The hard line sector has been attributed with  the most recent attacks.</p>

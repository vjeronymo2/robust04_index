			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> IVANA SEEKS HALF TRUMP FORTUNE  </P> <P> Ivana Trump asked a court today to declare that she is entitled to half of her  husband Donald's estimated $5-billion fortune, but her lawyers said she is not  seeking a divorce.  </P> <P> Michael Kennedy, Ivana Trump's attorney, told a news conference, "This is not  an action for either divorce or separation. Mrs. Trump remains committed to her  marriage and her family.  </P> <P> This is an action to obtain rights to half the fortune which the Trumps built  together during the course of their 13-year-marriage."  </P> <P> A 24-page complaint was filed with New York State Supreme Court against Donald  Trump, the real estate magnate whose marital problems have been the talk of New  York for the past month. He has allegedly been linked with an actress named  Marla Maples but has not sought a divorce or separation from his wife.  </P></p>

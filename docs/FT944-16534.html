			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Doubt cast on exclusion zone in the south: Advantages seen but feasibility questioned by IISS director It would be 'very difficult' to establish a military exclusion zone in southern Iraq analogous to that in the north, Mr John Chipman, director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said in London yesterday. However, such a zone would have definite advantages for those countries, notably the US and UK, which have committed themselves to defend Kuwait and 'will want to alleviate the task of performing that role'. Mr Chipman, speaking at the launch of his Institute's annual 'Military Balance' (a review of armed forces and weapons around the world), said it would 'require a lot of manoeuvring in the next 24-48 hours' to set up an exclusion zone. Last night, however, there were indications at the UN that the US was backing away from the proposal. A zone, in which the movement of troops and associated equipment would be prohibited, would have three advantages, he suggested: It would make it much more difficult for Iraq to create a threat on the Iraq-Kuwait border. It would make it difficult for President Saddam Hussein to use his armed forces for the purpose of repressing the Shiites in southern Iraq. By confining the elite Republican Guard to central Iraq and denying them access to both the north and the south, it might sow doubt in the minds of Iraq's military leaders about the capacity of their commander-in-chief (Saddam Hussein) to control and defend Iraqi territory. But Mr Chipman also saw two problems with the scheme. 'First, how will it affect the relationship with other permanent members of the Security Council, in particular Russia? Secondly, what are the political consequences in Iraq of pushing the Republican Guard around in this way?' There might be disadvantages as well as advantages, he suggested, in continued uncertainty in both northern and southern Iraq. Mr Ahmed Hashim, a research associate at the institute, added that if the zone were established, Iraqi dissidents based in Iran might move into it, and this 'would result in a three-way partition of the country'. Even if the Tehran government did not favour such a development, Pasdaran (revolutionary guard) units in southern Iran might give weapons and advice to the Iraqi Shiite forces based in their area, who are loyal to the 'Supreme Council for the Islamic Resistance in Iraq'. Yesterday, the Supreme Council's London office claimed that the Iraqi regime 'has transported chemical and biological weapons' into southern provinces where there have been signs of popular unrest. It also claimed to have reports from both central and southern Iraq that 'the Iraqi people in general are beginning to show their rejection and criticism of the latest aggressive movements of troops towards the Kuwait border'. They were also starting to show their rejection and criticism of the effects of soaring prices and lowering living standards.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Sales show consumers keen on cleanliness IN SPITE of impressions to the contrary, Britain is increasingly becoming a nation of squeaky-clean people who wash their clothes regularly and take pride in keeping their homes spick-and-span. According to a new report from Euromonitor, the market research company: 'The 1970s hippies and 1980s punks have given way to the 1990s conformist, with the mid-1980s spending boom fuelling a youth culture geared towards smart and sophisticated attire and quality clothes.' Partly because of food hygiene scares, consumers have placed an increasing emphasis on cleanliness in the home in recent years and demand for household cleaning products, such as kitchen cleaners and washing powders, has grown strongly. The overall market for such items grew by 8.7 per cent in 1989 and was estimated to have expanded by a further 7.1 per cent in 1990, showing few signs of abating, in spite of recession. The trend towards more expensive clothes and fabrics has increased demand for specialist cleaning products, although not at the expense of environmental considerations, which, Euromonitor suggests, represent the 'overriding influence' on the UK household cleaning market. British consumers are increasingly using environmentally friendly trigger-action sprays and are rejecting phosphate-laden detergents. However, in spite of the general increase in cleanliness, the humble bar of soap has surprisingly been one of the few in the market to suffer and has steadily lost sales to more sophisticated products.

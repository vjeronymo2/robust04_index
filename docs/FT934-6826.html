			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Emap The strong rise in advertising revenue at Emap's consumer magazines and regional newspapers in the past few months must have had creative types twanging their red braces with excitement. It would be tempting to believe good times are back for advertising agencies and media stocks. Emap's extravagant share rating certainly suggests as much. But Emap's experience is likely to prove particular rather than general, reflecting the focused readership its publications offer advertisers. Whether Emap can sustain growth in circulation revenue by raising cover prices above the rate of inflation must remain its chief concern, however. Even if the chancellor refrains from slapping VAT on printed matter next week, it seems likely it will follow eventually. That will forestall further price rises. Yet Emap has proved to be a canny operator. Further acquisitions and launches should keep it ticking along. The media sector as a whole is unlikely to prove as perky.</p>

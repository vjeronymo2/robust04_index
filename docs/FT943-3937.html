			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / PM confident Clinton will rebuff Adams The government is confident that Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, will turn down a request to meet Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, who is expected to visit the US later this month. The Irish government is understood to believe that a meeting between the Sinn Fein leader and Mr Clinton would move the peace process forward. However, Downing Street, which is opposed to Mr Adams being granted a visa, has lobbied hard against any meeting with the US president which it believes would enrage unionists. It is confident that the US State Department has accepted its advice. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has revealed that it was a call from him to Mr Clinton which cleared the way for a US visa to be issued to Mr Joe Cahill, a veteran republican, on the eve of the IRA ceasefire. Mr Reynolds said he believed that the ceasefire would not have come about if the visa had not been issued to Mr Cahill. Meanwhile European Union foreign ministers were briefed in Germany by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, on the peace process. Mr Hurd said the IRA would have to prove by 'words and deeds' that its ceasefire was permanent. Mr Spring said he believed the joint declaration signed in Dublin on Tuesday by Mr Reynolds, Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist SDLP, proved that the Irish government's interpretation of the IRA ceasefire announcement was correct. 'As far as we are concerned, the leadership of the IRA has made a declaration, they have renounced violence and that is on a permanent basis,' he said. It was now up to the British government to respond positively by announcing its acceptance of the ceasefire. The province is already guaranteed nearly Pounds 1bn in EU aid and the Irish Republic Pounds 6bn in the next six years. But Mr Spring made clear that more must be done 'to meet the needs of the new situation'. The EU has already contributed about a third of the Pounds 230m made available so far to the International Fund for Ireland, set up after the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1989 to support peace initiatives through job-creation schemes and other aid. The call for more cash won the approval of the other foreign ministers, who instructed the European Commission to draw up plans for extra funding in consultation with London and Dublin. However, final proposals are not expected to be ready until December. Mr Hurd tried to reassure unionists that they had nothing to fear from the peace process. He said: 'I hope they will recognise that it is a straightforward decision by the IRA that the armed struggle is not working, it is not producing results and that they should abandon it as prescribed in the Downing Street declaration.' He also indicated that there would be no early lifting of the broadcast ban on Sinn Fein.</p>

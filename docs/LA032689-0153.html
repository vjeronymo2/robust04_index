			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Joel Steinberg, convicted of killing his illegally adopted daughter, spent the  first full day of his maximum sentence in a Brooklyn jail cell awaiting  transfer to prison, officials said. The disbarred millionaire attorney, who was  sentenced Friday to 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison for beating to death 6-year-old  Lisa Steinberg, was forbidden visitors and was only allowed out of his cell for  an hour of recreation in a jailhouse gymnasium, said Department of Correction  spokeswoman Ruby Ryles. He was being held in punitive segregation, which  entails being locked in a cell for 23 hours a day without radio or television,  because he was discovered earlier this week with a 4-inch shank fashioned from  a sharpened plastic spoon, she said. Steinberg's first stop on the transfer  route will be the state's Downstate Reception Center in Fishkill.  </P></p>

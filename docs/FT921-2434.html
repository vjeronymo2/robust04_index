			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (26): Keeping tabs on software customers - User View: Supplier finds the right system to maximise the use of time and staff and simplify its IT strategy. THE CHOICE of the correct database was essential to Powertec, a software house specialising in human resource systems, writes Claire Gooding. 'With the sort of systems we install, people constantly want changes,' explains managing director Tony Ive. 'We give support over the line via modems, so that our customers can add screens, items, or change their applications, so we were looking for a database which could store all that customer information. Open architecture was very important to us.' So 'open' were Powertec's intentions that the other two contenders alongside Starbase user, Oracle and Ingres, lost favour with Tony Ive, despite their ability to run on different hardware. See Starbase supplier profile, below. 'If you buy Oracle, then you are tied to using other Oracle products and tools. With Starbase, you can use it with Cognos' own database, or with any other file structures; HP, DEC, anything under Unix. 'The ability to read other file structures, from different hardware systems elsewhere, was vital, from our users' point of view.' Powertec claims around 35 clients for its package, built up over three years: the most recent installation supports 50 concurrent users, all of whom are able to interrogate the database directly. There are further advantages to Powertec customers, according to Mr Ive. 'As far as the package users are concerned, Starbase is totally invisible: they don't know it's there. Starbase is also self-tuning, which means that users don't need in-house database expertise to run it properly, as they would with Ingres and Oracle.' This, he says, greatly simplifies the strategy for information technology, and helps to make the best use of time and staff: there is simply no need or technical database knowledge. 'The benefits come in the speed with which clients can respond to changes, and make alterations very swiftly.' Note: as a value-added reseller for Cognos, Powertec would not usually qualify for a user interview. Cognos' proposed user-site declined to be interviewed for this issue of Software At Work, but Powertec's views provided some useful insights in substitution.</p>

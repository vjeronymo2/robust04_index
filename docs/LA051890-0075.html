			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLHILL'S CANCEROUS LARYNX IS REMOVED  </P> <P> Surgeons removed the voice box of former hostage Robert Polhill on Thursday in  what doctors called a successful operation to rid his body of cancer.  </P> <P> "He's in intensive care after undergoing surgery," Walter Reed Army Medical  Center spokesman Ben Smith said.  </P> <P> "His condition's good.  </P> <P> Smith quoted doctors as saying the cancer had not spread beyond Polhill's  larynx, or voice box.  </P> <P> Polhill, 55, was freed April 22 after more than three years in captivity in  Lebanon.  </P> <P> Army Dr. Russ Zajtchuk said Wednesday that Polhill, a smoker, will not be able  to speak normally after the operation but he will be able to communicate,  perhaps with an electronic larynx.  </P> <P> Polhill, whose voice was faint and raspy in the days following his release,  also will receive radiation treatment after his recuperation.  </P></p>

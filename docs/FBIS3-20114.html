			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, Italian Social Movement </F> secretary and National Alliance leader, by `s.m.' in Rome; date  not given: "But Bossi Is an Attila; He Will Never Be Prime  Minister"]    [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Well, Mr. Fini, have you and  [League Secretary] Bossi really managed to come to an agreement,  as [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi maintains? And yet, in this  electoral campaign, you have attacked each other day in, day  out...    [Fini] My judgment has not changed. Bossi is the Attila of  Italian politics. When we sit down around a table, the League  will have to scale down its pretensions. And Bossi will not  only be the one who will count less, but he will end up like the  one who in general goes and buys the cigarettes.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And who will be prime minister?    [Fini] The electorate will point that out, and the president  will appoint him. This is not a decision for party secretaries.  One thing is certain: The prime minister can never be someone  like Bossi. For the simple reason that a member of the League,  an exponent of a party which is not national, cannot be prime  minister. Strauss was the leader of Bavaria but he never dreamed  of putting himself forward for the chancellorship.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And Berlusconi?    [Fini] As far as I am concerned, Berlusconi can be prime  minister without problems.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is a government with League and MSI [Italian  Social Movement] ministers possible?    [Fini] Yes, on condition that the League is clear on two  points: a clear decision in favor of national unity and genuine  solidarity between the north and the south.    [LA REPUBBLICA] They too are asking you to state your  position on federalism. Is that all right for you?    [Fini] What they call federalism can in our view be called  decentralization. If this is what it is, we can discuss. If, on  the other hand, they wish to despoil the state of all its  skills, if they are looking for three republics, the answer is  no.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The PPI [Italian Popular Party] maintains  that the Pact for Italy is the only lineup that seems ready to  govern. How do you respond to this?    [Fini] I too saw [PPI Venice Regional Secretary] Rosy Bindi  on television. She said they already had their program in the  drawer. I do not find it difficult to believe her: It is the  same one they have had for the past 40 years.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Who says that a Berlusconi-Fini-Bossi  majority will not be quarrelsome like the old five-party system?    [Fini] All coalition governments are exposed to the danger  of  internal conflicts. The Left too had its difficulties, it seems  to me. But what is the alternative? The single party?</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Hopes for Swan Hunter rescue package collapse: Receivers fail to agree going-concern sale with CMN Prospects for a sale of troubled shipbuilder Swan Hunter to Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie collapsed yesterday after CMN and receivers Price Waterhouse failed to agree a deal. With the abandonment of negotiations for a going-concern sale to French-owned CMN, 164-year-old Swan Hunter, one of the world's great shipbuilding names, looks almost certain to close. CMN, the only prospective bidder to emerge from a worldwide search by the receivers, yesterday put forward proposals to acquire a section of the Tyneside yard and intellectual property rights. It said this might enable it to place a short-term design contract with Swans, postponing next Friday's design-team redundancies. After final talks in London ended in stalemate, joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said: 'The gap between us was too large to bridge and in these circumstances no purpose could be served by continuing talks to sell the business to Soffia/CMN.' He said the receivers' next task was to discuss the implications with Swans' remaining 660 employees. Price Waterhouse and union leaders will meet today. Following the news of the failure of the sale, TUC general secretary Mr John Monks last night wrote to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, urging him to give the government's support to Swan Hunter's fight for survival. With a deadline of Friday for the dismissal of Swans' design and technical team - a move which would end the company's prospects of tendering for more work - Price Waterhouse is urgently reviewing other approaches made by potential buyers during the 15 months of receivership to see whether any offers a last hope of a going-concern sale. If that cannot be achieved, the company's physical assets on both banks of the Tyne and its intellectual property will be sold off piecemeal in the coming months. The last vessel on Swans' order book,the Type 23 frigate Richmond, will be completed in November. Mr Allen Donnelly, the Tyne and Wear Euro-MP, said: 'The whole sad series of events reflects the UK government's determined efforts to take Swan Hunter out of the defence procurement industry.' In the latest of several proposals made in recent months, CMN had offered Pounds 5m for the assets, against an estimated break-up value of Pounds 7.2m. But price was not the only sticking point: the unions and the receiver were unhappy at CMN's proposals for the workforce, which faced lay-offs without pay. After more than a year of talks, CMN, which proposed setting up a shelf company to acquire Swans, had still not provided financial guarantees to underpin the transaction. Mr Peter Chapman, one of the union leaders, said last night: 'We're disappointed we haven't got a conclusion, but while we're still working on the last frigate we still have some time.' Shipwright Mr Harry Cooper said: 'We're destined to die, everybody thinks that now.'</p>

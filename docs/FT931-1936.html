			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Letter: Russia: effective assistance with safeguards and a contradiction (1) Sir, The current major constitutional crisis in Russia poses an awkward dilemma for the Group of Seven: whether to provide large-scale assistance to Russia with the risk of its being wasted by a new government slowing down or reversing stabilisation and transition, or wait and see, thus contributing to Boris Yeltsin's demise. But there appear to be two forms of financial assistance which could be safely and effectively pledged immediately, regardless of future political and constitutional developments. These are: the provision by IBRD (World Bank), EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), and other financial institutions of investment funds for energy, military conversion and agro-industry, which might be well utilised in any case as long as they were not channelled through the Russian central bank, which effectively sabotaged Gaidar's 1992 programme, but through more direct and controllable channels; the provision of funds to cover partially and up to a maximum ceiling, for a half or whole year in the first instance, the cost of additional unemployment in Russia. This form of assistance would be 'robust' with respect to uncertain developments: if Yeltsin were ousted and stabilisation and reform stopped or reversed there would be no significant increase in unemployment and therefore the western commitment would be automatically voided. An immediate announcement should strengthen popular support for Yeltsin's likely initiatives, like a plebiscite or a presidential takeover. The amounts involved in supporting additional unemployment may be substantial. There has been a tendency to evaluate the effectiveness of dollar grants at the purchasing power in Russia of their rouble equivalent at a vastly undervalued exchange rate. However, aid would be used to finance imports of consumption goods on which the unemployed would spend their benefits, and therefore the dollar value of necessary real aid should be calculated at international prices.

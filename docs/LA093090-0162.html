			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE'S CALLING THE SIGNALS;  </P> <P> L.B. SYMPHONY FINDS ITS TEAM PLAYER IN JOANN FALLETTA  </P> <P> Three years ago, when the Long Beach Symphony's directors failed to renew  conductor Murry Sidlin's contract, there was talk of football in the Terrace  Theatre.  </P> <P> "I see the music director as the quarterback," board president George M.  Murchison said, "and we want to improve the team's record. I want to see a  better passer in there."  </P> <P> Sidlin was livid. He said comparing music to sports is inappropriate and  offensive.  </P> <P> His successor, JoAnn Falletta, a week ago introduced concertmaster Roger Wilkie  during a lecture before the season's opener this way:  </P> <P> "It's sort of like I'm the coach and he's the quarterback."  </P> <P> Then the diminutive maestro, who is 36, added sweetly, "I don't know how Roger  feels about being described that way."  </P> <P> The orchestra's management feels just fine about it. For if the board of  directors wanted a conductor who is a team player, they seem to have found one  in Falletta. And if better passing means selling more tickets, well, the  youthful maestro is a veritable star.  </P> <P> Since Falletta took artistic control of the 90-member group last year, overall  ticket sales have increased by 54%, said Mary Newkirk, the orchestra's general  manager.  </P> <P> With an increase in the price of admission, she said, revenues are up 76%. And  for the first time in its 56-year history, Newkirk said, the orchestra has  begun a season, Falletta's second as conductor, with its classical music series  sold out before the first concert.  </P> <P> "We've seen an enthusiasm that we simply have not known before," Newkirk said.  "There's no question but that JoAnn has already made a mark on the orchestra;  she is one of the stars of her generation."  </P> <P> Even the maestro's series of pre-concert lectures, which Sidlin performed in  the 900-seat Center Theatre, had to be moved to the adjacent Terrace Theatre,  which seats 3,000, Newkirk said.  </P> <P> "We found we were turning people away," she said. Average attendance is about  1,500 per lecture.  </P> <P> And the attention paid the conductor by the national media seems to have  brought a new level of exposure to an orchestra that, just six years ago, was  struggling back from the brink of financial oblivion. Earlier this month,  Falletta was on the cover of "Musical America," a major national journal of the  classical music industry. And focusing on her as she led the orchestra during  the recent season opener were several CBS cameramen, filming an upcoming  profile by Charles Kuralt for "CBS Sunday Morning."  </P> <P> Why all the fuss over someone whose main claim to fame is the directorship of a  regional orchestra that many consider overshadowed by the much-better-known Los  Angeles Philharmonic?  </P> <P> Part of the answer, Falletta's admirers admit, is that she is young and female,  both of which are relative anomalies in the close-knit world of conducting.  </P> <P> But beyond that, they say, is her musical style: one marked by verve, tenacity  and a kind of vivacious energy that most audiences find hard to resist.  </P> <P> "She has young ideas," said Ray Bisso, a member of the orchestra's board of  directors and chairman of its artistic advisory committee. "Yet she still has a  good traditional grasp of things. It's a perfect balance."  </P> <P> Donna Perlmutter, a Times critic who reviewed the Sept. 22 concert, described  Falletta as "a genuine podium master with considerable flair," who extracted  from the orchestra a "plush, full-bodied, integrated sound" containing, at  various times, "propulsion and heat" as well as "vigor, breadth, excitement and  no surfeit of sentimentality."  </P> <P> Many audience members seemed to agree.  </P> <P> "She's terrific," Carole Atkin, a longtime concert-goer, said during the  intermission. "She's improved the quality of the orchestra tremendously."  </P> <P> Amy Blender said: "She's lent an enthusiasm, a vitality and a vibrance that has  captivated all of us and given an electric quality to the performances. JoAnn  is really impassioned with the music; I've waited a long time for her."  </P> <P> Falletta modestly attributes her success at attracting audiences to being in  the right place at the right time.  </P> <P> "We, as a symphony, are part of the renaissance of Long Beach," she said during  an interview at the downtown Villa Riviera, where she recently bought a  condominium unit. "It's the right kind of cultural environment; I was very  fortunate to (come to) an orchestra poised for growth."  </P> <P> She has tried to aid that artistic and financial growth in several ways. She  has broadened the orchestra's musical repertoire to include the works of such  little-performed composers as Bela Bartok and Bohuslav Martinu. She has  expanded the group's traditional youth and kinder-concert programs to reach a  far greater number of children (and potential future concert-goers) in area  schools. And she has supported the careers of today's struggling young  composers by providing a forum in which their works can be performed.  </P> <P> Later this season, for instance, the orchestra will perform the first work in  its history that it commissioned: a piece by Mark McGurty, a young California  composer.  </P> <P> Falletta has also become a "team player" in ways that orchestra board members  say was lacking in the past. As required by her contract, she spends at least  100 days a year in Long Beach. Besides her downtown apartment, she maintains  homes in Denver, where she directs the Denver Chamber Orchestra (she also heads  a group called the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic in San Francisco), and in New  York, her hometown.  </P> <P> When in Long Beach, she averages five speaking engagements a week on behalf of  the symphony. And, in general, the youthful conductor has become a highly  visible member of the community and an effective advocate for the orchestra,  Newkirk said.  </P> <P> "She's remarkably centered and remarkably strong," Newkirk said.  </P> <P> Musicians, while generally praising her, tend to be somewhat more restrained in  their assessments. Steve Scharf, a violinist who has been with the symphony for  10 years, describes Falletta's musical personality as "cool and no-nonsense,"  in contrast with Sidlin's "rush and fire."  </P> <P> "I'd like to see a little more clarity," he said of her conducting style. "I  don't always read her" intentions.  </P> <P> John Hollenbeck, principal trombonist, said Falletta tends to concentrate on  the mechanics rather than the emotions of the music -- a focus he said the  symphony needed.  </P> <P> "I think we play cleaner now," he said. "We have a much better ensemble."  </P> <P> And Allan Carter, a violinist with the orchestra since 1974, said that, while  preliminary indications are good, the jury is still out on whether it will be a  marriage made in heaven. "We're still getting used to her," he said. "I hope  the orchestra will grow as much under JoAnn as it did under Murry. It's too  early to tell."  </P> <P> As far as management is concerned, the verdict is a foregone conclusion.  Already, Newkirk said, the orchestra is negotiating with Falletta's managers  for a three-year extension of her $70,000-a-year contract, which expires in  June. "I would imagine she will get a raise," Newkirk said.  </P> <P> Falletta, meanwhile, is brimming with plans for the orchestra's future, many of  which involve schemes for attracting people to the concert hall who have never  been there before.  </P> <P> In that regard, her major problem is too much success. "The fact that we're  sold out has been a problem," Falletta said. "We can't really reach out to new  people. We're almost stymied."  </P> <P> To help make performances more accessible to new audiences, Newkirk said,  orchestra staffers have begun contacting season subscribers before each concert  to request the return of any unused tickets.  </P> <P> They are also, she said, planning to add concerts in future years that will be  separate from the regular season.  </P> <P> But for now, Newkirk said, things are running smoothly for the newly  constituted Long Beach Symphony. Does she fear that the rising media star at  its helm might some day leave the orchestra behind?  </P> <P> Falletta "is definitely going to be going places," Newkirk said, "but Long  Beach is going along with her."  </P></p>

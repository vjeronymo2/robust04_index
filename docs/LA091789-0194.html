			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KENNARD SEEKS HER OWN WAY ON HIGH COURT  </P> <P> Justice Joyce L. Kennard, strengthening the belief that she may provide pivotal  votes on the state Supreme Court, says she has established a "streak of  independence" since joining the court last April.  </P> <P> "I can assure you I am not a token presence," Kennard, the court's only female  member, said in an appearance Friday night before the California Women Lawyers,  most of whom were here for the annual meeting of the State Bar of California.  </P> <P> During the Bar's gathering on Saturday, its Conference of Delegates adopted a  resolution urging state lawmakers to reject attempts to weaken privacy and  abortion rights, should the U.S. Supreme Court cut back on such rights under  the federal Constitution.  </P> <P> Kennard's remarks Friday, made in her first major public speech since joining  the high court, indicated she may frequently serve as a centrist "swing" vote  on the conservative-led state court.  </P> <P> Kennard, 48, was the surprise choice of Gov. George Deukmejian to succeed  Justice John A. Arguelles, who retired from the state high court last March.  </P> <P> At the time, she was generally expected by legal experts to follow the same  moderately conservative path of the four other Deukmejian appointees to the  court. But her relatively brief judicial record -- three years as a trial and  appellate court judge -- still left considerable uncertainty about her  philosophical views.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unexpected Votes  </P> <P> Since joining the high court, Kennard has often joined with the conservative  majority. But, somewhat unexpectedly, she also has sided with liberals in some  notable instances.  </P> <P> For example, in her first majority opinion, she upheld the death sentence of a  convicted killer. But in another case, with three conservative justices  vigorously dissenting, she wrote a lead opinion that sharply limited the  ability of prosecutors to bring second-degree felony-murder charges against the  provider of an illegal drug that results in the death of the user.  </P> <P> In another case, Kennard broke ranks with the conservative majority when the  court widened the power of municipalities to use zoning ordinances to restrict  the location of theaters that show sexually explicit movies. In her dissent,  Kennard expressed concern that the legal standards the court set were too vague  for theater owners to follow.  </P> <P> In her speech, Kennard warmly praised the other members of the high court but,  without discussing any particular cases, emphasized her intention to chart an  independent judicial course.  </P> <P> "The votes I have cast in certain decisions and opinions I have authored have  established a streak of independence," she said. "This independence did not  stem from a desire to disagree. I did what I did because, as I saw it, the law  and facts dictated a particular result in a particular case."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Welcomes Gains of Women  </P> <P> Kennard also welcomed the gains women have made in recent years in the legal  profession -- a part of her speech that drew an enthusiastic reception from her  audience.  </P> <P> "How nice it is to see so many women in their proper place -- here at the State  Bar . . . rubbing elbows with the 'old boys,' " she said with a smile.  </P> <P> Kennard is the second woman to serve on the state high court. The first, Chief  Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, left office after being denied reconfirmation by  voters in the November, 1986, election.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Conference of Delegates' adoption Saturday of the resolution  designed to protect abortion rights in California came by an overwhelming voice  vote.  </P> <P> The measure was passed as an expression of sentiment from the 500-member  Conference, which is composed mainly of representatives of local Bar  associations. The resolution would become official policy of the Bar if  approved later this year by the Bar's Board of Governors.  </P> <P> One of the proponents, Grace E. Emery of Santa Ana, told fellow delegates she  is "pleased and proud" the measure was supported by the delegation from Orange  County, "the land of rugged individualism and the home of John Wayne."  </P> <P> "Keep the government off our backs and out of our bedrooms," Emery declared.  </P> <P> During a brief discussion of the issue, no delegates spoke against the  resolution. But afterward, Andrew Landay, a Los Angeles lawyer, told reporters  he was dismayed that the measure passed.  </P> <P> "I'm all for choice, but the choice has to be made before intercourse," Landay  said. "The right to privacy shouldn't have precedence over the right to life."  </P></p>

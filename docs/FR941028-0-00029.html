			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.23 provides the course of action which a regulatory authority is required to take if the review conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of the section discloses any ownership or control link between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;773.23 requires that the regulatory authority notify the applicant of such link and refer the applicant to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;773.23 requires that the regulatory authority not approve the permit application unless and until it determines that all ownership or control links between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice are erroneous or have been rebutted, or the regulatory authority determines that the violation to which the applicant has been linked has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) or the State program equivalent. The determinations to be made by the regulatory authority under paragraph (b)(2) of the regulation are made in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.24, procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS, and &sect;773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, or their State program equivalents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.23 requires that, following the regulatory authority's decision on the application or following the applicant's withdrawal of the application, the regulatory authority is required to promptly enter all relevant information related to the decision or withdrawal into AVS. The regulatory authority's decision could include unconditional issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit. The requirement that all relevant information be promptly entered into AVS is intended to insure that AVS is continually updated to reflect the most current information available with respect to permit applicants. A critical source of such information is the regulatory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 773.24 is a new section that establishes the procedures to be followed if a person wishes to challenge an ownership or control link between a person and any other person shown on AVS. The procedures to be followed by both OSM and the challenger are included. The section provides procedures for direct appeals of such links to OSM by persons who have been so linked. The section also provides for challenges concerning the status of violations to which persons shown on AVS have been linked. The section further provides the opportunity for those persons making a challenge to obtain a temporary relief from any adverse use of the challenged link or violation information during the pendency of such challenge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS is an ownership or control link to any person could challenge such a link in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.25. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides, however, that such challenge is not available if the challenger is bound by a prior administrative or judicial decision with respect to the link. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that challenges of ownership or control links shown on AVS are made before OSM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership or control link to a person cited in a Federal violation notice seeking to challenge the status of such violation may do so in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.25, which are discussed in detail below. The procedures applicable are similar to those described in paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``status of the violation'' means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal to contest the validity of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i)&hyph;(ii). This usage is carried forward into paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;773.24 and into the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of &sect;773.25. The process for challenging the status of a Federal violation is a Federal process and such challenges will be made before OSM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In challenging the current status of a violation under &sect;773.24 or 773.25, a person will not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited unless the challenge is made by a permittee within the context of the improvidently issued permit process or by an applicant after permit denial. In general, the existence of the violation will have been established by prior administrative or judicial proceedings involving the person cited in the violation notice, or by such person's failure to exhaust its available remedies in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Israel eyes wider EU trade ties - But talks stall over pace of drive into Europe Israel is seeking long-term strategic economic integration with Europe in its negotiations over a new trade association agreement due for completion by the end of the year. But the negotiations, which made substantial progress earlier this year, have stalled over differing views of the pace of Israel's economic drive into Europe. Israeli officials say they envisage the agreement leading to a fundamentally new relationship between Israel and Europe under which Israel will be granted the same status as members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) within the framework of the European economic area. 'We want the benefits of economic membership of the EU without political membership,' said Mr Oded Eran, the co-head of the Israeli negotiating team. Israel's push towards Europe reflects the growing position of the EU as Israel's main trading partner. Last year the volume of Israel-EU trade was Dollars 14.4bn, 40 per cent of Israel's total trade, and is projected to increase next year to almost 50 per cent. Senior EU officials say they share the long-term vision of Israel having a special place in Europe but believe the process should be evolutionary. The EU is growing increasingly frustrated with Israel's rigid demands in agriculture and public procurement which could derail efforts to sign the agreement by the end of the year. 'You can always ask for the moon but we are saying take what you have got and continue from there,' said Mr Juan Prat, European Commission director general, on a recent visit to the region. Mr Prat said the EU had already made considerable concessions to Israel in the current talks which would institutionalise political dialogue and help to reduce Israel's Dollars 6bn trade deficit with Europe. Under the agreement, Israel will become the first non-European country to gain access to the EU's research and development programme. The EU has also revised rules of origin and accepted the principle of rules of origin to allow products resulting from Arab-Israeli joint ventures access to the free trade area. The changes in the rules of origin will have a favourable impact on Israeli exports of high tech, electronic and communications products. But while Israel has said they are satisfied with these concessions, they want the EU to open further its agricultural market to cut flowers, easy peel citrus fruits, table grapes and processed products such as juices. The move is opposed by southern European states, notably Spain and Italy. Israel argues the EU must recognise that, as part of the Middle East peace process, it has opened its markets to Palestinian agricultural produce in the face of opposition from Israeli farmers and is being asked to make further trade concessions to Jordan. Peace with Syria would involve an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, further damaging Israeli agriculture. 'We are being asked to make trade concessions to the region to consolidate peace and, in return, we are asking Europe to make an economic balance by deeper association,' said Mr Eran. 'Agriculture is the perfect example where Europe could offset the concessions we made to Palestinians by making concessions to us.' Israel is also holding out for concessions in opening of the EU market for public procurement in telecommunications and says the EU's demand for a reciprocal opening of all sectors of public procurement would worsen its trade deficit. The EU says it accepts Europe must play a critical role in cementing Middle East peace and is prepared, as a much bigger economy, to make uneven concessions to Israel but it expects some reciprocity. Mr Prat said Israel had not complied fully with the 1975 trade agreement. An example, he said, was Israel forcing a one year certification process on imported tourist buses from Spain. Mr Prat said the EU wanted to reduce Israel's trade deficit and the agreement, as it stands, would considerably help to narrow the deficit. But he said: 'Israel has a structural trade deficit with the world, including the European community. . . The agreement will help the trade deficit and this is our objective but it is not the miraculous solution.' Ultimately the dispute between Israel and the EU is more about timing. Israel wants a huge leap forward in economic relations enshrined in the new association agreement. Europe believes the agreement should grant considerable benefits now, as a stepping stone towards the fuller economic integration Israel wants.</p>

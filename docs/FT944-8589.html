			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Flexibility urged on energy Russia could attract more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 36bn) of foreign investment in its energy sector if the country's legal and tax regimes were more flexible, US and Russian experts told an industry conference in Moscow this week. Feasibility studies for several giant development projects have already been conducted by foreign companies but will never be realised unless there is a more predictable and stable investment climate, western executives said. 'There is simply too much uncertainty and confusion at present,' said one US oil company director. The conference, organised by the Russian Energy Ministry and the US Energy Department, attempted to resolve the legislative and fiscal difficulties obstructing foreign investment. Mr Yury Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, said progress had been made and it was recognised that 'strict rules of the game' had to be applied. US representatives held out hopes that fresh legislation concerning foreign investment in Russia's underground resources could be introduced into the Russian parliament as early as next month. Such legislation would face a tough passage, because of the political sensitivities involved, but sources close to the Energy Ministry suggested a presidential decree could be used to break any legislative impasse. Foreign oil companies complained that one of the main deterrents to long-term investment was the ambiguous legal position of oil ventures, given the overlapping jurisdictions of administrative and commercial law. At present, licences awarded by the Russian authorities to develop energy reserves fall under administrative law, which cannot be challenged in international courts. Western oil companies prefer production sharing agreements (PSAs), common in other parts of the world, which would be subject to international arbitration. Russia's confusing tax regime, the potential threat of an abrupt termination of production rights and the absence of a workable system of dispute arbitration were also cited as stumbling blocks. Some western oil executives privately expressed dismay at the bureaucratic delays they had encountered over the past few years and doubted that new legislation could be swiftly implemented. 'There is still no national consensus in Russia on how they should exploit their energy resources,' said one western executive. Mr Bill White, US deputy secretary of energy, urged Russia to reform its investment legislation speedily, saying an international race was under way to supply the increasing demand for oil. 'The countries which encourage that investment and are first will be able to sell their production on an economic basis and those that lag behind will not,' Mr White said.</p>

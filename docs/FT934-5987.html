			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mexico sets agenda for foreign bank licences Mexico is set to open up its financial system to foreign competition early next year. The finance ministry plans to give licences to as many as 25 US and Canadian banks, a government official said. The opening is prescribed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and the necessary legal changes were presented to congress yesterday. The new law will gradually eliminate restrictions on US and Canadian investment in Mexico's banking, brokerage and insurance sector. Excluding Citibank, which manages a branch under a special agreement, the banks will be the first foreign financial houses to operate subsidiaries in Mexico. JP Morgan, Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and American Express from the US, and Bank of Montreal, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Bank of Nova Scotia from Canada, have shown interest in a licence to open a subsidiary, the official said. Several US and Canadian subsidiaries of non-American banks are also seeking licences. The free trade agreement allows US- and Canadian-incorporated banks initially to take up to 8 per cent of the banking market as measured by capital, or about Dollars 830m. The limit is increased until all significant restrictions are scrapped by the year 2000. Each individual foreign bank would be initially restricted to 1.5 per cent of the market, or about Dollars 150m of capital. Mr Alvaro Vazquez, managing director of corporate finance at JP Morgan, said his bank would make 'a significant commitment in terms of capital and people' to Mexico if granted a licence. JP Morgan, like scores of other banks, has a representative office in Mexico. Mr Stefano Natello, an analyst with CS First Boston, doubts the new banks will enter the retail market, because of the high costs of setting up a branch network. Instead, they will concentrate on the corporate sector.</p>

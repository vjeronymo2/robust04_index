			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Bezverkhiy, head of the RF </F> Gosstandart [Russian Federation Committee on Standardization,  Metrology and Certification], conducted by correspondent Yuriy  Shikhov: "Sergey Bezverkhiy: To Care for the Producer While  Protecting the Consumer"]    [Text]    [Begin box material]    Sergey Bezverkhiy was born in 1940. He graduated from the  Vocational-Technical School on Mechanization of Agriculture and  the Zaporozhskiy Machine Building Institute. He worked at an  auto test site near Dmitrovo, having travelled the path from  engineer to general director. Since November 1991, he has served  as the head of the RF Gosstandart.    [End of box]    [Correspondent] With what, in your opinion, did the  Gosstandart of Russia begin?    [Bezverkhiy] Officially, it began in November of 1991 after  the signing of the Edict on the Gosstandart of Russia by Boris  Yeltsin. However, its roots go back to the Petrine times, when  by the order of the Russian emperor the fleet was created, arms  production was developed, the deliveries of flax and other  products to foreign countries were expanded or, in the words of  the poet, the "window to Europe was being cut." Under these  conditions, life itself demanded the issuance of edicts by Peter  I on establishing standards and requirements for good quality  products, including export products, so as not to undermine the  prestige of the Russian Empire.    [Correspondent] What do you see as the primary tasks of  Gosstandart at the current stage?    [Bezverkhiy] If we try to express the essence of our  activity  in concentrated form, I would say this: To formulate a standards  base for the implementation of economic reforms being undertaken  in the country, and to implement a unified state technical  policy in the field of standardization, metrology and  certification. At the same time, I will emphasize: Our main goal  is to help consumers, to protect the population against  dangerous products, to support the entrepreneur and to create  favorable conditions for goods producers on the entire territory  of Russia, stimulating interest in the manufacture of only high  quality, competitive products. Standards must open the door to  the world market for producers. The Gosstandart of Russia has  the capacity for providing specific services to goods producers.  Among them are: Information on product requirements in Russia as  well as abroad; Aid in performing certification of products  under any requirements of standard documents, including  international; Preparation of practical recommendations on  improving products not corresponding to current requirements,  performed by our qualified experts for enterprises, as well as  aid in formulating quality systems which have been tested in  world practice.    We have to some degree inherited the structure of the USSR  Gosstandart. However, the conception of the approach has  principally changed. First of all, this is an orientation toward  the international standard, a changeover to its direct  application. At the same time, we have introduced the voluntary  nature of the standard. Its requirements are mandatory for the  producer only from the standpoint of safety of man and the  environment. The standards, as I have already said, are  international, and therefore if you want to trade only within  the country and to make products which are not competitive on  the foreign market, then you will consequently get a low price  for these products. But if you want to earn currency, then you  must fulfill the requirements of the international standard, or  no one will take your goods.    [Correspondent] Will the introduction of European standards  not leave Russia outside the bounds of trade-economic relations  with the countries of the European Union?    [Bezverkhiy] Yes, the European Union is a closed economic  group which has its own standards. If we want to cooperate with  it on an equal footing, naturally we must raise the level of our  standard-technical documents to the international level, and  guarantee them if possible. Only in this way will we be able to  establish the necessary trade-economic contacts. Since our  greatest commodity turnover is with Europe, our producers must  primarily be aware of the European standards. Our next step is  to create a federal fund of standards of all types and  categories, including international (regional) and national  standards of foreign countries.    [Correspondent] Has the restructuring within the Gosstandart  itself been completed?    [Bezverkhiy] For the present day, the legislative base for  work under conditions of a market economy has generally been  created. Legislation on consumer rights protection, on  standardization, on ensuring the unity of measurements, and on  certification of products and services has been adopted at our  initiative. Other departments have prepared a number of the laws  concerning questions of safety and environmental protection  which have been issued, and which also touch upon questions of  standardization, certification and metrology. Moreover, we have  developed a set of sub-legal documents, as for example principle  documents on certification. Altogether during the past two years  there have been over 100 standards documents adopted, which  create the principles, I would say, of a technical constitution  regulating mutual relations of all economic subjects under  conditions of a market economy.    But this is only the first part. The second is the reform of  the system of Gosstandart itself. On 12 February 1994, the  government adopted the decree, "On Organization of Work on  Standardization, Provision of Unity of Measurement and  Certification of Products and Services." This government statute  has exclusively important significance. Basically, it  organizationally completes the creation of a state system of  control and supervision over correspondence of products to  mandatory requirements of state standards and provision of unity  of measurements in the country. The principle for our committee  and for the regions has become the government decision which  states that the local centers of standardization and metrology  receive the status of territorial organs of the Gosstandart of  Russia. In essence, within their regions they implement the  policy of the committee and act as the organ of state executive  power, and at the same time as a state institution with the  right to manage certain types of work on a contractual basis  (noncommercial, nonprofit).    It is no secret that the center of gravity for direct  regulation of questions associated with the vital provision and  resolution of social problems and the development of market  economic relations is today ever more tangibly being shifted to  the regions, and is being placed upon the local organs of  executive power. This is specifically what determines the need  for precisely formulating the basic guidelines of Gosstandart  regional technical policy, so as to be able to maximally aid in  the socioeconomic development of the regions and to give aid to  the local administrative organs in this matter.    [Correspondent] What legal sanctions are provided for  violators of the standards and certification regulations?    [Bezverkhiy] The law on protection of consumer rights, the  law on standardization, and the laws on metrology and  certification provide for rather strict measures of  action--ranging from economic sanctions (fines) to criminal  prosecution. While recently the manager of an enterprise which  manufactured substandard products was fined by the ispolkom  [executive committee] commission, in a symbolic manner, we might  say, today such directors are given fines of hundreds and even  thousands, and the enterprises are fined millions. For example,  the A/O "Dartlend" was fined more than 60 million rubles (R).  Unfortunately, the entrepreneur still rarely pays. We appealed  to the court of arbitration, and they promised to find us  methods of collecting this money. I spoke with the chairman of  the RF Supreme Arbitration Court, Veniamin Yakovlev, and he  support us. We agreed that in the near future we would appeal to  the government or the Duma for adoption of an appropriate  legislative statute.    [Correspondent] Is there a real mechanism for realization of  the Law on Consumer Rights? Or is it necessary to rely on public  control which is implemented by the consumer societies?    [Bezverkhiy] I believe that there is. Goods and services for  which there are safety requirements are prohibited from sale  without a certificate of compliance. Aside from this law, as I  have already said, the Law on Certification of Goods and  Services has been adopted, principle documents in this field  have been developed, and around 60 orders of certification on  types of products have been approved. After all, the  certification of a tape recorder involves one set of regulations  and standards. The certification of space products has its own  requirements. The certification of tobacco goods--in general you  do not know how to approach it, because smoking is harmful. In  principle, it should be banned, but as long as they smoke, let  them smoke tobacco, and not its substitute. Well, and so forth.    For every group of uniform product, the central organs have  also approved a certification--a sort of higher level, which  defines the ideology and policy. There are 21 of them. They have  also ratified a middle level which, specifically, is the one  which issues the certificates. There are around 200 of these. I  would like to stress: This is not only Gosstandart.    Half is Gosstandart, and half is other organs of state  administration and public associations. Around 600 laboratories  have been accredicted. The essence of certification, the basis  of consumer rights protection, is the testing of goods by a  third, independent, party to see that they correspond to the  standard.    We are often accused of monopolism. Well, 7 percent of these  laboratories are within the Gosstandart system, and 93 percent  are outside of it. It is important for us that they operate  according to unified regulations, which correspond to the  international ones, and that they be independent if possible. We  do not have a law like they have, for example, in the FRG  [Federative Republic of Germany]. There they have fines ranging  from 2,000 to 10,000 marks for dishonest entrepreneurial  activity. And for violation of testing and falsification or  omission of negative results--a jail term of up to 3 years. If  we had such a law, the affiliation of the testing laboratory  would be unimportant. I hope that we too will come to this.    [Correspondent] Tell us, what are your relations with the  state and social structures? Primarily with the State Committee  on Anti-Monopoly Policy?    [Bezverkhiy] They are normal business relations, although  sometimes there is some friction and an absence of mutual  understanding. But this, I believe, is an inevitable thing. For  example, the representatives of the committee actively help us  in the local areas. Nine supervisory departments--the  anti-monopoly committee, the sanitary-epidemiological  inspection, the Ministry of Health, our committee, the trade  inspection, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and other  agencies of executive power and departments--have signed a joint  appeal to the heads of local administration with a request to  create coordinating councils or commissions in the regions,  which under the management of one of the deputy heads of  administration would jointly resolve problems on ensuring the  rights of consumers to safe and good quality products. Thus, we  are delegating our powers and authorities to those organizations  which are better informed in their field. This is how it is done  throughout the world. However, at the same time we must, we are  obligated, to remain monopolists in fulfilling our functions as  the national organ of Russia which formulates the tactics and  strategy for development of standardization, metrology and  certification. It is we who ensure the work of the departments  within the framework of mutually coordinated regulations and  procedures. We maintain constant contacts with societies for the  protection of consumer rights. Their representatives are  present, as a rule, at most of our collegium meetings, speaking  out with their comments and proposals. We always try to take  them into consideration.    We also invite representatives of the Chamber of Commerce  and  the Congress of Exchanges to our collegium meetings. We have  concluded agreements with them. We have delegated them powers  and authorities within the framework of the functions which they  fulfill.    [Correspondent] In other countries, the financing of  standards development is performed primarily by companies  interested in these standards. How is it in our country?    [Bezverkhiy] In Russia, for a number of years standards have  been developed not by institutes, as was done previously, but by  technical committees. There the principle of consensus reigns  supreme. The contractor, manufacturer, consumer, and  representatives of Gosstandart and societies for the protection  of consumer rights have the right to participate in them.  However, none of the commercial merchants has invested a single  ruble in this endeavor, perhaps because they live by ready-made  standards which already exist and which may be used free of  charge. Especially since these standards suit them for the  present time. However, since the state does not finance such  technical committees, we have found ourselves in an unenviable  position. Let me cite an example. The president of a certain  firm came to me and asked for an international certificate: I  want to supply oil and oil refining products abroad, he says. He  has mastered one thing well: Without a certificate, the price on  his product immediately drops by 30-50 percent. I tell him that  in principle it is possible to obtain such a certificate. For  this we have accredited laboratories and developed procedures.  The trouble is that 35 of our standards on oil and petroleum  products still do not correspond to the international standards.  Thus, in order to issue a certificate to the businessman,  Gosstandart would have to revise our standards, which would  require around R350 million. Where can we get this money? The  entrepreneurs do not give it to us. The Minister of Finance also  does not give it. Imagine how many years we would spend revising  all 25,000 standards which are in effect today in Russia and the  CIS countries if the merchants do not get involved in this work?    [Correspondent] What is the premium for quality?    [Bezverkhiy] In the USA, Japan and a number of other  industrially developed countries, premiums for quality are very  popular. They are given the names of outstanding people and, as  a rule, they are awarded at a very high level, including the  presidential. A country cannot have unconditional international  recognition if it has not attained world standards in the  quality of its goods. You yourselves know: If it is Japanese,  that means it is good. After all, there is neither oil, nor  cotton, nor other resources in the Land of the Rising Sun... So  the Japanese have decided to make product quality the main  priority in their work. This has become the national task, a  matter of national prestige for every Japanese.    In our country there have also been premiums for achievement  of high technical-economic product indicators at various times.  But, unfortunately, they enjoyed neither particular popularity  nor authority. Well, and recently quality has generally faded  into the background. However, we will not be able to make our  ruble convertible if we do not manufacture products which are  able to compete on the foreign market and which are capable of  bringing us hard currency. I am convinced that the time is not  far off when quality will become the national task and national  prestige in Russia as well. As soon as the political passions  subside more or less, Gosstandart will submit for the  president's signature an edict on introducing a Russian premium  on quality. Its distinguishing peculiarity will be the absence  of monetary remuneration. It will be awarded each year in the  name of the president. Goods producers who are laureates of this  prize will receive tax benefits or the right to free  advertising. It is true, the very fact of presentation of such a  prize is already an advertisement. I believe this should  motivate our producers to fight for this prize.    [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the elimination  of barriers in international trade?    [Bezverkhiy] The press has repeatedly announced Russia's  intention to join in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT). If we join in it, then we will be forced to bring all of  our national standards--and, as I have already mentioned, for  the present day there are 25,000 of them--into line with  international practice.    As for the former USSR republics, Gosstandart has concluded  an interstate agreement with them, stating that "we will live  according to unified standards." An interstate council has been  created, and not only the CIS countries will participate in its  work. A representative from Lithuania is always present at its  meetings. Moreover, bilateral agreements have been signed with  practically all the former republics, specifically on the mutual  recognition of the certificate of compliance, so as to exclude  expensive retesting. If we perform testing of a "KamaAZ" and  supply it to Belorussia, they will recognize our certificates in  that country. This also constitutes the elimination of technical  barriers in trade.    In general, I must say, the elimination of barriers is a  clever thing: In words, everyone is `in favor' of it. Yet in  fact, the EEC [European Economic Community], as I have already  noted, is in practice a closed grouping of countries. In  essence, normal access to this market is closed to any of our  producers until we join in the EEC and until we harmonize our  standards with the European ones. We also have our difficulties  with GATT. Contrivances and tricks are being devised within its  framework in order to support the industry of the member states  of this organization and not to allow competitors.    Of course, we are interested in removing the technical  barriers in trade for our goods producers. For this purpose, the  committee actively works within international organizations on a  bilateral basis. Treaties have been concluded with England,  Israel, Japan, and South Korea. I would like to stress that we  have come to agreement on the mutual recognition of  certificates. Please, let us perform mutual accreditation of  testing laboratories. You may control them and perform  inspection control. However, our relations must be on an equal  basis.    The ideal variant is large international agreements such as  the Geneva Agreement on Automobile Technology. Its participants  are practically all the countries of Europe, including Russia.  Our certificates on automotive technology are recognized in all  the European countries. If we issue the symbol E-22 to a car,  then it is recognized as an international certificate in any  country in Europe and the world. The same is true also in the  production of firearms and munitions. Here the Brussels  Convention is in effect, and we are completing arrangements for  joining in it.    You probably know that a treaty on partnership and  cooperation between Russia and the European Union is to be  signed in the near future. One of the articles of this treaty,  prepared with the direct participation of Gosstandart, provides  for measures directed at increasing the compatibility of systems  of standardization and metrology and evaluating the level of  compliance and consumer protection of the agreeing parties.  Recently we held successful negotiations with our colleagues  from the European Commission, at which we reviewed in detail the  systems of mandatory certification. In my opinion, one more  practical step has been taken in expanding the spheres of trust  between Russia and Europe.</p>

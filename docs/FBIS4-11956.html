			<p>BFN     [Text] Army sources told Qol Yisra'el that they do not  expect any reduction in army service in the Hebron area in the  wake of the agreement. It will take time for the Norwegian,  Danish, and Italian observers to establish some framework for  operating in the town with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and  the Palestinians. In any event, Israeli officials are stressing  that this is not a precedent and that responsibility for  security remains with the IDF.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / BAT warns of challenge over pension liability BAT Industries, which owns insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, yesterday said it might issue a legal challenge to regulators' plans for paying compensation to people who followed poor advice to take a personal pension. Mr Martin Broughton, group chief executive, said BAT believed that life companies operating through direct sales forces - as Allied Dunbar largely does - should not have any compensation liability for investors who have been wrongly advised by independent financial advisers which then go out of business. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, last week published a report on identifying and compensating people who had been wrongly sold personal pensions. It said that life companies and advisers should review at least 350,000 cases within the next two years. Some estimates put the bill at up to Pounds 2bn. SIB did not say how the retail financial services sector should divide the cost of compensating the victims of independent advisers which are unable to meet their liabilities, and life companies are arguing fiercely about how the expense should be split. Mr Broughton said: 'We might finish up taking the SIB or somebody to court if direct sellers were asked to pick up some of the spread of liabilities for independent advisers. We would take every step to avoid that.' SIB is already discussing a narrower point with Sun Life, another life insurer. Sun Life, which does 90 per cent of its business through independent advisers, says legal advice casts doubts on whether it will have to contribute compensation in respect of independent advisers which have already gone out of business. Mr Les Owen, Sun Life chief general manager, said the insurer was also taking legal advice about the duties of the trustees of occupational pension schemes. Mr Broughton emphasised that Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star would provide compensation where they had mis-sold pensions. He estimated the administrative cost to the two companies of identifying potential victims as between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m over the next two years. Lex, Page 24 BAT rises 21%, Page 25</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR BROKER SURRENDERS IN THEFT CASE  </P> <P> A car broker charged with 16 counts of grand theft and operating without a  salesman's license has surrendered to police, authorities said last week.  </P> <P> John Davis Allsbury, 38, turned himself in to police Wednesday after his  attorney and police worked out the details of his surrender, Police Capt. Dave  Hinig said.  </P> <P> Allsbury, an Arcadia resident, was arraigned in Pasadena Municipal Court that  afternoon and was released after posting a $50,000 bond, Hinig said. Allsbury  was accompanied by his attorney, Doug Trousil, when he arrived at the Police  Department, Hinig said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Lewis said a preliminary hearing for  Allsbury, who pleaded not guilty during the arraignment, is scheduled for June  20. Allsbury and Trousil could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Allsbury was charged April 27 with eight counts of grand theft and eight counts  of selling cars without a license, Lewis said. The charges stemmed from  Allsbury's car brokering business, Auto Marketing Concepts, 159 E. Huntington  Drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Evidence  </P> <P> The charges were based on eight brokering deals Allsbury handled, but Lewis  said there is evidence of other misdealings.  </P> <P> James Lee Roper, general manager at Auto Marketing Concepts, has been charged  with four counts of grand theft and three counts of operating without a  salesman's license, Lewis said.  </P> <P> Lewis said charges were filed against Allsbury and Roper after months of  investigation prompted by complaints from the Department of Motor Vehicles, car  dealers and some of Allsbury's former customers.  </P> <P> Customers and car dealers for whom Allsbury acted as a go-between told  authorities that Allsbury defrauded them of between $12,000 and $59,000, Lewis  said.  </P> <P> Allsbury's customers paid him to purchase cars from dealers of autos, such as  Jaguar, Mercedes Benz and Toyota, Lewis said.  </P> <P> When dealers discovered Allsbury had given them bad checks, they repossessed  the cars from buyers, he said.  </P> <P> Complaints against Allsbury date from November, 1987, to February, 1989, Lewis  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent in the territories Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Text] Palestinian public support for Fatah, the largest  and dominant organization in the PLO, is falling, while support  for "independents," who prefer to avoid direct identification  with the organizations supporting the Israel-PLO agreement or  those opposing it, is steadily increasing. This transpires from  a public opinion poll conducted on 16 January by the  Nabulus-based Palestinian Research Center. The poll included  1,607 interviewees from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This  research center started to conduct monthly polls after the  signing of the agreement in order to assess the public mood  among the Palestinian population and its possible voting  patterns in the framework of democratic elections.    According to the agreement of principles, the elections for  the autonomy council are slated to be held in July 1994 and the  research center intends to continue conducting the polls until  elections are held. Recently it was proposed that municipal  elections be held in order to gauge the mood of the Palestinian  voters in the territories. It has also been reported that the  PLO leadership is even considering delaying the elections for  the autonomy council.    According to the poll, support for Fatah has declined from  approximately 42 percent in December to 35 percent in January.  During this period support for the opposition organizations has  not increased but remained stable. Support for Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] stands at 14.7 percent, whereas support for  the Popular Front is 8.4 percent. At the same time the poll  indicates that the coalition of the agreement's supporters made  up of Fatah, FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation], and the  Palestinian People's Party, is still stronger than the  rejectionist coalition of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular  Front, and the Democratic Front. The agreement's supporters  garnered approximately 39 percent, whereas the opposition  accrued some 29 percent. The findings indicate that the  contribution of FIDA and the People's Party to the supporters'  camp is marginal and amounts to only a few percent.    The researchers assess that the voices lost to Fatah went to  those supporting the "independents," especially the "national  independents." According to the poll, support for the  "independents" has gone up to 32 percent. The conductors of the  poll estimate that some Fatah supporters preferred to define  themselves as "national independents" or to abstain. They also  assessed that some other independents are leaning toward the  Muslim organizations or other organizations which have not  defined their positions.    The poll shows that the lowest support for Fatah is to be  found in Hebron, where only 24.6 percent support this  organization. Had elections been carried out in Hebron on the  day of the poll, the opposition organizations would have easily  defeated the agreement's supporters. The greatest support for  Fatah is to be found in Nabulus and Jericho (42.2 percent in  both areas). The greatest support for the "independents" is to  be found in East Jerusalem: 46.2 percent.    The researchers estimate that several factors contributed to  the drop in support for Fatah. The main factors are the  frustration and despair felt by the Palestinian population in  view of the slow progress made in the negotiations; the absence  of practical moves for implementing the agreement; the ongoing  violence in the territories, for example, the killing of the  four Hamas activists in Hebron two days prior to the poll; and  the proliferation of arms in the Gaza Strip. The inter-Fatah  arguments over appointments and democratic reforms also made a  bad impression on the public. The researchers believe that all  these factors have increased the Palestinian public's doubts  over Israel's intentions and the ability of the Palestinian  delegation to convince Israel to accept the Palestinian  positions.</p>

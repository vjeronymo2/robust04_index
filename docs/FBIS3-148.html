Mr Buthelezi said he wanted to talk only peace with Mr  Mandela. "There is no question of me being persuaded by him or  anyone to ensure the IFP's participation in the elections," Mr  Buthelezi said in a memorandum prepared for delivery to National  Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr Antonie Gildenhuys in Ulundi on  Monday. "I have nothing further to talk about on this issue,  particularly with Mr Mandela...I hope he does not waste his time  by trying to persuade me to accept this."    Mr Buthelezi said Tuesday's meeting was a follow-up to their  peace summit in June last year when they agreed, among other  things, to address rallies together. But this had not happened,  he said, in spite of meeting ANC Chairman and Deputy  Secretary-General Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma in September, 1993  when they discussed possible dates for the joint public  addresses. "I gave them October 16 and 17 as being possible  dates...I have heard nothing further from them until last week  when Mr Zuma contacted me about tomorrow's (Tuesday's) meeting."    Mr Buthelezi criticised Mr Mandela for what he described as  an offensive statement that he, Mr Mandela, was prepared to go  on his knees to the IFP president to prevent bloodshed. "The  insinuation...that I am responsible for the bloodshed, I throw  at him with the contempt that it deserves."    Mr Mandela was also reported as saying he wanted to persuade  Mr Buthelezi to participate in the April poll. "I am prepared  to co-operate with Mr Mandela in any efforts that we agree can  end or reduce the levels of violence," Mr Buthelezi said.    On the election, the IFP leader said his party would not  participate because of the interim constitution which did not  allow regions to have exclusive powers. He said Mr Mandela had  also told him during their June meeting the ANC was opposed to a  federal system. "We do not accept the constitution. We do not  intend entering the elections. And indeed we oppose the  constitution and the election with every democratic means at our  disposal."    But, Mr Buthelezi said, he alone could not make a decision  to  participate in the elections. "It is an IFP matter as much as  it is a Freedom Alliance issue. I want there to be no illusions  about this, and understanding this before our meeting tomorrow  will contribute a lot to making our meeting fruitful and  meaningful."</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: PLDT declines 12.8% despite higher revenues Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), the country's dominant telecommunications company, yesterday reported a 12.8 per cent drop in first-quarter profits to 912.3m pesos (Dollars 32.9m), in spite of a 10 per cent rise in revenues to 4.78bn pesos. The company said higher capital spending, mostly related to its programme to meet an estimated 800,000 applications for telephone lines, led to the lower earnings. Industry analysts had forecast slower profits growth for PLDT, which faces keener competition from rivals in the newly deregulated industry. The company said operating expenses in the first quarter grew 21 per cent to 3.51bn pesos.</p>

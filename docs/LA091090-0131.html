Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SIOUX HONORING 'LA BAMBA' STAR  </P> <P> Lou Diamond Phillips' latest role is causing controversy among Navajos, but  South Dakota Sioux are honoring the multiracial actor for his portrayals of  American Indians.  </P> <P> The Sioux have given Phillips, 28, star of the 1987 film "La Bamba," the  honorary name Starkeeper, publicist Eddie Michaels said last week.  </P> <P> The tribe will officially confer the name on Phillips at a ceremony later this  year in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Michaels said.  </P> <P> The American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts has challenged the casting  of Phillips as a Navajo policeman in a film based on author Tony Hillerman's  novel "The Dark Wind."  </P> <P> Phillips, who played a Mexican-Indian in "Young Guns" and "Young Guns II," has  said he is part Cherokee, Filipino, Scottish-Irish, Hawaiian and Latino.  </P> <P> Bonnie Paradise, director of the American Indian Registry, said last week that  Phillips had not provided documentation of his lineage.  </P></p>

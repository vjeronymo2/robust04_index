			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI)--Israel has offered to  co-operate with India in the development of avionics and  armament systems of the light combat aircraft (LCA), upgradation  of the MiG 21 and development of various missile systems.    The offer was conveyed to top defence research and  development officials and air force and navy brass at the  just-concluded Avia-93, South Asia's first-ever air show held  near Bangalore by top Sibat officials, the Israeli foreign  defence assistance and exports organisation.    "Israel is very keen for defence tie-up with Indian armament  firms, specially in collaboration for development of missile  systems," a top Sibat official said. In fact, next to the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Israelis had put  up a massive display at the Avia-93 show.    The scientific adviser to the defence ministry, Prof A.P.J.  Abdul Kalaam, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S.K.  Kaul, and the naval chief, Admiral V.S. Shekawat, held talks  with top Israeli aviation and missile experts during the show.    The Israeli aviation firm, Elbit, which has developed one of  the world's most extensive facilities for comprehensive  upgradation of aircraft, particularly the MiG-21, is in serious  contention with Russian Sokol company in bidding for the  upgradation of the MiG-21 aircraft.    Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul said that the Indian air force,  during the next two to three years, would have to get in for  upgradation of at least 18 of the 26 MiG-21 squadrons and that  the government was seriously looking at various offers.    Elbit officials, who had put up a comprehensive design of  the  upgradation they had carried out in the MiG-21, said they had  installed advanced avionics, including weapon delivery  navigation, communication and display systems, and equipped the  remodelled aircraft which they had labelled as MiG-21 2000 with  sophisticated smart bomb delivery system as well beyond  visual-range missiles.    The chief of the Air Staff and the naval chief were at the  Israeli stall for more than two and a half hours having a  special study of the upgraded MiG-21 systems.    Elbit officials said they were offering the Indian air force  an upgradation of MiG-21 which would also include improved  radar, and head-up display combine with colour and  mono-multifunction display system for weapon handling,  facilities for ballistic calculations.    The other highlights of the modification which the Israelis  have undertaken in the MiGs are installation of opher (a  terminal guidance kit that transforms dumb bombs into smart  weapons), dash (a display system and sight helmet for effective  utilisation of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles).    The two sides are likely to further discuss the Israeli  offer  on upgradation of MiGs when Air Chief Marshal Kaul visits that  country early next month.    The air chief said once the final decision was taken, the  upgradation would be carried out at HAL [Hindustan Aeronautics  Limited] and would only take 24 to 30 months for the upgraded  versions to roll out.    Elbit has also offered to collaborate with India on  development of nightsight systems for both the air force and  army weapons systems.    On the light combat aircraft, the Israeli aviation companies  are offering to collaborate in light-weight weapon delivery  system, aerospace composite material components, range-finder  target designator laser, ECM [Electronic Counter Measures] and  counter-ECM systems.</p>

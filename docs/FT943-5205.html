			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (2): Cordless systems gain ground - Paul Taylor examines trends among business users Business users, particularly small businesses, helped fuel the growth of cellular mobile telecommunications in the early 1980s in the US and then in Europe. A decade later although attempts are being made to broaden the market for mobile telephony, for example through the introductions of Personal Communications Networks (PCNs) like Mercury One-2-One and Hutchison's Orange network in the UK, the main focus of cellular network operators remains the business customer. Indeed, the introduction of digital cellular networks such as the GSM networks which are being built across Europe and in many other countries around the world, and other new services like mobile data, promise to provide business users with a new set of telecommunications tools which can increase flexibility and improve productivity. One advantage of these new digital mobile services is that they are easier to integrate with corporate fixed telecommunications and data processing equipment and will enable network operators and others to provide a wide range of value added customer services such as voice messaging and data transmission. 'With their intelligent network architecture and nationwide digital networks, the mobile operators will soon be able to offer all the services that a (fixed network) telephone operator can, and more,' says Mr Tim Harrabin, a principal consultant at the Cambridge-based Analysys telecoms, strategy and economics consultancy, in a report published last year. Other telecommunications strategists believe that before the end of the decade, office cordless and mobile digital technologies will be integrated in dual mode handsets capable of operating at work, while travelling and at home. In the office itself most market research organisations predict that cordless telephony based on either of the two main digital technologies currently available, CT2 or Dect, will be gradually adopted by corporate customers over the next decade. Frost and Sullivan, the market research firm, is predicting that sales of wireless office equipment will grow from virtually nothing last year to nearly 20 per cent of the market by the year 2000. Among the benefits claimed for cordless systems are increased efficiency, reduced outgoing call costs and savings on running costs. Already most of the main telecommunications equipment manufacturers are either supplying or developing cordless systems which can be added onto existing PBX (Private Branch Exchange) equipment. The next step is likely to be to integrate these cordless voice systems with the emerging cordless data networks which are beginning to appear. Outside the office the cellular telephone is already a vital business tool for a large number of mobile workers including salesmen, site engineers and others whose jobs require them to leave the fixed telecommunications services available in the office, factory or warehouse. For some mobile workers - including those whose occupations mean they are often away from their desks or work-benches - pagers can provide a low cost and effective solution to the problem of 'telephone tag'. Pager networks have also proved very successful in Asian markets such as Hong Kong where they are increasingly used along-side 'telepoint' public mobile cordless systems. However, pager networks face a growing challenge from the new digital telecommunications and from GSM in particular. Vodafone, the UK cellular network operator working with Sema Group's telecom division, was the first GSM network operators successfully to test the short message service facility included in the GSM specification. This allows an alphanumeric message of up to 160 characters - twice as long as the typical maximum length paging message - to be displayed on the handset. The messages are sent via the short message service centre and when they arrive at the mobile they are stored in the user's SIM (smart) card ready for retrieval. SMS's unique features include the ability to send or receive messages at the same time as speaking or sending data, an alert feature for informing a third party when a mobile re-registers on the network, the ability to store a message and forward it to the mobile when it is switched on, and acknowledgement of successful message delivery. Mr Martin O'Byrne, managing director of Sema's telecom division, believes that SMS and other features like it will provide network operators with a way of differentiating service offerings. Business users who want to send longer data files from their portable computers while on the move - as well as being able to use the network as a conventional voice link - will probably also turn to GSM. However those whose need is for frequent computer-to-computer communications will probably use one of the dedicated mobile data networks such as Ram Mobile Data in the UK. These data networks provide high speed, reliable wireless mobile data connections which typically enable mobile workers such as parking wardens, meter readers and others to exchange data or E-mail with a central office network. In the meantime, the proliferation of mobile telecommunications equipment is already causing problems in some large organisations which sometimes do not even know how many mobile telephones their employees are using and have few, if any, controls over their usage. The problem is so pronounced that Mercury Mobile Services inthe UK offers a 'consolidation' service which begins with a 'consolidation audit' to discover the number and type of phones a customer has and to set up a database to monitor users and usage trends. If required, MMS can then arrange for all the equipment to be transferred so that it is all managed by a single service provider and will then provide the customer with detailed management reports and monitor whether the mobile fleet is being used efficiently. Customers have included Digital, Shell, the AA and UPS. According to Ms Diana Jones, who handles marketing for MMS, some customers are now asking Mercury Mobile Services to manage their entire mobile telecommunications operations - including marketing the services to internal users. As Ovum, the market research group, noted in a recent study, 'so far neither suppliers nor user organisations have paid much attention to how a large company 'as a whole' can use mobile to best advantage.' However, Ovum also noted that as the drive towards a mass market for mobile communications and fierce competition force mobile operators to lower prices, developing products and services for the corporate sector will become increasingly important to mobile operators seeking to sustain margins. 'The more experienced corporate users have identified how mobile communications can improve their efficiency - they are starting to change the way they operate in order to take advantage of mobile services,' said Ovum. 'Changes include cutting down on staff and accommodation - thereby allowing extra spend on mobile communications - and closer integration of mobile with private network facilities.' One worldwide office equipment supplier interviewed for the survey 'Integrating Mobility into the Corporate Network' said that by introducing voice mail for sales people they had made savings on message desk staffing. However, Ovum noted that most users do not see the introduction of mobile communications as a cost-saving measure. But they are aware of how mobile services can benefit their business in other ways, for example by improving the productivity of mobile staff, making an organisation more responsive to customers, improving sales effectiveness and speeding up decision making. Given that mobile communications products and services are widely regarded by telecommunications managers as too expensive, suppliers need to find ways of simulating market growth which do not focus primarily on cost reduction, says Ovum. These include adding value to individual products and services such as data over GSM; moving new applications to mobile communications and educating corporate users about the benefits of using mobiles; and integrating services across technologies, adding value for users and providing cost control for the company.</p>

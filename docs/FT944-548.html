			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Turkey orders Islamists jailed A Turkish court has convicted 86 Islamic fundamentalists of murder and rioting, sentencing them for up to 15 years in jail for their part in disturbances last year in the city of Sivas in central Turkey that lead to 37 deaths. In July last year the defendants surrounded and set fire to a hotel where an arts festival was being held, killing 37 people, most of them writers, artists and actors. This was the worst outbreak of fundamentalist violence in recent years in Turkey, highlighting the growing strength of Islamic extremism.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An Arms Package Offer?"] </F>   [Text] A US State Department team is said to be in  Islamabad to discuss, what is being termed a `package deal' on  nuclear non-proliferation. If so, it points to two fairly clear  conclusions. One, that the device of Pressler Amendment,  intended by the US to arm-twist Pakistan into accepting the US  diktat on nuclear development, had failed to achieve its goals.  And two, that Pakistan's perception of a threat to its security  was leading it into an arms race with India. The realisation  that two important countries of South Asia were sinking their  vital economic resources into highly unproductive channels  because of a dangerous dispute over Kashmir, may have obliged  the US recently into pressurising Pakistan and India to find a  diplomatic solution. The failure of the Secretary-level talks  between the two countries must have convinced the US that India  though willing to go through the motions of a dialogue, was not  really serious in solving the Kashmir issue. And so long as the  core of the conflict remained unresolved, no progress on the  nuclear option, that Pakistan was unwilling to give up, was  possible. And hence the visit of the US team. The reasoning in  the State Department could be that India remaining adamant on  Kashmir and rattling its sword for a so-called `limited war',  Pakistan would be driven to the wall and could unfreeze its  nuclear programme. Working on this hypotheses the US team could  have brought in a `package' to basically address two problems of  an immediate nature. First, to persuade Pakistan not to  unfreeze its nuclear programme and secondly, to remedy to some  extent the danger that the Pressler Amendment had done to  Pakistan's defence capability. That both objectives are  interlinked is obvious, but while the first objective can be  presumed to be certain, the second is not. The US negotiators,  for example, could threaten Pakistan with further damage to its  security as a penalty for unfreezing of its nuclear programme.  That would obviously be totally counterproductive but it would  not be the first time the US did something that achieved the  opposite of what was intended.    Having said that, it also needs to be said that unless two  parallel lines of action are adopted, the US team's mission is  doomed. In the short term, the incentive for an attack on  Pakistan will have to be removed from the minds of the Indian  leadership. The Indians could be thinking that deprived of  conventional arms by the US, Pakistan is now weak enough to be  taken out in a short surgical strike. India will have to be  disabused of such a notion on the one hand and Pakistan's  defence shored up on the other. In the longer term, India will  have to be persuaded to give Kashmir to Kashmiris or suffer  harsh UN-supported sanctions.</p>

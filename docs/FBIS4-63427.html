			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "In Brief" rubric"] </F>   [Text] While there are currently more than 50 nuclear  research plants in operation on the territory of Moscow, none of  the working nuclear reactors have safety devices such as  protective hoods, for example, measuring up to safety standards.  Nevertheless, only three reactors have been shut down since 1992  on the site of the Kurchatov Research Center, and they could be  back in use again shortly. This has been advised by Vladimir  Kuznetsov, chief of the Moscow inspectorate of the State  Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety.</p>

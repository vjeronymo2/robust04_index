			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Ceslovas Jursenas, speaker of the Lithuanian  parliament, and his delegation arrived in Damascus this evening  on a four-day visit to Syria.    He was received at Damascus International Airport by  'Abd-al-  Qadir Qaddurah, speaker of the People's Assembly, and Shakir  Is'ayyid, chairman of the Arab and Foreign Relations Committee  in the Assembly.    Mr. Jursenas said upon arrival that he was glad to be  visiting Syria. There have been no parliamentary relations  between our two countries previously, he noted. During this  visit, we want to get to know Syria first-hand and boost  bilateral ties, particularly in parliamentary affairs, Mr.  Jursenas told SANA.    This is the first time we have visited an Arab state since  our independence. Our nation, he added, welcomes contacts and  relations with Syria in particular and the Arab states in  general. He emphasized that his country is particularly  interested in the Middle East and the ongoing peace talks.  Lithuania, he stated, supports the return of the occupied  territory to its rightful owners.    The Lithuanian parliament speaker concluded his statement by  saluting Syria and its people.</p>

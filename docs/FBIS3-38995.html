			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "SN": "Recession in Industry Seems To Have </F> Bottomed Out"]    [Excerpts] Vienna -- Judging by the order books it looks  as if the recession in the Austrian industry might bottom out in  the course of the year. According to calculations by the  Economic Research Institute (Wifo), companies received more  orders on an average over the past few months than one year  earlier, and in November order books, for the first time, were  fuller than in the previous year.    The economy further consolidated in the fall. Industrial  production remained almost stable,, falling short of production  figures of one year ago only by about 1.5 percent between  September and November. The economic researchers have based  their optimism mainly on the recovery of the sector of products  for further processing, which tends to precede economic  developments. The textile and clothing industry and the  producers of capital goods once more had to significantly cut  back production.    The negative developments in last year's export figures  improved over the past few months. Remarkable results were  achieved by Austrian exports overseas (Southeast Asia and the  United States, in particular): November exports to the "Four  Dragons" increased by 19 percent, and to the United States by 28  percent over the previous year. The increase in orders from  abroad in a number of industries gives rise to the hope that the  export industry will soon free itself from stagnation. One  important condition for it is a stable upward trend in Germany.  Developments in the German economy have been relatively  favorable in the past few months. There is, however, a major  discrepancy between increasing orders from abroad and a weak  demand at home. The risk that lack of confidence among German  consumers might impair the recovery must not be underestimated.  [passage omitted]    In Austria, the rate of inflation remained at 3.5 percent in  December, too, falling by only about 0.5 percentage points in  the course of 1993 despite the recession. The increase of  prices for industrial products (plus 3.2 percent) and private  services (plus 5.7 percent) remained almost undiminished.  Public rates increased more strongly in the course of the year  (reaching plus 4.9 percent in December). Prices for energy and  food were tending to check price rises.    On the labor market economic recession and the pressure of  rationalization measures resulted in a major reduction of jobs  in industry (October: minus 37,000 or minus 7 percent). Total  employment, however, remained virtually stable due to additional  demand for labor by the public sector, the health sector,  economic services, and the construction industry. The increase  in registered unemployed continually diminished: from plus  40,000 in March 1993 to plus 11,000 in January 1994.</p>

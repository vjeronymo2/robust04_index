			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Minister Choe In-ki sacked three officials Saturday,  holding them responsible for the trouble caused by the recently  introduced law on the distribution and price stabilization of  agro-fishery products.    The three are Sin Sun-u, director-general of the  Agricultural  Marketing Bureau, Kim Chu-su, chief of the Planning and Budget  Division, and Choe Pu-kwan, of the Market and Price Policy  Division, according to the spokesman.    The three officials failed to devise measures to ensure the  law's smooth execution and, therefore, took responsibility for  the trouble in which thousands of middlemen at the Karak  Agro-Fishery Wholesale Market paralyzed the distribution system  by boycotting their business in protest against the revised law  banning wholesale activities by middlemen, the spokesman said.    The three will lose their jobs unless they are reinstated  within three months.    In a statement, Minister Choe instructed all ministry  officials to develop agro-fishery industries, warning that he  would severely punish those who fail to perform their jobs well.</p>

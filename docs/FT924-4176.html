			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Astra slides as stake sale speculation intensifies ASTRA International, Indonesia's troubled automotive company, reported net profits of Rp59.2bn (Dollars 28.6m) for the nine months to December, a 69 per cent fall on year-earlier figures. The results coincided with renewed speculation that the Soeryadjaya family, Astra's majority owners, are preparing to sell a substantial stake. Net of extraordinary items, Astra made Rp16.6bn in the third quarter, an improvement on the Rp5.2bn loss in the second quarter but slightly below brokers' forecasts. Brokers said net profits for the year were unlikely to break Rp80bn, against Rp210bn in 1991. The Soeryadjayas own 57 per cent of Astra but are under pressure to sell shares to raise finance for their privately-owned Bank Summa. Bank Summa was suspended in mid-November with bad debts exceeding Rp1,000bn. Brokers say Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a prominent Indonesian businessman and a close associate of the family of President Suharto, has emerged as a potential purchaser for a large portion of the Soeryadjayas' Astra holding. Bank Summa's problems have prompted public concern over the wider health of the banking sector, resulting in a run on two banks. Bank Subentra and Bank Surya have reported large withdrawals following speculation they had fallen into arrears with the central bank. This has been denied by the central bank, which has declared them to be in sound financial health. Mr Sudwikhatmono, a shareholder in both banks and a relative of President Suharto, has called for rumour-mongers to be charged with subversion. Mr Eka Widjaja will step down as president commissioner of Bank International Indonesia, Indonesia's third largest private bank and a listed company.</p>

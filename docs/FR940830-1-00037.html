This proposal would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system with new, improved actuators. This proposal is prompted by reports indicating that the requirements of a previously issued AD do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by October 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 15, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327 (57 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 47987, October 21, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 and Model 767 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive inspections (weighing program) of the door opening/snubbing actuators of the escape system (for Model 747 series airplanes) and the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide (for Model 767 series airplanes), and modification of the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report from an operator of Model 767 series airplanes that several actuators leaked following accomplishment of the modification procedures required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the modification requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, this operator also reported that, during subsequent inspections (weighing program) of these actuators, the weight in several actuators increased from the original weight measured during the initial inspection (weighing program) required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA finds that the inspection requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 cannot reliably determine the fluid level of these actuators by the weighing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, the manufacturer has developed a new, improved actuator for Model 767 series airplanes. These new actuators are not fluid-filled. The old actuators were fluid-filled and had a tendency to leak, which caused the actuator to fail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

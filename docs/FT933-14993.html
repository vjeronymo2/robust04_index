			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / US warns Iraqis in missiles row PRESIDENT Bill Clinton told Iraq yesterday that he viewed as 'serious' its refusal to allow United Nations inspectors to install cameras on two missile test sites, but appeared to rule out unilateral US action if Baghdad did not comply. A team of UN weapons inspectors is due in Iraq today to seal the two test sites while negotiations continue over the introduction of cameras. Questioned at a press conference in Tokyo, Mr Clinton said Iraq was violating UN resolutions. If it persisted, the US would take the issue back to the UN Security Council and seek the appropriate multilateral response. Mr Clinton contrasted the present standoff over the missile test sites with his response to an alleged Iraqi attempt on the life of former President George Bush, when he ordered a unilateral military strike on Baghdad. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, meanwhile stressed that the use of further force against Iraq was 'entirely possible' unless Baghdad complied with UN directives. In a television interview in Tokyo, he said there was a pattern of Iraqi violations that could lead to further coalition strikes. US efforts to block the military ambitions of both Iraq and Iran were underlined yesterday in Brussels when Mr Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, urged the EC to put pressure on Tehran to drop any plans for developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Iran announced last weekend it had reached agreement with China to buy a 300MW nuclear power station but both countries stressed it would be used only for peaceful purposes. Mr Djerejian said his Brussels meeting was designed to build on recent talks between Mr Christopher and EC foreign ministers in which they discussed joint action to contain Iran. The US is also urging its allies to limit trade and technical co-operation with Iran, which it considers to be the foremost sponsor of international terrorism. Iran has been attempting to improve its international relations, particularly with the EC, in order to acquire the financial and technological aid needed to rebuild its economy after the eight-year war with Iraq.</p>

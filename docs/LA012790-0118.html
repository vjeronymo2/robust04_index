			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY CONTINUES TO DOG TENNANT;  </P> <P> DRUG TESTING: LATEST DEBATE ON WEST COVINA DOCTOR'S ABILITY MIGHT COST HIM  POSITION WITH NFL.  </P> <P> Forest Tennant shy away from controversy?  </P> <P> Four years ago, the West Covina physician was asked about his penchant to  irritate everyone from Los Angeles County politicians to the NFL Players Assn.  </P> <P> "I've not only ruffled some feathers, I've run them over like a steamroller,"  he said in an interview in 1986. "If I don't have some adversaries out there,  I'm not accomplishing anything."  </P> <P> As one of the country's best-known drug doctors and former mayor of West  Covina, Tennant has accomplished plenty in the last 20 years.  </P> <P> Yet, all the while he has received recognition for good deeds, his image has  been tarnished by criticism of incompetence. Tennant's abilities were  questioned again this week after a Washington television report was critical of  his role as NFL drug adviser.  </P> <P> In a news conference Friday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the NFL did little  to dispel rumors that Tennant, 49, will soon be fired by the league.  </P> <P> Longtime observers of Tennant were not surprised by the latest debate.  Consider:  </P> <P>  -- In 1983, Tennant apparently reversed himself on the witness stand during a  highly publicized trial involving drug overdoses by an Orange County doctor.  Based on Tennant's report, the Orange County District Attorney's office  prosecuted the case. When Tennant offered a different account on the stand, the  case was dismissed.  </P> <P>  -- In 1984, as head of the Dodgers' drug prevention and treatment program,  Tennant told a newspaper reporter that he had a list of players involved with  drugs, which surprised team officials.  </P> <P>  -- In 1984-85, Community Health Projects Inc., a nonprofit network of drug  clinics in Southern California founded by Tennant in 1974, had problems with  the State Department of Health Services. A state agency audit found  discrepancies in billing procedures to Medi-Cal. Tennant denied any wrongdoing,  but the company was ordered to pay reimbursements for overcharges. It was one  of several times it was ordered to do so.  </P> <P>  -- In 1986, L.A. County health officials registered their concern over the  maintenance of Community Health's methadone program. Community Health Projects  eventually canceled its $272,000-a-year contract with the county to provide  methadone treatment for indigent heroin addicts.  </P> <P>  -- In 1986, Tennant conducted a public feud with L.A. County Supervisor Pete  Schabarum over the construction of waste-to-energy incinerators in the San  Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P>  -- In 1986, as newly appointed NFL drug adviser, Tennant disclosed plans to  specially monitor six New England Patriot players for drug use. The Players  Assn. accused Tennant of violating rules of confidentiality and called for his  removal.  </P> <P>  -- In 1988, Tennant told a group of Alaskan businessmen that the Dodgers'  success that season was partly traceable to management's alleviation of the  team's drug problem. Dodger officials expressed disappointment over the  remarks, and Tennant later was dismissed as the team's drug adviser.  </P> <P>  -- In 1989, a report in Sports Illustrated characterized problems with the  NFL's drug-testing methods in which Tennant was in charge.  </P> <P> Last summer, Tennant told The Times that the magazine article was untrue.  </P> <P> "This whole story is nonsense," he said. "I'm a public figure. I never thought  as a physician that I would get the kind of criticism that I get in the media  from time to time."  </P> <P>  -- Also in 1989, Tennant's rapid-eye exam, a home drug-prevention kit, was  criticized by some drug-testing experts, doctors and a Boulder (Colo.) superior  court judge. The rapid-eye exam, which sells for $49, has prompted a debate as  to whether it is an effective tool or a gimmick to make money from the concern  over drugs.  </P> <P> Tennant told The Times that his detractors do not understand the eye exam. He  said that when used properly, the test can stop drug use in the home.  </P> <P> Friday, Tennant was not defending himself from the latest volley.  </P> <P> Sandy Ethridge a spokeswoman for Community Health Projects, said: "Dr. Tennant  is very hopeful there is a time when he can speak openly about all this."  </P> <P> Tennant's lack of comment is uncharacteristic.  </P> <P> As a farm boy from Dodge City, Kan., Tennant worked his way through the  University of Kansas Medical School by selling crystal and fine china door to  door.  </P> <P> Like his parents who had sold Bibles in the Midwest during the Depression,  Tennant learned the importance of personal contact.  </P> <P> "It paid off handsomely," he said in 1986. "I got used to having people who  didn't like me."  </P> <P> In 1968, two years after earning a medical degree from Kansas, Tennant was an  Army surgeon based in West Germany. There, his profession took an alternate  course as he learned of the Army's drug problem.  </P> <P> He used information gleaned from treating service personnel as the basis for a  doctorate thesis at UCLA School of Public Health in 1972. Then, as a  post-doctorate fellow, Tennant was appointed director of UCLA's methadone  program.  </P> <P> The school rented a building in West Covina, where Tennant's staff dispensed  methadone daily to heroin addicts. This eventually became the basis for  Community Health Projects, which has grown into a multimillion-dollar  operation.  </P> <P> Because of the organization's recognition from work with professional athletes,  Tennant was often called to testify as an expert witness in drug trials. Also,  he has been a consultant to the California Highway Patrol, teaching officers  how to recognize symptoms of drug use. His rapid-eye exam has been praised by  law enforcement authorities as an effective means in field sobriety tests.  </P> <P> The test today is whether Tennant can withstand the mounting criticism. Judging  from his past, his supporters believe he will weather this latest storm.  </P> <P> "Whatever his personality is," an Orange County physician once said, "his work  is what really is important."  </P></p>

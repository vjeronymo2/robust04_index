			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / De Klerk moves to defuse row over army scandal PRESIDENT FW de Klerk last night moved to repair damage caused by accusations of an army dirty tricks campaign against the African National Congress by replacing the command of South African military intelligence. In a statement after a 10-hour cabinet meeting, Mr De Klerk said that General Pierre Steyn, the chief of the Defence Force Staff, had been placed in immediate command of all intelligence organisations of the armed forces. The president also ordered some military intelligence files to be seized. Mr De Klerk by said he had ordered Gen Steyn and Police General Alwyn Conradie to 'secure immediate control over all the documentation of the Directorate of Covert Collection (of military intelligence). The measures came in response to a statement by a judicial inquiry on Monday that said military intelligence had sought to involve the armed wing of the ANC, led by Mr Nelson Mandela, in common crime. Mr De Klerk said he was seeking an urgent meeting with the inquiry's leader, Judge Richard Goldstone, who has been appointed by the government to probe the causes of the political violence which is racking the country. The two will discuss the judge's request that he be given more resources to investigate wrongdoing by all armed groups in the country. Earlier further pressure on the government came from Mr Harry Schwartz, the South African ambassador to the US, who said he was 'furious and outraged' at the Goldstone Commission disclosures. 'It has undermined all our effort here, all the hard work that so many people have put into changing our situation here. There can be no room for this sort of thing in South Africa,' said Mr Schwartz. The revelations have been a considerable embarrassment to the government as they cast doubt on the veracity of previous pledges to stop covert campaigns against political opponents. They have also impeded efforts to revive the constitutional negotiation process, stalled since May. The ANC has called for an expanded judicial inquiry into the military, echoing Judge Goldstone's request for wider powers, more resources and greater co-operation in carrying out his investigations. Meanwhile, Mr Gene Louw, minister of defence, said he 'seriously disputed' several of Judge Goldstone's statements about the affair.</p>

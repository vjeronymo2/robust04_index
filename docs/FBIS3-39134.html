Even the  threat of resorting to air raids if the Serbs do not withdraw  their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo cannot be considered  a move of fundamental strategic importance within the context of  the Bosnian civil war.    Indeed, the international community has for months been  issuing a series of palliative and half measures, consistently  presented as decisive, always crowned by success. Consider  "Deny Flight," the operation to impose a no-fly zone in the  skies above Bosnia: It was preceded by a great publicity  campaign and was perfectly executed by the NATO politicians, but  no real results were achieved, partly because in the few  instances when a violation of the flight ban was detected, they  were not authorized to intervene. Similarly (and fortunately)  there has been no response to the provocations of the Serbs --  from the antiaircraft batteries' radar which "floodlit" allied  aircraft to Belgrade's fighters which "shadowed" NATO's  reconnaissance aircraft as they tried to look beyond the  borders. When the same kind of provocation was attempted by the  Iraqis, the response was immediate and sharp. Of course, the  situation in Bosnia is different, but....    Be that as it may, since the Bosnian Serbs are able to crush  their adversaries without recourse to Belgrade's aircraft, the  NATO operation did not alter the outcome of the land battle in  the slightest.    As for the watertight naval blockade, before it was  implemented in earnest, innumerable "violators" succeeded in  bringing through consignments of weapons and supplies for the  fighters. For the past several months it has been more  stringent, and the embargo has been implemented resolutely, but  consignments continue to pass easily across the land borders  with Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, which either are unable or  unwilling to implement a total blockade.    Of course, the Croats and the Serbs in Bosnia receive all  kinds of assistance from Zagreb and Belgrade, whereas supplies  to the Muslims are insufficient, despite the Islamic community's  efforts.    Even the "ultimatum" currently being discussed is of  symbolic, rather than real, value: How can we forget that a  similar sequence of events occurred some months ago when NATO  aircraft were ready to intervene if the Serbs did not leave the  strategic heights around Sarajevo? After an exhausting trial of  strength, the Serbs did withdraw from Mount Igman and other high  places. Everyone was happy, but after a few months we now find  ourselves in the same situation again. It is just as well that  Sarajevo was "saved."    So it is entirely in the Serbs' interests to agree to  "submit" to the NATO-UN ultimatum: Indeed, it is better that  they display their goodwill by announcing the withdrawal of  their artillery even before the NATO bureaucratic monster sets  itself in motion. It will take only a matter of hours, not  days, to withdraw the guns and rocket launchers. Light weapons,  such as mortars, can merely be hidden. If necessary, personnel  and equipment can return to battle quickly. This, because NATO  is only demanding that the guns be removed and that the  bombardment of the city cease, not that the Serbs abandon their  positions. And in order not to lose its role as "third agent"  in the conflict, the United Nations cannot demand further  concessions from the Serbs, notwithstanding Izetbegovic's  continuing efforts to reverse at the negotiating table the  defeats that he is suffering in the field. So the vise around  Sarajevo will not be loosened, and there will be another  stalemate. Even the proposed demilitarization of the city would  not alter the overall strategic military picture. Be that as it  may, even after media interest in the capital's tragic plight  has ceased, the war would continue with the usual ferocity  throughout the rest of the country. It does not take much to  calm people's consciences, since nobody intends to become really  involved in Bosnia.    In the form in which it has been formulated, the ultimatum  does not serve much purpose and it discredits the international  community even more: Principles of equity would have required  the simultaneous imposition of identical conditions on the  Croatian artillery units bombarding Mostar and on the Muslims  occupying Tuzla, as well as on the Serbs who surround them. We  can just imagine the paeans of triumph that the media will issue  over the "liberation" of Sarajevo. Let us not delude ourselves;  nothing has changed; the tragedy continues.</p>

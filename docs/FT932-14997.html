			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BOC tumbles Industrial gases and healthcare group BOC saw its shares fall on worries that a US competitor is poised to grab market share following January's expiry of BOC's patent in the US on Forane anaesthetic gas. Investment bank BZW was telling clients that Abbott Laboratories of the US had developed a version of the BOC product which was rapidly penetrating Forane's US market. The house has left its forecasts unchanged but is expected to reduce them over the next few days. However, Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said: 'Even if they lost half the market share to generics it would only reduce earnings per share by 2p to 48p. The effect is pretty well in the share price by now.' BOC is expected to fight for its old Forane market share with a new product, Suprane, which received FDA approval in September and is now in the early stage of marketing. BOC shares closed 16 lower at 707p with 2.5m traded.</p>

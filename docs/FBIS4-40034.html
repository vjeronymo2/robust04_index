			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Week's </F> Topic" rubric: "Battle for the Budget: The Argument Over  Figures Never Became a Debate on the Country's Security  Problems"]    [Text] The past political week in Russia must have really  delighted pedantic champions of parliamentarianism. At last  everything here was "as with other people." I mean the heated  budget battles in the Federal Assembly, which centered, as is  proper, on defense spending.    If we disregard the results and the fact that the figures  approved by the State Duma for the military budget bring the  Armed Forces to the verge of mere survival or even push them  beyond it, the very fact of this debate must, at first sight,  provide definite grounds for optimism. Our parliamentarians  have finally realized that they can influence the country's  development -- and influence it perfectly really -- not through  endless arguing over political questions. But the way this is  done in all civilized countries -- through the budget.  Throughout the world, by allocating or not allocating money  under a particular heading to a particular government program,  the people's elected representatives shape the state policy  which they deem necessary.    In this context the present difficulties of the defense  department and of our military industry would seem to be on a  par with those encountered by the military department and the  military-industrial complex of, let us say, the United States.  The Pentagon always gets less than it asks for. But, alas, the  similarity here seems purely superficial, a similarity of  procedure and form, certainly not one relating to the crux of  the matter. For, at least in the perception of the public, the  heated parliamentary fighting centered on highly abstract  figures. It turned out that 37 trillion rubles [R] was arguing  with R55 trillion.    And yet fundamentally different approaches lie behind these  figures. Not even approaches to the future fate of the Army,  for which undying love is sworn by all Russian politicians (who,  it is true, forget that the Army must not only be loved but also  fed). I am talking of approaches to ensuring the country's  security.    So the Ministry of Defense, relying on the main provisions  of  the military doctrine, having reckoned up the possible threats  to our security, and mindful of the problems facing the Armed  Forces and of Russia's international obligations, formed a  certain military budget. The Ministry of Finance disagreed with  it, which apparently is normal. At the same time the approach  itself was formulated in a fundamentally different way: We will  give as much money as we can, based on the state's assumed  income. The Duma inclined toward the second approach. This,  taking the state of our economy into account, would also be  understandable in general. But for one highly material  circumstance.    Parliament failed to take the next step, which was  absolutely  essential in that situation. Namely, it did not, as far as I  know, assume the responsibility of deciding just how, in fact,  the Ministry of Defense should dispose of the funds allocated  and what it should renounce. In giving this money to the Army,  it was necessary to say honestly: It is the State Duma -- an  organ of legislative power -- and not the "notorious  bureaucrats" of the Ministry of Defense which, owing to the  economic situation, is depriving servicemen of a considerable  proportion of the privileges that were granted them previously.  In giving this money to the Army, parliament should have  acknowledged that for the same reason soldiers would be fed and  clothed worse. The legislature should also have assumed  responsibility for the fact that considerably fewer apartments  than planned would be constructed. Consequently, with the  legislators' blessing many units and formations being withdrawn  from Germany and the Baltic republics would be housed out in the  open.    Moreover, precisely the parliamentarians should have taken  the trouble to decide who, essentially, was to abandon combat  training and where, and who was to make the switch exclusively  to guarding storehouses and military installations and to  mothballing military property. For it is perfectly obvious that  it is impossible, within the framework of the funds being  allocated, to maintain the combat readiness of all units,  formations, and districts.    That is, in adopting such a budget, parliament should have  recognized that not even the minimum requirements of all the  Armed Forces would be satisfied. And defined the vitally  important elements of the country's security structure which it  considers it necessary to finance, as well as the less important  ones which can be abandoned. And assumed responsibility for  those decisions. There should have been a debate on those  priorities, not about abstract figures. But there was not.    Instead, the opinion was widespread that the military was  sabotaging reforms in the Armed Forces, which is why the Army  cannot manage on the funds allocated to it. All this talk is  painfully reminiscent of what our leaders were saying about  conversion at the end of the eighties. Conversion, they said,  will not only provide the military-industrial complex with work  but will also give a boost to the entire country's development.  The only hindrance is the sluggish thinking of the corps of  directors. Something else was and still is a hindrance: A  reluctance to understand that any reform, be it conversion of  military production or Army reform, requires huge additional  funds.    And yet those who sit in the State Duma are certainly not  naive. There are sufficient qualified economists there to be  aware of the obvious. But for some reason they prefer not to  talk about real, basic problems. There can be just one  explanation for this, although it is not quite pleasant for the  legislators. They do not believe that the budget is realistic.  They do not believe that, by discussing it, they are really  financing a particular aspect of the state's life.    They believe that the government will fail to secure the  income on which it is reckoning. If this is so, then the crumbs  that are gathered up will be distributed "on a current basis,"  i.e. according to the method of stopping holes. In this case  all debate resembles the torments of one of Zhvanetskiy's  characters. The one who agonized over whether to buy crayfish  at "yesterday's R5" or "today's R3," when he neither had R5  yesterday nor has R3 today. Then, in discussing the military  budget, it is hardly worth going deeply into such complex  matters as defense capability. Then it becomes clear why the  budget's approval became a field for interparty intrigues, loud  statements, and overt politicking. It follows from this that  our politicians, alas, have not matured to the point of real  parliamentarianism, which embodies, above all, responsibility  for the country.</p>

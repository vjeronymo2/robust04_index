			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK to present proposals for opening Irish fishery Britain presents its proposals to the European Commission today for opening up European Union waters around Ireland to the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets from 1996. At the last fisheries council in September, a Commission proposal was rejected as being too bureaucratic and unworkable. The Commission called for member countries' own ideas on providing access to these sensitive waters when Spain and Portugal become full members of the common fisheries policy at the end of next year. Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said the British suggestions reflected many of the views of fishermen after widespread consultation. 'Now, we need to convince the council we have a workable alternative to the Commission's proposal,' he said. He hoped the issue would be discussed at the next fisheries council in November. Spain had threatened to block the accession of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden EU if rules for accommodating Spanish fishermen were not agreed by the end of this year. Mr Jack is calling for access to waters west of the UK, France and north-west Spain to be restricted to vessels with established rights, with special treatment for highly sensitive zones such as the Irish Box. He wants the UK to be able to enforce access arrangements for all vessels in its western waters. In addition, he wants larger vessels to be required to report their entry into and exit from areas covered by the regulations and to report catches. He is also proposing stronger technical conservation measures. The Commission had suggested allocation of standard vessel days to each nation for fishing in these waters.</p>

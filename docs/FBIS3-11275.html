In a meeting to evaluate the progress of  this process in Granma Province, which Alfredo Enriquez Pina,  first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Granma  Province, also attended, Ross Leal noted that the solution to  our problems is not money but more production. He stated that as  long as 79 percent of the country's enterprises are  unprofitable, Cuba will not be able to improve or overcome the  special period. He stressed that it was essential to reduce  expenses and increase production. He pointed out that until  production is raised we cannot think of an analysis of  agriculture prices. He went on to say that  agricultural-livestock workers first need to produce enough for  themselves and for the rest of our people.    During this meeting to analyze the workers parliaments of  Granma Province, it was mentioned that the Basic Cooperative  Production Units [UBPC] have been created but the number of  management personnel of the enterprises and delegations of the  Ministry of the Sugar Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture  have not been reduced. The importance of implementing a set of  ideas previously submitted by workers was also stressed by  participants. The solution to many of those problems can be  found in the individual work center, municipality, or province.    [Begin Ross recording] On the 29th we will agree on what we  will call the process that will follow this one, because we do  not want the word parliament to lose its content. The name  should express what is desired and it should be used when that  is necessary. We are going to change the focus and the name of  our process of assemblies of production or services. We are  thinking that they should be assemblies to discuss economic  efficiency in production or service centers. We must analyze  this carefully to establish a proper name so that they are not  used for something else, because production or services  assemblies are good for everything except for the analysis of  these problems. [end recording]    During the meeting, Pedro Ross Leal awarded a banner to  Granma Province for being the largest contributor toward  financing the Territorial Troops Militia [MTT] during 1993. In a  coming contact, we will offer exclusive statements made for this  program by comrade Ross Leal giving his personal views of the  progress of the workers parliaments in Granma Province.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: SMALL SHOW OUTSHINES THE BLOCKBUSTERS  </P> <P> The blockbuster exhibition, that exhaustive, exhausting phenomenon that all but  consumed American museums in the '80s, has a polar opposite in the Timken Art  Gallery's series of "Focus" shows.  </P> <P> Attracted by the hype, the blockbuster's shuffling hordes marvel en masse at  temporary extravaganzas, while permanent collection galleries stand vacant. At  the Timken, the permanent collection of European and American paintings and  Russian icons is the focus, and works from other sources are brought into the  gallery temporarily -- not to divert but to sharpen that focus.  </P> <P> "Eastman Johnson: The Cranberry Harvest, Island of Nantucket" (through June 24)  is the gallery's fourth "Focus" exhibition since the program began in 1984.  Like the others, it zeroes in on a single painting from the collection, and  puts it in the company of a dozen or so related works, studies by the same  artist or variations on the theme by others.  </P> <P> These shows broaden our understanding of the Timken's prized works, to be sure,  but just as important, they nurture an approach to art based on sensitivity  rather than the sensational. They encourage a slow, intimate discourse with the  work, a pace of viewing and reviewing. There is room here for the gradual  revelations and private discoveries that are all too often smothered by the  flourishes and frenzy of the blockbuster show. Here, one can learn how a work  of art is made, not just how it is marketed.  </P> <P> Eastman Johnson, like all ambitious American artists of the 19th Century,  sailed to Europe for his training. Born in Maine in 1824, he had already  established a successful career as a portraitist before leaving for Dusseldorf  in 1849, but experience in the academies, studios and museums of Europe earned  him a credibility unattainable in the fledgling art schools of the U.S. Johnson  studied figure and genre painting in Germany, the Hague and Paris before  returning to the U.S. in 1855.  </P> <P> Ironically, the demand for European training did not conflict with the equally  insistent demand toward the middle of the century for a distinctly American  art.  </P> <P> "Let a bold genius scan our history, note our civilization, examine our life,  and he will discover innumerable themes characteristic enough to excite the  interest of the people," wrote one critic and champion of Johnson's work in  1858. "Our colonial, pioneer and Revolutionary eras, the customs and local  peculiarities of the land, are prolific subjects for pictorial art; let them be  seized, with a native zest and true insight, and new life will be imparted to  the limner and his achievements."  </P> <P> Answering this call with "zest and insight," as well as good doses of nostalgia  and sentimentality, Johnson resumed his American career with a series of  portrait studies of the Chippewa Indians around Lake Superior. Not until 1859,  however, with the painting, "Life in the South" (also called "Negro Life at the  South" and "Old Kentucky Home") did he marry his interest in American themes  with his study of genre, the portrayal of scenes from everyday life. The  painting, an anecdotal treatment of leisure time in slave quarters, brought  Johnson popular and critical acclaim.  </P> <P> Between "Life in the South" and the 1880 painting, "Cranberry Harvest, Island  of Nantucket," the focus of the current Timken exhibition, Johnson pursued  several other themes -- farmers at work, families at home, children at play and  more. Several of these culminated in broad horizontal tableaux, epic images  composed of numerous small vignettes. "Cranberry Harvest" was Johnson's last  major effort of this type, and it is regarded by many to be his genre  masterpiece.  </P> <P> A sweeping view of the golden-brown cranberry bog and its harvesters, the  painting epitomizes Johnson's sanitized, idealized vision of rural labor. The  workers -- men, women and children -- bend over the sandy earth in search of  the small crimson berries, but their crop is less Johnson's concern than the  process of its gathering.  </P> <P> Intrigued by the quaint island of Nantucket since he first began spending time  there about 1870, Johnson observed the September harvest with a passion he  called his "cranberry fit." He respected the communal nature of the labor and,  most likely, exaggerated its overtones of play and courtship. Men gaze warmly  at the women working at their sides, and, throughout the finished painting and  the 13 studies included in the show, couples pair off for various tasks or a  flirtatious break. The sentimentality of the scene is further enhanced by a  charming trio of children making a game of their work, an older man picking  berries from a chair next to an admiring young girl, and most of all, by the  young boy carrying his infant charge to his mother, who stands like a vertical  anchor near the center of the image.  </P> <P> Golden dabs of light grace the cheeks and shoulders of the workers, a stoic,  clean and proud class -- no sweat or soreness here. American art scholar  Patricia Hills has written of the nationalism and nostalgia influencing such an  approach: "Turning to rural themes was, to be sure, a manifestation of the  cultural protest against the industrial revolution with its concomitant  overcrowded city slums, its urban pollution and human exploitation."  </P> <P> As American as Johnson's sensibility was, however, his style and subject matter  borrowed heavily from the European painters -- especially French -- whose work  he admired at home and had studied abroad. Thomas Couture, whose Paris studio  hosted a bevy of American art students, including Johnson, was a great champion  of the painted sketch, the quickly brushed study from life, en plein air.  </P> <P> Johnson's studies here reveal a fresh, vigorous touch that, according to the  conventions of 19th-Century painting, was exchanged for more deliberate,  refined brushwork in the finished painting. By contemporary standards, the  final composition looks stiff and staid next to the immediacy and directness of  the studies. While Johnson defines the figures in the final painting by the  layers and folds of their clothing, he is content in the studies to convey the  same gestures through dry dashes of solid color. In the large canvas, the  workers labor atop the land; in the studies (most on paper board), they merge  with it in a seamless union of brush strokes.  </P> <P> Seeing Johnson's finished work alongside his studies of the landscape and  cranberry pickers is a luxury afforded only by time and scholarship. Though  Johnson admired the energy of the painted sketch form, he -- and most artists  of his generation -- never considered such studies suitable for exhibition.  </P> <P> Credit for exposing this slice of art and social history goes to guest curator  Marc Simpson of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Simpson, his colleague  Sally Mills and Johnson scholar Patricia Hills from Boston University, have  each contributed an essay to the show's informative and richly illustrated  catalogue.  </P></p>

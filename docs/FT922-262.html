			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Breaking a run of bad luck: The casino industry's hopes for better times ahead LUCK has been running against the casino industry. The Gulf war hit Kuwaiti gamblers, then the recession knocked British confidence, and finally London Clubs, the capital's leading casino group, fell out of favour with the gaming authorities. In spite of all that, Mr Norman Ward-Jones, whose term as Gaming Board chairman ends tomorrow, believes that casino gaming has held up better than might be expected. 'Times are changing, and we have tried to change with them,' Mr Ward-Jones says. 'I suppose my main aim has been to preserve the character of British gaming - the club atmosphere.' Mr Ward-Jones's term of office has been generally calm and uneventful, apart from the debacle over London Clubs, which started a year ago with police raids on its Mayfair casinos. The board and the police have lodged objections to renewal of London Clubs' casino licences. No official comment is being made on the matter, pending a magistrates' court hearing set for October. However, after the sudden resignation of the top managers of London Clubs this spring - 'in the best interests of the majority of the company's employees' - the outlook has changed. It may be open to Sir Gordon Booth, new chairman of what is in effect a new company, to apply for a transfer of the licences. If the police and the Gaming Board chose not to oppose such a transfer, the casinos - which include the Ritz Club in Piccadilly and Les Ambassadeurs in Park Lane - would be saved. One of the main achievements of Mr Ward-Jones's six-year term as chairman was to secure an amendment to the Gaming Act to give the board proper control of casinos when they changed ownership. During the casino scandals at the end of the 1970s and 1980s, a casino in conflict with the authorities could simply try to sell its licences to a new company. Now, if 15 per cent of a casino's shares are sold, it is deemed a change in control and the company must seek a fresh certificate of consent. There have been one or two changes that have helped the gambler. For example, cheques may be consolidated - that is, a player who cashes cheques with the casino and goes on to win money that night may use the winnings to redeem the cheques. Mr Ward-Jones says: 'Obviously casinos have been hurt by the recession, even in the provinces. But it is surprising how well business has held up. 'The big money never came from the British, anyway. Overseas players still seem to be coming to London. In some of the provincial casinos, though the stakes are far less, the Chinese are the keenest punters.' New legislation is always difficult to promote. An attempt to raise the maximum number of slot machines allowed in a club from two to four failed in the Lords. Mr Ward-Jones has visited most of the 120 casinos in the country during his term, but has never felt drawn to gambling, beyond the typical Englishman's enthusiasm for the Derby. His successor is Lady Shirley Littler, who among other things chairs the Department of Health committee inquiring into stillbirths and deaths in infancy. She was previously director-general of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which she joined on leaving the Home Office, where she was under-secretary in charge of the immigration and nationality department. Mr Tom Kavanagh, the new secretary of the board, also comes from the Home Office's immigration department. The European dimension is likely to play an increasingly important role in the board's affairs. The European Commission is considering proposals to harmonise gambling regulations in the European Community to ensure 'a level playing field' for operators and consumers - although the plans are at an early stage. So far as casinos are concerned, each country's traditional way of doing things is likely to be the prevailing factor. To meet the challenge of the single European market, Mr Ward-Jones has set up a Gaming Regulators European Forum for gambling authorities in EC states.</p>

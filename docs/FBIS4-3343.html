			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Ministry Steps Up Bid to Preserve </F> Nation's Farmland"]    [Text] The central government is to boost the number of  farmland preservation zones around the country, the Agriculture  Ministry said yesterday.    The move is part of a bid to keep the arable acreage at  roughly current levels until the end of the century-levels which  are still nearly 20 million hectares short of what China needs  to feed and clothe its people.    And it comes as the government makes every possible effort  to  preserve the country's farmland which has been overwhelmed in  recent years by the growth of towns and cities.    The move was initiated by the State Council and aims to curb  the use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes, a ministry  official said.    And now a set of rules and regulations to protect farmland  have been jointly drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and  the State Land Administration and they will be issued later this  year the official said.    The regulations say all non-agricultural use of farmland  must  be first approved by the authorities and the user will be  required to pay for such use. However the official declined to  elaborate.    China has only about 96 million hectares of arable land to  feed its 1.2 billion people. That's about 0.087 hectares of  land per head.    Chinese agricultural experts believed the minimum  requirement  is 110 million hectares of grain cropland, plus 5.7 million  hectares of cotton-growing land.    Nevertheless, the limited farmland is still being overrun by  an invasion of industrial and residential developments, said  land administration officials.    A report in the Beijing-based ECONOMIC REFERENCE NEWS, says  747,000 hectares of farmland have been lost in the past two  years, particularly affecting grain and cotton crops.    The State Council, China's cabinet, launched a basic  farmland  preservation drive in 1992, urging all local governments to put  mandatory preservation orders on their high-yield cropland.    The programme covers rich rural land, suburban vegetable  farms, and national or local agricultural production centres.    The pilot programme has so far led some 900 counties, or 45  per cent of the country's total, to set up protection zones.    In Shanxi Province, protection orders have been put on 3  million hectares of land, 61 per cent of its total, while zones  have been set up to cover 80 per cent--4 million hectares--of  the counties in Jiangsu Province.    Meanwhile, most of local governments have also issued  related  regulations, rules or policies specifying details of the  programme. However, the official said some problems still exist  such as the lack of management of the protected zones and the  regional protectionism.    To make up the massive land deficit, China has launched  several projects to reclaim or develop its 33 million hectares  of wasteland and switch some of its 333 million hectares of  grassland to agricultural use.</p>

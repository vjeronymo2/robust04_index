			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Poland moves back on track with debt talks: Warsaw negotiator smoothes ruffled feathers of banks - Anthony Robinson and Christopher Bobinski review the chequered history of debt servicing NEGOTIATIONS for a reduction in Poland's Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 8.5bn) debt to foreign commercial banks are now expected to take on a new urgency following International Monetary Fund approval this week of a Dollars 655m stand-by credit. An initial approach was made to foreign banks represented by the London Club of bank creditors early in February after an 18-month hiatus. The Polish team was led by Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, formerly Poland's main trade official in Washington and recently appointed as Warsaw's debt negotiator. He defines Poland's goals as 'a reasonable agreement on all aspects of our debt linked to our real capacity to pay'. The Dollars 12.1bn which Poland owes the banks is made up of capital and the capitalised interest accumulated since Warsaw suspended debt service on all but Dollars 1.1bn of revolving trade credits three years ago. The number of bank creditors has fallen to around 300 from 460 ten years ago as many smaller creditors have quietly sold off their Polish debt on the secondary market. Some debt was also bought back illegally by Polish officials implicated in the so-called Fozz scandal two years ago. Fozz is the Polish acronym for the now-disbanded Polish debt office. Poland continued to service its commercial bank debt for eight years after suspending its much larger official debt to government agencies in March 1981. A decade of accumulating unpaid debt service pushed up the original Dollars 20bn official debt to Dollars 33bn. But in March 1991 the Paris Club of official creditors agreed a two stage, 50 per cent, debt reduction which was conditional on Poland receiving IMF approval for its reform policies and budgetary discipline. The decision to suspend servicing most bank debt was taken partly on the advice of US academic advisers shortly after the collapse of the communist regime. The move angered the banks as did the decision to stop servicing the Dollars 1.1bn revolving trade credit only days before talks resumed with London Club representatives. One of Mr Krowacki's first tasks at the resumed talks was to explain Warsaw's decision. 'We had to place all the debt on the same basis so that we could deal with it comprehensively,' he explained. But the unilateral move to non-performing status only days before debt talks resumed was an expensive blow for holders of the revolving credit. Apart from smoothing the ruffled feathers of bank creditors, Mr Krowacki also has to explain to his domestic audience why Poland needs to reach an agreement on debts incurred under the communist regime. 'Few Poles realise that we pay a hefty credit risk premium. The combination of a 4 per cent premium and wider spreads is sometimes higher than the base interest rate itself,' Mr Krowacki says. Warsaw's poor credit rating is an important element in Poland's relative lack of success in attracting private investment, which has been channelled mainly into Hungary and the Czech Republic. Hungary, whose per capita foreign debt is double the Polish level, received over 60 per cent of the Dollars 7bn private capital which flowed into central Europe between 1990-92. Hungary's strong credit rating, sharply declining debt/export ratio and rising reserves has widened its access to US and Japanese as well as European capital markets and reduced the cost of borrowing. At present Poland is paying only reduced interest on its Paris Club debt. Next year it will have to pay full interest and in 1995 Warsaw will have to resume capital repayment of around Dollars 2bn annually in addition to between Dollars 500m and Dollars 600m in interest payments. A London Club agreement would require additional repayments on the bank debt. All this has serious budgetary implications for a country facing a sharply rising domestic debt burden and the need to keep the budget deficit to around 5 per cent of GDP. This is the main target outlined in Poland's letter of intent to the IMF in connection with the latest standby loan. Servicing foreign and domestic debt will consume 12 per cent of total budget spending in fiscal 1993, according to Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister. This will rise to around 25 per cent by 1995 if repayments under both Paris and London Club agreements have to be financed. This will require fresh money and refinancing of existing debt on a substantial scale. Borrowing alone will not be enough. Poland also requires further strong export growth and rising inflows of foreign equity capital. Mr Osiatynski believes that measures will be required before long to boost exports. 'I would prefer to do this through tax concessions to exporters rather than by devaluation which feeds back quickly into inflation. But tax concessions would erode revenue and bring us into conflict with the European Community,' he says. His words reflect the narrow margin of choice in a country which has achieved an economic transformation in three years, but badly needs a commercial debt agreement to facilitate investment on the scale required to ensure steady growth.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the </F> Yugoslav National Bank, by Dusko Petrovic, following reports  that the FRY dinar has been listed on the foreign currency  exchange list in USA TODAY; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Avramovic] That is great. Thank you for finding  that report. It will help here for the people to realize that  someone actually trusts us with something, after all the  doubting Thomases we have here. Their mistrust is unfounded.  But you see, there are other people who can see it from a  distance and who can see that everything is all right. The  minute I got here a magazine from Israel telephoned me asking  for an explanation of all this, citing the article from THE  ECONOMIST, you see.    [Petrovic] Can we expect an Israeli economic or financial  magazine to publish soon an exchange list that will have our  dinar on it?    [Avramovic] I am certain that this will go further. The  next paper to carry it will be THE HERALD TRIBUNE.    [Petrovic] Can you please comment on the fact that this [USA  TODAY] exchange list literally carries our exchange rate  concerning the dollar, that is, the German mark?    [Avramovic] Yes, yes. Exactly. They have put here foreign  currency [two words in English], it says 1.71 per dollar, which  is our official exchange rate. The dollar has weakened against  the German mark, so this is exactly right, according to parity.    [Petrovic] What does this mean in practical, concrete terms?    [Avramovic] In practice it means that we will most likely  appear -- at this price, or very close to this price -- in  exchange offices worldwide. This practically means that when  you travel to Switzerland and so on, you will be able to go to  the Union de Banque Suisse and sell your dinars there, and not  at some scandalous price either. First it will appear, then  there will be some margin, and then the margin will drop -- if  everything continues to go well here. It also works the other  way around. You will buy dinars there. They will become a  thing to buy and sell in the world. That will solve the problem  of the internal convertibility -- and I do not know who invented  that -- that is stupid, you see. It is either convertible or  not, it either has value or not. If it has value, then it has  value both here and in Milan. If it has no value, then it has  no value either here or in Milan.    Then soon, it will inevitably appear in Vienna, in Zurich,  then it will appear in New York.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / U-turn gives stay of execution to 21 pits THE GOVERNMENT bowed yesterday to the national storm of protest provoked by its planned run-down of the coal industry by agreeing a temporary reprieve for 21 of the 31 pits earmarked for closure. The embarrassing climbdown, announced to MPs after an emergency meeting of the cabinet had been told that its original programme faced certain defeat at Westminster, will give temporary job security to 22,000 of the more than 30,000 miners threatened with redundancy. It may also delay for a year the privatisation of British Coal. But in spite of a broad welcome from most Conservative MPs, it remained uncertain whether the moratorium and an associated government study would be sufficient to head off pressure among MPs for a far-reaching review of the energy industry. Amid angry scenes in the House of Commons, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the closure of 10 loss-making pits would go ahead after completion of the statutory 90-day review procedure. The remaining 21 would stay open at least until early next year. But Mr Heseltine emphasised that his willingness to allow wide-ranging consultations about the industry's future had not altered his conviction that the case for a radical reduction in capacity was 'compelling'. The U-turn marked another serious blow to the authority of Mr John Major's embattled government, and put a question mark over its ability to push through plans for drastic cuts in government spending programmes next year. It also left the personal political standing of Mr Heseltine severely dented. He emerged from a two-hour grilling in the Commons to face renewed demands from some Conservative MPs for his resignation. Mr Heseltine, who apologised to MPs for the handling of last week's announcement but refused to budge on the economic judgment behind his decision, was driven at one point to tell jeering opposition MPs to 'stop being so bloody stupid'. Senior ministers calculated that the volte-face would be enough to avert a full-scale rebellion by Tory backbenchers when the Commons debates the future of the coal industry tomorrow. The ministers acknowledged, however, that Mr Heseltine needed to win over more potential rebels in private meetings today with backbench MPs. Some prominent critics of the closures, including Mr Winston Churchill, indicated they were still prepared to back Labour demands for an independent inquiry embracing a strategic analysis of all Britain's energy resources. Mr Churchill believes the privatised electricity industry has 'rigged' the energy market against coal. Last night Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the cross-party Commons trade and industry committee, said his committee would launch a wide-ranging review of energy strategy. Some Conservative MPs appeared unimpressed by Mr Heseltine's simultaneous announcement of a package of aid worth Pounds 165m to regenerate the areas hit by the pit closures. The aid programme - which includes Pounds 75m of new money for English Estates to provide factory sites and another Pounds 75m extra for training schemes - will be overseen by Lord Walker, former cabinet minister and now chairman-designate of the planned Urban Regeneration Agency. Mr Heseltine said the government would also introduce new enterprise zones while other areas would be upgraded to assisted area status next year. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, sought to capitalise on remaining Tory disquiet, signalling that the opposition motion to be debated tomorrow would not focus on 'scoring points' against the government. Instead, it demands that no pits close until the Commons trade and industry select committee has carried out a review of the costs and benefits of closures. Mr Heseltine said repeatedly that he saw no long-term future for the coal industry at its present size. British Coal could expect to secure a contract with the electricity generators for no more than 40m tonnes a year from April against the present 65m tonnes. 'The economic case for a substantial reduction in capacity therefore remains compelling,' he said. Signalling his opposition to any independent inquiry, Mr Heseltine said that during the moratorium 'the government and British Coal will set out the full case for the closures which British Coal planned and to which I agreed'. Subject to Commons approval, he then intended that British Coal would 'proceed with a phased programme of colliery closures aimed at reducing surplus capacity as soon as possible'. Any changes in the programme ultimately were likely to be 'at the margin'. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, and other miners' leaders insisted they would continue their campaign to have all pit closures halted. The Trades Union Congress said it would go ahead with a mass rally in London on Sunday. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said: 'There has been no genuine moratorium. All the miners have got is a stay of execution.'

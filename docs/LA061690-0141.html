			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NORDQUIST FALLS SHORT IN JUMP-OFF;  </P> <P> TRACK: LA HABRA RESIDENT LEAPS 7-8 3/4 IN THE HIGH JUMP AT NATIONAL  CHAMPIONSHIPS TO PLACE SECOND TO CONWAY. BOTH QUALIFY FOR THE U.S. GOODWILL  GAMES TEAM.  </P> <P> His coach shouted technical advice. His parents, relatives and longtime pals  added their encouragement. And the students from his Santa Fe Springs High  School band class provided an orchestra of vocal support.  </P> <P> But in the end, only Doug Nordquist was going to get Doug Nordquist over the  high jump bar Friday night at the USA/Mobil national track and field  championships at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Nordquist managed that task quite nicely, leaping 7 feet 8 3/4 inches. Not only  was that a career best -- he jumped 7-8 1/2 at the Irvine Elite Classic June 3  -- but it also broke his meet record of 7-8 set in 1988.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Nordquist, Hollis Conway, the American record-holder at 7-10,  also cleared 7-8 3/4 Friday, then beat Nordquist in a jump-off moments later.  In the jump-off, both missed at 7-9 1/2, but when the bar was lowered to 7-8  3/4 again, Conway cleared it but Nordquist could not.  </P> <P> Although he was disappointed that he did not win -- Nordquist wanted to add a  third national championship to the two he earned in 1986 and '88 -- he did  accomplish his ultimate goal: a berth on the U.S. Goodwill Games team. The top  two finishers in each event qualify for the 50-nation meet, which will be held  July 20-Aug. 5 in Seattle.  </P> <P> Nordquist, 31, and Conway, 22, mugged for reporters after the competition.  </P> <P> "I felt sorry for him. I already had two championships," said Nordquist, a La  Habra resident who attended Sonora High School.  </P> <P> Answered Conway: "Yeah, I'm the freshman."  </P> <P> Nordquist, who won the gold medal at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, cleared  his first five heights, including his career-best 7-8 3/4. So excited was  Nordquist with that leap that he nearly ran out onto the track just as the  men's 1,500-meter runners went by.  </P> <P> Then, instead of attempting the next height, 7-9 1/2, Nordquist asked that the  bar be raised to 7-10 1/2 -- an attempt to set the American record. But he  missed twice, scraping the bar with his back, and came to the bleachers for  some quick advice from his coach, Allan Hanckela.  </P> <P> What Nordquist got was a tip from his father.  </P> <P> "Think!" Neil Nordquist shouted to his son.  </P> <P> "Don't think!" his son shot back.  </P> <P> Perhaps he should have thought. Nordquist missed on the third attempt, forcing  the jump-off for the title.  </P> <P> "I wanted it too badly. I hadn't pressed all day long," Nordquist said. "I got  a little excited. . . . It's just a new experience. There's a big difference  between jumping 7-6 and 7-10.  </P> <P> "I just have to get used to that feeling. Come Goodwill Games, we'll see what  happens."  </P> <P> Meet Notes  </P> <P> Jim Doehring, a former San Clemente High standout now living in Fallbrook, won  the shotput with a toss of 69-6 3/4. World record-holder Randy Barnes, who  complained of an injured hand, was second at 69-3 1/2. . . . Former UC Irvine  long jumper Mike Powell was first in that event's qualifying heat with a  wind-aided leap of 26-10.5. . . . Costa Mesa resident Bonnie Dasse, formerly of  Orange Coast College, was third in the shotput, qualifying at 56-10 3/4. . . .  Former Newport Beach resident PattiSue Plumer won her heat of the 1,500 in  4:12.54. In another 1,500 heat, UCI's Buffy Rabbitt was ninth (4:23.04) and did  not qualify.  </P></p>

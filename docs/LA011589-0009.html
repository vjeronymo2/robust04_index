			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I love the way ABC treats our Olympic champ. The network advertises the  daylights out of "Brian Boitano: Canvas of Ice," then shows it at 10:45 p.m. on  the West Coast! Who cares about watching Sarah Purcell interviewing Mary Tyler  Moore (in the preceding "Public People, Private Lives")? ABC could have aired  Boitano's special on another night other than Monday so the football game  wouldn't have interfered with it. Good going, ABC!  </P> <P> Debra Barlow, Northridge  </P></p>

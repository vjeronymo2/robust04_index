			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee price slide continues COFFEE PRICES dropped by up to Dollars 27 a tonne on the London Commodity Exchange yesterday after a wave of selling in New York, where brokers remained sceptical that the producers' new retention scheme would work. The scheme aims to restrict producers' exports by 20 per cent until the 15-day average of the International Coffee Organisation's composite indicator price rises above 75 cents a lb. Tuesday's ICO average was 70.62 cents, but that was set to fall with London's January robusta futures position slipping to the equivalent of 52 cents a lb yesterday and New York's March arabica position, which fell one and a half cents on Tuesday, down another 0.35 to 74.15 cents in late trading. In the run-up to the scheme being launched last Friday, London's December delivery price, which closed yesterday at Dollars 1,140 a tonne, reached a high of Dollars 1,325 a tonne. 'I can see the scheme working temporarily, but if prices go up, the lure of higher prices could attract some increased selling from producers,' said Ms Judy Ganes, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. If prices fell too far, she added, producers would wonder why they were spending so much on the scheme and might 'throw in the towel'.</p>

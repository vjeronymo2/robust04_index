			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD market firmed yesterday, shrugging off signs that US inflation pressure might be easing. Having dipped early on by Dollars 1 the London bullion market price rallied to close Dollars 1.80 up on the day at Dollars 365.75 a troy ounce. 'I think the market got itself a bit short and when buying came in, people ran for cover,' one dealer said. After the price bounce another dealer commented: 'I would regard anything around Dollars 363 (the low reached in the initial fall) as an opportunity to buy'. At the London Metal Exchange the TIN market came under renewed pressure as traders became increasingly concerned over rising stocks, growing production and sluggish demand. A slide through Dollars 5,100 a tonne for three months metal triggered stop-loss selling and the price ended at a 20-year low of Dollars 5,070 a tonne, down Dollars 90. London's robusta COFFEE market reversed an early setback to end Dollars 2 up on the day in the September futures position, at Dollars 922 a tonne, near the middle of the recent trading range. The COCOA market remained quiet with nearby futures contracts scoring small gains. Compiled from Reuters</p>

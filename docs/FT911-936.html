			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Blazing a trail in southern Italy - Haig Simonian explains the change of status for Banco di Napoli BANCO di Napoli, the large public-sector Italian bank, is called many names, but 'trail-blazer' is not one of them. However, the Naples-based bank, which is the biggest financial institution in southern Italy and the fifth largest nationally, is the first big bank to decide to use new laws letting it list up to 49 per cent of its shares on the stock exchange. Precisely when the bank goes ahead will depend on market conditions, says Mr Antonio Sussi, its deputy director-general, who is also responsible for its international activities. However, he adds, 'we expect to issue within the year'. Although some large public-sector banks, such as Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and Credito Italiano, are quoted, most are not. Neither municipally-owned savings banks, such as Milan's Cariplo, are listed, nor the handful of large banks which, like Banco di Napoli, are owned by charitable foundations. The closest private investors can get to such institutions is to buy special categories of shares such as the non-voting savings stock which some have listed, or the ordinary shares of quoted subsidiaries, such as Monte dei Paschi di Siena's Banca Toscana operation. Last year, legislation allowed such big banks to change their legal status to joint stock companies, and thus move towards floating up to 49 per cent of their ordinary shares. The decision at Banco di Napoli's annual meeting on April 29 to change its status means it should be the first to go ahead. How much the move will raise remains unclear. However, Mr Sussi stresses the bank has put its long-standing problem of shortage of capital behind it. The change to joint stock status will be accompanied by a revaluation of assets which is set to more than double the bank's net worth from L1,742bn at end-1990 to L3,620bn. 'At this point, we become a much bigger bank,' says Mr Sussi. The figure will reach more than L5,000bn if subordinated loans and other factors, such as the first L140bn tranche of a four-tranche L850bn cash injection from the Italian Treasury, are included. The changes will leave the previously under-capitalised bank much better placed. At the end of last year, it had reached the Bank of Italy's current capital standards. The recapitalisation will also put it above the 1993 norms from the Bank for International Settlements, Mr Sussi says. 'We will have a lot of room to grow.' Shareholders in the 'new' joint stock Banco di Napoli, which will be formally launched on July 1, will be the foundation - which currently owns all the bank - and the Italian Treasury. Following the translation of last year's injection of Treasury funds into new shares in the bank, they will have stakes of about 93 per cent and 6.5 per cent stake each. Mr Sussi cannot say whether the bank will float 49 per cent of its stock on the bourse in one go or will opt for smaller tranches. 'We really haven't thought about that yet. It will depend on the market.' Discussion of possible foreign tranches and potential lead managers for the offering is also premature. 'We have to be sure the shares get placed with investors who won't immediately sell them back in Italy,' notes Mr Sussi. Although the bulk of the issue will be sold domestically, 'we could also sell some shares abroad if we get the feeling that there are long-term investors", says Mr Sussi. As matters stand, the bank reckons that more than 10 per cent of its savings shares are held outside Italy. Banco di Napoli has grown in attractiveness as an investment since the early 1980s, when it barely made money. Even if profits remain relatively low, net earnings jumped by 40.5 per cent to L104bn in 1989 and leapt a further 52.4 per cent to L159bn last year. That came despite a contraction in total assets to L82,870bn from L85,128bn in 1989, reflecting the bank's tougher policy on lending. According to Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its loan loss provisions are now in line with industry averages. Shareholders have already had some reward, with the dividend on savings shares being raised last year to L1,600 a share from L1,400. Analysts say there is further profit potential in the bank's pension scheme. The current, fully-funded in-house scheme is believed to be over-provided, allowing scope for considerable savings in future. No allocation was made to the fund last year. The bank, which now has 617 branches, has been expanding its domestic coverage, notably in the south. 'The south of Italy is still underbanked,' says Mr Sussi. The bank plans to open almost 140 new branches this year, most of them small units. Further internationalisation is also in the pipeline, although Mr Sussi rejects rumours that the bank is on the brink of a cross-equity deal with a foreign counterpart. 'We have an operating agreement with Banco Exterior of Spain, but there is nothing else planned,' he says. 'Our position is first to change the bank's status; that will show our full strength. Then we can talk with others.' With its new capital, is there not the risk of suddenly throwing caution to the winds and spending wildly on acquisitions? 'It won't happen to us. We've spent too many years living within very tight capital bounds,' says Mr Sussi.</p>

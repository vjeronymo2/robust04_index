			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Royal rights The market was surprised at the timing, but not the substance, of the Pounds 404m rights issue which accompanied Royal Insurance's first quarter figures. Royal has long been seen by the market as one of the prime candidates to raise money via a rights issue, but analysts had expected the group to wait until it had achieved profits for at least two quarters before asking its shareholders for cash. The deeply-discounted terms of the rights issue was generally well received in the market, where Royal shares closed a net 9 weaker at 307p, having fallen to 301p at one point. Turnover totalled 5.5m, the highest since mid-March. But across the wider range of the market, the cash call unsettled sentiment. One leading analyst described Royal's first quarter figures as 'surprisingly good', and said they would have been even better but for the country-wide floods in January. He said the rights capital would enable the company to take advantage of the opportunities caused by the shrinkage of the UK market's underwriting capacity. There were worries in the sector that Royal's move might be followed by a similar fund-raising from General Accident, whose shares fell 6 to 554p.</p>

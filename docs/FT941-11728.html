			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Chairman of Tory group under fire Sir George Gardiner's future as chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory MPs looked in increasing doubt last night after the botched handling of an abortive meeting with the prime minister. MPs in the group were vociferous in condemning the way the engagement was handled after Mr John Major had been angered by publicity suggesting he was being offered terms for his survival as leader. As rumours about a possible challenge to Sir George's chairmanship started circulating, one prominent group member said the matter had been 'appallingly badly handled'. He said the meeting should have been cancelled as soon as reports appeared that the group was demanding changes. The outcome - the meeting was deferred after a few minutes - reflected badly on Mr Major and the group. Separately, the rightwing No Turning Back group of Tory MPs released a paper arguing that a single currency would signal the end of the UK as a nation state. It urged the government to guarantee there would be no return to the European exchange rate mechanism. A Conservative Europe 1994 and Beyond. The European Foundation, 61 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5HZ.

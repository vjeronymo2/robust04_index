			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Bank shares may suffer further fall - New York Although this will be a holiday-shortened week (the markets are shut on Thursday for Thanksgiving and will close at 1pm on Friday), investors and traders should have plenty to chew on over the next few days. October durable goods data, due out on Wednesday, are expected to provide further evidence that economic activity is picking up. But the stock markets may not find much cheer in the numbers if, as in the past few weeks, the news unsettles inflation-sensitive bond investors and pushes long-term interest rates higher. The steady rise in rates has put the brake on the long rally in bank stocks. One of the reasons the Federal Reserve cut interest rates between 1990 and 1992 was to bail out the ailing banking industry by providing banks with huge interest margins. The rate cuts had the desired effect, but now, with rates rising, banks will have to wean themselves off their fat margins. Their earnings performance, which has been impressive recently, will undoubtedly suffer as a result. Bank stocks, which stumbled last week, could fall further before the week is over. There is little corporate news due out, although the takeover battle for Paramount Communications will enter a new phase with the offers of rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network both due to expire this week. Investors will also be keeping an eye on airline stocks in the light of the flight attendants strike at American Airlines, which unions plan to extend into the busy Thanksgiving weekend - traditionally, the busiest travel period in the year. Stocks traded on the Nasdaq market are looking vulnerable at the moment. Nasdaq lists a lot of smaller-capitalised, growth-oriented companies, many in the technology, communications and healthcare sectors. Their shares performed well when the economy was seen to be struggling, because investors liked their potential for earnings growth, but in recent months they have lagged the broader market. Last week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index held their own near record highs, the Nasdaq composite fell 3.56 per cent, and its performance over the year now lags behind the main indices. With economic growth picking up pace, the tide of investment sentiment may be moving decisively against small-cap stocks in favour of the giants of the Dow and S&amp;P. Finally, the market for initial public offerings is worth watching. Over the past fortnight the IPO market has seen a couple of big successes - most notably, the flotations of the restaurant chain Boston Chicken and the clothing retailer Talbots. Both benefited from hype and heavy speculative buying, leading some observers to warn that the IPO market (and with it the secondary market) may be in danger of overheating.</p>

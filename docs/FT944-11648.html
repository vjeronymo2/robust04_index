			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco plans nickel mine Rising metal prices have led Inco, the Toronto-based nickel producer, to press ahead with a large mine near its Sudbury, Ontario, operation. Inco said yesterday it would invest USDollars 158m to bring the McCreedy East nickel and copper deposit to production. The mine, due to be commissioned in late 1996, is expected to be to be one of Inco's lowest cost - and most productive - operations. In its first phase, McCreedy East will produce an estimated 15m tons of ore, grading 4.32 per cent copper and 1.44 per cent nickel. At full production in 1999, it is expected to mine 3,000 tons of ore a day for 17 years. At this rate, it will produce 22.5m lbs of nickel and 77.5m lbs pounds of copper annually. The mine is expected to employ about 200 people. As recently as last year, nickel producers were cutting production to bring supply into line with demand. But the market has turned sharply in recent months.</p>

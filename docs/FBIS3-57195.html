The right-wing  opposition, which had been demanding a declaration of intention  to join NATO, was somewhat stunned by such a decisive step from  the current Lithuanian leaders who, from their point of view,  have pro-Russian sympathies.    What made the Lithuanian leadership, which is distinguished  by a sober, well-considered approach to issues, a habit of not  hurrying, and an emphatically good-neighborly attitude to  Russia, become the first of the Baltic countries to request NATO  membership? What is this: pressure from the political  opposition? A change in the political situation in connection  with the elections in Russia?    Undoubtedly all these factors played a part. Lithuania,  irrespective of prevailing conditions, had to choose with whom  it wanted to be, and say "yes" or "no" to the North Atlantic  alliance. After long hesitations clarity has been introduced,  positions have been refined, and the time of uncertainty is at  an end. Russian troops are stationed in Latvia and Estonia;  hence they are refraining at the moment from officially applying  to NATO for membership. Lithuania has nevertheless chosen the  path of solidarity with these states. The "Partnership for  Peace" program has not been entirely accepted in Lithuania. And  many politicians saw in it no guarantees of national security,  although President Algirdas Brazauskas has given every support  to this initiative, which is based on gradual entry to NATO  structures.    Lithuania realizes that the republic will not become a NATO  member for a long time, that this road is very difficult and  full of pitfalls. The Lithuanian statement bears a highly  political, even symbolic character, and it would be  fundamentally incorrect to see it as a manifestation of some  kind of anti-Russian stance. A hardline reaction from Russian  representatives will only distance the amicably disposed  Lithuanian leadership still further.    Politicians from the camp of left-wing forces, especially  from the ruling Democratic Labor Party, advocate all-round  cooperation with Russia, especially in the economic sphere, and  support a balanced, cautious policy toward West and East.    The right-wing opposition, which is headed by former  parliamentary speaker Vytautas Landsbergis, accuses the ruling  party, President Algirdas Brazauskas, Foreign Minister Povilas  Gylys, their "associate" Kazis Bobelis, chairman of the Seimas  Committee for Foreign Affairs, and certain other influential  Lithuanian politicians of excessive tractability vis-a-vis  Russia, and even of a secret desire to join the CIS. It is on  this line of disagreements that considerably earnest passions  are beginning to rage. On the one hand, ardent charges of  selling out the motherland and independence are heard, on the  other -- categorical assurances of the complete absence of such  base designs. The opposition sees the shadow of the Russian  bear even in the creation of joint enterprises. The Right's  campaign for a reassessment of foreign policy was stepped up  after the elections in Russia. Vytautas Landsbergis stated:  "The new authorities have tried to reorientate Lithuania's  policy toward the East, and now we see just what this East is  like."    Does the opposition understand that its rhetoric only  provokes Russia's radicals? The Left believes that the  intransigent Right, which whips up anti-Russian sentiments, acts  on the principle of "the worse, the better." In the Right's  opinion, this tactic accelerates their accession to power in  Lithuania.    Algirdas Brazauskas is perhaps the only political leader in  Lithuanian whom political opponents are reluctant to criticize.  This is the effect not only of Brazauskas' personal prestige but  also of reverence for the presidency. That same Landsbergis of  the malicious tongue understands that a restrained tone toward  the president and his post could perhaps enable him to avoid  indiscriminate criticism in the future, should he suddenly  become president...    Under the Constitution it is the president who is answerable  to the country for the state's foreign policy activity. It was  Brazauskas together with Yeltsin who, during the recent meeting  in Moscow, got the stalled Russian-Lithuanian talks moving again  and so enabled a whole package of important agreements to then  be signed. As advisers Brazauskas chose Justas Paletskis -- a  former professional diplomat and his comrade in arms in the  Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee, where he  supervised ideology and culture -- despite the fact that in the  difficult days of the former Communist Party he joined the  social democrats' party and apparently betrayed his former views.    The son of a well-known Lithuanian party figure who was for  many years chairman of the Lithuanian SSR [Soviet Socialist  Republic] Supreme Soviet, Paletskis is very cautious and adopts  a well-considered approach to any problem; in short, he acts  according to the principle "Measure your cloth 10 times..."  Just as Paletskis was one of the most consistent supporters of  transforming the Communist Party into a party of the social  democratic type. Paletskis is generally considered a firm  advocate of good relations with Russia. His influence on the  president is very great.    But, as the saying goes, render unto Caesar the things that  are Caesar's: The president elaborates the strategic directions  of Lithuanian diplomacy with his chief foreign policy adviser,  but, as a rule, very seldom interferes in the specifics of  foreign policy. This is typical of Brazauskas in general.  Unlike his predecessor Landsbergis, who wrote his own speeches  with his own hand, since he did not like anything that was  outside his own direct control, and who liked to give interviews  to journalists almost every day, Brazauskas does not tolerate  excessive surveillance over anyone, grants more independence,  shows trust, and never bothers with trifles, or rather, never  expends his energies on affairs not worth his while.    Many a politician in Lithuania was greatly surprised when  Povilas Gylys, a Vilnius University professor and a man on the  whole remote from foreign policy, was promoted to the post of  chief of the foreign policy department. In recent years he had  headed the department of foreign relations [as published], but  he had not made his mark in big-time politics. However, it  quickly became clear that the president had made the right  choice. Gylys clearly adheres to the foreign policy cause  elaborated by the Democratic Labor Party, does not indulge in  unnecessary dabbling or "meddling," and has even several times  successfully cut down to size impolite right-wing oppositionists  from the Seimas rostrum.    Gylys is also numbered with the "Russophiles," and is also  charged with secret plans for Lithuania to join the CIS and with  certain separate deals with Russia.    The bitter battle for the foreign political heights in  Lithuania is also reflected in the fate of the current chairman  of the Seimas Committee for Foreign Affairs (Kazis Bobelis --  yet another highly influential politician). A Lithuanian  American, a doctor by profession, who lived in the United States  from 1944 through 1992, he returned to Lithuania on the eve of  the parliamentary elections. In emigration he headed the Main  Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, an extremely  prestigious organization in emigre circles. The committee was  dissolved with Lithuania's acquisition of independence and the  chairman decided to return to his homeland. His homeland  welcomed him unenthusiastically. Bobelis was betrayed by the  American habit of calling a spade a spade. He allowed himself  to speak scornfully about certain third-wave "Sajudis" people  who considered themselves the only Lithuanian patriots. The  Right at once recalled his U.S. citizenship, insisting that  Kazis Bobelis, as a citizen of the United States, had had no  right to take part in the Seimas elections in which he had won  his seat.    However, the former emigre stood his ground and in the  presidential election last February he, the number one staunch  anticommunist, supported the former number one Communist  Brazauskas. This deepened the split between himself and the  right-wing radicals still further.    Kazis Bobelis has earned the reputation of a man who is  decisive and independent. Not everyone is capable of leaving a  home in Florida, where Prime Minister Slezevicius and his family  spent the Christmas holidays with him, and moving to cold  Lithuania, which at the time was enduring a power supply crisis.    As a sensible man, Bobelis cannot fail to see how pernicious  the course advocated by some right-wing politicians seeking  confrontation with Russia would be for Lithuania.    If republic Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, Seimas Chairman  C.  Jursenas, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, and J.  Bulovas, leader of the working group for talks with the CIS, are  added to the list of major protagonists in Lithuanian foreign  policy, the composition of the new coordinating council for  foreign policy becomes clear. It is these "magnificent eight"  who today determine Lithuania's strategy, coordinate the actions  of all institutions of power in the foreign policy sphere,  resolve cadre questions, and guide the work of all Lithuanian  embassies, six missions, and several consulates general abroad.</p>

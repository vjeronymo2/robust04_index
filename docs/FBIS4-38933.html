			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas and  Europarliament President Egon Klepsch so no reasons why an  associative treaty could not be concluded between Lithuania and  the European Union, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy  adviser Petras Vaitekunas told Interfax.    Vaitekunas said that Brazauskas had again complained that  Russia had not honored the trade and economic agreement signed  last November. By doing so, Brazauskas told Klepsch, Russia  tried to make it more compliant in other areas. (IF Note: In  particular, Russia wants free transit to the Kaliningrad Region  across Lithuania).    Klepsch expressed satisfaction over the fact that the  relations between Lithuania and Russia had been largely settled  and added that Europe would welcome positive results of talks on  the outstanding bilateral issues.    Speaking of Lithuania's efforts to strengthen the contacts  between the Baltic countries and the Visegrad group, Brazauskas  called for more tangible western aid to the Ukrainian economy.    He said that early admission of Latvia to the Council of  Europe would contribute to security in the Baltics.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / All at sea in Europe: Why the EC ship of state is drifting A row is brewing inside the European Community over new institutional reform, which Brussels intends as a solution to future problems but which could end up merely complicating present ones. After the stormy waters of negotiations on its Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union, the Community ship of (super)state now lies becalmed. But on board all is far from calm. Some of the passengers (member states) and much of the crew (the European Commission) are growing restive. A queasy period in the doldrums was inevitable this year, as the Maastricht treaty waits for the ratification that it must get from each and every EC parliament. But the Community is also stalled on its 'normal business'. It has made little or no progress so far in reaching a Gatt trade deal with the US, in carrying out its internal farm reform, or in agreeing future EC funding up to 1997. The EC executive itself is starting to rattle apart as its four-year term draws to an end this December, with commissioners openly sniping at each other over industrial policy. And on Yugoslavia, where the world is looking to the Community for a political lead, the Twelve seem no more in tune than they were before Maastricht. In these circumstances, it is only natural that the Commission should be dreaming of becoming a more powerful executive which could shake member states out of their inaction. Strictly speaking, the new institutional changes being bandied about in Brussels have nothing to do with the current malaise. They are part of the report on enlargement which the Commission has been asked to submit to the Lisbon summit in June. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said at the weekend that 'profound changes would be needed to improve the efficiency and democratic accountability of a Community of 25-30 members', and that it would be 'dishonest not to face up to this'. He wants to change the Commission into a more political executive whose head might be elected by the European Parliament, perhaps from candidates nominated from the European Council (as EC summits are known). It would also be directly accountable to EC leaders. Such an executive, mooted in the early 1950s, would effectively eclipse, but not formally replace, the current EC Council presidency that rotates every six months between governments. The latter might wear the ceremonial ermine, but no longer steer the substance, of the Community. Mr Delors prides himself on thinking big and far. These are long-term ideas to cope with at least two waves of enlargement - from the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and, later, from central Europe. But they are fuelled also by shorter-term frustrations, chiefly over the chairing - and obstruction  - of Community foreign policy by small countries. The Portuguese presidency is seen as out of its depth. Conscious of its weakness, it farms out reports to others - to Spain a study on the Maghreb, to Britain a study on relations with Turkey, to the Dutch a study on new membership of the Council of Europe. Each such individual act of delegation may make sense, but taken together they reinforce the impression of a rudderless Community. In the Yugoslavia crisis, Brussels also blames Portugal for not taking a tougher line with Greece which refuses to follow its EC partners and recognise Macedonia. The present system of 'chain-gang diplomacy' means that when one country tugs - Germany over recognising Croatia and Slovenia, Greece in its stance towards Macedonia - the other 11 have to follow for the sake of consensus. The difference is that Greece is over-playing an extraordinarily weak hand. Athens is not only in clear breach of the terms of last year's loan from the EC, but also blocking any rapprochement with Turkey and a big financial package for eight Mediterranean countries. It is hardly Portugal's fault that under the present system there is little to stop Greece being an Achilles heel. But, at last weekend's meeting in Guimaraes of foreign ministers, Portugal was criticised for producing a report on developing the Maastricht provisions for 'a common foreign and security policy' that was just a platitudinous re-hash of treaty language. Next to take over the presidency, on July 1, is Britain. It can be counted on a) to oppose any idea that a still-stronger EC executive is needed to manage a more numerous Community, and b) to run a thoroughly businesslike presidency to show that the current system can produce results. 'There is no such thing as a perfect institution, but you can have a workmanlike one', said a British official at Guimaraes. But this will not stop the coming clash. The certainty of enlargement was reinforced on Saturday when - ironically, in the 'Arab Room' of the Oporto stock exchange - the EC-Efta treaty to create the European Economic Area was signed. Afterwards, Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, Iceland's foreign minister and current president of Efta, jested that 'the EC will break up in the next century' if it was not careful with enlargement. Mr Delors wants to ensure that remains a joke.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rates end firmer CASH rates in the sterling money markets firmed yesterday after a plummeting dollar and pound were saved by massive central bank intervention on the foreign exchanges. In the morning, cash rates rose to new highs as sterling slid two pfennigs and fears intensified that the Bundesbank would need to raise its money market rates again before the summer is over. After the central banks intervened, the pound improved on the foreign exchanges and the mood lightened. But the market ended in a bearish mood. Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, was offered at 10 3/8 per cent, up from a previous close of 10 1/4 per cent. Sterling dealers had been intensely bearish in the morning, and came close to pricing a  1/2 percentage-point base rate rise into their operations. The market is increasingly convinced that the next move in rates will be upwards, a view boosted by weekend press speculation and the rise in mortgage rates announced by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society last week. By lunchtime, three-month money had firmed to 10 7/16 per cent offered. Trade in sterling futures was hectic. In the morning, the September short sterling contract dropped 14 basis points to a low of 89.56, tracking sterling's fall. That was the lowest point the contract has reached since the day before the UK general election, when the market was fearful of a Labour victory. Following the central bank intervention, it closed at Friday night's 89.70 level. In spite of the currency's difficulties, the Bank of England did not raise the rates at which it buys bills in the sterling money market. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m, the Bank purchased bills at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchasing agreement (repo). However, the Bank did not deal in Bands 3 and 4, in contrast to last Friday's operation. In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 23m in repos for resale to the market. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of Pounds 800m. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 51m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 748m of Band 1 bank bills.</p>

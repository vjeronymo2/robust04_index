			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOST TO POLITICAL UNDERDOGS SEEN;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FINANCING: EXPERTS SAY THAT THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN RULES COULD AFFECT  SEVERAL RACES. A JUDGE OVERTURNED THE LAW LIMITING CONTRIBUTIONS.  </P> <P> Candidates and political fund-raisers, caught off guard by a federal court  decision overturning California's campaign contribution limits, predicted  Wednesday that the ruling will give a major boost to underdog candidates of  both parties.  </P> <P> In some races, they said, the sudden change in campaign financing rules could  tip the balance between now and the Nov. 6 election, giving a tremendous  fund-raising advantage to candidates who can rely on a handful of donors for  large contributions.  </P> <P> "You can all give more," Democratic treasurer candidate Kathleen Brown told a  group of contributors after the ruling was announced. "The sky's the limit."  </P> <P> Paving the way for other candidates, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne  Feinstein became the first to disclose that she is accepting checks from donors  who had already given her the maximum allowed under the old rules.  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission and backers of the initiative  went to court Wednesday afternoon to seek a stay of the decision by U.S.  District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton. But their bid to put the Proposition 73  rules back into effect was delayed at least until Friday, when Karlton has  scheduled a hearing.  </P> <P> As long as no judge grants a stay of the ruling, candidates are free to raise  and spend as much as they want, said attorney Joseph Remcho, who represented  Democratic leaders and labor unions in the successful suit to throw out the  contribution limits.  </P> <P> "If they have people who are willing to contribute at amounts above the limits,  they ought to go ahead and accept the money," Remcho said. "It would be foolish  not to exercise that right and thus have less money to get out their message."  </P> <P> Proposition 73, approved by the voters in 1988, limited contributions to $1,000  from individuals and up to $5,000 from political committees during the fiscal  year from July 1 to June 30.  </P> <P> In his decision issued Tuesday, Karlton ruled that imposing the limits for each  fiscal year -- rather than each election cycle -- gave an unfair advantage to  incumbents in violation of the First Amendment.  </P> <P> Karlton also ruled that a ban on the transfer of funds from one candidate to  another also was unconstitutional because it was imposed in conjunction with  the fiscal-year limits.  </P> <P> Despite Karlton's decision, many candidates were adopting a cautious approach,  waiting before risking the wrath of voters -- and contributors -- by seeking  huge donations.  </P> <P> In part, that is because the Fair Political Practices Commission has ruled that  in legislative races candidates are still bound by the contribution limits of  Proposition 68, a rival initiative also approved by the voters in 1988. The  rival measure had not taken effect until now because it had garnered fewer  votes than Proposition 73.  </P> <P> If the judge's ruling stands, the change in fund-raising rules is most likely  to help statewide candidates -- Republican and Democrat alike -- who trail  their opponents in fund raising.  </P> <P> Most prominently mentioned as beneficiaries of the decision were Democratic  gubernatorial nominee Feinstein, Republican state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes,  state Sen. Marian Bergeson, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, and Joan  Milke Flores, the Republican nominee for secretary of state.  </P> <P> In fact, Flores fund-raiser Joyce Valdez predicted that the ability to seek  large sums from the Los Angeles city councilwoman's loyal donors would enable  her to defeat Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu.  </P> <P> "It is the difference between winning and losing," Valdez said.  </P> <P> Although Hayes is the incumbent treasurer, he has trailed more than $1 million  behind Brown in campaign contributions. The change in the rules would allow him  to solicit large donations from the financial community that is affected by the  treasurer's actions. Hayes issued a statement saying he would not accept  contributions over the Proposition 73 limit "until the courts can clarify the  law."  </P> <P> The potential boost for the Republican Hayes at the expense of Brown puts an  odd personal twist on the campaign financing issue. Brown's brother, former  Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., helped push for the judge's ruling in his current  post as chairman of the Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Some candidates, including GOP gubernatorial nominee Pete Wilson, Secretary of  State Eu, Hayes and Democratic attorney general nominee Arlo Smith responded to  the judge's action by calling on their opponents to abide by the old $1,000  contribution limit.  </P> <P> Flores has not decided whether to follow such self-imposed limits. Republican  attorney general nominee Dan Lungren said he will not take any contributions  exceeding the limit until Karlton decides on a stay.  </P> <P> The change is expected to have the most effect on the race for governor, where  the stakes are highest and contributors usually give the most.  </P> <P> Wilson, in a luncheon address to Los Angeles County Republican Women, called  the court's decision "one of the worst in memory." The ruling, he said,  constitutes a "reversion to the law of the jungle . . . when we had government  by fat cats."  </P> <P> In the last reporting period, Wilson had $3.9 million in the bank compared to  Feinstein's $645,000.  </P> <P> Feinstein's decision to accept any level of contribution, Wilson said, will  mark her as the candidate of the special interests and the status quo. That is  a label Feinstein has been attempting to hang on Wilson.  </P> <P> But the California senator said he also will accept donations above the $1,000  level in the absence of an agreement between the two candidates to abide by the  old limits.  </P> <P> "We don't intend to just turn the other cheek, but I will tell you I think it  is very wrong," Wilson told the Associated Press. "We may have to fight fire  with fire."  </P> <P> Dee Dee Meyers, Feinstein's press secretary, said the campaign has begun  soliciting larger donations. "Quite frankly, there's still a lot of questions  out there. But for the moment we're asking people for contributions who are  already maxed out and . . . we're telling them to go ahead."  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), one of the plaintiffs in the  lawsuit, said he would follow Proposition 73 "through the election until there  is a final decision." In particular, Brown said he would abide by the  initiative's ban on transferring money among candidates. "I'm not going to  transfer a nickel," Brown told a reporter at a reception he hosted on  Feinstein's behalf for Capitol lobbyists.  </P> <P> Two authors of Proposition 73, Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra and  Independent Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco, joined in seeking a stay of the  order from Karlton and also filed a separate appeal Wednesday with the U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> Johnson argued that the judge's decision just six weeks before the election has  left candidates in "utter chaos" over what rules to follow. He criticized the  judge for waiting so long to issue his ruling when the trial ended last April.  </P> <P> Ruth Holton, a lobbyist for Common Cause, urged voters to clear up the  confusion by approving Proposition 131 on the Nov. 6 ballot. The initiative  would replace both Proposition 73 and Proposition 68 with new campaign rules,  including public financing of campaigns and contribution limits.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Cathleen Decker, Paul  Feldman, Paul Jacobs, Dean Murphy, Douglas Shuit, Bill Stall and Daniel M.  Weintraub.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FUND-RAISING LIMITS: IMPACT ON KEY RACES  </P> <P>  The federal judge's decision to strike down the fund-raising limits imposed by  the 1988 voter-approved initiative Proposition 73 could markedly reshape a  number of statewide races prior to the Nov. 6 general election. Here are some  scenarios:  </P> <P> THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein: In  the last reporting period, Republican Wilson was raising money at twice  Feinstein's rate and had $3.9 million in the bank, compared to the Democrat's  $645,000. While Feinstein's campaign has little hope of matching Wilson,  donations from well-heeled Democrats could boost her closer to Wilson's level  and ensure an adequate supply of money for last-minute television commercials.  </P> <P> LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE, Democrat Leo T. McCarthy and Repulican Marian  Bergeson: Incumbent McCarthy had raised just over $1 million and had $485,000  in the bank as of the latest reports. Bergeson had raised $798,555 but had only  $4,000 on hand. Bergeson might seek contributions from her Senate colleagues,  to whom she has been generous over the years with donations raised from her  lucrative Orange County political base.  </P> <P> STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE, Republican Dan Lungren and Democrat Arlo Smith:  Smith and Lungren each had about $200,000 cash on hand at the end of the most  recent reporting period. Either could receive major contributions from special  interest groups: Smith from union, abortion rights and environmental protection  interests and Lungren from big business and anti-abortion interests.  </P> <P> TREASURER'S RACE, Republican Thomas W. Hayes and Democrat Kathleen Brown:  During the primary, incumbent Treasurer Hayes raised just over $1 million,  while Brown raised $2.1 million. Hayes stands to be the big gainer since a  tough primary left him with just $24,000 in the bank, while Brown had $1.2  million left.  </P> <P> SECRETARY OF STATE, Democrat March Fong Eu and Republican Joan Milke Flores: A  campaign without contribution limits would favor challenger Flores, who has  cultivated a loyal core of contributors as a member of the Los Angeles City  Council. Flores, who expects to lay out $1 million, already is expected to  outspend incumbent Eu, who has said she will spend half that amount. But  strategists say Flores will need even more money to topple the four-term  incumbent.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 3 (TANJUG) -- The first appearance on  the international scene of the Muslim-Croat federation in the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has proved it to  be a dead letter. After the Geneva conference was put off on  Thursday, even those world analysts who are in favour of the  federation, now admit that it is only a temporary political  alliance with the two sides differing in all interests but one  -- to fight the Bosnian Serbs. The Geneva peace conference,  scheduled by special U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi, was cancelled because it was attended only by the  delegations of the Bosnian Serbs, headed by their president  Radovan Karadzic, and the Bosnian Croats, headed by the  president of the Muslim-Croat Federation Kresimir Zubak.    The Bosnian Muslim delegation, headed by Prime Minister  Haris  Silajdzic, failed to appear. This has raised the question of  who can the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation be represented by if  not by its own president. It is apparently being represented,  both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and abroad, by each of its  constituents respectively.    This leaves the Bosnian Serbs at a loss of who they should  negotiate with in the peace process? -- the Croats, Muslims or  the Muslim-Croat federation's delegation.    The federation is practically being disregarded by its own  constituents, which is evident from the fact that not even after  its constituent assembly was held did any of its officials seek  its international recognition. The Muslims and Croats are  reluctant to do so because this would pave the way for an  international recognition of the Bosnian Serb Republic too and  bring into question Bosnia-Herzegovina's U.N. membership. They  have complied with a sheer formality, deliberately evading to  resolve one of the crucial issues -- territorial delineation.    Western analysts already portray the federation as nothing  but a farce. This has recently been confirmed by Hans Koschick  of Germany, the administrator of Mostar, who was appalled at the  extent of the hate between Mostar's Muslims and Croats. After a  year of bitter war over territories, the Bosnian Muslims and  Croats, acting under strong pressure from the United States,  agreed in Washington on March 18 to set up a binational  federation, which would form confederal ties with neighbouring  Croatia.    Political analysts assess that the federation was aimed at  isolating the Bosnian Serbs and at pressuring them into  accepting a peace settlement tailored to the needs of the West.</p>

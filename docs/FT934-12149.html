			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gatt disputes rise but success slows THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is handling a growing number of trade disputes but resolving fewer of them, a development which underscores warnings of an outbreak of trade friction if the Gatt world trade talks fail. A report to the governing council yesterday by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, shows that requests for consultations under Gatt disputes procedures rose to 26 in the 12 months to September, from 11 in the previous year. Independent disputes panels to probe eight new trade complaints were established in the past 12 months, the same as in the previous period. However, the number of panel recommendations adopted by the Gatt council fell from eight to only one in the past 12 months. As many as 12 panel reports in the year to September, were not implemented. In five cases the offending country made action conditional on a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks. Mr Sutherland says in the report that Gatt members can only negotiate new obligations with conviction if they are confident trading partners will observe existing ones fully. Yesterday's council meeting was dominated by a series of disputes at different stages of resolution. The European Community, backed by African and Caribbean states, refused for the third time to adopt a panel report condemning its now abandoned banana import regime.</p>

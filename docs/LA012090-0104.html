			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE'S LANDING DELAYED AGAIN -- COMPUTER AT FAULT  </P> <P> Mission Control told Columbia's astronauts shortly before midnight Friday to  delay their landing at least 95 minutes because of a problem in the spaceship's  computer system.  </P> <P> The "wave-off" call came just 25 minutes before Commander Daniel Brandenstein  was to fire braking rockets to start the spaceship on an hourlong dive through  through the atmosphere to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base.  </P> <P> Touchdown, which had been set for 12:01 a.m. PST was rescheduled for 1:36 a.m.,  after Columbia made one more swing around the globe.  </P> <P> Mission Control reported there was a switching problem in a backup computer and  the new landing time was dependent on a resolution of the trouble.  </P> <P> In normal configuration Columbia has four primary computers working and one  backup. The control center said it was reconfiguring the system to shift one of  the operating units to the backup.  </P> <P> The spaceship could operate with just two computers operating.  </P> <P> The shuttle and its five astronauts had planned to return home Friday morning,  but the landing was waved off first by one orbit and then by a day because of a  threat of fog that proved to be real at Edwards.  </P> <P> The weather was favorable for this morning in the Mojave Desert.  </P> <P> Columbia carries enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit until at least  Monday, NASA officials said.  </P> <P> The astronauts had a light day Friday, working on a couple of experiments and  snapping some more photographs of Earth before going to bed around noon.  </P> <P> They were awakened Friday evening to the strains of "Anchors Aweigh" for  shuttle commander Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee, both Navy men, and the  fight song for the University of Wisconsin at River Falls, Brandenstein's alma  mater.  </P> <P> "Good morning Columbia. We'd like to know what it feels like to be record  setters," Mission Control said.  </P> <P> "We're at a loss for words," Brandenstein said.  </P> <P> It was the second time they were awakened. Their sleep was interrupted in the  afternoon when an alarm sounded, indicating there was briefly too much nitrogen  in the nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere inside the shuttle.  </P></p>

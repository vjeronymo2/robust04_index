			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan postpones privatisation of JR West The Japanese government yesterday shelved until next year the flotation of West Japan Railway (JR West), the latest in a series of embarrassing setbacks to its privatisation programme. Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said the flotation would have 'adverse effects on the stock market' if it took place as scheduled, in the current tax year to March. He feared the value of the company, one of seven established from the 1987 break-up of Japan National Railways, 'may not be recognised adequately'. The stock exchange believes the listing will take place after the company's annual results next June. The postponement was seen by Tokyo stockbrokers as a government recognition of the market's dislike of its unique pricing system for new issues, in which the price is decided at a pre-offer auction among a restricted number of large investors. This contrasts with the book-building system, used for most international equity issues, where professional advisers set the price after consulting the main institutional buyers. Critics of the Japanese equity pricing system say it tends to set prices too high, a factor in the flop of the latest privatisation, of Japan Tobacco, the cigarette making monopoly, last month. The finance ministry was left with 280,000 Japan Tobacco shares after small investors spurned the issue. It traded yesterday at Y991,000 a share, well below its Y1.438m issue price. As a result of the Japan Tobacco experience, the finance ministry has launched a review of the method of pricing flotations. The delay to JR West's privatisation will leave another shortfall in the finance ministry's revenues this year. They have already been depleted by lower than expected income tax revenues. However, the ministry is accustomed to the unexpected where privatisations are concerned. The 1990 stock market collapse forced it to delay reducing its stake in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, still at 65.6 per cent, to the targeted 50 per cent. For the same reason, the government delayed the flotation of East Japan Railway, the only rail operator to have been privatised so far, for a year until 1993.</p>

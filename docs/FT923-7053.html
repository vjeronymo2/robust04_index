			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Repsol plans flotation REPSOL, the Spanish state-run oil and gas conglomerate, will float up to Pta100bn (Dollars 1.07bn) in shares at the end of the year in an offer aimed at institutional investors, Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Madrid. Mr Fanjul told a Madrid newspaper that Repsol will float between Pta50bn and Pta100bn in shares in November or December. At the current market price of Pta2,510 per share, Pta100bn in shares represents 13.3 per cent of Repsol stock. Mr Fanjul said it was likely that the Spanish government would lose its majority shareholding in Repsol as a result of the new offering, but would continue as the single largest shareholder. The state currently has a 64.4 per cent stake in Repsol through its energy holding company Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos.</p>

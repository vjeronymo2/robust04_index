			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAN LE PRINCE REIGN AT A LONGER DISTANCE?  </P> <P> In workouts, Le Prince has beaten the best horses in his trainer's barn.  </P> <P> Saturday in the Travers at Saratoga, he will try to beat 13 other 3-year-olds,  including Go And Go and Thirty Six Red, who ran 1-2 in the Belmont Stakes.  </P> <P> "I think he's the best horse on the grounds," trainer Dominick Imperio said.  "He does everything perfect."  </P> <P> Well, his record is perfect, but he's only raced once in his life -- winning a  maiden race July 29 at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> That race was at seven furlongs. The Travers is a testing 1 1/4 miles.  </P> <P> Le Prince, who was hampered by bucked shins as a 2-year-old and also this year,  was supposed to start in the 1 1/8-mile Jim Dandy on Aug. 5 at Saratoga, but he  missed the race because of a rash.  </P> <P> Imperio is confident, however, that the colt can handle the Travers distance in  stakes-toughened company.  </P> <P> Imperio doesn't think the speedy colt's lack of race experience will hurt him  in the large field because "if he's going to win the race, he'll go  wire-to-wire."  </P> <P> "He'll pull the jockey to the lead," added Imperio, who said it takes a  160-pound exercise rider to hold the colt in the morning.  </P> <P> The jockey Saturday will be Laffit Pincay, who will replace Jose Santos. Santos  was impressed by Le Prince in his debut, but he is committed in the Travers to  ride Profit Key, winner of the Peter Pan and Dwyer, both at 1 1/8 miles at  Belmont Park, for trainer D. Wayne Lukas.  </P> <P> The track oddsmaker made Le Prince, who will start from the No. 12 post, 12-1  in the morning line.  </P> <P> Le Prince will start just inside of Go And Go, who will be ridden by Michael  Kinane of Ireland. Kinane rode him to victory in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes  on June 9. That was the last start for the Irish-bred colt, who arrived at  Saratoga from Ireland early Thursday.  </P> <P> Go And Go is the 3-1 early favorite. The second choice at 9-2 is the Lukas  entry of Profit Key and Sir Richard Lewis. Next is Thirty Six Red at 5-1,  followed by Rhythm and Restless Con, each at 6-1.  </P> <P> Thirty Six Red, who won the Gotham and Wood Memorial before finishing ninth in  the Kentucky Derby, has raced once since the Belmont, finishing fourth in a  seven-furlong allowance Aug. 1 at Saratoga. He will be ridden by Mike Smith.  </P> <P> Craig Perret again will be aboard Rhythm, the 1989 2-year-old champion whose  only stakes win this year was in the 1 1/8-mile Colin on June 9 at Belmont. In  his last two starts, he finished second in the Dwyer and third in the 1  1/8-mile Haskell Handicap on July 28 at Monmouth Park.  </P> <P> Restless Con, who will be ridden by Tim Doocy, won the Haskell in his last  start.  </P> <P> If all 14 3-year-olds go to the post, the 121st Travers will be worth  $1,186,000, with $711,600 to the winner.  </P> <P> The field in post-position order is Shot Gun Scott, Sir Richard Lewis, Rhythm,  Restless Con, Thirty Six Red, Profit Key, Baron de Vaux, Rowdy Regal, Secret  Hello, Solar Splendor, Yonder, Le Prince, Go And Go and Tee's Prospect.  </P> <P> All will carry 126 pounds.  </P></p>

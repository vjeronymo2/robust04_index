Cho Kun-hae, his wife and four  others killed in a helicopter crash on Thursday lay in state,  offering condolences to their bereaved families. He was  accompanied by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Chief  Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong.    Kim told Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Choe  Tong-hwan and other Air Force leaders to make thorough  preparations for the victims' funerals, which the government  will hold as an Air Force rite. The Ministry of Patriots and  Veterans Affairs has decided to pay the victims' bereaved  families compensation totaling 280 million won (350,000 U.S.  dollars).    Gen. Cho's family will receive 109 million won, Maj. Kang  Song-yun's (pilot) 51 million won, Capt. Yu Yong-chae's  (co-pilot) 34 million won, Capt. Yi Sang-hun's (Gen. Cho's aide)  40 million won and Msgt. Chon Hae-won's (navigator) 46 million  won. The government will honor them all, providing a decoration  for Gen. Cho and special promotions for the other.    Meanwhile, an Air Force team investigating the crash found  the helicopter's voice recorder late Thursday night and turned  it over to the National Scientific Investigation Institute for  closer examination. Partially damaged, the recorder contains  taped communications between the pilot and the flight control  officer, which is expected to reveal the cause of the crash.    The Air Force is considering two reasons for the crash:  Engine failure due to poor maintenance and the pilot's failure  to cope with a sudden weather change.</p>

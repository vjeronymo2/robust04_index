			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on cabinet meeting by Communication Minister Daniele </F> Boni-Claverie in Abidjan on 20 April]    [Text] At today's cabinet meeting the government examined  the country's current situation, and expressed satisfaction with  the international community's reactions to the fact that the  crisis has been brought under control and properly managed. We  are also pleased with the increasing interest that financiers  are steadily showing toward us concerning the way Cote d'Ivoire  is implementing its structural adjustment program. A number of  achievements already allow us to assert that the expected  economic recovery is not a vain hope, that it will become a  reality in the months ahead. The government is satisfied with  the regular payment of salaries, the increase in the producer  prices for cash crops, the payment of students scholarships, and  the payment of retirement pensions. Other achievements include  the gradual repayment of national debts, support to financiers  -- as I have already pointed out -- in funding development  projects, and the implementation of social welfare programs.  These are some of the many achiements which, in so short a  period, have restored hope to our compatriots and the entire  nation.    The government especially wants to praise the determination  and commitment of our citizens, and thanks them for their  support, as the efforts demanded from each citizen can only be  continued with the understanding of all, thanks to the  continuing social peace. That is why the government is  astonished by the ill-timed statements, calls for violence,  disorder, and disturbances orchestrated by a certain portion of  the media. The only thing that should prevail is national  solidarity. The government wants to emphatically reassure the  Ivorian people that no one will be threatened -- neither the  leader of the Ivorian Popular Front nor its activists.    However, since Cote d'Ivoire is a country where the rule of  law prevails, nobody, whatever his political leaning or  profession, can be above the law. When citizens violate the  laws of the country, they have to face the consequences of their  acts without trying to sow confusion among public opinion. The  prosecution of Abou Drahamane Sangare, publishing manager of the  newspaper LA VOIE, and Souleymane Senn, a journalist for that  same paper -- even if they are influential members of a  political party -- is only in line with the enforcement of the  law. Cote d'Ivoire has always defended freedom of speech, as  well as individual and collective freedoms, on the condition  that they are exercised legally.    It is in this regard that the government warns all those  making appeals likely to disturb the social peace and law and  order, and calls on all Ivorians to remain as calm and collected  as they have always been -- which has so far been a guarantee  for the harmonious development of our country.    In this period of political and social instability in many  African countries, Cote d'Ivoire will continue to demonstrate  that disorder is not an unavoidable condition.</p>

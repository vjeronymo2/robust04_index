			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni House of Representatives has called on  the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Command to abandon the  use of force immediately and abide by the instructions of the  legitimate authorities. The House issued a statement saying  that its members and the rest of the nation denounce the use of  force and all those responsible, directly or indirectly, for  fanning the flames of sedition among the sons of the same nation.    A responsible source at the Yemeni Defense Ministry says  that  Yemen will only overcome the complications created by the  fighting in 'Imran camp, north of Sanaa, through solidarity  among all patriotic and democratic forces concerned for the  country's safety and unity.    Reports speak of more fighting between rival army factions  at  a military base situated north of Sanaa. Tank battles erupted  between forces loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bayd in what was described as  the worse fighting in Yemen's history since its unification four  years ago. The outcome of the fighting is still unclear, but  reports say that about 30 tanks were destroyed and other tanks  were captured. Hundreds were reportedly killed or wounded.    The Aden-based South Military Command has issued a call for  an immediate end to the fighting, warning that fighting may  spill over to other parts of the country, raising the prospect  of a destructive civil war.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Observer: Spin dried This really hasn't been Hoover's happiest 12 months. First it resolutely dug itself into a public relations disaster over its free flights fiasco - there are thought to be as many as 200,000 disgruntled UK customers. And as if that weren't enough, the Consumers' Association now reckons that a Hoover washing machine is twice as likely to need repair in its first five years as the most reliable brand on the market, made by AEG. Maytag, Hoover's US owner, must know what it feels like to be hung on the line.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Valuation allowance for share disposals - Rollover relief This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. IT IS proposed to add new EC agricultural quotas for the premium given to producers of ewes and suckler cows to the list of assets which qualify for capital gains tax rollover relief. In addition the chancellor proposes a general power to add, by Treasury order, to the list of assets which qualify for rollover relief. The proposals recognise the fact that, since such quotas can be capital assets of farming trades, rollover relief should be available for them. The changes will apply to acquisitions and disposals on or after January 1 1993. On the valuation of shares the Inland Revenue has issued an extra-statutory concession relating to the calculation of March 31 1982 values of shares and securities for capital gains tax rebasing and indexation purposes. The concession will allow individuals and companies disposing of shares acquired from their spouse or a company in the same group owning the shares at March 31 1982 the choice of adopting a more favourable basis of valuation at that date. The concession applies to a disposal of shares which an individual has acquired on a no gain/no loss transfer from a husband or wife who held the shares on March 31 1982 or which a company has acquired on a no gain/no loss transfer from a company in the same group which held the shares on March 31 1982. For indexation and rebasing purposes the individual or company is treated as having held the transferred shares on March 31 1982. They are added to any shares the taxpayer actually held on March 31 1982 and all the shares are valued as a single holding. This may have the effect of lowering the March 31 1982 market value of the shares in the hands of the transferee.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Management: Doing justice to just in time - Success with this controversial philosophy depends on the manufacturing process For almost a decade, just in time (Jit), a manufacturing management philosophy and practice developed and very successfully applied by Toyota, has been enthusiastically embraced by many managers and academics in the west. Papers with titles such as 'What is your excuse not to use just in time?' preached its virtues without reservation. Now, critics are questioning its impact on profitability. An article in this newspaper on August 10 cited a study published by the University of Cambridge which concluded that a higher use of Jit was associated with lower operating profit margins for UK companies. Should we infer that these techniques work in Japan but not in the UK (or other parts of Europe)? Or, is it unrealistic to expect profit margins to improve automatically by applying these Japanese practices? The Cambridge study has initiated a healthy debate about this management philosophy without, however, answering the above questions. To do this, it is critical to consider the degree of applicability of Jit to different companies and how it has been implemented. Our research at the International Institute for Management Development shows that the actual application of Jit varies very much from industry to industry. In the automotive industry, almost all European car manufacturers have adopted these techniques, while in the pharmaceutical field only a few companies are starting to use them. Given that the last recession has affected some industries more than others, it is probable that the lower profitability found in the Cambridge study has much to do with the industry in which companies compete, rather than with the application of any particular technique. While advocates of these techniques argue that its principles are universal, the reality is that Jit does not have a dramatic impact on certain types of production process. For example, one of the objectives of Jit techniques is to transform the factory so that a continuous flow in materials is achieved, resulting in lower work-in-process inventory levels and shorter production lead times. Its application to many electronic manufacturers has resulted in significant benefits because these companies used to operate with high work-in-process inventory levels and long lead times. By comparison, many chemical companies have always had continuous production processes and relatively low inventory levels because the high volumes they manufacture do not allow them to do otherwise. Therefore, in this type of business, the application of Jit does not make the same impact on the production process as it does in electronic companies. To expect improvements of similar proportions is therefore unrealistic. At the opposite extreme of the manufacturing spectrum there are companies making non-repetitive products to customer specifications, such as special machine tools or large electric motors. These companies usually apply Jit only in the most repetitive part of the factory, where it is possible to achieve a continuous flow. After such application these factories are, quite often, effectively divided in two parts: the Jit part, where there is a quasi-continuous flow of materials, and the traditional job shop where the less repetitive operations are made. The introduction of Jit will usually not significantly affect profitability, because only a fraction of the operations change. Furthermore, an unexpected consequence is that some of these companies making customised products, embrace Jit too enthusiastically and decide to drop or to out-source the products or processes that do not fit in the new system. Thus, products whose manufacturing process fell out of this new quasi-continuous process are abandoned because they are no longer a 'core' product. While these decisions may be sound in some cases, in others they could imply reduced volume and lower profitability. Even if Jit improves the factory operations, this practice implies a radical change in the 'factory culture'; thus, its implementation requires many resources and a high dedication from top management. This represents an opportunity cost that should not be underestimated. For instance, if a company wants to become a Jit supplier it is likely that customers will demand the supplier has a quality certification, so that products need not be tested for quality when received and an almost continuous flow of products between supplier and customer is achieved. However, some companies complain that they were too busy obtaining the certification to dedicate any effort to actually improving quality. In some of these cases, it is not clear whether the benefits outweigh the implementation costs and opportunity costs of management distraction. Lastly, to expect superior financial profits by just applying Jit could even be absurd in some cases. In an industry where all the competitors adopt Jit, it becomes a necessary but a not sufficient condition for comparative advantage. If a company in such an industry does not apply this technique it could be forced out of business. In other cases, companies facing serious problems have tried to apply Jit as a last resort. While in some cases this has saved the company, in others the companies have gone bankrupt and have given birth to the circulation of Jit horror stories. Jit is neither a manufacturing panacea nor the manufacturing equivalent of alchemy. The profitability of a Jit application depends strongly on the company and the type of manufacturing process rather than on the UK culture being different from the Japanese.

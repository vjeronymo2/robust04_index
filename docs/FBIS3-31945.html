			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Hugo Espinoza from Coatepeque] </F>   [Text] In Coatepeque, thank God, everything is normal.  Polling stations opened at 0700. We visited the National  Police and the Treasury Police. We will first listen to  Coatepeque Police Chief Patrocinio Benjamin de Leon:    [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...to work out  without problems and to allow the security of all citizens and  Coatepeque voters.    [Espinoza] Have there been any disorders or terrorist  attacks  in your municipal jurisdiction?    [De Leon] Everything is going normally, thank God, and  thanks  to the security afforded by the National Police and the Army,  with whom we have worked closely in addition to the municipal  police.    [Espinoza] Is there any sort of special recommendation you  would like to make to the people?    [De Leon] Only that they remain calm and behave the best  they  can to ensure that these elections benefit our Guatemala. That  is what we wish.    [Espinoza] We are now in the office of Luis Everardo Soto,  Coatepeque Treasury Police chief, who will give us important  information on the sale of liquor. From what time were liquor  sales suspended?    [Soto] Everyone who sells liquor and beer was told sales  have  been suspended from 1200 [as heard] onward until 0600 on Monday.  The idea is to afford greater control during this referendum.  Regarding security, this has been coordinated with the National  Police. All the necessary security has been rendered since the  day the election papers and ballots arrived in the municipality.  Today we also have, in addition to the Treasury Police, the  National Police.    [Espinoza] Have there been any disorders, or is everything  normal up to now?    [Soto] Everything is normal up to now. I do not know if we  are going to have any type of problems later.    [Espinoza] What recommendations would you like to make to  our  listeners?    [Soto] That they continue to behave the same way they have  done up to now, so as to avoid any problems. [end recording]</p>

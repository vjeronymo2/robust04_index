			<p>BFN     [Text] A candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, Leonid  Kuchma, has said that his first step in the office would be to  reconstruct 90 percent of Ukraine's enterprises like West  Germany is doing in East Germany. Speaking at a news conference  in Kiev Wednesday [1 June], he pointed out that he pinned his  hopes on private foreign capital rather than centralized western  aid in the resolution of economic issues.    "We have no hope for a Marshall plan, that is why Ukraine  should rely on its own forces in the first place," Kuchma was  quoted as saying. He added that it was necessary to create such  rules of the games that western partners did not fear to lose  their investments.    Commenting on his initiative to grant Crimea special status  announced in parliament Wednesday, Kuchma said he meant the  status of a free economic area. It is necessary to give Crimea  more economic independence rather than take back powers, he said  adding that Crimea should be kept within the Ukrainian state  borders,.    The presidential elections in Ukraine will be held on 26  June.    Leonid Kuchma is Ukraine's former prime minister, presently  the president of the Ukrainian Industrialists and Entrepreneurs'  Union and the leader of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms.</p>

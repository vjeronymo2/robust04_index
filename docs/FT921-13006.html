			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Maxwell investigators find seventh trust A SEVENTH secretive Liechtenstein foundation, the Hesto Trust, has been uncovered by investigators who are probing an alleged scheme by the late Mr Robert Maxwell to support the share price of Maxwell Communication Corporation. It also emerged yesterday that at least Pounds 200m missing from the public Maxwell companies and their pension funds was used to buy shares in MCC in April, June and July last year, and that to conceal the identity of the buyer, the orders were placed by Swiss and Liechtenstein trusts managed by independent lawyers. It has now been established that in almost all of the 20 to 30 share deals under investigation, the money to pay for the shares was channelled through the private Maxwell companies, particularly Robert Maxwell Group and Bishopsgate Investment Trust, and was not routed through the overseas trusts. That new evidence will intensify investigators' questions about whether Goldman Sachs and other stockbrokers who sold shares - ostensibly to the trusts - should have been aware of the real identity of the buyer. At the time, Goldman obtained verbal confirmation from clients buying MCC shares that they were not connected to Mr Maxwell, and written confirmation subsequently from all but one. Hesto, together with six other foundations, or 'stiftungs', named last week by the Financial Times, is believed to have had a central role in the share support operation. The MCC shares ostensibly acquired by the overseas vehicles were held in some of Mr Maxwell's 400 private companies. The private companies used them as security to raise more loans - and then used some of that money to buy more MCC shares, in a spiral which piled ever greater amounts of debt on a tiny base of assets. As well as the Pounds 200m used in concealed support of MCC shares, investigators have traced Pounds 200m spent in raising Mr Maxwell's publicly-declared holding in MCC from 51 per cent to 68 per cent, and a further Pounds 100m in funding the 1991 trading losses of the private Maxwell companies. It is unlikely that this money can be recovered. No evidence has yet been found to suggest that the trusts have been used to stockpile cash or assets, nor to route funds anywhere but back to Maxwell companies. Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, which has had more than 100 staff administering the private Maxwell companies under UK insolvency law, said yesterday that 'the majority of funds' flowing out of the private Group appeared to have been consumed in buying MCC shares, in trading losses, paying off the bank loans of some of the private companies, or in interest payments on those loans. Mr John Talbot, the joint administrator, said last night the sale of Vista Computers Systems had been agreed. The administrators are believed to have received several expressions of interest in the 51 per cent stake in Mirror Group Newspapers.</p>

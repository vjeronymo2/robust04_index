			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Late recovery CONCERTED intervention by the world's central banks in support of the dollar triggered a recovery in both the sterling cash and futures markets yesterday after a rather bearish start to trading. Sterling futures contracts had dipped in early trading, after the pound opened about 20 points lower against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Shortly before the central bank's intervened at lunchtime in London, the September sterling contract was off by about 4 basis points from its opening level, at 89.65, and the December contract was off 6 basis points, at 89.73. Intervention then boosted both the dollar and sterling, with the pound peaking at DM2.8304, nearly  1/2 a pfennig up from its opening level. Futures followed the currency upwards, with the September contract closing up 2 basis points on the day at 89.71. The December contract closed down unchanged on the day at 89.79. Both closing prices continue to reflect the market's belief that a base rate cut is a far off prospect. Rates in the sterling cash market firmed upwards in the morning even though the Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 550m. The market often finds the smaller shortages harder to remove, because the Bank invites no offers of bills in the early round and each discount house waits for the next one to take the shortage out. This was the pattern of yesterday's trading, and the overnight rate firmed up to 10 1/2 per cent by lunchtime. Following the central bank intervention, short-dated rates softened again. One week money again closed below the base rate figure at 9 3/4 per cent from a previous close of 9 7/8 per cent on the offered side. Three month money closed  1/16 per cent down on the offered side at 10 1/4 per cent. Rates were also softer at the long end, with 1 year money ending down  1/8 per cent at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side. In its money market operations, the Bank of England again dealt at 9 7/8 per cent in Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent in the repurchase agreement (repo). In the morning, the Bank only bought Pounds 6m in Band 1 and Pounds 6m in Band 2. The forecast was revised to Pounds 600m, and in the afternoon the Bank bought Pounds 67m in Band 1 and Pounds 10m in Band 2. There was late assistance of Pounds 325m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814), and Wu Yilong </F> (1566 1150 7893): "Random Notes About the Two Sessions:  Popularization of Science and Technology Is Essential for  Revitalizing Agricultural Production"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- Agricultural development  counts on three factors: Policy, investment, and science and  technology. Although everybody knows the might of science and  technology in boosting agricultural output, the role played by  agricultural science and technology is far from having been  demonstrated.    Accordng to deputies attending the current National People's  Congress [NPC] session, China has achieved results in more than  25,000 agricultural research projects since the adoption of the  reform and opening up policy, but many of these achievements  have been shelved; and while developed countries can attribute  their higher agricultural output to the application of 70-80  percent of their research achievements, China can attribute its  higher agricultural output to the application of only 30-40  percent of research achievements.    Why is it so hard to revitalize agricultural production  through science and technology? The deputies maintained: The  problem lies in popularization of agricultural science and  technology. First of all, the number of technicians is  inadequate. On the average, there is only one full-time  technican for 7,000 mu of acreage, and only one animal husbandry  technician for 2.3 million mu of grassland. Second, low morale  owing to budget shortage. A deputy from Qinghai compared the  current state of popularization of agricultural science and  technology to "a severed thread, a broken net, and the departure  of personnel." Deputy Liu Zhongzhu, president of the Fujian  Academy of Agricultural Sciences, maintained that irrational  structure is also an important cause of ineffective  popularization of agricultural technology. He said:  Agricultural colleges are placed under the control of the  education department; institutes of agricultural sciences are  placed under the control of the science and technology  commission; departments in charge of popularization of  agricultural sciences are placed under the control of the  agricultural departments; and the agricultural fund is placed  under the control of departments in charge of planning,  financial, and banking affairs. Because such controls are very  unlikely to be merged organically, their strengths as an  integral whole cannot be manifested.    "The situation of popularizing agricultural technology has  become even worse today." Shandong's NPC Deputy Yu Songlie said  anxiously: "Under the new situation of developing the market  economy, some local authorities have arbitrarily 'weaned' the  organizations in charge of popularizing agricultural technology.  Consequently these organizations have to find their own way out  and many technicians have left the agricultural sector to do  something else. When these people are gone, who is going to  popularize agricultural technology and train farmers? This  situation certainly will hinder China's agricultural development  from reaching a higher stage." Fujian deputy Zeng Jinfeng said:  Pushing the popularization organs to the market is likely to  give rise to two problems, even if the technicians of these  organs choose to stay: First, for the sake of incomes and  profits, these departments will withhold the technology that  ought to be popularized; and second, out of consideration for  economic interests, the technicians will likely popularize only  the profit-making technology which has nothing to do with grain  and cotton production.    Higher agricultural output depends on two factors: Larger  acreage and higher per-unit yield. China's situation shows that  it is hard to depend on the first factor, namely larger acreage,  which is decreasing; and that increasing per-unit yield  substantially through counting on scientific and technological  progress has become increasingly important. For this reason,  NPC deputies have urged the government that it should take  measures as quickly as possible to stabilize and strengthen the  ranks of agricultural technicians to make sure that agricultural  science and technology can be successfully transformed into  productive forces.</p>

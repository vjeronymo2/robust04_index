			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina today said he has begun "to establish order  in democracy" in his country, and, alluding to the military, he  stressed that he is the commander in chief of the Armed Forces.    Reina was questioned today by opposition politicians and  local analysts, who suggested he remove Defense Minister General  Reynaldo Andino from his post for disagreeing with the draft  bill which the government sent to the National Congress to  reform military service.    The reform changes compulsory military service to  "voluntary,  educational, social, humanistic, and democratic" service.  According to Andino, the Armed Forces do not agree with the  change, but will abide by the president's decision.    Those who are questioning Andino's remarks argue he has  shown  disrespect for the president's authority, because by law the  military must be "apolitical, obedient, and nondeliberative,"  and, therefore, they feel the president should remove him from  his post.    Reina said there is no insubordination on the part of the  general and that everyone interprets the draft military service  reform as he sees fit.    The president asked, "How can it be insubordination, when he  is obeying the orders of his commander?" Reina also noted that  any citizen can express doubts about the proposal, which, in his  opinion, is a democratic right.    In referring to those people who contend the defense  minister  is defying his decision, Reina said, "It seems to me that this  is not a correct interpretation, perhaps because of a lack of  information or because they do not agree with what is being  done."    The president said the draft bill on reforming military  service was discussed with his cabinet ministers, his advisers,  and the military command "until we reached a point of consensus."    Reina told newsmen that, after he announced that he had sent  the draft bill to the legislature on Wednesday, he received a  call from Divison General Luis Alonso Discua, the chief of the  Armed Forces, "congratulating" him.    The president reiterated on three occasions that he is the  Armed Forces commander in chief and that he is not afraid of  being wrong, because it will be the National Congress which will  open the debate on military service.    "The people are represented there in Congress, and if  Congress rejects the proposal, then I will know that I have been  mistaken," he said.    He also said the Armed Forces have admitted that the  traditional military draft "was inappropriate, inadequate, and  violated basic principles."    Reina maintains that military service "has only been  compulsory for the poor" and that "terrible injustice was  committed under the former system."</p>

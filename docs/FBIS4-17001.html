			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Russian nationalist  leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky fears the youth today cannot  decently protect the motherland because of poor health  undermined by during the years of former Soviet President  Mikhail Gorbachev and called to recruit men of "older age who  did not suffer from perestroika in childhood".    "The youth today are not like they used to be before  perestroika. Misery, hunger, life in constant fear for future  (which began for the kids at nine years of age, that is with  perestroika years) resulted in that drafted to the army now will  be weak and sick guys who are unable neither to protect the  motherland nor themselves", the press service of the Liberal  Democratic Party said on Thursday quoting Zhirinovskiy. "It is  possible to recruit up to two million volunteers and let  children study", the statement reads.    Speaking at parliamentary hearings on civic accord  agreement,  Zhirinovskiy proposed to the Russian president to cancel his  decree which stripped students of vocational schools who have  reached 18 years of age of the right to defer military service.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / People: Sir David White to chair Coal Authority Sir David White, chairman of Mansfield Brewery and Nottingham Health Authority, has been appointed the first head of the Coal Authority which is being set up by the government to supervise coal mining when the industry is privatised later this year. His appointment as chairman-designate of the authority, where he will work one day a week, means he will step down as part-time non-executive director of British Coal. He has been on the board at the corporation since last October. Sir David's work in the coal industry continues a long association with energy. Early on in his career he served at sea working for Shell Texaco and Gulf Oil. The government announced yesterday that the authority would be based in Mansfield in a building already part-occupied by British Coal Opencast. The Coal Authority will take over British Coal's ownership of coal reserves, license coal mining operations and deal with liabilities arising out of former British Coal-owned pits. It will employ up to 100 people. Sir David, 64, said appointing a chief executive would be among his first tasks. He said his appointment as chairman, which is expected to be effective from July when coal privatisation receives royal assent, was a terrific opportunity to help facilitate the development of private sector coal mining. Sir David, 64, was brought up in Nottingham, where he now lives. 'I am steeped in Nottinghamshire and therefore the coal industry,' he said.</p>

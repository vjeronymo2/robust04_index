			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- "Official Simferopol must remember  that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, and therefore it  ought to bring the Constitution of the autonomous republic in  line with Ukrainian legislation." That was the main idea of  today's speeches by Ukrainian parliamentarians during the debate  on the "Crimean question."    Some deputies demanded that the Constitution of the Crimean  republic be suspended until it is brought in line with the  Constitution of Ukraine, and that the population of the  peninsula should abide by the laws of the Ukrainian state. Some  said that the powers of the Crimean Supreme Council must be  suspended early. In this connection, the Ukrainian president  was asked to set up executive bodies of state power on the  territory of Crimea and to ensure that Ukraine's constitutional  norms are observed.    Many speakers believe that the situation in Crimea is  adversely affected by the presence of Russian military units.  In the opinion of some deputies, talks should be held with the  Russian president about the withdrawal of Russian military  formations, ships, and associations of the Black Sea Fleet  beyond Ukrainian borders. However, the Ukrainian president does  not share this point of view. He believes that "this issue  cannot be approached from this angle". This would be wrong above  all from a strategic point of view, he said. Ukraine cannot  afford to deprive Russia of the possibility of having its own  fleet in the Black Sea, he said.    History determined that Ukraine and Russia must be friends,  live in peace with each other, and have relations of equal  partnership, he said. The question of the fleet is an "issue  between Ukraine and Russia," Leonid Kravchuk stressed. And it  must be resolved gradually without making the situation worse.    Some parliamentarians believe that in many respects the  Crimean issue has arisen because socio-economic problems on the  peninsula remain unresolved.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOTS MAY BE NEEDED IF BITTEN BY A PET  </P> <P> Here are steps to take if bitten by a pet:  </P> <P> Wash the bite thoroughly with soap and water.  </P> <P> Seek medical attention. A doctor may recommend a tetanus shot. (Tetanus isn't  an animal-borne disease, but rather a bacterium which can infect through  wounds.) If the situation warrants, the doctor also may recommend rabies  treatment as a preventive measure.  </P> <P> Report the bite to the animal control bureau in your area. If it was not your  pet, try to obtain the owner's name and address. Try to learn whether the  animal has been inoculated for rabies or has had contact with potentially rabid  wildlife. If the animal appears to be a stray, try to identify the area it has  been sighted in. If it is your pet, have ready the date of your pet's rabies  vaccination; the physician and animal control will inquire.  </P> <P> Be alert to the possibility of infection during the days after the bite. Report  to your physician any change in health, such as fever, lymph-node swelling,  nausea or vomiting or rash.  </P> <P> Alert your veterinarian if the pet's biting or aggressive behavior persists.  This isn't "normal" behavior for a pet and may signal a problem that could lead  to further risk to you. Jean Thompson  </P></p>

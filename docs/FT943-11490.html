			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Opening auctions of the new selling season in Australia brought a fresh rise in wool prices this week, which continued and led to an increase in the newly based market indicator of 7 cents, to close at 681 cents a kg. This means an increase compared with the end of June of about 15 cents or 2.5%, though adjustments make exact comparisons difficult. Wool at other auctions this week, in New Zealand and of British wool in Bradford, showed a similar or greater advance. Traders still indicate resistance to higher prices from the retail end, despite the maintained upward trend and the relatively low level of wool prices on any long term comparison. Holidays now affect many of the leading wool processing countries in Europe but otherwise activity is good.</p>

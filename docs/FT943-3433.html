			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Variable geometry challenge for EU Sir, Unlike the Maastricht process, we are already seeing a serious debate developing well ahead of the 1996 intergovernmental conference; this is healthy and democratic. Lionel Barber rightly points out ('Fresh meat from Europe's stable', September 8) that the challenge is how to apply variable geometry in a Union expanded to the east. The recent German CDU/CSU paper proposes a combination of variable geometry and a hard core. Variable geometry, without a hard core of member states agreeing in advance to opt in to core policies, would unleash a centrifugal force. The existence of the hard core creates a centripetal force. John Major, at Leyden on September 7, said the vision of the founding fathers 'was proved right for its age. But it is outdated. It will not do now'. He is wrong. The vision remains right for today's age; it is the institutional and organisational structure of the Union that is outdated. The original imperatives for creating the Union remain valid today. The central concern of the CDU/CSU paper is Germany's position in Europe and the need to guard against future German hegemony: 'If Europe were to drift apart, Germany would once again find itself caught in the middle between east and west . . . If (west) European integration were not to progress, Germany might be called upon, or be tempted by its own security constraints, to try to effect the stabilisation of eastern Europe on its own and in the traditional way.' The UK government is right that we must not force member states to integrate more quickly than they wish. Conversely, member states which want to integrate more quickly must be permitted to do so. The most important requirement is to place the real issues and choices before the public in their correct historical European context.

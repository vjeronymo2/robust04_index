			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] In a statement to Europe No. 1 Radio today,  European Commission President Jacques Delors unleashed a harsh  attack against our country and stressed that Greece should be  careful of the measures it has taken against the small republic  of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM],  as he called Skopje, and added that these measures are not  acceptable. [passage omitted]    Responding to Delors statement, government spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos said: Mr. Delors has made a very general  statement on the European family and I think he referred to the  concept of European solidarity, to which Greece also attaches  very great importance. Mr. Delors has his views on the measures  the Greek Government took on 16 February and he outlined these  as president of the Commission in the letter he sent to the  prime minister; the replies and procedures are well known. Mr.  Venizelos concluded: Nothing special emerged in today's radio  statement by Mr. Delors.</p>

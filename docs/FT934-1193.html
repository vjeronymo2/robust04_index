			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / BCCI 'presented false accounts for a decade' A small group of trusted officials at Bank of Credit and Commerce International presented false accounts over nearly a decade to deceive the government of Abu Dhabi over how its money was being used, the government's lawyers said yesterday. Several senior executives in BCCI's headquarters in Leadenhall Street, London, and in ICIC, a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, fabricated valuation statements of Abu Dhabi's money while spending the cash to prop up the loss-making bank. The details of their claim emerged from a briefing by lawyers at Simmons &amp; Simmons, a London-based firm of solicitors, as they announced a Dollars 7bn civil case against 13 former executives of the bank in Abu Dhabi. From November 1980 to March 1990 Dollars 2.6bn in the private funds of Sheikh Zayed and Crown Prince Khalifa of Abu Dhabi was entrusted to BCCI, at the instigation of Mr Hasan Abedi, the founder of the bank. The money was invested in account 20071 in ICIC in regular instalments throughout the decade, then distributed to dozens of sub-accounts in BCCI branches around the world. About Dollars 600m went to prop up the Gulf Group, a Pakistan-based shipping conglomerate with delinquent loans, and Dollars 1bn in the purchase of BCCI shares and notes. The rest went to support other failed loans, and the bank's Treasury division, which lost more than Dollars 1.8bn in 1980-87. An elaborate system of dual accounting developed, by which the bank would spend the money and then prepare regular falsified valuation statements showing how the funds were supposedly being invested and earning interest. By 1989 BCCI was telling Abu Dhabi that the portfolio was worth Dollars 4.3bn. But just Dollars 150m was left in the account when BCCI was closed in July 1991 and the only other money returned to the government was Dollars 450m it requested back in 1988-89. In an internal note in 1985 Mr Swaleh Naqvi, chief operating officer of the bank, makes reference to a 'number of transactions we will not be able to explain'. The funds typically moved along a tortuous route which made tracing transactions difficult. Money was transferred through intermediaries before being dispersed. Only after four years of pressure from Abu Dhabi for an audit of its portfolio did BCCI hire a small local firm to carry out the work in 1988. The reports do not express any concerns about the recoverability of the assets, and state that the valuations provided to Abu Dhabi show a 'true and fair view'. Abu Dhabi says it was only when the demands on BCCI dwarfed the remaining funds in the portfolio in April 1990 that the misappropriation was uncovered, when Mr Naqvi confessed and sought new funds. Abu Dhabi then began an investigation.</p>

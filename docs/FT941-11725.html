			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / BCCI auditing methods queried Inadequate auditing techniques were used by accountants Price Waterhouse to check the books of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a partner with the firm admitted at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Simon Chapman, PW's audit manager for BCCI from 1986 to 1989, made the admission during the trial of Mr Mohammed Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil. The prosecution alleges Mr Baqi helped falsely inflate BCCI's profits by signing bogus audit confirmation letters which pretended the oil company owed the bank Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m). Mr Baqi denies 16 charges relating to the furnishing of false information. Mr Chapman was being questioned over the methods used by Price Waterhouse to obtain such confirmations with BCCI's clients. Mr Stephen Solley QC, for Mr Baqi, said PW's practice of allowing confirmation correspondence with Attock Oil to go through BCCI was a 'serious inadequacy'. Mr Chapman replied: 'We realised it was an inadequacy which we discussed internally'. The practice was then tightened up, he said. Earlier, Mr Chapman said PW had carried out its audits in accordance with best practice. 'We pride ourselves on our standards,' he told the court. Mr Chapman also said that by October 1990, nine months before the bank collapsed, supervisors from the Bank of England, BCCI's lead regulators, had a 'considerable understanding' of PW's deep concerns about BCCI's operations. This followed a meeting that month between Bank officials and two PW partners. However, at this point, the Bank still supported attempts to keep BCCI going in the interests of depositors, he said. The trial continues today.</p>

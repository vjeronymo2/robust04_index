			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (7): His other car is Porsche / Profile of Ferdinand Piech, VW's manager in waiting FERDINAND PIECH is a disconcerting man with an impeccable and impressive engineering background and a detailed knowledge of the motor industry's newest manufacturing and management methods, many of them originating in Japan, writes Andrew Fisher. From the start of next year, he will be in a unique position in the German car industry. That will not be just because he steps up then to become the next chief executive of the Volkswagen group, though that in itself will be enough to give him a powerful voice in the industry. Enhancing his status - and certainly not making it any less controversial - will be his continued position as head of the supervisory board of Porsche, the problem-ridden luxury sports car company. Because of his independent wealth, Mr Piech is not shy of speaking his mind. Nor is he averse to knocking heads together in the interests of greater productivity and profitability in an industry which is now acutely aware of its high cost burden compared with Japanese and European rivals. At VW, the 55 year-old Mr Piech will be taking on the top job at a time of continued pressure on profits. Not only are the company's labour and other costs too high, even compared with its German competitors, but VW is also faced with the problems of adjusting to the revalued D-Mark. With the German currency having moved up by more than 10 per cent against the lira this year, sales to Italy, VW's biggest export market, will not become any easier. At Audi, the up-market VW subsidiary which he now heads, Mr Piech has made a strong impact. With an attractive model range, combining solidity with sportiness, Audi has been an important contributor of profits to the VW group, even though it still has to recover fully in the US from the sales slump caused by allegations (of which it was cleared) of unsafe acceleration. Mr Piech, a keen skier, jogger, and fast driver, was involved as an engineer in the trailbreaking Audi Quattro sports car, the use of galvanised steel to prevent rust, and significant developments in aerodynamics. Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper, said he had 'petrol in his veins'. He has shown this in his activities at Porsche, where he continues to exert a strong influence as a member of one of the families who control the company's voting shares. He did not see eye-to-eye with Mr Arno Bohn, the former Nixdorf Computer marketing specialist who has just left as Porsche's chief executive. The unexpected choice of Mr Piech to head VW, with the backing of both industrial and trade union representatives on its supervisory board, shows a clear awareness on both sides of the problems and challenges facing the group. Mr Piech is known for his tough approach to business, his often prickly manner, and his dedication to constant improvements in productivity. It was clearly these qualities that led the supervisory board to prefer Mr Piech over Mr Daniel Goeudevert, who joined VW from Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of Ford Motor of the US. At one time, Mr Goeudevert, a former Sorbonne professor of literature, looked like the main candidate to succeed Mr Carl Hahn, whose career with VW dates from the time when he led the Beetle to success in the US market in the 1960s. Mr Goeudevert, who has strong and unconventional views about the motor industry and its environmental and transport responsibilities, would certainly have been a more conciliatory and collegial boss than Mr Piech. But the rapid pace of change in the industry upset all the calculations. Originally, Mr Hahn was to have stayed on for two years after his normal retirement date. That would have taken him to the end of next year. Concern over VW's profitability as it continues with a heavy DM51bn (Dollars 34bn) programme of capital investment in Germany and abroad led the board to change its mind and time the succession for a year earlier. At the same time as the news of Mr Piech's impending appointment emerged, VW said it intended to cut 12,500 jobs from its domestic workforce of 130,000 people by 1996. This would be achieved through natural fluctuation, and VW denied reports that the reduction would total 25,000. Whatever the final number, the trend is clear: fewer jobs and a determined onslaught on costs. VW made net profits of DM445m (Dollars 278m) in the first half of 1992, a rise of 3 per cent, but pre-tax profits were 17 per cent lower at DM987m. With foreign markets becoming tougher, competition from the Japanese hotting up, and the unity-inspired sales boom at home tailing off, Mr Piech will be taking the wheel at VW just when the road is getting bumpier.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: CSM challenges bourse CSM, the Dutch food group, has opened legal proceedings against the Amsterdam stock exchange in a dispute over the number of anti-takeover measures listed Dutch companies can use, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. CSM is challenging the bourse's decision to terminate its listing in June 1994 if it does not comply with new rules requiring companies to limit their anti-takeover mechanisms to two. At issue is CSM's use of non-convertible depositary receipts, a type of share which the Amsterdam bourse wants to discourage.</p>

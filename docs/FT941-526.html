			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Slovene defence chief sacked The Slovene parliament yesterday voted by 49 to 39 to dismiss Mr Janez Jansa, the defence minister, on charges of abusing his powers. Mr Jansa, who was once the hero of Slovenia's 10-day war of independence against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army in 1991, has waged a bitter campaign of opposition against President Milan Kucan of Slovenia, a former communist who led the country's drive for independence. Mr Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister, yesterday proposed Mr Jelko Kacin, the former information minister, to fill the post. Mr Drnovsek, who had also been at odds with Mr Jansa, said the sacking followed allegations made by a former military agent that Mr Jansa was involved in tapping journalists' phones.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Jobs turnover in hotels declines Labour turnover in the hotel and catering industry has slumped in the past decade and is at an all-time low of 27 per cent, figures from the Hotel and Training Company, the main training body for the industry, show. That compares with a turnover of 81 per cent in 1978 and 60 per cent in 1984. Although industry observers attribute much of the fall to the recession, the industry also believes that it is a sign of better employment conditions and training.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: No thanks What's this? A charity turning down donations? Shared Interest, the Newcastle-based organisation that lends money to disadvantaged groups in the Third World, is evidently a little particular about where its cash comes from. Its international partner, the Ecumenical Development Co-operative Society, was recently offered a Dollars 10m interest-free loan, as well as a Dollars 450,000 grant to help its activities in eastern Europe. But the offer came from the foundation set up by market speculator George Soros. Shared Interest voted against accepting the donation out of moral disapproval of the way Soros profited from the plunging pound on 'Black Wednesday' in 1992. Being black-balled is probably a novel experience for Soros. Still, the path to sainthood has never been easy.</p>

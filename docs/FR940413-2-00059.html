			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCA staff identified advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to the general question of competition within the System and also considered several challenging situations that may (or have) come before the agency: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An association not properly serving its territory; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An association wanting to merge, but potential mergers would involve a charter with nonexclusive territories as a result of an inability to establish congruent territory; and (3) An eligible customer with operations in two or more association territories wishing to choose which association would best serve his/her needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Opinion Interviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCA staff interviewed representatives of some of the System institutions that currently have the authority to compete. The purpose of the interviews was to gain insight into how competition is working within the System. Among those interviewed, there was no consensus on either the benefits or disadvantages of competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some interviewees questioned whether ``competition'' should exist in the current environment. There was agreement among institution managers that customer loyalty to the System plays a big part in maintaining business relationships and, as a result, competing institutions should not do anything that would damage the System's reputation. Most respondents wanted to preserve the funding benefits of the System's Government-sponsored-enterprise (GSE) status. Some association managers wanted to be able to shop for funding from different System banks. Several operational problems relating to the accommodation of competition in the current environment were cited: joint and several liability; System institution board representation; size differential; and common funding through a bank jointly owned by competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these interviews, FCA staff conducted a limited survey of System farmer-customers, directors, and managers. The sample was relatively small, consisting of 51 respondents of 135 randomly selected, so no definitive conclusions were drawn. The survey was done to get a sense of the nature and extent of support for, or opposition to, intra-System competition. Six questions on the survey represented various positions the agency could take relative to the competition issue. Additionally, the survey respondents were provided the opportunity to write in any comments on the issue and include those comments as part of the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of the survey indicated no clear consensus for or against competition. The farmer-customers surveyed were somewhat more likely to favor competition than were the managers and directors. Most System institution managers surveyed were opposed to competition; however, the directors believed that some form of competition would be justified if the farmer-customers were not being adequately served. The only area of consensus was opposition to chartering a new association within the territory already being served by an existing association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Competition in the Larger Market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCA staff also reviewed the economic literature on competition. System institutions are participants in the agricultural credit market, which is a part of the broader financial credit market. The financial credit market, generally, is among the most competitive markets in the world, in that no one market participant can control price and availability. While this general competitiveness appears to be true for the agricultural credit market as a whole, there are exceptions in some geographical areas and specialty submarkets. Staff concluded that Government action should not normally be required to ensure that competitive markets for agricultural credit exist, and that Government action might be appropriate if the agricultural credit market in a specific geographical area or agricultural credit submarket were noncompetitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because System institutions compete in the broader agricultural and general credit markets, increasing the amount and nature of competition between and among System institutions could only improve the availability, terms, and price of credit for eligible customers if the overall market for agricultural credit in a certain area were noncompetitive. Therefore, when the local market for agricultural credit is already competitive, the additional economic benefits of increased competition, including competition among System institutions, are likely to be relatively small (although there may be other, noneconomic reasons for such competition). Conversely, when the local market for agricultural credit is not competitive, the economic benefits of increased competition, including competition among System institutions, are likely to be relatively large (although there may be other, noneconomic reasons for avoiding such competition).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the FCA attempted to determine if there were lessons to be learned or knowledge to be gained by looking at competition between the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). These two GSEs carry an implicit Federal government guarantee. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae both serve the same market for secondary housing loans and, although both have existed for some time, they have only competed directly against each other since 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interviews were conducted with representatives from the two GSEs, the Federal government oversight agency, independent rating agencies, and those who do business with both companies. Almost all of the participants believed that competition between the two had yielded extremely productive results, both in the way of new products for housing consumers as well as investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

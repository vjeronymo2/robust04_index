			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] This morning a ceremony installing the government  transition team was held. The team is formed by representatives  of President Guillermo Endara and President-elect Ernesto Perez  Balladares. The so-called transition team is composed of the  following people:    Representing President Endara: Eduardo Linares, deputy  minister of planning and economy policy; and Joaquin Franco,  vice president of the Authentic Liberal Party.    The president-elect's representatives are Francisco Sanchez  Cardenas and Jose Luis Sosa.    At the installation ceremony, Ernesto Perez Balladares  praised the demonstrated goodwill as well as the work done in  recent days by President Endara and his government to make an  exemplary and democratic transition possible.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] The next few months will  be months of coordination and transition and will attest to our  respect and determination that Guillermo Endara continue as  president of the country until 1 September 1994, until an hour  yet to be established. We hope that in the spirit of cooperation  we may do whatever is feasible and possible to see that the  transition is carried out in the least disruptive way possible,  with the utmost respect for all the people of the Endara  administration and all public officials involved in this  transition, who I am sure understand that their jobs are not at  stake. [end recording]    Presdent Endara expressed his satisfaction with the normalcy  that prevailed during the 1994 elections.    [Begin Endara recording] It is a fact that the outgoing  president wants the president-elect and his team to be prepared  to assume the government on 1 September by knowing whatever they  want to know. We will gladly oblige. [end recording]    From now on, the government's transition commission, which  began work immediately, will have to prepare full reports for  the members of the new government that will be sworn in on 1  September.</p>

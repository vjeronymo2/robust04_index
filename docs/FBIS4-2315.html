			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's fast economic  growth has resulted in the widespread development of the coal  industry in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China.    Ningxia, with estimated verifiable coal deposits of more  than  31.5 billion tons, is one of China's coal-producing bases  together with the autonomous regions and provinces of Xinjiang,  Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Shaanxi.    In 1993, the region turned out more than 13.5 million tons  of  coal and earned some 30 million U.S. dollars by exporting  588,000 tons.    According to a regional government plan, its coal production  will reach 20 million tons a year by the end of 1995, and  production will double the present figure by 2000.    Experts say the booming of the coal industry in the region  stems from the state's policy of transferring energy and  energy-consuming industries to the northwestern part of the  country.    At present, a 2.4-million-kw thermal power plant is being  built in the region, and another 10-million-kw thermal power  base is included under the government plan.</p>

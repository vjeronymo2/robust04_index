			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Doubt cast on Chilean copper deal A shadow was cast over the Dollars 1bn El Abra copper project in Chile yesterday when the two north American partners said that tests they had made to confirm previous estimates showed reserves might be significantly lower than previous data suggested. El Abra had previously been expected to become one of Chile's largest copper mines, producing an annual 225,000 tonnes. Lac Minerals and Cyprus Amax, who last year agreed to pay Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group, Dollars 404m for a 51 per cent stake in El Abra and to spend Dollars 307m on the project, said they would do more assay test work, which would take another six to eight weeks. However, Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president of development, warned that if the North American companies reduced their offer too drastically his company might look for new partners. But it was unlikely this would be necessary, he added. Codelco so far was 'very happy' with Lac and Cyprus. The partners would look again at core samples taken from drilling between 1973 and 1975 at the El Abra site, in the Atacama desert, which provided the basis for Codelco's estimates of copper oxide reserves of 500m tonnes containing 1 per cent copper, Mr Bande said. 'This is absolutely normal for such a big project,' he added.</p>

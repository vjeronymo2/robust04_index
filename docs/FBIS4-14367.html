			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports from the occupied south, the  township of Marj 'Uyun is currently teeming with arrivals from  East Beirut. The reports add that the new arrivals are being  provided with housing for a prolonged stay.    The reports note that the area's residents say that the  arrivals are members and cadres of the Lebanese Forces who have  come there following the dissolution of their party in the wake  of their involvement in a series of explosions, including the  bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il.    Although the reports do not indicate the number of those  arriving, they nevertheless mention that many of them have  arrived in the nearby villages and towns as well. The same  reports say that some of the arrivals are carrying out military  and security activities and are roaming the areas with light  weapons. It is not yet clear whether the new arrivals will join  the army of agent Antoine Lahd--which has since 1987 banned any  political or military entity from operating outside its  jurisdiction--or if they will open offices run by the Lebanese  Forces and with the support of Israel. The reports say the  Lebanese forces will either be deployed along the combat lines  facing the liberated southern areas or they will foment  seditious acts.</p>

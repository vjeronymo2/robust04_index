			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Kira Adham: "The Meaning of EU Commission's `No' </F> Decision"]    [Text] During a meeting behind closed doors yesterday, the  European Union [EU] Commission did not come to any specific  decision against Greece for its measures against Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. On the contrary,  it decided to continue mediation efforts of EU Commissioner Hans  Van Den Broek.    That means the EU Commission yesterday decided to act  strictly within a political framework against Greece, and allow  time to search for a formula that will allow the dialogue  between Athens and Skopje to resume. The EU Commission put  aside, for the time being, the "penalties" and Greece's recourse  to the European Court, thus greatly displeasing all those EU  partners who are annoyingly in a hurry, pushy and openly  pro-Skopje and who were certain that it would issue a  condemnation against Greece.    With yesterday's move, the European Union clearly indicated  two specific things:     -  It had great difficulty in reaching a  heavily condemnatory decision against a member state that also  holds the presidency of the Union. Such a development would  have been a severe blow to the European Union itself, something  which EU Commission President Jacques Delors, as champion of the  "European family," wants to avoid at all costs.    -  It was very  unwilling to see the issue of Skopje move outside the EU's  influence, something which could happen if the Commission's  mediation effort and the issue of Skopje were to pass  exclusively into Washington's hands and those of UN's American  mediator Cyrus Vance.    Yesterday's development gives Athens a brief respite and  [adds] a note of optimism for the future of the issue of Skopje,  following the overall international negative reaction to  Greece's measures.    Moreover, in reviewing the overall negative and/or offensive  reaction, because actually there is some of that too, Athens has  the assurance that its measures are now a part of the new  reality and, as such, are receiving relevant consideration by  all.</p>

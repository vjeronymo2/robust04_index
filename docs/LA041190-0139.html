			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Save the Quayle: Dan Quayle is not the fool that comedians portray him to be,  says the Hit the Trail for Quayle Club in Peoria, Ill. Members have written to  Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and David Letterman asking them to stop joking about  the vice president.  </P> <P> Club founder Dorothy Vallosio said: "The public is being programmed to think  our vice president is a laughingstock."  </P> <P> * I Shall Not Return: ABC news correspondent Carole Simpson, who claims to have  been assaulted Feb. 10 by a South African policeman, said Monday in Pittsburgh:  "I'll go back when apartheid is over, and I don't think that's going to happen  soon." Simpson, who is black, said an officer threw her against a car and  struck her in the kidneys during a Johannesburg church service. ABC lodged a  formal complaint, she said, "but I've given up waiting for a response."  </P> <P> * Cat Lover: Saudi Arabian prince Mohammed al-Fassi gave $1 million Monday to  Minnesota animal-protection groups to set up a shelter and to educate the  public. Al-Fassi turned his south Florida mansion into a refuge for abandoned  cats last year when he was told American animal pounds put unwanted cats to  sleep.  </P> <P> * Ex Libris: The 10th Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Awards will go to Tracy  Kidder for "Among Schoolchildren," an account of a year in a public school  classroom, and Alec Wilkinson for "Big Sugar," a report on dire conditions for  migrant workers in the Florida sugar-cane fields. The judges also cited James  MacGregor Burns for "The Crosswinds of Freedom." The awards will be presented  May 9 in Virginia.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ECONOMIC data from the UK which suggested that any inflation worries were overdone sent the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index soaring yesterday as the market became convinced that a further reduction in interest rates was needed, writes Peter John. Derivatives began wearily, digesting a very large trade in Footsie options on Wednesday. Then, the mid-morning news on the RPI sent December sharply forward, as hopes rose of an imminent rate cut. Sales data, pointing to a sluggish recovery, also added impetus. The optimism gave a boost to gilts and short sterling and pushed the FT-SE futures contract for December to a high of 3,142 shortly afterwards, a premium of 16 to the cash market compared with an estimated fair value of some 6 points above cash. One dealer said: 'After the announcement everyone was buying. And with the NAFTA vote, a Bundesbank meeting and the Budget all just ahead of us, volatility is not going to come down.' Implied volatility, the indicator of market uncertainty priced into options, was said to be hovering around 16 per cent for the December Footsie series. Footsie options turnover represented over 19,000 of the total option volume of nearly 39,000 lots. December futures hit 3,128.5 by the official close and 3,133 in after hours dealing suggesting that the market might begin strongly today.</p>

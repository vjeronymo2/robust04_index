			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Peoples Jewellers chief quits as more shortfalls revealed PEOPLES Jewellers, the Canadian jewellery chain forced into court protection by a 1980s acquisition spree in the US, has disclosed details of numerous discrepancies in its financial statements and accepted the resignation of its long-serving chief executive. The 230-store chain also plans to seek court permission to solicit bids from prospective buyers for its entire business or for specific assets. Mr Irving Gerstein, whose family owns about 86 per cent of Peoples' shares, has resigned as chairman and chief executive. The company said Mr Gerstein, who will remain a director, is putting together a restructuring or acquisition proposal with 'independent sources of financing'. Peoples filed for bankruptcy protection in December, following similar action by Zale Corp, the largest jewellery chain in the US, in which Peoples had a 47 per cent stake. Peoples, in partnership with Swarovski International of Switzerland, bought control of Zale in 1986 in a USDollars 650m leveraged buy-out engineered by junk-bond pioneer Mr Michael Milken. Peoples said yesterday that an examination of its books by auditors Deloitte &amp; Touche haduncovered, among other things, an unfunded shortfall in the executive pension plan and an unauthorised purchase for cash of almost 20,000 shares by the employee profit-sharing plan. The company is also considering changes to its accounting practices, which it warned could result in further writedowns. It plans to apply for a 10-day extension, until early March, of the deadline for filing a plan of arrangement. The board named Mr Duff Scott, a former head of Prudential-Bache Securities' Canadian subsidiary as acting chairman. The chief financial officer has been appointed acting chief operating officer, leaving the company without a chief executive for the time being. Mr Charles Gill quit late last year as president.</p>

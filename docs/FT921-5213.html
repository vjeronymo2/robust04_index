			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / BNL raises net earnings 3.2% BANCA Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the Italian Treasury-owned bank, raised net earnings at parent bank level by 3.2 per cent to L74.2bn (Dollars 59m) last year. Gross profits, before depreciation and provisions, rose 22.8 per cent to L1,204bn. The sharp difference between BNL's net and gross earnings lies in the L1,319bn being put aside in depreciation charges and provisions. Some L917bn of the total is being allocated to special bad loan provisions, following a similar provision of over L637bn last year. Separately, a special Italian parliamentary committee investigating the scandal over Dollars 4bn in improper Iraqi loans made by BNL's Atlanta branch, announced its long-awaited report would not be issued until after general elections on April 5.</p>

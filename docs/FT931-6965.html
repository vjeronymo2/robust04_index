			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Provident Financial shows 30% advance PROVIDENT Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, yesterday announced a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1992 after a year of extensive restructuring in its main consumer credit business. The company also announced a 16.6 per cent increase in its final dividend to 19.25p (16.5p), making a total of 28.5p (25p). It will propose a 5-for-2 split of its 25p ordinary shares at the annual meeting. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 44.5m compared with Pounds 34.1m. There is an extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.9m because of a goodwill writeback of Pounds 4.2m on selling its Car Care Plan (Holdings) and People's Motor Finance businesses. Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said the 'excellent' performance was achieved despite unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence. The changes from company restructuring would produce continuing benefits in the coming year. He said closure of retail operations and most merchandising activities had been offset by a 'significant expansion' in the underlying loan and insurance businesses. Mr van Kuffeler said the company had been advised to make a share split because the rise in the price of its shares made them more difficult to trade. Provident's shares yesterday closed up 20p at 794p. Provident's main business is a Pounds 400m portfolio of weekly collected credit. It offers unsecured loans, the majority to tenants on council estates, on which it charges high rates of interest to compensate for collection costs and risk. During the year, it closed its Lawson Fisher business offering goods on credit in 14 stores. It also ended the catalogue goods business of its HT Greenwood offshoot and closed a network of warehouses for retail goods. It also reduced its network of branches from over 400 to 360 while cutting staff levels. Its force of local loan payment collectors was cut by 1,200 to 4,200. The insurance division raised profits to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 900,000). Its Halifax Insurance operation expanded policy holders by 40 per cent to 400,000 at the year end. It expanded its supporting network of brokers to over 5,000. The banking division made a profit of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.5m loss) partly through cost cutting. The number of branches was reduced from 13 to 6. The company said there had been 'a determined focus' on debt collection in motor finance. Group turnover increased to Pounds 371m (Pounds 359m) and profit after tax and before the extraordinary item rose to Pounds 30.7m (Pounds 24.1m). After deducting Pounds 15.1m in paid and proposed dividends, it made a retained profit of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 11.1m). Earnings per share rose to 58.37p (46.63p).</p>

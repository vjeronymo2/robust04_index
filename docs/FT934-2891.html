			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Delay for Hungary in IMF pay-outs International Monetary Fund credits for Hungary have been put on hold just three months after it concluded a standby agreement with Budapest, writes Nicholas Denton from Budapest. Local and IMF officials said yesterday Hungary would not this month be drawing down the second tranche of the 18-month SDR340m (Pounds 320m) credit package concluded in September. World Bank structural adjustment credits are also delayed. Budapest, anxious to maintain appearances before international capital markets and an electorate which will judge the conservative coalition's economic policies in elections next year, denied that it amounted to a suspension of Hungary's IMF agreement. The official explanation is that the central bank's record Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 4bn) reserves obviates the need for IMF support. But the IMF drew attention to deteriorating economic indicators. The agreement assumed a current account deficit of Dollars 1.5bn this year but the latest unofficial forecasts put the shortfall at Dollars 3bn, or about 9 per cent of GDP. The government's implied budget deficit for 1994, equivalent to 6.2 per cent of GDP, is also overshooting the IMF target of 5.4 per cent. Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, has suffered a relapse in his long-running illness, raising new questions about his ability to lead Hungary's governing conservative coalition into elections next spring. An official communique announced yesterday that Mr Antall, who is 61 and receiving treatment for cancer, had developed heart complications.</p>

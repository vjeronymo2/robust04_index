			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (7): Structural obstacles litter the route - The London insurance market approaches  change at varying speeds SIX YEARS after 'big bang' and long after other city financial institutions have changed their working practices, the London insurance market is slowly beginning to embrace new technology. But the pace of change has been uneven. Larger insurance brokers - professional insurance buyers - and insurance companies have backed the changes which they believe will radically increase the efficiency of the London insurance market and improve its ability to compete against European and North American rivals. 'Insurance is like any other business in that nothing focuses the mind more than the prospect of losing clients and making losses,' explains Mr Max Taylor, chairman of the board of Limnet, a London market network which links up underwriters and brokers from all sectors of the London market. Supporters of new technology have been forced to tackle an array of structural and cultural obstacles. The London insurance market is highly fragmented, divided by function, market specialisation and business organisation. Brokers who buy insurance on behalf of commercial clients have no direct community of interest with underwriters. Underwriters of traditional marine insurance sometimes see their interests as quite distinct from reinsurers or insurers of large commercial risks. Insurance companies, whose branches or divisions, are members of the Institute of London Underwriters (for marine business) or the London Insurance and Reinsurance Markets Association (for non-marine business), do not always see eye to eye with syndicates at Lloyd's of London. Above all there are few big players, who have the economic weight within the market to force through changes. Lloyd's consists of more than 279 syndicates managed by about 100 agency groups and the ILU and Lirma each has more than 100 members. This is in sharp contrast to the structure of the retail market's structure, where new technology has been introduced rapidly and thoroughly. Huge supermarket chains have been able to use their economic muscle to force suppliers to adopt computerisation, says Mr Tim Taylor, of IBM which supplies hardware and systems support to the London Insurance Market Network (Limnet). Many underwriters have a small business mentality. 'People are jealous of their own independence,' says Mr Taylor. Lloyd's, the ILU and Lirma agreed to develop common market standards for electronic communication in 1987. However, given the market's fragmentation, progress has inevitably been uneven. It has been most comprehensive in backroom operations farthest removed from the markets' day to day trading activities. Limnet's 'signing and accounting messages' application handles the cash flow transactions that follow the placement of a risk. Brokers and underwriters deal with all these accounting transactions via centralised market bureaux - such as the Lloyd's Policy Signing Office. These act as financial clearing houses. Virtually all these transactions - some 28m a year - are now handled electronically across Limnet. In transactions affecting the day to day business of placing business and handling claims, progress has been understandably slower. However, both ILU and Lirma companies now process more than half their claims electronically, while some individual brokers handle a much higher proportion. Willis, for example, processes more than 80 per cent of the claims it deals with over the electronic system. Even the Lloyd's market, where three separate claims offices were unified in July, hopes to launch a pilot scheme at the end of next March. Ms Jenny Shaw, executive director of Willis Corroon Group information systems division, says that the average time it takes to pay claims has been reduced five weeks to between two to three weeks. This has yielded important savings for Willis which has been able to handle the huge volume of extra claims emerging from the London insurance market's recent heavy losses without having to take on extra staff. Ms Anne Waite, divisional director of Willis Corroon's marine division, says that the system has helped staff avoid mistakes and improve the consistency of its data. Progress in electronic placing of risks by brokers has been much less rapid. This is partially because many underwriters are only just beginning to understand how the EPS system can support the more complex face-to-face negotiations which are such an important part of business in the London market. The bulk of the more than 200 risks placed electronically since the system came on stream in April have been for insurances such as personal accident policies, in which terms and conditions tend to be standard. In the insurance of more complex risks, electronic trading supports rather than replaces face-to-face negotiations. For example, Mr Richard McFarlane, international property broker with Willis Corroon, recently spent up to 20 hours in talks with two 'lead' underwriters to agree on a large portion of the insurance of an Australasian power plant. These 'lead' underwriters examined a range of details about the risk, ranging from the geology of the area where the plant was located, to the cost of alternative power supplies, before agreeing a premium rate. Once these matters were agreed, support from a 'following market' - made up of more than a dozen other insurers - was gathered electronically. The ability to trade in this way saved the brokers and underwriters time and money.</p>

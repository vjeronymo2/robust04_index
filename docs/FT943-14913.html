			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Budapest exchange plans forint interest futures The Budapest Commodities Exchange (BCE) will introduce trading in forint-denominated interest rate futures in October, the exchange's head said, Reuter reports from Budapest. The futures are expected to be for three months, with six-month and nine-month versions to be introduced at a later date, said Mr Szergej Keresztesi, chief executive of Arutozsde, which operates the exchange. Because of uncertainty about the central bank's interest rate policy and future inflation, setting medium-term rates is a risky exercise for Hungarian banks, Mr Keresztesi said. However, interest rate futures will allow banks and businesses to hedge themselves against the uncertainty, he added. '(With the introduction of the futures) the risk will disappear for the banks . . . and for the general population as well,' he told reporters. The smallest underlying amount of a contract will be Ft1m. Purchases on margin will be allowed. Settlement will be in cash. The new contracts are the latest innovation from the BCE, which now trades grain, meat and foreign exchange contracts.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / London denies China claims of secret HK airport finance deal Britain yesterday denied a Chinese accusation that it had breached a secret agreement on the financing of Hong Kong's new airport and its connecting railway, as the diplomatic row over the colony deepened. The Chinese government chose Sir SY Chung, a former senior member of the Hong Kong government who is now advising Beijing, to pass on its allegation that a secret deal had been brokered in 1991 by Sir Percy Cradock, then foreign affairs adviser to Mr John Major, the prime minister. Sir SY Chung said in Beijing that Mr Lu Ping, head of the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, had been told by Sir Percy that an agreed HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 434m) ceiling on Hong Kong government borrowing for the airport project included debt of the airport and rail authorities. Britain was forced to enlist the support of Sir Percy, now one of the fiercest critics of UK policy on Hong Kong, in denying Mr Lu's contention. Sir Percy, now retired, negotiated agreements with Beijing over Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 'There were no secret understandings between the British and Chinese governments on airport financing,' the Foreign Office said. A dispute over financing threatens to delay completion of a new airport, though Mr Major went to Beijing in September 1991 to sign a memorandum of understanding meant to secure Beijing's blessing for it. China has since refused to agree how much debt can be used to finance the airport and its railway. It says proposals now on the table represent a financial burden to the post-1997 Hong Kong government. A clause in the memorandum stipulated that the Hong Kong government's airport-related debt at June 30 1997 - the last day of British rule - should not exceed HKDollars 5bn without China's agreement. The Foreign Office said: 'This clause refers only to borrowings by the Hong Kong government, not borrowings by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the Provisional Airport Authority.' In Sir Percy's negotiations, there had been no discussion about extending the scope of the ceiling to cover the MTRC and PAA. It had contacted Sir Percy and he 'agrees with this description of the position'. Sir Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, said that throughout the negotiations the issue of public corporation borrowing had been kept separate from government borrowing. 'There can be no doubt that borrowings by the PAA and MTRC are outside the HKDollars 5bn figure,' he said. Discussions on the airport and other aspects of the 1997 handover have ground to a halt following the breakdown of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political structure. However, Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, said that when the Sino-British airport committee could meet 'we will be putting a new offer which we think will address all the Chinese concerns.'</p>

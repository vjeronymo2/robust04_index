			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SATICOY BRIDGE DEMANDED  </P> <P> Warning that the Saticoy bridge spanning the Santa Clara River is in danger of  collapse, a group of Saticoy businessmen, property owners and a Ventura City  Council member have joined forces to hasten state efforts to replace it.  </P> <P> State officials say the bridge is safe and have the replacement project, which  includes a new bridge and widening of California 118 through Saticoy,  tentatively scheduled to begin in 1992.  </P> <P> But members of the newly formed Saticoy Bridge Committee said this week that  1992 is not soon enough.  </P> <P> "What they're doing is just Mickey-Mousing around with this bridge. If that  bridge goes down, someone is going to get hurt, just like the Oakland Bay  Bridge," said Bill Martin, a Saticoy property owner and bridge committee  member.  </P> <P> Martin said the committee, which met for the first time Wednesday, plans to  pressure state officials to keep the Saticoy bridge project in the forefront  and is considering a lobbying trip to Sacramento.  </P> <P> Committee member Charles Davis, who runs a bakery and barbecue business along  Wells Road, said the bridge is extensively cracked in many of the vertical pier  supports and a bridge footing has been undermined, exposing several steel  pilings that are driven 50 to 60 feet into the riverbed.  </P> <P> Martin, a county resident for 43 years, said the bridge was weakened when it  was damaged during a 1969 flood that washed out several other county bridges.  He said the bridge has been patched up but not adequately repaired.  </P> <P> But California Department of Transportation officials said this week that they  have no fears about the bridge's immediate safety, although they acknowledge  that it may be below standards.  </P> <P> "It's perfectly safe," said Jack Hallin, chief of the local Caltrans project  development branch. "Caltrans inspects every bridge on the state highway system  every two years as a matter of course. The piles are not in any danger of being  undermined."  </P> <P> However, the Caltrans environmental report on the project states: "The bridge  is structurally deficient as well as functionally obsolete. The footings are  too high -- pile footings are exposed and subject to scour undermining the  bridge. Decking is deficient -- barely adequate for legal loads."  </P> <P> The study also specifies problematic expansion joints, cracked concrete  surfaces and a metal beam guardrail that doesn't meet Federal Highway  Administration requirements. It also says the bridge is too narrow.  </P> <P> The Saticoy bridge is one of four bridges linking Ventura across the Santa  Clara River to Oxnard and east Ventura County. It was built in 1912 but  destroyed in a 1914 flood. The bridge washed out again in 1938 and was rebuilt  in 1939. Major repairs were done in 1956, 1969, 1974 and 1979.  </P> <P> Caltrans plans to build a new four-lane bridge and widen 1 1/2 miles of the  highway along Los Angeles Avenue and Wells Road between Vineyard Avenue and the  Santa Paula Freeway. California 118 will be diverted diagonally across the  railroad tracks, bypassing downtown Saticoy, to link up with Wells Road, which  will also be extended southward.  </P> <P> More than 27,000 cars and trucks use the route and bridge daily, according to  Caltrans figures, last compiled in 1984. The count is the highest of any  two-lane state highway in Ventura County and includes 14% truck traffic,  according to Caltrans.  </P> <P> Martin and other committee members said Caltrans officials are ignoring the  safety issue when they continue to delay the project.  </P> <P> "They made a case against the safety of the bridge, but when it became prudent  that plans be delayed they seem to take a laissez-faire attitude about it,"  said Ventura City Councilman Donald Villeneuve, who initiated the bridge  committee.  </P> <P> Hallin said Caltrans first considered the project in 1984 and planned to have  it finished this year. Now the construction, which has been subject to  fluctuating state budgets, is not set to be completed until 1994.  </P> <P> The plan, along with widening California 118 and California 23 through  Moorpark, has been a long-term Caltrans goal but was delayed in 1985 because of  a $300-million shortfall in the state's $5.3-billion highway project fund.  Hallin said funds being shuttled to highways and bridges in the San Francisco  region, damaged after the Oct. 17 earthquake, may delay other state projects  but should not affect work on California 118 and the Saticoy bridge.  </P> <P> Hallin said the state has $17 million set aside in its State Transportation  Improvement Program for the Saticoy project but the funds are not specifically  budgeted for that reason.  </P> <P> Funding and the date of completion for the project will depend on the passage  of a Senate committee bill in June. If signed into law, the bill will raise the  Gann spending limit and allow a gas tax increase, which will provide additional  funds for transportation projects.  </P> <P> Hallin said if the bill is not passed, county projects may be delayed for  several more years.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Standardized Approach of the Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter believes that the standardized design and test approach of these amendments to CRFS certification, while acceptable, is not as valid as the establishment of individual design criteria on a case-by-case basis followed by a design review and a test program. However, the commenter offered no specific data or case histories to substantiate this position. Since all past successful civil and military experience has been with a standardized design and test approach, the FAA finds no historical or technical basis to support the commenter. Moreover, the FAA has determined that a standardized design and test approach, when properly applied, still allows for adequate use of individual design features that meet the specific safety standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Military Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter expresses concern that the proposals are less stringent than the corresponding military standard because of perceived differences in the military and civil environments. The commenter is especially concerned that fuel tank bladders are not mandated. The commenter proposes verbatim adoption of the military standards. The FAA disagrees. Based on independent studies, the General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP) committee recommendations, and past civil CRFS service experience, the FAA has determined that the proposals, while less stringent than the military standard, provide an equivalent level of safety considering the differences (such as violent atypical flight maneuvers, landing maneuvers, and gunfire hazards) in the civil and military environments. While it is anticipated that most successful fuel cell designs will involve the use of bladders, bladderless rigid designs (that provide the same level of safety as designs with bladders) may be approved under the new standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Concerning Performance Criteria Specification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter applauds the fact that the proposal specified performance standards (i.e., a minimum level of safety) in lieu of unnecessarily mandating certain specific design features such as flexible liners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Specific Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Section 27.561(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter questions the need for the specification of load factors in proposed &sect;27.516(d), since similar load factors are specified in proposed &sect;27.952(b)(3). The FAA has determined that load factors are needed in both &sect;&sect;27.561(d) and 27.952(b)(3). Section 27.561(d) applies to fuselage structure, and &sect;27.952(b)(3) applies to fuel tanks. Although the load factors are identical, they are specified for different parts of the rotorcraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter correctly states that the load factors are clearly specified for fuel cells by their location on the rotorcraft but asks which load factors are to be used for other major fuel system components. The load factors used for each fuel cell location should be used for fuel cell components of significant mass in the same locations. Therefore, this amendment is adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(a) and 29.952(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter states that identification of a critical fuel tank (if such exists) should not be allowed in certification. The FAA does not agree. The use of critical conditions, systems, etc., is a well-established technique for substantiating similar design features. Therefore, these amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(a)(1) and 29.952(a)(1) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All commenters support the proposed drop test, and most commenters favor the 50-foot drop height. However, two commenters propose a reduction in the drop height for a bare fuel cell from 50 to 25 feet. Another commenter proposed a reduction in drop height of a fuel cell test article configuration (i.e., a fuel cell installed in its representative airframe structure) from 50 to 15 feet. Another commenter contends that since the military fuel cell drop test (and nearly 20 years of associated, successful safety experience) is at a 65-foot drop height, the proposed drop height should be 65 feet, not 50 feet. The proposed 50-foot drop height is based, in part, on an analysis of nearly 20 years of combined military and civilian design and operational data. (The 15-foot reduction in drop height from the military standard to the proposed civil standard equates their level of safety because of the elimination of the additional risks associated with the military environment.) A significant part of this 20 years of data is based on approximately 1,500 civil rotorcraft that have been certificated (on a voluntary, nonhazard basis) to design standards (including a 50-foot drop test) analogous to these proposals. This 20 years of data and experience (from both the military and voluntary civil unit installations) have resulted in a good operational safety record. This good safety record indicates that fuel tank installations designed to these proposals (including the practical standard of a 50-foot drop height) successfully minimize the post-crash fire hazard. Therefore, no change to the 50-foot drop height is warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter proposes deletion of the requirement to drop the fuel cell in its surrounding structure. The same commenter asks if the bare tank drop test will follow the procedure of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B when the surrounding structure is free of projections or design features likely to contribute to tank ruptures. Another commenter states that the requirement to drop a representative structure should be fully defined. The same commenter states that no mention is made of production drop test requirements that would be made necessary by postproduction design changes to either the fuel system or its surrounding structure. The FAA considers these suggested changes unnecessary because (under Part 21) a design review (precipitated by a proposed design modification that affects the fuel cell-airframe interface) would automatically require a review of the interface with regard to these proposed standards. If that design review shows the surrounding structure is free of projections and hazards, the fuel cell may be dropped alone. Additionally, MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B procedures may be used, except that the drop height is reduced to 50 feet. Further, major post certification design changes, such as major changes to the fuel system cells or their locations, automatically require recertification in accordance with FAR 21.93(a). Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(a)(3) and 29.952(a)(3) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter notes that the proposed drop test criteria require that the fuel cell test article be filled 80 percent with water with no mention of the contents of the other 20 percent. The commenter states that this is different from part 23 Notice No. 85&hyph;7A (55 FR 7280, February 28, 1990) in that the proposed rotorcraft amendments do not require the air to be removed from the fuel cell prior to the drop test. The commenter suggests that the best method of compensating for the difference between the density of fuel and water is to leave the tank 100 percent full of fuel and adjust the drop height to a lower value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Flat market hits balance - Directors' transactions With the market ending up flat during the week reviewed here, it seems only just that there should be a roughly equal balance between the number of buys and sells over the period. Wholesale Fittings, the family-orientated distributor of electrical goods and components, has had a strong recovery since its trough in September 1992. At that time, joint managing director Richard Rose bought two tranches of stock, each of 50,000 shares, at prices ranging between 153p and 168p. The latest sale by Lennard Rose, the other joint managing director, was of 585,000 shares at 305p. Richard Rose also took profits recently by selling 60,000 shares at 331p. Final results are due in August and brokers forecast earnings of 11.8p, which gives rise to an above-average prospective p/e. Sir Michael Bishop is known better as chairman of British Midland, the airline company, but he is also a non-executive director of Williams Holdings, an industrial conglomerate. He has bought 10,000 Williams' shares at 369p, his first purchase of these. The last significant purchase by any of his fellow directors was in February 1992 when chairman Nigel Rudd bought 50,000 at 311p. William Richards is a non-executive director of Industrial Controls Services, quoted under the electronic and electrical equipment sector. He has sold 325,000 shares at 150p, leaving him with a holding of 2.1m. Announcing interim results at the end of February, the chairman indicated that the order book looked encouraging. The consensus earnings forecast is for 9.4p in the year to end-May 1994, rising to 12.1p for the following year.  --------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ---------------------------------------------------------                                                    No of Company              Sector     Shares   Value   directors  --------------------------------------------------------- SALES  --------------------------------------------------------- British Petroleum      OilI     87,900     352       1* E'burgh Fund Mgnrs     OthF     27,000     163       1 Grosvenor Inns         Brew     19,351      26       1 Indl Ctrl Services     E&amp;EE    325,000     488       1 Reckitt &amp; Coleman      HseG      3,600      24       1 RTZ                    ExIn    115,690     990       1* Sainsbury (J)          RetF      8,000      31       1 Scottish Nat.

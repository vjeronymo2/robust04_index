			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flat Panel Displays: A European </F> Challenge"]    [Text] ESPRIT Project 7701, European Consortium Active  Matrix (ECAM), is a large-scale, industry-led project aiming to  capture a share of one of the fastest growing markets in IT  peripherals -- active matrix LCD displays.    The lead partner in ECAM is the Netherlands electronics  company Philips, which combined forces in 1992 with French  companies Thomson and SAGEM. The result was "Flat Panel Display  Company," a joint venture company based in Eindhoven, the  Netherlands, employing over 500 people. They have established  two factories -- a pilot line, where most of the new  developments are tested, and a full-scale production assembly  line, the largest in Europe.    "Tomorrow's market in LCDs is enormous, because they will  soon move from portable computers to all sorts of consumer and  industrial equipment," explains Dr. Robert Hartman of the newly  established company. We estimate a market of over ECU1.5  billion by 1996. Unfortunately, the world's five largest LCD  companies are all Japanese. They have a strong position on the  market, so if we do not invest today we will always rely on  foreign sources for what will become an essential element in  many new electronic systems."    Started in January 1993, the ECAM project involves a total  of  19 partners from the Netherlands, France, Germany, the United  Kingdom, and Belgium, and is composed of 11 subprojects. The  overall aim is to develop technologies and components to make  feasible larger display sizes and/or higher resolutions,  increase the number of potential applications of LCD technology  and develop less complex designs and more cost-effective  production methods.  <H5>  Simpler and Cheaper Technology </H5>   Of the eleven subprojects, the most important is "2S-3S Thin  Film Transistors." "Briefly, 2S and 3S refer to the number of  steps required to produce the LCD matrix," Dr. Hartman  explained. 2S technology can be used to manufacture computer  monitors, while the 3S system can be used in TV projectors.    "2S and 3S were patented by SAGEM's [Company for General  Applications of Electricity and Mechanics] research partner,  CNET-France Telecom, the French telecommunications laboratory,"  he continued. "The subproject has two elements: SAGEM and CNET  are transferring both 2S and 3S as "direct view technologies" to  our pilot line here in Eindhoven, and Thomson in Moirans (near  Grenoble, France) is developing a "projection" 3S display."    These new technologies are simpler than those used today and  use less raw materials, adding up to a less expensive factory,  both in start-up and running costs.  <H5>  A Complete Project </H5>   In general, most of the other partners are involved in one  or  two subprojects specific to their interests. BARCO, a Belgian  manufacturer of TV projectors, for example, aims to develop  active matrix LCD projectors that can display video and data  graphic images with XGA (1024*768 pixel) resolution.    In this way the joint venture combines specialised expertise  from around Europe and ensures that the technologies have a  range of marketable applications ready as soon as possible.    There are also four universities and private research  laboratories contributing their expertise. The University of  Dundee in the United Kingdom, for example, is contributing its  knowledge of certain types of amorphous alloys to the SWITCHMAT  subproject, where materials for TFD-R (Thin-Film Diode plus  Reset) devices based on amorphous silicon alloys are being  developed.    TFD-R devices hold out the promise of a low-cost, high-yield  production process, but also have some drawbacks. The  University's experience with similar alloys will help in the  assessment and perhaps the exploitation of this potentially  valuable method.    Other subprojects are developing additional applications and  materials, examining future technologies, working on  international standards and plotting the joint venture's R&amp;D  programmes. According to Dr. Hartman, "We are quite pleased with  results so far, particularly in the important 2S-3S subproject,  and expect to complete the project by the end of this year as  planned."

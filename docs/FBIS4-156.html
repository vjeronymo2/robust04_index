			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 3 SAPA -- Nine African National  Congress supporters were massacred in their kraal outside Port  Shepstone, Natal South Coast, on Saturday [2 April] and an  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporter was allegedly shot dead by  ANC supporters while praying in Durban's Bhambayi shack  settlement on Sunday, police said. And police on Sunday said at  least another eight people were murdered in Natal since the  declaration of a state of emergency in the province three days  ago, bringing to almost 40 the number killed since then.    SA Police spokesman Lt-Col Marzedt de Beer said Ethel  Danisa,  25, was shot dead in war-torn Bhambayi while she and others were  praying. Another woman was injured.

The women were praying beside a cross,  recently erected there by clerics after a peace march.    In Port Shepstone at about 8.30pm on Saturday the kraal of  the Mzelemu family in the Nkulu ward was approached by men who  identified themselves as policemen and forced their way into the  homestead. One family member fled the area immediately. Nine  others, including a five-month-old baby and two other children  were chopped and stabbed to death.    The dead were identified as: Gugu Mzelemu, 5 months; Ciyisa  Mzelemu, 70; Philisile Mzelemu, 3; Hlengiwe Mzelemu, 13;  Phindile Mzelemu, 8; Phumele Mzelemu, 18; Prudence Mzelemu, 13;  Lindiwe Mzelemu, 16; and Doris Mzelemu, 46.

Police also reported a rape and  armed robbery in the Amatikwe area where two of the killings  occurred.

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS HEARING ON LOWERING KEATING'S BAIL;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: PROSECUTORS OPPOSE A REDUCTION BECAUSE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CHARGES  GIVES THE FORMER CHIEF OF IRVINE-BASED LINCOLN S&amp;L A 'MOTIVE TO FLEE.'  </P> <P> A federal judge Tuesday ordered a hearing to determine whether he should lower  the $5-million bail set for Charles H. Keating Jr., who has been jailed since  he was indicted a month ago on state charges of securities fraud.  </P> <P> In a brief order, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies scheduled the hearing for  1:30 p.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> Davies' decision came after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office  filed documents that said Keating's bail should not be reduced or lifted  because of the seriousness of the criminal charges and other legal actions give  him "a strong motive to flee."  </P> <P> Keating, who has been jailed since Sept. 18, had gone through the state  appellate system seeking a review of the bail amount. A state Court of Appeal  panel refused to lower bail, and the state Supreme Court refused to hear the  case.  </P> <P> Keating, 66, is the former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix,  which owned Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. The company filed for  bankruptcy in April, 1989; federal thrift regulators seized Lincoln the next  day.  </P> <P> Regulators say Lincoln is one of the nation's worst S&amp;L disasters and  estimate that it will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion to clean up the  thrift.  </P> <P> The company sold nearly $200 million in junk bonds through Lincoln's 29  Southern California branches, and the small investors who bought the bonds say  they were misled into believing that the bonds were safe and federally insured.  </P> <P> The 42-count indictment accuses Keating and three others of providing investors  with false and misleading information and violating other state laws in selling  the bonds, which have become worthless since the collapse of the company and  the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> A trial is scheduled Nov. 26, but both the Los Angeles County Superior Court  trial judge and defense attorneys said they doubt that a trial could begin that  soon.  </P> <P> In his federal court petition, Keating claimed that the $5-million bail set by  Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner is excessive and beyond reach. Keating, who  just three years ago was worth nearly $40 million, now claims to be broke.  </P> <P> Prosecutors responded that the bail is not excessive, even if Keating cannot  afford it. They said he has had access to huge sums in the past and could try  to tap into those sources in order to flee.  </P> <P> "The magnitude of the offense in this case sets it apart from other cases and  justifies a bail setting higher than that which is customary in other cases,"  the prosecutors said.  </P></p>

Mr. Yandarbiyev noted that "Elections in the  Chechen state are possible only after a decision has been made  by the leadership of the Ichkeria Republic, within the time  frame established by the Constitution of Chechnya."    The head of the Chechnya security department has charged  Russia's law enforcement bodies with criminals action aimed at  undermining the republic's economy. In an official letter sent  to the leadership of Russian Federation power structures, Sultan  Geliskhanov reports that stable criminal groups, which for a  long time have engaged in oil smuggling, are taking refuge in  Russia.

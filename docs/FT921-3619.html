			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Flat interim profit leads to shake-up at Coles Myer COLES Myer, Australia's biggest retailing group, yesterday said recession had restricted net profits to ADollars 227m (USDollars 171.9m) in the six months to the end of January, an increase of less than 1 per cent on the comparable period of the previous year. Turnover was up 2.1 per cent to ADollars 8bn. However, Mr Solomon Lew, chairman, said sales had improved 'slightly' in February, prompting hopes that 'tentative' signs of recovery were beginning to emerge. Coles also announced the retirement of Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive, as part of a shake-up of senior management intended to improve profitability in under-performing areas of the company. No replacement for Mr Quinn was announced. The job is widely expected to go to Mr Peter Bartels, the former managing director of Foster's Brewing Group, who resigned earlier this week. Coles said it was considering an issue of convertible preference shares to raise ADollars 300m to strengthen its balance sheet and finance expansion. The announcement follows confirmation earlier this month that Coles plans to float at least 60 per cent of Progressive Enterprises, a New Zealand subsidiary, to provide further funds for expansion. Mr Lew said no big acquisitions had yet been considered, but the company was in 'a comfortable position to have a strong cash flow and a strong balance sheet in a buyers' market'. Coles said the recession had affected its businesses throughout Australia and New Zealand, particularly the downmarket K mart and Coles Fossey chains. However, the company said several of its chains had traded 'very satisfactorily'.</p>

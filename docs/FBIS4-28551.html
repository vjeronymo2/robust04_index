			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jakarta correspondent Paul Jacob] </F>   [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto yesterday defended the  purchase of 39 former East German naval vessels for the  Indonesian navy, saying that those who criticised the deal had  little knowledge about its background.    Speaking at a ceremony marking the start of development of  the Teluk Ratai naval base in southern Sumatra, he said  Indonesia needed a strong and efficient naval force to patrol  its vast waters and protect its economic exclusive zone.    "People who have less than full understanding and who  presented their views have blurred the issue, caused divisions  and suspicions which can affect stability," he said.    He warned that the government would not tolerate such  manoeuvrings and would take firm action against such people,  whom he did not identify.    The controversy stirred by the purchase of the vessels --  the  cost was said to be US$1.1 billion [Singapore dollar] (S$1.65  billion) -- has given an impression that there are divisions  within the government between groups that are pro-and anti-Dr  B.J. Habibie, the Research and Technology Minister.    He was entrusted by Mr Suharto to handle the purchase but  critics, including Defence and Security Minister Edi Sudrajat,  have described the US$1.1 billion figure as being excessive.    Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told Parliament on Tuesday  that the government was only allocating US$319 million for the  purchase and refitting of the ships.    Dr Habibie has, however, defended the purchase and the cost  though he accepted a slashing of the original US$1.1 billion  budget he sought, which covered refurbishment and development of  supporting facilities, such as bases.    In his remarks yesterday, Mr Suharto expressed support for  both the purchase of the ships -- now put officially at US$482  million -- and the establishment of the Teluk Ratai base, which  is being developed to support the operations of the 39 vessels.    At Teluk Ratai in Lampung province, he also witnessed the  official handing over of five of the vessels to the navy.    He said the government first heard about the availability of  the vessels from private-sector sources. He then asked Dr  Habibie to get more details about the ships and their  availability.    This was because Dr Habibie "is well-known to officials and  private businessmen in Germany.    "Because of that, the appointment of Dr Habibie to handle  the  deal should not be made an issue," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Suleyman Demirel this morning received  Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal. In a statement  after the hour long meeting, Baykal said that the country is  facing a great economic crisis. He noted that all the problems  are tied to the government problem, adding that it has become  evident that the current government is incapable of solving the  current issues. Baykal said that the government issue should be  discussed at the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] and  solved.    [Begin Baykal recording] This issue should not be a constant  source of discussion and complaints in unauthorized forums and  by unauthorized organs. The time has come to discuss and assess  this issue at the authorized organ, which is the TGNA, within  the framework of the appropriate rules and regulations.  Everyone should shoulder his responsibilities and execute his  duties. [end recording]    Baykal stated that the primary condition for solving the  country's problems is to form a determined government that will  inspire confidence and secure the support of the people.    Demirel received Nationalist Action Party leader Alpaslan  Turkes in the afternoon. At the meeting, Turkes told Demirel:  Your messages are most beneficial. You raise the morale of the  people. In reply Demirel said:    [Begin Demirel recording] We are waging a psychological war.  If, as a nation and as a people, we believe that we can surmount  the problems then that is what will happen. We have surmounted  all our problems in the past. [end recording]    Demirel said that there is no reason for the Turkish economy  to go bankrupt and added: There was a monetary crisis.  Naturally, this problem should be solved without it affecting  the economy and social issues.    In a statement after the meeting which lasted for 40  minutes,  Turkes said that he conveyed to Demirel his views on the  country's political problems. Pointing out that the country's  problems should be solved in accordance with human rights, the  laws and the principles of democracy, Turkes added that views  and rumored solutions outside this framework are invalid. He  noted that the government and statesmen should keep up their  responsible attitude regarding national unity and the country's  territorial integrity.    [Begin Turkes recording] I told him that statements are  being made from time to time to the effect that the activities  of our security forces against the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] should be stopped and that a political solution  should be sought. I also told him that these statements should  not be heeded. I said that these statements are aimed at  deceiving the Turkish people. I said that those who want to  divide Turkey are resorting to such deceit. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

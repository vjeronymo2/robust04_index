			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Pianist Van Cliburn will play his first major concert in more than a decade  when he performs June 19 with the Philadelphia Orchestra. With the appearance,  Cliburn, 54, will resume an active concert schedule that has been on hold since  he quietly took a sabbatical in 1978 after two decades of performing. Conductor  Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, who will conduct his Philadelphia concert, said, "I'm  very happy that Van is coming back to his career. Everyone has been very sorry  that he wasn't playing." Cliburn did accept an invitation to play at the White  House last year during the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (6): Something of a miracle - The new government / The new team's unity has been its main strength in surviving the murderous world of Russian politics THAT A COUNTRY as conservative and closed as Russia should have such a bright and westward-looking government is really something of a miracle. It is a sign of Russia's desperate situation that the team of economic reformers led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the 36-year-old first deputy prime minister, has come to power. With most of the key ministers in their mid-30s, the youngest cabinet in Russian history is being entrusted with the momentous task of switching the country to a market economy after 75 years of state planning. Six months on, they are still in office because the older generation, discredited by the failure of the socialist experiment and five years of tentative economic reform under President Mikhail Gorbachev, has failed to come up with an alternative. Apart from a package of go-it-alone market reforms which would bypass disagreement among republics, Mr Gaidar, an academic with no experience of government, was able to sell President Boris Yeltsin a ready made government team - made up of like-minded economists who also happened to be his friends. The team's roots go back to the 1980s, when they held unofficial seminars on market economics at a time when such ideas were just beginning to gain currency in very limited circles. Mr Gaidar, an exceptionally bright, suave and persuasive figure, very soon emerged as their leader, his time as economics editor of the Kommunist party journal in the late 1980s giving him the opportunity to publish pro-market views. The 36-year-old privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, a graduate from Leningrad's Economics Institute, had been friends with Mr Gaidar ever since they began clandestine studies of market economics together in 1979. The Latvian-born Mr Peter Aven, the foreign trade minister, who is also 36, and the only non-Russian in the cabinet was in Vienna researching economic reforms in eastern Europe before he came back to Moscow. Mr Alexandr Shokhin, who used to advise Mr Eduard Shevardnadze when he was still Soviet foreign minister, acted as the stalking horse for the Gaidar team to take over. He was labour minister in the previous back-biting Yeltsin administration. Although only half a dozen are ministers, there are several other allies scattered round in the top echelons of the administration. There are so many qualified economists in the Gaidar team that there will be very few economists left to take over should they fail. Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, who is responsible for negotiation with international organisations, provided an international connection for the group when he set up a Market Institute sponsored by the London-based Institute of Economic Affairs, the Thatcherite think-tank. Like their predecessors in eastern Europe - Poland's Mr Leszek Balcerowicz and Vaclav Klaus in Czechoslovakia - the Gaidar team is more free-market than many of their foreign advisers. Their common ideological front - allergy to the old system - translates into a mix of orthodox free market economics and admiration for Margaret Thatcher's strength of character. This is tempered by political realism - about what it is possible to get away with in Russia - as witnessed by their decision last month to loosen their tight credit policy at the risk of triggering hyperinflation. Apart from the support of Mr Yeltsin, the team's unity has proved its main strength in surviving the murderous world of Russian politics. In the absence of strong parties, Russian politics, usually depressingly, and dangerously, boils down to petty jealousies and power struggles among personalities, all jockeying, in true Soviet fashion, for the top leader's seat. Mr Gaidar and his critics started off by not expecting him to last long in office. But having matured fast as a politician since taking office in October, and then putting up a ferocious fight for his reforms in parliament, Mr Gaidar emerged from lat month's bruising Congress of People's Deputies with a new self-assurance. Although disarrayed by their trouncing, many of his pro-market opponents still see themselves as a second tier of pro-market reformers, waiting in the wings to prevent a fascist Communist takeover should the government collapse under a wave of spontaneous popular anger. 'We want more gradual reform more focused on the population, because Russia is used to living slowly but is used to equality, explained Mr Oleg Plotnkov, a young pro-market member of the Smena ('Change of Guard') parliamentary faction which wants more power for parliament. Although superior to anything else on offer so far - 'we are often accused of being arrogant,' says one Gaidar aide, 'but perhaps that arrogance is justified' - the government is by no means all sweetness and light. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the chief Soviet economic strategist, who struggled between the August coup and the collapse of the Soviet Union to build some kind of economic union, accuses them of outright opportunism. He proudly describes a stormy scene in his office late last year, when he turned down a job offer from Mr Gaidar and accused him of tailoring his go-it-alone Russian economic reforms to suit the new isolationist mood of the country's political masters. Their appeal to the West as normal, articulate human beings eschewing the old traditions of Soviet bureaucrats, does not necessarily translate into affection for them within the Commonwealth. The team's self-confidence - which took the form of bypassing parliament and offending people like the central bank chairman - has also irritated many older Yeltsin supporters who have been shunted out of the president's 'in' crowd. Ms Bella Kurkova, an influential St Petersburg journalist and deputy in her 50s, recently complained on her own TV programme that the government was inaccessible. What she really meant to say, as she commiserated with St Petersburg mayor, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, was that they were inaccessible to them. But one intelligent thing this team has done is to hire, as government advisers, outside experts who might otherwise criticise it, or whose prestige enhances their image - 'all you have to do is criticise the governmen to get a job offer,' joked Mikhail Leontiev, economics correspondent for Nezavisimaya (Independent) newspaper, who claims he turned down such a proposition. Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a rising young star of Russian politics who made a name for himself pushing for the split of the Communist party, was recently appointed head of the government inspectorate. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, a top investigative journalist, is Mr Gaidar's adviser on fighting corruption. They have also used foreign advisers - including economists such as Jeffrey Sachs whose support has even extended to helping one minister give his first foreign press interview - to drum up support and sympathy for their reforms in the West. The Dollars 24bn aid package - granted by western governments in time to support them at the Congress of People's deputies - has become another argument for them to stay in power. But as President Yeltsin demonstrated when he said Russia would not be taking orders from the International Monetary Fund, the government - which openly says it would like its central bank to be run by the IMF - has to be careful to avoid accusations of being too subservient to the West.</p>

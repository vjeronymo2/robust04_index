			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / European fund for refugees criticised in report A fund owned by 21 European governments to help refugees evolved into a substantial investor in international money markets and provided lavish rewards for its staff, according to a confidential official report. The report by accountants Castel Jacquet Ernst &amp; Young into the activities of the Council of Europe's Social Fund also says it exercised insufficient care in monitoring how its loans, which totalled Ecu6.7bn (Pounds 5.1bn) at the end of 1992, were used. A loan from the fund had, for example, been used to finance the building of a Sheraton hotel in Milan, according to Mrs Paule Dufour, president of the fund's governing body, who has been trying to reform the institution. The Ernst report also discloses that cheap mortgages for employees were used for property speculation and executives were allowed to make large withdrawals from a pension fund while retaining their jobs. The fund's governing body meets in Paris today to elect a new governor, following the resignation last month of Mr Roger Vanden Branden, who had held the post since 1979. Last orders, Page 19</p>

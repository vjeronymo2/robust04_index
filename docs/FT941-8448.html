			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Aluminium and copper  set pace Aluminium and copper continued to set the tone at the London Metal Exchange this week and all base metals contracts finished higher. Further output cut announcements by western aluminium producers (the latest yesterday of 37,000 tonnes from Spain's Inespal) took the total since last month's multilateral agreement in Brussels to 737,000 tonnes a year; and an official of Russia's Aluminiy producer group helped to shore up a sometimes shaky market with an assurance that his country's cuts, 100,000 tonnes a year so far, would grow to 300,000 tonnes by the end of April. Cheered by these developments, the market, which on Monday had tested support at Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three months delivery, was able to resume the uptrend that was interrupted last week. Yesterday morning three months metal touched a fresh 18-month peak of Dollars 1,330 a tonne before settling back to close at Dollars 1,321.50, up Dollars 56.50 on the week and Dollars 149 since the conclusion of the Brussels meeting. Three months copper surrendered Dollars 9 of its rise yesterday but still ended Dollars 62 up on the week at Dollars 1,906.50 a tonne. Far Eastern buying was the main influence in the rise and a substantial reduction in LME warehouse stocks, though widely expected, helped to underpin the market. A sustained fall has reduced exchange copper stocks by 52,950, or 8.5 per cent, since mid-January. Constructive chart patterns helped the zinc market to rally following the heavy set-back caused by last week's news of the collapse of European producers' efforts to forge an agreement for jointly financed output cuts. After dipping to Dollars 948 a tonne on Tuesday the three months price closed yesterday at Dollars 994.50, up Dollars 22 on the week. A renewed uptrend in the tin market was fuelled by concern about supply tightness developing for the early May delivery period. That resulted in cash metal moving from a Dollars 52.50 discount against three months at the end of last week to a Dollars 5 premium. In the precious metals market the platinum price was yesterday knocked off a five-year peak as selling spilled over from a weak gold market. The price had been lifted to Dollars 404.50 a troy ounce in London by concern about possible disruption to production during the South African election campaign and Japanese buying encouraged by the weakness of the yen. But it was fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 399 an ounce, still Dollars 9 to the good, as the gold price plunged Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 378.50, near the bottom of its recent trading range. Oil prices were also very weak, with New York futures hitting five-year lows. Traders said there were no particular developments to account for the weakness of the market, which was still suffering from Opec inaction on cutting excessive production. At London's International Petroleum Exchange the prompt April futures position, which dipped to Dollars 12.96 a barrel on Thursday morning, was quoted in late trading yesterday at Dollars 13.20 a barrel, down 56 cents on the week. Technical rallies boosted both coffee and cocoa futures at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. May delivery coffee broke through resistance at Dollars 1,228 a tonne and moved on to close at Dollars 1,243, up Dollars 16 on the day and Dollars 39 on the week. Cocoa, which had been trading in a narrow range, put on a late spurt to end at Dollars 919 a tonne in the May position, up Dollars 31 on the week.  ----------------------------------------------             LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS           (As at Thursday's close)  ---------------------------------------------- tonnes  ---------------------------------------------- Aluminium            -2,975 to 2,552,675 Aluminium alloy        +340 to    47,120 Copper              -13,350 to   564,850 Lead                 +1,000 to   329,125 Nickel                 +720 to   132,462 Zinc                 +5,450 to 1,027,925 Tin                     +25 to    21,655  ----------------------------------------------</p>

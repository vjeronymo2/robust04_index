			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Damned if it does - and if it doesn't: Quentin Peel examines Germany's defence against the charge that it is beginning to throw its political weight around The charge is clear: a united Germany, already the economic power house of Europe, is starting to throw its political weight about too. The Anglo-Saxon media, and the corridors of Congress and the Elysee, are full of dark mutterings of German high-handedness. This was the week when the member states of the European Community (EC) finally bowed to the bullying of Bonn, the accusers say, and recognised the independence of Croatia and Slovenia against their better judgment, just to prevent Germany going it alone. And that came barely a month after the EC summit in Maastricht set the signals for a common European foreign and security policy, at Germany's insistence. The economies of Europe are still smarting from the effects of the German Bundesbank's best Christmas present - a half percentage point rise in its interest rates, dragging most of western Europe in its wake. That was pretty rich, coming only 10 days after Maastricht agreed on European monetary union, says the prosecution. And now they charge that Chancellor Helmut Kohl, not content with unification, is campaigning for more members in the European Parliament, and for German to be used as a working language of the EC, like English and French. Close allies in his coalition government are even calling, God forbid, for Germany to be granted its rightful seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The charge is furiously denied, in Bonn: more in sorrow than in anger, although with more than a hint of bitterness, too. 'First we were accused of being high-handed over unification; then we were charged with being too feeble in the Gulf war; and now we are accused once more of being a bully over Yugoslavia. It is difficult to know how to react,' says one senior German diplomat. The feeling is equally sore in the Chancellor's office: 'How can we argue our case better, in Brussels for example, without being instantly accused of national assertiveness?' one of Mr Kohl's advisers complains. 'We are rather like the Americans during the Vietnam war: the ugly Americans. We are the ugly Germans, and we cannot escape it.' So what is the verdict: guilty or not guilty? Has German foreign policy changed since unification in substance, or only in style? If it has changed, is that any bad thing for the west, and the rest of the world? There is no doubt that the world has changed since German unification, and Germany too. 'The situation has changed fundamentally. That must have consequences for our foreign policy,' says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman in parliament for Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). 'The recovery of our full sovereignty gives us greater room for manoeuvre. We are no longer threatened (from the east) or dependent (on the west). 'Germany has not only grown bigger, but the expectations of our partners have grown too: both their hopes and their fears. The hopes are in the east, and the fears are in the west, and these are contradictory expectations.' The irony for a united Germany is that the country's greatest preoccupation is internal - the need to make the traumatic process of unification work, given that it is proving far more difficult and far more expensive than expected. Yet, just when the German desire, both in government and in business, is to be entirely introverted, the growing chaos in the outside world is forcing the country to become a much more serious actor on the international stage. 'Germany is in an awkward position,' according to one experienced European ambassador. 'They are not assertive because they want to be assertive. It is thrust upon them.' Mr Hanns Schumacher, the official spokesman for Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, is adamant that German policy has not changed one jot. It has simply been reinforced. 'Mr Genscher says it is most important not to lose the trust we have earned, not to turn our new size into more power, but into more responsibility in the world,' he says. 'He made a solemn European offer, immediately after unification. We offered to bind ourselves into a process leading to (European) political union. We proposed the gradual transfer of national competence and political responsibility to European bodies.' Put another way, the offer was not to make Europe more German, but Germany more European. Since then, two things have happened. The negotiations on European political and economic union have laid the foundations for greater integration, but they still fall well short of what Chancellor Kohl would like to have seen. And the process of disintegration in eastern Europe, in Yugoslavia and, above all, in the Soviet Union, has accelerated. It is the latter, the fear of chaos and collapse on its eastern frontiers threatening even the security of the German integration process, that is now proving the driving force of German foreign policy. And there is a conviction throughout the body politic that the rest of the western world has simply failed to appreciate the danger. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the finance ministry and Germany's chief negotiator in the Group of Seven industrialised nations, is convinced that his British, French, American and Japanese colleagues are dangerously complacent. 'We are living on a powder keg, yet nobody is worrying about it enough,' he said last month, on his return from negotiating the G7 debt relief programme in Moscow. 'The British are making a terrible mistake if they think they can sit on their island and escape when another nuclear power station blows up.' Mr Jochen Thies, editor of Europa Archiv and a critic of the Kohl-Genscher foreign policy, says: 'All round our German home, the landscape has totally changed. Stability ends on the German and Austrian borders. Indeed, the earthquake begins already in east Germany, for the Russian troops are still there. No other EC country is confronted with that.' German fears are not only about nuclear safety (from civil as much as military sources), but also about immigration. 'We have no straits of Dover,' says Mr Thies. 'The river Neisse in some places is only 50cm deep. You can walk through it. Chaos in the Soviet Union would have an immediate impact.' There is no doubt that the urgency of German fears over collapse and disintegration in the east have fuelled its assertiveness in foreign policy. Yugoslavia is the immediate example. But there, German apparent heavy-handedness has been compounded by the peculiarities of the country's foreign policy-making process and its dominant personality - Mr Genscher. With 17 years as foreign minister behind him, Mr Genscher is the most experienced foreign policy maker on the European stage. He is also a supreme tactician, a master of apparently perpetual motion, an acutely sensitive follower of the public mood and, above all, a supreme local politician. His insistence on dragging visitors to his home town of Halle is legendary. So is his almost total personal domination of the German Foreign Office machine, and the diplomatic debate in the German media. 'He is badly advised. There are no early warning systems. When you are foreign minister for 17 years you can play with the journalists at home, but you cannot afford to do that on the international scene,' says Mr Thies. 'This explains astonishing mistakes in terms of style.' According to one western diplomat: 'Germany is not overbearing, but Genscher can be.' Yugoslavia became a huge emotional issue in German public life in the middle of last year. The media debate was almost entirely one-sided: sympathetic to the self-determination of Croatia and Slovenia, and hostile to the aggression of Serbia. Mr Genscher reflected that emotional response. He was personally horrified at the Yugoslav National Army's use of force. The turning point was apparently a telephone call from Mr Stipe Mesic, the Yugoslav president, on July 3, reporting that the army had effectively carried out a putsch. From then on he was determined to force through EC recognition of the two republics to protect them, even if it meant alienating his EC colleagues. German policy on Yugoslavia reveals another profound difference with foreign policy making in, say, France or Britain - although a similarity with that in the US. It is far more motivated by domestic political considerations, and by perceptions of principle and morality, than pragmatic national interest. 'Yugoslavia was an emotional reaction, and there I would see a weakness in the German political system,' the western ambassador says. 'It runs on emotion, in the population and the media, and without guidance from the government. The government always wants to be in harmony with public opinion.' Mr Lamers, an outspoken supporter of Croatian independence, agrees: 'Whether you believe it or not, our engagement was very strongly morally motivated,' he says. He admits that German opinion may have been blind to human rights violations by Croatia, but the overwhelming sympathy was for self-determination, against perceived aggression by Serbia.' Yugoslavia was the immediate example of Germany's determination to pursue an active foreign policy in central and eastern Europe, but Germany does not want to go it alone. 'I don't want Britain and France to sit there and criticise us,' Mr Lamers said. 'They must take the initiative too. This wait-and-see attitude is not good enough.' He believes that Germany's bitter experience of Nazi rule from 1933-45 has taught the country that it is no longer possible to behave like a nation state. France and Britain have not learned the lesson so well. Another powerful driving force for co-operation in eastern Europe is the economic state of the nation. The once purring German economic machine is staggering under the burden of transfers of state spending to subsidise jobes in the east. Indeed, it was concern over the state of the domestic economy, the size of the public sector deficit, and the demands for double-digit wage awards that prompted the Bundesbank to raise interest rates in December. The government was as upset with the central bank as were London, Paris and Rome. There was certainly no hint of co-ordinated muscle-flexing. 'We have problems creating an order of priorities,' says Mr Thies. 'We try to do everything, and have a tendency to do nothing: never to take hard decisions. This generation in government seeks to buy its way out of conflicts if it can. But this policy is coming to an end. The money is running out.' He believes that, far from fearing German assertiveness, the rest of the world ought to be encouraging greater German international involvement and responsibility. He regrets the fact that Mr Kohl has flatly rejected seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the foreseeable future. 'It is very important to bind in the Germans at the world level, as well as at the European level,' he says. A senior diplomat from one of the smaller EC nations goes further. 'It is both wrong and dangerous to accuse the Germans of arrogance,' he says. 'The Germans have always offered to pool their sovereignty in a European context. If France and Britain continue to refuse that offer for parochial reasons, the Germans may eventually say: 'Let us go it alone.' Then the current anti-German propaganda would prove self-fulfilling.'</p>

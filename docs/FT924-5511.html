			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pegasus shares fall 42p as chief executive leaves Shares in Pegasus tumbled 42p to 86p yesterday following news that Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, chief executive, was leaving and that the USM-quoted designer of accounting software and supplier of forms would incur trading losses in the five months to December 31, its new year-end. This would result in 'a small loss from normal trading activities' in the current 17-month period. However, the company added that at the pre-tax level it would be in the black, thanks to the sale in September of 25 per cent of Stockforms to Deluxe Corporation of Minnesota for Pounds 1.7m cash. This would appear in the year-end results as a Pounds 1.25m exceptional gain, it said. In the 12 months to July 31 pre-tax profits declined to Pounds 655,000 (Pounds 1.67m). Mr Derek Moon, non-executive chairman, said that Pegasus had been forced to reappraise its short-term strategies and, in the company's words, 'the board is taking steps to reduce costs and defer expenditure in line with anticipated launch dates of new products', or 'it is readjusting marketing initiatives started by the chief executive' in Mr Moon's. He said this had thrown up 'a disagreement over policy' between Mr Hubbard-Ford, chief executive only since April, and the rest of the board. Mr Hubbard-Ford will remain as a director for the time being, and until a new chief executive can be found, the remaining executives and the senior managers will run the company. Cash balances at November 30 amounted to Pounds 2.5m. At July 31 they were Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 3.27m).</p>

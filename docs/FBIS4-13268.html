			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- The visiting deputy  foreign minister of Sudan, Yusuf 'Umar Baridah, and his Iranian  counterpart Mohammad Hashemi urged lifting of arms embargo on  Bosnians and called on world Muslims to take serious measures in  this connection.    In a meeting here Monday, the two sides discussed  international developments including crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and termed the double-standard of the West,  especially the U.S., as "cruel and unacceptable". The two  officials also criticized procrastination of the U.N. and the  West towards massacre of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces.    Pointing to the issue of hajj, Hashemi regretted new  restrictions being imposed by Saudi Arabia on the number of  Iranian hajj pilgrims. He stressed that if Muslims were allowed  to raise problems facing the Islamic world during hajj rituals  and could make proper decisions themselves, the world arrogance  could never find a chance to interfere in their internal affairs.    Baridah, who arrived here Monday on a three-day visit,  discussed expansion of bilateral relations in all fields. He  also underlined the religious and political importance of hajj.</p>

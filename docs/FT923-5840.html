			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: MacGregor ousted at HunterPrint SIR IAN MacGregor has been ousted as chairman of HunterPrint, the loss-making specialist printer. It is understood that there had been institutional pressure for him to go. The issue had apparently been raised as the group sought to raise fresh finance. In March, borrowings stood at Pounds 30m on shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.5m. Sir Ian, former chairman of British Coal and British Steel, was paid Pounds 236,000 by HunterPrint last year. He was on a two-year contract running until December and held more than 5m shares. These were bought at 10p each when he came in with new management, making his personal investment about Pounds 500,000. That rescue share issue in December 1990 raised Pounds 13.6m. Sir Ian is being replaced at HunterPrint by Sir John Wheeler, a non-executive director, who was described by the company yesterday as an interim chairman. The chief executive is Mr Tony Caplin, one of those who came in with Sir Ian. Sir John, MP for Westminster North and chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, was reported by a wire service yesterday to have said of Sir Ian: 'He is nearly 80 and has had a heart by-pass operation. I don't think I need go any further than that.' However, Sir Ian's health did not seem to be in question at his Argyll home yesterday, which he had just left to fly to Geneva. He was due to meet Mr Eric Kohn, chief executive of Holmes Protection, the US-based security company that is quoted in London. Sir Ian is chairman of Holmes, which recently concluded a debt restructuring exercise. Mr Kohn reacted with surprise to Mr Wheeler's comment, which he described as 'extraordinary'. 'Sir Ian does not behave like a man of 80. He has all the faculties of someone of 40 or 50. He has performed admirably at Holmes.' Sir Ian's recent involvement in companies in need of resuscitation included the chairmanship of Mountleigh, the property company which collapsed in May with debts of Pounds 590m. HunterPrint also announced yesterday the appointment as a non-executive director of Mr Jeoff Samson, former managing director of Yale &amp; Valor. The company's share price closed at 6p yesterday compared with a 12-month high of 16 1/2 p.</p>

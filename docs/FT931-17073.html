			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Feeble growth The Treasury's expected growth rate is feeble for an economy emerging from recession. It is only about half that achieved by the US last year in a recovery that was far too weak to save President Bush from electoral defeat. The equity market is thus taking a lot on trust. All the more so, since the FT-SE index has risen by 33 per cent over the past two recessionary years while reported industrial earnings have fallen by some 18 per cent. That leaves the market on a historic multiple of over 17, a range not seen since the run up to the 1987 crash. Arguably such a rating is justified on the grounds that inflationary expectations have fallen. Low inflation enhances the quality of earnings, enabling shares to trade on a higher rating even though prospects for nominal earnings growth have diminished. Yet there can be little mileage left in this argument. Any further advance will need to be justified by actual earnings growth. This is notoriously hard to predict. The devaluation should boost the income of companies which derive most of their earnings from abroad. Those which are active in the US may benefit additionally from recovery there - as well as further dollar appreciation. But expectations of an anaemic UK recovery suggest earnings growth may be confined to around 10 to 15 per cent this year. Besides, low dividend cover will limit the beneficial impact of any earnings rise. And the earnings trend will be unusually hard to pin down, given the accounting changes now entering into force. The market may thus find itself relying heavily on trading statements accompanying annual results to sustain any new year rally. The trouble is that there are plenty of other factors which could kill the advance. If the chancellor means what he says, there is unlikely to be another cut in rates in the first quarter, although base rates of 6 per cent are probably factored into equity prices. Further deterioration of the European economy - largely ignored by UK equities so far - will not help, though it might hasten interest rate cuts in Germany. Another concern is that the market's higher levels could provoke a spate of rights issues. This would add to worries about institutional cash-flow. Rights issues last year amounted to only Pounds 4bn against Pounds 10.3bn in 1991.</p>

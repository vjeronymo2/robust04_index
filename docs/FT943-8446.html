			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / New swap provides a hedge against higher UK taxes Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has entered a UK tax rate swap, which could mark the opening of a new market for hedging tax exposure. The agreement, signed this month, will allow its client to protect itself from future variations in UK corporate tax rates. Companies routinely consider tax implications when entering interest rate and currency swaps but a tax swap is more radical. The swap would allow companies to hedge against changes in tax rates and as a result to maintain their level of post-tax profits regardless of the tax effects triggered by policy changes or switches in political regimes. Morgan Grenfell has taken on its own books a swap relating to Pounds 15m income from leases payable to an international bank. The agreement runs over four years - until after the next general election. If UK tax rates fall below the current 33 per cent, Morgan Grenfell will pay out the saving in the tax charge to the client. Morgan Grenfell says the swap has a natural hedge because it can offset any payments or receipts against the effects that any tax rate change will have on its own corporate profits. Its profits on the deal came from a fixed fee, but it believes future agreements could be based on a commission and may be hedged around rates other than 33 per cent. It is seeking counterparties for this swap and is considering a number of similar arrangements with other clients. Mr Neil Jeffares, a director in the banking division at Morgan Grenfell, said the client had provided 'a very satisfactory fee'. The product would be ideal for UK companies or multinationals with UK tax liabilities, although it would be more difficult for a UK bank to enter swaps hedging against tax changes in other countries. According to derivatives specialists, there have been tax swaps in the past ahead of general elections, particularly in anticipation of a shift from a right to left-wing government, such as in the US in 1991 and 1992 because of fears of a tax rate rise under a Clinton administration. However, a number of factors have tended to inhibit the development of a tax swap market. It may be hard to find counterparties for companies trying to offset tax risk. In addition, tax authorities have tended to frown on structures devised purely for tax reasons. 'The mood these days is that it is the spirit and not the letter of tax law that counts,' said one head of swaps at a London-based bank. However, the Morgan swap does not affect the amount of tax payable to the Exchequer.</p>

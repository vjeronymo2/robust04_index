			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Further change to asylum bill A FURTHER move toward providing independent reviews of decisions made on asylum cases was made by the government yesterday in order to facilitate the passage of the asylum bill through parliament. Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister, accepted a move to appoint an independent 'auditor' to monitor the working of the new arrangements.

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS HELP COUPLE RISE ABOVE ORDINARY  PROBLEMS;  </P> <P> B&amp;BS IN SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS OFFER ESCAPE FROM SUMMER HEAT  </P> <P> Blue skies, evergreen forests, azure lakes and a host of bed and breakfast inns  promise relief from the megalopolis in midsummer.  </P> <P> "It's a lot nicer up here than it is down there," said Janice Hague, who was  having a leisurely breakfast with her husband Chris on the back porch of the  Eagle's Nest B&amp;B in this quiet alpine community.  </P> <P> Lounging in their bathrobes, a mile high in the San Bernardino Mountains, the  couple was escaping the heat and smog that recently covered their San Fernando  Valley home and much of the Los Angeles basin.  </P> <P> Although Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead have long been fresh-air retreats for  Southlanders, an increasing number of B&amp;Bs now offer a greater variety of  lodgings and locations. They range from one room in a private house, where a  continental breakfast is served, to a more traditional inn featuring 10 guest  rooms and a full breakfast with home recipes.  </P> <P> These days, more than a dozen B&amp;Bs are scattered in the mountains at Lake  Arrowhead, Skyforest, Blue Jay, Running Springs, Fawnskin, Big Bear City and  Big Bear Lake. All rates quoted in the following B&amp;Bs are per room or  suite.  </P> <P> The Hagues were staying just off the main highway in Big Bear Lake at the cozy  five-room, five-bath Eagle's Nest, owned and operated by Jim Joyce and Jack  Draper.  </P> <P> Since opening their log cabin lodge three summers ago, the dedicated innkeepers  have added three private cottage suites in a separate building.  </P> <P> "The suites are for guests who want a more secluded getaway," Joyce said. "They  are very popular with honeymooners."  </P> <P> Each suite has a wood-burning fireplace, a TV set, mini-refrigerator, microwave  oven and coffee-maker. Two of the suites feature Jacuzzis, the other a sleeper  to accommodate children. Nightly rates are $80 weekdays, $130 (with Jacuzzi  tub) and $110 (with sleeper) on weekends.  </P> <P> Guests in the suites cook their own breakfast or go out to eat. "We recommend  The Landings Cafe in the terminal of the Big Bear City Airport," Draper said.  </P> <P> B&amp;B guests in the main house are served a bountiful breakfast by the  innkeepers. Weeknight rates are $70, weekends $85/$95. Call (714) 866-6465 for  reservations at Eagle's Nest.  </P> <P> The best-known B&amp;B at Big Bear Lake is the historic Knickerbocker Mansion,  named for the man who began building the four-story home of vertical logs in  the 1920s.  </P> <P> After 44 years, Bill Knickerbocker was still working on the imposing structure  when he died at the age of 89. It became a B&amp;B five years ago.  </P> <P> Almost the entire top of the house was recently turned into a honeymoon suite,  complete with a double-size Jacuzzi and a wood stove. A VCR accompanies a huge  projection TV screen, and guests in the suite also enjoy an audio system with  CD and cassette players. The spacious accommodation is $150 per night.  </P> <P> The other five guest rooms in the rather rustic mansion share two baths and  rent for $85 per night. Four more rooms, all with private bath, were created in  the hayloft of the adjacent carriage house. Rooms are $95 per night in the  carriage house, which was the meeting site of Big Bear's first Masonic lodge.  </P> <P> Ask owner Phyliss Knight, who moved from Fullerton to take over the B&amp;B in  1987, more about the old home's history.  </P> <P> Her assistant, Valerie Prehm, can explain about the bullet lodged in a door  jamb in the dining room. Another of the innkeepers, JoAnna Derrington, will  relate her experiences with the resident ghost.  </P> <P> People like the informality of the Knickerbocker Mansion. "We want guests to  feel like they're visiting grandma's house," Derrington said. In the kitchen, a  cookie jar is filled with help-yourself treats, and coffee and tea are always  available. An expanded continental breakfast is offered in the morning.  </P> <P> A hammock beckons lazing visitors to the second-floor porch, where rocking  chairs also give views through enormous pine trees to the lake. Croquet,  Ping-Pong, darts and a Jacuzzi on the sun deck are other diversions.  </P> <P> The 2 1/2-acre property adjoins a national forest with hiking trails. In the  opposite direction, it's a three-block walk to the center of town. For  reservations at the Knickerbocker Mansion, call (714) 866-8221.  </P> <P> On the opposite side of the lake in Big Bear City is Gold Mountain Manor,  another vintage log house that was restored as a B&amp;B five years ago. Since  being erected in a pine forest in 1926 as a private club's mansion, the  three-story structure also has been a bordello and a boarding house.  </P> <P> A Victorville grade school principal, Conny Ridgway, and her husband, John,  bought the seven-room inn last year and have put it into tiptop shape.  </P> <P> The rooms have fireplaces and individual decors, including the downstairs suite  with a pioneer-Indian motif that's named for a Big Bear outdoorsman, Ted Ducey.  It features a private Jacuzzi, a half bath and a nightly tab of $150. The  presidential suite, which has a full private bath, costs the same.  </P> <P> The Honeymoon Room with half bath is $130. The other four rooms in the manor  share two baths and cost $110/$115, except the small Wildcat Room, which has no  fireplace and goes for $75.  </P> <P> Rates include a home-cooked breakfast. Guests like the quiet location and  woodsy grounds of this historic inn, which has been the background for a number  of clothing ads and catalogues. Call (714) 585-6997 for a room at Gold Mountain  Manor.  </P> <P> The much newer Inn at Fawnskin also is on the north side of Big Bear Lake, but  near its western end. G.B. and Susie Sneed left Orange County and the savings  and loan industry to open their four-room B&amp;B in a contemporary log home  two years ago.  </P> <P> "We came up here and fell in love with the place," G.B. said. It shows. The  comfortable, well-kept inn has country decor befitting its knotty pine  interior, along with special features ranging from a grand piano to a  basketball court.  </P> <P> A pool table, wide-screen TV with a selection of 200 videotapes and a wet bar  (bring your own liquor) are found in a separate game room. Novels line  floor-to-ceiling shelves.  </P> <P> "Families and small groups of friends sometimes rent the entire inn," G.B.  said. "We're happy to socialize as innkeepers or just retreat to our own cabin  and leave them alone."  </P> <P> The four upstairs rooms are from $75 for the smallest to $155 for the master  suite, which has a private bath, rock fireplace, TV and VCR.  </P> <P> For breakfast, stuffed French toast and Susie's cinnamon rolls are favorites of  the guests. For reservations at the Inn at Fawnskin, call (714) 866-3200.  </P> <P> Not far from Lake Arrowhead, along Rim of the World Drive at Skyforest, is the  Storybook Inn. This rambling, glass-fronted home was built in the 1940s for the  man who designed the original Lake Arrowhead Village.  </P> <P> In 1986, Kathleen and John Wooley of Glendale purchased the three-story inn,  which has nine large guest rooms and suites, all with private bath. Rates are  $95/$155, less on weekdays.  </P> <P> A special attraction is a rustic 1930s log cabin that resembles a hunting lodge  with mounted fish and game trophies, stone fireplace and knotty-pine paneling.  It sleeps six in two bedrooms and a loft, and there are two baths plus a full  kitchen. The rent is $175 for two, plus $30 for each extra person.  </P> <P> Guests get a hot tub and sun deck with views of the valley on non-smoggy days.  In the morning, a hot breakfast is brought to each room with the daily  newspaper, or guests can eat in the dining room or solarium. For reservations  at Storybook Inn, call (714) 336-1483.  </P> <P> Closer to Lake Arrowhead is the 6,500-square-foot home of Jody and Oscar Wilson  that they transformed into the impressive six-room Chateau Du Lac Bed &amp;  Breakfast Inn in 1988.  </P> <P> The Lakeview Suite has the best view of Lake Arrowhead and comes with an  outdoor balcony, Jacuzzi and fireplace. The tab is $250, including a gourmet  breakfast and lavish afternoon tea. Jody, who was a caterer in Palos Verdes,  also can prepare special dinners by request.  </P> <P> All rooms feature queen-size beds, TVs and telephones. Only two rooms share a  bath, and they are the least expensive at $95 per night. Guests relax in the  upper-level library or the dining room, where there is a game table. A canary  serenading visitors in the dining room adds to the charm of this handsome inn.  For reservations at Chateau Du Lac, call (714) 337-6488.  </P> <P> Also near the water is the first B&amp;B at Lake Arrowhead, the homey Bluebelle  House that Lila and Rick Peiffer opened in 1983.  </P> <P> Three of Bluebelle's five rooms are decorated in motifs recalling the  innkeepers' travels to Paris, Bavaria and Austria. The others have romance and  country themes, including silk flower displays that reflect Lila's background  as a floral and interior designer.  </P> <P> Nightly rates are $75/$110, including a home-cooked breakfast. Call (714)  336-3292 for reservations.  </P> <P> Another B&amp;B at Lake Arrowhead is Eagle's Landing, where four rooms in  Dorothy and Jack Stone's modern home rent for $85/$155. Call (714) 336-2642.  </P> <P> For other bed and breakfast inns in the area, call the Big Bear Chamber of  Commerce at (714) 866-4607. Also contact the Lake Arrowhead Communities Chamber  of Commerce: (714) 337-3715.  </P> <P> Be warned that many B&amp;Bs have prohibitions regarding smoking, children and  pets. A two-night minimum stay often is required on weekends, with three nights  over holiday weekends. Ask about midweek and senior citizen discounts.  </P> <P> To reach Big Bear Lake via Lake Arrowhead, drive east from Los Angeles on  Interstate 10 to join Interstate 215 north. Follow the freeway direction for  Highland Avenue/Mountain Resorts, California 30, then take the Cresttline/Lake  Arrowhead exit, Waterman Avenue, which is California 18 and winds up the  mountain.  </P> <P> An alternative route is to continue east on California 30 about five miles  beyond the California 18 exit and join California 330 up the mountain to Big  Bear Lake via Running Springs.  </P> <P> Round trip from Los Angeles to Big Bear Lake is 210 miles.  </P></p>

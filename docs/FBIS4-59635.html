			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus -- In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS,  Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, general secretary of the Islamic Jihad  Movement, said that the Islamic Jihad Movement realizes that it  is facing a changing and new reality, which calls for drawing up  a dynamic and new program. He added: We will examine and  reevaluate the new conditions with a view to formulating a more  effective program.    Al-Shaqaqi noted that some of the details of this reality  are  still ambiguous. This will affect a decision on all these  issues and will leave options and possibilities open. He  criticized the recent Cairo agreement and affirmed his  movement's refusal to recognize this agreement, which according  to him gives the occupation legitimacy over a major part of  Palestine in return for ridiculous self-rule over a small part  of the homeland.    Al-Shaqaqi added: We have to continue mobilizing the people  against the agreement and draw attention to its dangers, which  are epitomized by the loss of Palestine; the annulment of the  Palestinian people's presence; and Israel's decisive victory.  Israel is entering the region as a recognized central and  dominating power with a recognized role.    On the Islamic Jihad Movement's stance toward the  Palestinian  police, al-Shaqaqi stressed that one of his movement's  priorities will be to avoid armed clashes with the Palestinian  authority and police and that Islamic Jihad will do its utmost  to avoid clashes even if it is forced to change its tactics in  Gaza. He noted that one of Israel's major goals is to spark  these clashes and preoccupy the Palestinians.    Al-Shaqaqi said that it was important to achieve a more  effective political, social, and cultural presence in the coming  stage while affirming the unity of and coordination among  opposition Islamic and national forces. This, in a bid to reach  the best practical program possible so as to move beyond just  issuing statements while the effort on the ground remains  divided and isolated.    In answer to a question about an issue currently  preoccupying  the Israelis, namely, whether he had any information about  missing and captured Israelis, especially the pilot Ron Arad,  al-Shaqaqi said that according to his information all missing  Israelis, with the exception of Ron Arad, were dead. Those  missing in 1982 were killed and there are conflicting reports  about the whereabouts of their bodies. Two Israeli soldiers  were captured by Hizballah fighters in 1986. One of them was  killed on the spot and the other died from his wounds. As for  Ron Arad, he was captured by the fighters of the "Faithful  Resistance," which is a small splinter faction of the Amal  Movement and holds Islamic tendencies. This faction was  recently disbanded.    Al-Shaqaqi added that the Faithful Resistance leaders say  that they did capture Ron Arad but that after a while he  disappeared or fled and that most likely an unknown party is  still holding him. In any case, this party must be protecting  him and has important reasons for doing so.</p>

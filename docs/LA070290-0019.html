			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS HOPE TO END BLAZE TODAY;  </P> <P> DISASTER: DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT $500 MILLION. AUTHORITIES CITE 25 INTRUDERS  FOR SIFTING THROUGH ASHES IN SEARCH OF VALUABLES.  </P> <P> As firefighters armed with shovels and water hoses Sunday battled the last hot  spots of the devastating wildfire that they expect to extinguish today,  authorities announced they had cited about 25 people for rifling through the  ashes of homes for valuables.  </P> <P> "People are sifting through the ruins of other people's houses," said  California Highway Patrol Sgt. Dave Kissinger at a roadblock in one  neighborhood that was heavily damaged by the fire. "It's totally sick."  </P> <P> Those cited were charged with "sightseeing at the scene of an emergency," a  misdemeanor, after they were caught combing through the rubble in burned-out  neighborhoods, said Tim Gracey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> CHP officers maintained roadblocks at streets leading into some neighborhoods  and allowed in only those who could prove they lived there.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara County Sheriff Jim Thomas said there were no documented cases of  looting, a more serious charge. But one fire victim said it was clear that  someone had searched through the ashes of his home, moved a filing cabinet and  opened the drawers.  </P> <P> "There's nothing anyone could find in there," said John Warkentin, pointing to  his demolished house, "but it's irritating to think someone was trying."  </P> <P> As firefighters worked to clear out the final hot spots of the wildfire,  officials estimated the damage at about $500 million. Estimates have varied as  official inspections were completed.  </P> <P> About 1,000 firefighters -- down from a peak of 1,800 -- remained Sunday, and  officials say they expect the number to drop to a crew of about 100 today.  </P> <P> "They're checking tree stumps, roots and piles of leaves, making sure nothing  is smoldering," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Maeton Freel. "We don't want  to run the risk of anything flaring up again."  </P> <P> The ground crews were aided by helicopters equipped with infra-red video  cameras, designed to find burning embers in the brush and in charred houses.  Once the smoldering areas were found, ground crews and helicopters dumped water  and fire retardant on the embers.  </P> <P> In other areas of the city, residents whose homes escaped the flames that  scorched thousands of acres worked together to trim back trees and clear shrubs  to be better prepared for the next wave of fire. Fire officials said Santa  Barbara is particularly vulnerable during the remainder of the summer because  the region has been plagued by a severe drought.  </P> <P> "The scary part is, this is just the beginning," said Charles Johnson, a  spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. "We still have the  whole summer to go."  </P> <P> In one neighborhood hard hit by the fire, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and county  officials staged a press conference Sunday afternoon after touring the stricken  region by helicopter and on foot.  </P> <P> "It is almost an unprecedented disaster in terms of the speed and the magnitude  of the fire," said Wilson, the Republican nominee for governor. "It traveled  3.8 miles in an hour and 20 minutes."  </P> <P> Wilson said Santa Barbara residents will be able to apply for federal disaster  relief on Tuesday, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency opens a  temporary headquarters in the area.  </P> <P> An inter-agency task force headed by officials from city and county fire  departments and the U.S. Forest Service has been formed to investigate the  fire, caused when an arsonist used an incendiary device on the bone-dry brush.  A $120,000 reward, raised from donations by local residents and businesses, has  been offered for information leading to the arrest of the arsonist.  </P> <P> On San Marcos Pass Road, where traffic was permitted for the first time since  the fire began Wednesday, scores of sightseers on Sunday parked by the side of  the road to gaze at the huge expanse of charred brush and firefighters at work.  </P> <P> "I think the whole thing is incredible -- that an arsonist could do so much  damage," said Irv Bromberg, a tourist from Coral Springs, Fla.  </P> <P> Bromberg and his wife, Wendy, standing near where the fire was set, watched as  helicopters carrying huge buckets of fire retardant flew over and dumped their  loads on smoking embers on a nearby hillside.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, the fire was contained, which means a fire line around the  blaze was completed. The fire was expected to be under control by this morning.  That means there are no flames within 300 feet of the fire lines. And, because  of the coastal fog, cool temperatures and absence of winds, the fire is  expected to be extinguished later today, officials said.  </P> <P> But in the aftermath of this fire, residents will eventually be confronted by a  new danger -- mudslides. During the next week, a U.S. Forest Service team of  geologists, soil scientists and other experts, along with officials from the  county Flood Control Agency, will map the burn area, looking for potential  mudslide sites. Before winter, the Forest Service will build small dams at the  base of some denuded hills and block off some fire-ravaged ravines to prevent  flooding during the next heavy rains.  </P> <P> "The area that was burned was steep, close to populated areas and there were  about three creeks that drain right through the cities. This makes it a prime  area for mudslides," Freel said. "That's our next concern."  </P> <P> In San Diego County, gusting winds on Sunday prolonged the life of another  arson fire burning for the last five days near Lake Henshaw. The fire had been  listed as contained Sunday morning until winds increased, preventing full  containment for another 24 hours. The final damage toll is expected to be 4,350  acres and $291,000. The fire destroyed two homes. Ten firefighters suffered  minor injuries. Halting the flames' advance required more than 1,800  firefighters.  </P> <P> During last week's savage heat wave, brush fires -- most of them arson --  scorched thousands of acres in areas of Southern California, including  Glendale, Chino Hills, Corona and Hemet.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Howard Blume contributed to this story from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FIRES' TOLL  </P> <P>  Devastating wildfires -- most set by arsonists -- swept Southern California  last week.

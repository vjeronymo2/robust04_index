			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT / ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR: AIRPORT NOISE FIGHT SETTLES INTO HOLDING  PATTERN  </P> <P> Edwin C. Hall started fighting the county over airport noise in 1977. That was  four suits, numerous newspaper articles, hundreds of phone calls and, by his  estimate, 3 million words ago.  </P> <P> "I've written to everyone including the President," said Hall, 64, who moved  into what was the quiet neighborhood of Santa Ana Heights 25 years ago. His  dreams of a peaceful retirement home have long since been shattered by the roar  of airplanes flying in and out of the county-operated John Wayne Airport, just  to the northeast.  </P> <P> "When it comes to government, they really have a license to steal," Hall  complained this week.  </P> <P> But not far from the Hall residence live Kelly and Wesley Beavers, who bought  their home in Santa Ana Heights from the county earlier this year. They say  they're the ones -- not county government -- who got the steal.  </P> <P> "The houses we looked at in other areas were so small and much more expensive,"  said Kelly Beavers. As for the airplanes, she said, "I have parrots, and  they're noisier."  </P> <P> As neighbors in the Sherwood Estates section of Santa Ana Heights, the two  couples represent opposites sides of a controversy that has dogged the county  for more than a decade and shows no sign of going away any time soon.  </P> <P> Three years ago the county adopted a three-part program that was supposed to  mend fences with airport neighbors fed up with the noise. But residents  complain -- and some county officials concede -- that much of the program has  been slow getting off the ground.  </P> <P> As one of the first steps under the noise relief program adopted by the Board  of Supervisors in 1986, the county rezoned some of the noisiest areas around  the airport from residential to industrial to forestall future homeowner  problems.  </P> <P> The other two parts of the plan applied to about 460 existing homes or  apartments in Santa Ana Heights.  </P> <P> Homeowners were given until March, 1987, to opt for a buyout under which the  county would purchase the homes of residents who couldn't take the noise. Then  the county was to insulate the houses against noise and resell them. It is one  of these homes where the Beavers now live.  </P> <P> "It's not that bad when the windows are closed," said Kelly Beavers. "It's not  even a roar. It's just like a muffle."  </P> <P> Initially, 72 homeowners opted for the buyout. But county officials say the  number of participants has since dwindled to 44. Of those, county officials  have completed purchase of 20 and resold half a dozen. The others are under  renovation and should be sold by the end of next summer, county officials said.  </P> <P> Hall, who did not sign up for the program, contends that homeowners dropped out  because of long delays and below-market purchase prices offered them by the  county. He complains that four county-owned houses near his home remain vacant  and are a fire hazard.  </P> <P> But county officials say many of the homeowners decided not to sell because of  another more popular option offered by the county. Homeowners have until the  end of 1990 to sign up for $25,000 worth of sound insulation -- including  stronger, thicker doors and windows and air conditioning -- in exchange for  giving up their right to sue over the noise as long as it remains under a  certain decibel level.  </P> <P> Already 102 homeowners and the proprietors of 198 apartments in two complexes  have agreed to the deal, according to county records. Work on about 40 of the  homes is expected to begin early next year. Completing work on all the homes  and apartments is likely to take another three or four years, said Micki  Harris, a county environmental planner who is overseeing the program.  </P> <P> "It's been a little slow, but once we get going we should really start cranking  them out," Harris said. "We've gotten a good turnout. We're pretty pleased."  </P> <P> Thomas F. Hogan is among the 100 or so residents who haven't chosen either  program. At 78, Hogan said, he has no plans to move and would miss the summer  breezes from the ocean channel behind his home if he were forced to close his  windows and turn on air conditioning.  </P> <P> He would never, in any case, give up the rights to the airspace over his home,  Hogan says, and so he'll just wait it out and see what happens.  </P> <P> That's the attitude of many folks in the neighborhood these days, Hall said. He  is not planning on doing much of anything either.  </P> <P> "We've all adopted the happy-go-lucky" attitude, Hall said. "Otherwise we'd be  chewing all our fingernails off."  </P></p>

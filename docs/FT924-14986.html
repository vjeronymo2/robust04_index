			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Loss and dividend cut at Ben Bailey An erosion of margins and an increased write down in value of land stock pushed Ben Bailey Construction into a loss of Pounds 443,000 in the year ended June 30 1992. The final dividend is halved to 0.25p; that gives 0.55p for the year, against 0.8p last time when the pre-tax profit was Pounds 317,000. Losses per share came to 2.98p (earnings 2.16p). The company said that in the second half there had been a slow but steady deterioration in the willingness of people to buy new homes without heavy incentives and price reductions. In the face of falling margins maintaining volumes became paramount, and 279 (247) units were sold at an average of Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 51,000) to produce turnover of Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 16.5m). But gross profit declined to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 3.36m). Administration expenses were cut as was interest payable. Stock write down was Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 146,000).</p>

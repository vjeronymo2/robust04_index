			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (19): ECGD support grows UK exporters' confident performance in developing markets could be further strengthened if an overhaul of the Export Credits Guarantee Department project financing scheme seduces foreign buyers. Rules on risk-sharing and limits on commercial risk cover are being relaxed. For five years, the ECGD has been offering cover for so-called Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects, where exporters take on concessions to build and operate infrastructure such as power stations and toll roads. It has received about 100 enquiries and looked at 20 projects in detail but only one - a Russian polyethylene plant in which the John Brown Group has a stake - was carried out on BOT terms. The late 1980s saw a flurry of interest in BOT financing, particularly in booming south-east Asian markets. But this was a new game for western exporters and for governments in the buyer countries. Many projects never got off the ground, while others were financed through more established means, such as traditional state-guaranteed export credits. But with many developing nations privatising utilities, BOT is back in the limelight. The UK is well placed to compete as its leading infrastructure operators - in power, water, gas and telecoms - are now in the private sector. Their experience of running such services can be combined with the construction and engineering expertise of the traditional project contractors. Faced with the resurgence of interest in BOT, last year the ECGD - like many other export credit agencies - began a review of its little-used insurance scheme. Until now it has only been prepared to cover commercial risks up to 60 per cent of the value of the loan financing a project. It felt that banks and contractor-concessionaires should be prepared to take substantial share of the risk themselves, as a token of their own faith in the project. Now, the ECGD has decided this risk-sharing can be incorporated in other ways. Henceforth, it may provide full cover for loans meeting up to 85 per cent of the cost of a project, an approach that puts BOT on equal terms with traditional export credit. In cases where it feels obliged to accept a lower exposure, it will still provide a full 100 per cent cover for the loans, even if these are meeting only 70 or 80 per cent of the project cost. It has also relaxed a previous insistence that governments in buyer countries promise to pay indemnities if they make policy changes that affect the viability of a BOT project (for example, by limiting charges for electricity sold by a power station). The decision on whether to seek compensation will now depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>

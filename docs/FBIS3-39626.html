BERLINGSKE TIDENDE was able to report on Monday [14  February]  that the Coordinating Council for Military Affairs in the CIS  (the former Soviet Union) has asked Denmark to assume this  leadership role.    "It is probably wrong to envisage that Denmark or any other  country should play a special role. The United Nations or the  CSCE should play such a role; we have to say that it is  international organizations that should play a special role in  the resolution of conflicts between Russia and its new  neighbors," Helveg Petersen told the TV-Avisen program last  night.    But he is positive to the idea that Denmark should make  troops available.    "Denmark has peacekeeping operations experience that is  unique. We have been involved in many such operations, and we  have trained personnel in the Danish defense forces and  elsewhere to take on such operations. So if the United Nations  and the CSCE become involved in these operations in the former  Soviet Union, well, naturally Denmark must also give  consideration to the role it should play."</p>

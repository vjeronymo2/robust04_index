			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> American to Drop John Wayne-S.F. Service: American Airlines said that, as a  result of a decision to drop British Aerospace 146 aircraft from its fleet, it  is halting service between Orange County and San Francisco, effective Nov. 1.  M. E. Olsen, American's vice president for capacity planning, said the airline  wasn't making money on the route. American's withdrawal turns control of the  market between Orange County and San Francisco over to USAir, which has eight  flights a day between the two points.  </P></p>

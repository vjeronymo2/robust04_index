			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / 'No win, no fee' law scheme attacked GOVERNMENT PLANS to allow lawyers to take cases on a 'no win, no fee' basis came under attack yesterday from the committee appointed to advise the Lord Chancellor on regulating the legal profession. The public plea from the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee not to implement the system was labelled last night as a cack-handed attempt to push Lord Mackay into changing his mind. There was also surprise at the timing of the committee's announcement. The scheme's form has been known since August and Lord Mackay has made clear that he hopes to introduce it for personal injury cases by the end of the year. Conditional fees - under which solicitors charge nothing if they lose but can charge up to double their normal fee if they win - are seen by the Lord Chancellor as a partial solution to the problem of reduced access to justice resulting from cuts in the legal aid budget. His original plan, which the committee says it approved of, was to allow solicitors to charge a premium on their normal fee of just 10 per cent. However, the profession warned the Lord Chancellor that no solicitor would risk a case on a conditional basis for such a small reward, and Lord Mackay agreed to increase the premium to 100 per cent. The committee objects to the 100 per cent premium because it says there is a danger in many personal injury cases that it could swallow up to half or even more of the damages, which could result in serious injustice to people of often limited means.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- The session of the Crimean Supreme  Council continued its work on 20 May. At the morning sitting,  Leonid Hrach, Communist Party of Crimea first secretary, made a  speech in which he called on deputies to "maintain common sense  and not unleash a military conflict." However, deputies decided  to renew the text of the 6 May 1992 version of the Republic of  Crimea constitution (69 deputies voted in favor and 2  abstained). In accordance with the text of the constitution,  mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine  should be built on the basis of agreements and treaties. The  constitution also mentions dual citizenship and creating Crimean  military formations.    Before the vote, the Crimean Tatar Kurultay's [congress]  group announced it would not take part in the voting. People's  Deputy Oleksandr Kruhlov, leader of the Sevastopol branch of the  National Salvation Front of Russia, promised "in the event of a  military conflict, 80,000 Kuban cossacks would defend the  Crimean constitution."    As Vyacheslav Lebedyev, the Crimean president's press  secretary, said Yuriy Meshkov and acting Minister of State  Affairs Viktor Minin flew to Krasnodarskiy Kray at 8.30 "in  connection with the recent signing in Moscow of an  intergovernmental agreement between the Republic of Crimea and  the Russian Federation." It is expected that Yuriy Meshkov will  return to take part in the parliament's work in the second half  of the day.    General Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea minister of internal  affairs of the republic -- appointed on 19 May by the parliament  -- reported to an UNIAN correspondent, "the situation on the  peninsula is quiet, the employees of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of Crimea are fulfilling the duties they are charged  with." According to him, Colonel Valeriy Chernyshov, chief of  the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in Crimea under the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine -- appointed by Leonid  Kravchuk's decree -- is now in Simferopol, "and if he wishes to  visit the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Crimea, we shall let  him in. However, he does not command anyone and the fulfillment  of the duties he was charged with by the president of Ukraine is  out of the question."    The deputies to the Crimean parliament elected a  plenipotentiary commission to hold negotiations with the Supreme  Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president of Ukraine,  consisting of Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council;  Serhiy Nikulin, chairman of the commission for legislation;  Refat Chubarov, chairman of the Kurultay group; Deputies  Volodymyr Klychnykov, Yuriy Podkopayev, and others.    Commenting at UNIAN's request on the developments at the  Supreme Council of Crimea, Leonid Hrach, chairman of the  Communist Party of the Republic of Crimea, said after such steps  by the Crimean parliament, Ukraine has all grounds to take any  measures. "I hope the Supreme Council of Ukraine will show  political wisdom and will become a balance between the emotions  and the legal space which exists in Ukraine and in Crimea," he  said.    Commenting on the report on the concentration of Spetsnaz  [special-purpose forces] in Crimea issued by the TV company  Ostankino, Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimean internal affairs minister,  said there were around 60,000 Ukrainian servicemen on the  peninsula and therefore Ostankino's data were correct.    Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Mykola Mykhalchenko,  official in charge of domestic policy issues at the Ukrainian  presidential service, stated: "The Ukrainian president's  position is this: There is a boundary, which can be maintained  by the central leadership of Ukraine, and it may not be  overstepped." In Mykola Mykhalchenko's view, actions by the  parliament of Crimea overstep the boundary of common sense "and  one has to take the path of compliance with the constitution  across the whole of Ukraine's territory." Also, he does not  rule out that in the very near future a Ukrainian presidential  directive or appropriate actions by the parliament of Ukraine as  a reaction to the [Crimean parliament's] anticonstitutional  decision can be expected.    In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent during a break in  the work of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, Ukrainian Acting  Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy stated: "I think we now must  turn to economic sanctions against Crimea. The republic is in  debt to Ukraine, up to date owing over 1.5 trillion karbovantsi.  We must turn to sanctions like those used by Russia against  Ukraine. We have enough levers such as, for example, the supply  of water and electricity." Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said the  government was now working on appropriate steps. "I would not  call it an ultimatum. This is a tougher approach to our  relations", added Yukhym Zvyahilskyy.</p>

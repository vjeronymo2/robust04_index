			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Observer: Empty seats at pit head Finding a few bodies to fill the vacant seats on the board of the British Coal Corporation is hardly the most pressing item on Michael Heseltine's agenda. However, it has taken on a sense of urgency following the publication of the Prospects for Coal white paper. The terms of Bert Wheeler, the deputy chairman, and Kevan Hunt, the employee relations director, expire next week and the government hasn't yet replaced Malcolm Edwards, the commercial director who was ousted last year, or Ken Moses, the strategic planning director who died. If it doesn't act soon, the only two British Coal executives left on the corporation board will be Neil Clarke, the chairman, and Michael Butler, the finance director. It is not as if there is any shortage of talent on the executive committee which runs the day-to-day business. Andrew Horsler, in charge of marketing, could easily step into Edwards' old seat and Ray Proctor, who heads British Coal's privatisation team, would fit in with Hezza's commitment to appoint a board member with special executive responsibility for privatisation. It is understood that Neil Clarke has already indicated his willingness to put Proctor up for board membership. It is far from clear whether the delay in making the appointment comes from the government side or from Proctor himself - conscious that his job security may be a little less assured if he were no longer a humble employee.</p>

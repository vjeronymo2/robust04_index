			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. said an internal audit discovered "irregularities" in its  facilities management department, and it will take appropriate personnel  actions to deal with the problems. Chrysler refused to discuss the nature of  the problems, but a source at the auto maker said the investigation reportedly  involved kickbacks to suppliers. The facilities management department, based at  the company's headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., has responsibility for  everything from orders placed with outside suppliers to running the Chrysler  headquarters' cafeteria. The company said the audit was begun after its  internal control systems spotted "some concerns."  </P> <P> Roger Martin  </P></p>

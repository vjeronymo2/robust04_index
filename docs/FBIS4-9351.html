			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Bucharest, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Nikola Sainovic, the  vice-prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on  Friday told the Crans Montana international forum in Bucharest  that the policy of pressures, ultimatums and punishing of  Yugoslavia has been proved ineffective, inhuman and  counter-productive. Such a policy only postpones a just  solution to the lengthy crisis and widens the economic, social  and cultural gap between the Balkans and the other parts of  Europe thus providing a favourable terrain for longterm  destabilization, Sainovic told today's session on the topic  "Prospects for peace in the Balkans."    Sainovic, who heads the Yugoslav delegation in Bucharest,  said that the holding of the conference on the Yugoslav crisis  depends on the fulfillment of three conditions: the equal  treatment of all sides in the conflict, the abandoning of a  policy of pressures and ultimatums, and the lifting of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia. Sainovic recalled that the  international sanctions against Yugoslavia, the first against a  European country, represent the collective punishment of the  entire population of a country and threaten some 60 [?million]  refugees, of which 300,000 are children, and who found sanctuary  in Yugoslavia. An enture nation has been denied the elementary  and civilization rights: the right to health, education,  culture, the freedom of movement and travel, and even the right  to life, Sainovic said.    The imposition of the sanctions against Yugoslavia only,  represents the implementation of a policy of double standards  which has no basis in democratic principles and can only be  explained by the interests and revanschism of certain powers and  states who have always had certain historic aspirations towards  the Balkans, Sainovic said. The Balkans have dramatically been  pushed into the spotlight of world public opinion and have  become the stage for new divisions reflected in the  disintegration of the former yugoslavia and the civil war in its  territory, he said. Internal antagonisms and the in-advance  prepared secessionist forces saw their chance in the changes in  the balance of power in Europe and carried out the violent  secession from an internationally recognized state and the  founder of all major institutions of the international order,  Sainovic said. The existing constitutional order has been  disrupted, the universal principles of the Helsinki CSCE process  violated and the rights of peoples who voted for the continuity  of a joint state ignored, the Yugoslav vice-prime minister said.    At this year's meeting of the Crans Montana forum, attended  by some 1,000 prominent world figures, the Yugoslav delegation  also includes Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and  Serbian Minister Without Protfolio Dragan Tomic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- Skilled specialists from  research institutions and industrial enterprises are taking part  in today's discussion in the State Duma of Russia's  participation in international agreements on the destruction of  chemical weapons. During the discussion they intend to work out  Russia's political course in the quest for economically  advantageous and ecologically acceptable ways of disarmament,  Professor Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry, who took part in  the discussion, told ITAR-TASS.    According to Dr. Kholstov, "the chemical disarmament process  has a ten-year history. Russia is honestly living up to its  commitments." He believes, however, that now there is rivalry  between supporters of two entirely different ways of the  implementation of the disarmament programme. Some experts  believe that toxic agents should be destroyed according to  Western technologies, while others insist on the use of domestic  technologies, which, by the way, bring in substantial profits  and ensure ecological safety.    According to specialists, major countries of the world have  become a scene of competition in the sphere of the production  and sale of super-pure chemical substances, specifically  arsenic, which is the only chemical element that could be used  in heleo- installations, capable of replacing all other energy  sources in the 21st century. American scientists are also  working hard in this promising field. Fearful of competition,  Western business people are trying to bar Russian arsenic,  obtained in the process of the destruction of the toxic agent of  lewisite, from the world market. According to Russian  scientists, chemicals produced in Russia, which have a high  level of purity, can oust products of competitors on the world  market.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY TREE: TRIBUTE TO IMMIGRANT ANCESTORS  </P> <P> The Ellis Island Immigrant Museum, currently under construction and scheduled  to open this fall or early in 1990, will tell the story of the largest human  migration in modern history. Part of this unique exhibit will be the Immigrant  Wall of Honor -- devoted solely to the display of thousands of names of  immigrants who came to America during the past four centuries.  </P> <P> Between 1892 and 1954, 17 million immigrants were processed at Ellis Island.  Today more than 40%, or about 100 million, of all living Americans can trace  their roots to an ancestor who came through Ellis Island. It was there in  various rooms of the main building where these new arrivals -- often fearful of  rejection -- were processed, inspected and eventually granted permission to  enter this country. The Immigrant Museum, located in the 200,000-square-foot  main building where so many of our immigrant ancestors first set foot in  America, will offer visitors a complete look at the total immigrant experience  by use of innovative displays that feature historic artifacts, photographs,  computers and taped oral histories of the immigrants themselves.  </P> <P> The Immigrant Wall of Honor will pay tribute to all our ancestors -- whether  they arrived at Ellis Island from Italy on the Verona in 1909, came on the  Mayflower in 1620 to Massachusetts or from Germany to Galveston, Tex., in the  middle of the 19th Century. By making a $100 tax-deductible contribution to  restore Ellis Island you can have the name you designate permanently placed on  the Wall of Honor. In addition, all names will be entered, together with a  country of origin and the name of the donor, in a computer register located in  the same room.  </P> <P> According to the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, more than 70,000  names have already been submitted -- including the ancestors of First Lady  Barbara Bush and entertainer Neil Diamond. Among the names are such famous  progenitors of many American lines as Miles Standish, of Plymouth Colony, and  William Bradford, governor of Plymouth colony and Pilgrim leader.  </P> <P> Your ancestors' names can be part of this exhibit also. Many have chosen to  honor their parents, great-grandparents or their family name. You may register  any name of your choosing, as it is not necessary that it be the name of your  immigrant ancestor. When honoring a family name, the foundation recommends you  use a first and last name (i.e. the William Johnson Family). If you choose to  honor your mother or a female ancestor, list her first name, maiden name and  married name.  </P> <P> Brochures and registration forms are available from the Statue of Liberty-Ellis  Island Foundation, Inc., 52 Vanderbilt Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017-3808 or you  may call (212) 883-1986 and request the information. Deadline for submitting  your names is Aug. 1. Your contribution will be used to complete the Ellis  Island restoration and for the creation of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum.  The restoration of Ellis Island, which began in 1984, will cost $140 million.  It is the largest restoration project of its kind in American history.  </P> <P> You will receive a certificate, personalized with the name and country of the  individual you choose to honor. There is a minimum contribution of $100 for  each name to be registered but there is no limit to the number of names you may  submit. However, you should list each name and country of origin separately. No  titles, such as Mrs., Dr. or the Rev. will be used.  </P> <P> Ellis Island, located just a few hundred yards from the Statue of Liberty in  New York harbor, has long been the symbol of the gateway to America. However,  whether your ancestors entered via this famous landmark or not, the American  Immigrant Wall of Honor there is an appropriate monument to all of our  ancestors who came to this country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Myra Gormley welcomes genealogical questions for her column, but is unable to  answer individual letters.

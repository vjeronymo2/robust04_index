			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Economics: Focus on the US election THE BIG event this week is the US presidential election tomorrow. Whoever wins will inherit a fragile economy as a number of indicators this week are likely to confirm. October's non-farm payrolls should be relatively free of the temporary distortions that have affected the data since June, including the temporary Federal jobs programme designed to create 300,000 jobs. The forecast is that 25,000 jobs were created in October, mainly in the service sector. This is 'minute by comparison with typical emerging recoveries,' say economists at Greenwell Montagu. This is also an important week for Germany where the economy looks to be heading for a recession. Business confidence has fallen sharply while consumer confidence is at an all-time low. After a surprisingly big bounce back in industrial production in August, data for October is expected to confirm the picture of a declining economy. Sluggish activity will also be reflected in the employment figures. Many economists believe short-time working is being converted increasingly into full unemployment. This will have been exacerbated by the squeeze on export sales resulting from a strong D-Mark. In August west German unemployment rose by 20,000. A repeat performance is expected for September. Other economic highlights follow. The medians of economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a financial information company, appear in brackets.

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Task force for telecom future THE US administration yesterday set up a task force to co-ordinate government and private sector efforts to develop new 'electronic highways' for voice and data communications. Vice-President Al Gore said the task force would review existing federal laws and rules governing the telecommunications market - many of them dating back to the 1930s - and seek to speed the creation of a national information infrastructure. The plan Mr Gore announced yesterday outlines a future of telecommuting, long-distance education, interactive television and widespread access to databases through a network of cable and satellite links. 'It's critically important to the economic future of the United States,' Mr Gore said. The task force is expected to conduct a thorough review of the Communications Act of 1934, which has been modified over the years but casts a dominating shadow over the entire telecommunications field. Designed in the days of a monopoly telephone company, the act is based on a principle of universal access which has been somewhat overtaken by technological developments. Mr George Fisher, the chief executive of Motorola and chairman of the Council on Competitiveness, a business grouping, yesterday welcomed the administration's policy announcement. 'We are especially pleased to see the establishment of an information infrastructure task force and a private-sector advisory committee, both vital to success,' Mr Fisher said. At stake in the discussion on a national information infrastructure are huge economic interests. While almost all of the US is equipped with basic telephones and televisions, the development of satellite broadcasting, cable television and computer bulletin boards and databases has left a higgledy-piggledy web of often incompatible technologies. While visionaries dream of fibre optic cables taking such services to every home, cynics suggest this sort of cabling would cost Dollars 200bn to Dollars 400bn (Pounds 130bn to Pounds 260bn). Compressing digital information on to existing telephone lines, on the other hand, could be much cheaper but would offer far more limited capacity, a maximum of perhaps 144,000 bits per second, compared with several billion bps for fibre optics.</p>

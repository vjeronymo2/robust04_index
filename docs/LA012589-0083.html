			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Yisroel Soloveichik, the 12-year-old boy who was the subject of a legal battle  between his mother and father over his medical care, died of brain cancer at  Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. Yisroel's death came  the same day his parents had returned to court to continue their argument over  treatment of the boy. Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas O'Brien last Thursday  ruled that the boy's mother, Miriam Soloveichik, would make all decisions  regarding her son's medical care. She had sought to avoid further surgery on  the boy in his dying days. Yisroel's father, Moshe Soloveichik, an Orthodox  Jewish rabbi, wanted to do everything possible to keep his son alive.  </P></p>

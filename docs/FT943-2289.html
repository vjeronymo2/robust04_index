			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: General Mills cereals setback General Mills, one of America's biggest producers of breakfast cereals, suffered a 21 per cent slump in cereal sales volume in its first quarter to August 28. The company blamed supply disruptions during the summer, when it discovered it had been using in its cereals oats treated with an unauthorised pesticide. General Mills said the costs, which obliged it to throw away some 50m boxes of cereal, had been included in last year's results. However, cereal production, suspended in June, had not been fully resumed until the second half of July. That had affected both first-quarter sales and profits. The company said that shortage of product had caused its share of the Dollars 9bn US cereal market to fall from 29 per cent to 24 per cent in the quarter. However, trade inventories were now normal and full marketing support had resumed. Sales were ahead of budget, the company said, and a 'resumption of earnings momentum' is expected. General Mills' pesticide problems have compounded its difficulties in the highly competitive US cereal market. In April, the company announced it was slashing the prices of some of its brands, which include Cheerios and Wheaties, by 11 per cent. The decision, reminiscent of Philip Morris's earlier cut in the price of its Marlboro cigarettes, surprised the rest of the market. Net income for the quarter fell 9 per cent from Dollars 1.04 per share to Dollars 0.95, on sales down 5 per cent at Dollars 1.98bn. Excluding the cereals operations, the company said, earnings were up 8 per cent on the year before. Volume of its Betty Crocker products, excluding snacks, had risen 8 per cent. Snack volume was lower due to 'promotional timing', the company said. Restaurant sales were up 6 per cent in the quarter, but operating profit was virtually flat. General Mills' shares rose Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 55 3/4.</p>

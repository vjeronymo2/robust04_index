			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts Sometimes there is no pleasing the gilts market. Last week was packed with good news but prices ended almost unchanged. The better than expected retail price inflation figures received a small round of applause and the US interest rate increase was welcomed. The Bank of England also obliged by saying that, following the good public sector borrowing figures, there would not be a gilts auction this month. But all was drowned out by the Bundesbank's decision to hold its interest rates unchanged. Gilts were particularly vulnerable to the ensuing disappointment because the yield spread compared with German bunds had narrowed significantly this month. It had dropped from around 180 basis points to 150, but ended the week at its recent average of 165. With volumes thin at the moment, the relapse reflected only a handful of trades. The excellent outlook for UK inflation and interest rates would seem to justify a reduction in the spread, though not to the 40 basis points gap that prevailed at the end of January. But the German institutions that were prominent in selling gilts last week are probably more concerned about renewed sterling risk. Concern that German interest rates are at or near their bottom also unnerved bunds and had a knock-on effect on gilts. Meanwhile, the prospect of a surge in supply of bunds hung over the market: the German government has raised only a net 10 per cent of its funding requirement so far this year. The spread against bunds may have to narrow just for gilts to stand still.</p>

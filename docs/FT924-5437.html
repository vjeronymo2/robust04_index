			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Observer: Gaidar-goader If Nikolai Travkin has anything to do with it, the embattled Russian prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, will get his final comeuppance at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet today. Travkin, chairman of the Democratic party of Russia, rushed back for the big event from London after speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, where he claimed westerners were wrong to view Yeltsin and Gaidar as reformers and everyone else as conservatives. Take himself, for instance, Travkin said. Whereas in reality Gaidar had only talked about privatisation and other reforms, he had actually put same into force in the district of Shahovskaya, where he is head of the local administration. There, 100km north of Moscow, trade was totally privatised, and prices were '50 per cent lower than in neighbouring regions'. Hence the solution to Russia's problems was simple: 'We must do on the scale of the country what is being done in Shahovskaya.' Travkin - who is allied in the Civic Union with Russian vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and industrialist leader Arkady Volsky - is confident of commanding the votes today. What is more, he believes that its outcome will prove decisive for next week's Congress of People's Deputies which 'will put a stop to the Gaidar experiment'.</p>

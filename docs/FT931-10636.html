			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Life groups in Japan to gain losses concession JAPAN'S ministry of finance is likely to allow life insurance companies to postpone booking foreign exchange losses on international bond investments for the year ending March 1993. The move is part of the ministry's efforts to support the ailing Tokyo stock market by restricting stock sales by institutional investors. The ministry has already instructed the country's banks not to sell stocks to shore up profits, and now wants to prevent selling by life groups, Japan's leading institutional investors, to cover for their investments in Australian and Canadian bonds. Although life assurers are allowed to value foreign securities at book value, they are required to book losses once the market value of the investments falls more than 15 per cent. Both Canadian and Australian dollars have fallen sharply against the yen this fiscal year, and leading life assurers are believed to be holding some Y300bn (Dollars 2.41bn) in unrealised losses. The ministry is also considering whether to allow life assurers to book unrealised profits on stock holdings to prop up profits. While the move is likely to attract criticism as window dressing of accounts, the finance ministry intends to allow life assurers to include unrealised stock profits to increase their dividend reserves for policy holders. Unrealised profits on stock holdings have served to cover the loss between dividends on policies, which average around 6.5 per cent, and the return on the assurers' investments, which is declining rapidly due to the fall in interest rates. The ministry and life industry are becoming wary over further erosion of the 'buffer' against lower returns through realising latent gains on stocks. Combined unrealised profits on stocks at the largest life assurers totalled some Y6,000bn last September, Y2,000bn lower than the previous year.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 28  June.    Authorities of the Central Bank of Honduras, BCH, decided  yesterday to hold daily dollar auctions beginning 23 June. Bank  spokesman Juan Soto said the auction will operate much like a  stock market. (San Pedro Sula EL TIEMPO in Spanish 22 June 94 p  2)    An official source reported today the BCH sold $2.9 million  during its first U.S. currency auction. The post-auction  exchange rate was 8.67 lempiras per dollar. These auctions are  among the measures recently adopted by Honduran banking  authorities to stop the increasing devaluation of the local  currency. Local bank figures indicate the lempira suffered a  devaluation of at least 13 percent during the first five months  of 1994. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1800 GMT 24 June 94)</p>

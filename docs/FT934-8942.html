			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Dark horse Nextel looks for a winning line - A look at a company making an impact in the US cellular telephone sector NEXTEL Communications, a six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch service company, this week burst on to the scene as a potential new rival to established US cellular telephone services. The little-known company came into the limelight with the acquisition of mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola of the US for Dollars 1.8bn in stock. Formerly called Fleet Call, Nextel is the second largest company, behind Motorola, in the US 'specialised mobile radio' (SMR) market, providing radio dispatch communications services for taxis, delivery vans and the like. Growth in the SMR sector has been constrained by the lack of radio-frequency capacity in most US cities, making it a sleepy backwater in an otherwise booming business. But Nextel has ambitious plans to build its SMR business into a national network, using new digital technology from Motorola which in addition to dispatch services will provide mobile telephone, messaging and paging services. The Motorola deal tops a series of smaller transactions through which Nextel has acquired radio licences and stakes in other companies with licences. These deals have given it access to 45 of the 50 most populous regional markets in the US. Since its formation Nextel has raised Dollars 1.2bn through public and private equity and debt offerings. But the company has paid for most of these acquisitions with stock, taking advantage of a run-up in its share price from Dollars 15 at the beginning of last year to Dollars 47 1/8 yesterday on the New York stock exchange. In another deal announced this week, Nextel reached an agreement with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. NTT will assist Nextel with the design and management of a network connecting all of its SMR sites throughout the US. To cement the deal, NTT will acquire a 1 per cent stake in Nextel, or about 1.5m shares, for Dollars 75m. Motorola, which received a 20 per cent stake in Nextel in exchange for its radio licences, has also provided the company with Dollars 260m in credit facilities for the purchase of Motorola equipment. Other Nextel shareholders include Comcast, a cable television and cellular phone service company, which holds a 12 per cent stake, with rights to boost its holding to 30 per cent; Matsushita Communications, which owns about 5 per cent, and Northern Telecom. Investors have been lured to Nextel by the promise of a high-growth US market for mobile communications services. There are about 13m cellular phone subscribers in the US, and the market is expected to grow 40 per cent this year. Nextel's digital mobile phones will not be compatible with existing analogue cellular services. However, the company believes it can attract customers by offering 'integrated' mobile communications services and improved quality. 'Currently 64 per cent of our dispatch customers also carry a cellular telephone, while 53 per cent carry a pager,' said a Nextel spokesman. For these and the increasing number of business travellers who carry a collection of electronic devices, integrated communications services with a single multi-purpose handset is expected to have a strong appeal. Nextel will also provide integrated billing and says its prices will compare favourably with multiple services purchased separately from competitors. 'No longer will customers be required to carry two or three pieces of hardware, paying two or three bills to two or three different service providers,' said Mr Brian McAuley, president and chief executive of Nextel. Nextel is testing its technology and marketing strategy in Los Angeles where it began a pilot project with about 500 customers this summer. Full scale marketing will begin in January, with Nextel targeting businesses such as estate agents, film and TV producers, caterers and others who typically carry more than one communications device. Eventually, Nextel aims to tap into the growing consumer market for mobile communications. Nextel plans to move quickly. It aims to have a California-wide network in operation early next year, with New York and Chicago to follow by mid-1994 and a nationwide service by the end of 1995. The cost of deploying its services across the US could be more than Dollars 1bn, and it may be years before it turns in a profit, analysts warn. In the year ended March 31, Nextel lost Dollars 9.6m on Dollars 53m revenue. Competition is also mounting, with leaders in the US cellular telephone market, such as GTE and PacTel Cellular, beginning to upgrade to digital technology. Personal Communications Service 'Pocket' telephones are also on the horizon, promising yet another option for mobile communications. So far Nextel is the only company in the US mobile communications market to promise a nationwide service. With the cellular telephone industry locked in a battle over digital technology standards, Nextel may become the dark horse that comes out ahead in the mobile communications race.</p>

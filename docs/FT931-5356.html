			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Bass quits National Lottery race BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, has dropped out of the running for the licence to operate the planned National Lottery. The company had examined in detail prospects for the National Lottery - the lottery bill is now going through parliament - and was expected to be a member of a consortium bidding for the operating licence. After a strategic review of the company's operations, the Bass board decided last week to concentrate on its existing core businesses and disband its lottery team, which had reviewed opportunities. The Bass decision has been taken even though the company is already involved in gambling through Coral, its bookmaking arm. Bass is also a large operator in the bingo market. The company decided that operating the National Lottery would be an entirely separate business needing new skills. 'We think the National Lottery will be a great success but we have decided to concentrate on our existing business,' Bass said yesterday. Bass is still interested in selling lottery tickets in its pubs although it is not clear whether this will be possible under the rules. Many business opportunities will arise out of the National Lottery, particularly for companies that supply other lotteries around the world. These include companies such as GTECH, which supplies computer-based lottery systems in many parts of the world and printers such as Norton Opax of the UK which supplies lottery tickers and instant scratch game cards.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: IBM shares fall sharply on speculation over cost cuts INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' share price dropped sharply yesterday and the company's debt rating came into question amid broad speculation that the large computer group may announce a new round of consolidation and up to 30,000 job cuts as early as next week. Wall Street analysts said that IBM was expected to hold an emergency meeting of its board of directors next week to consider a range of cost-cutting proposals. Some analysts predicted that these might include IBM's first involuntary redundancies and the closure of several facilities. There was rising concern that charges resulting from such cuts could force IBM to cut its dividend. 'We expect IBM to conclude a dismal 1992 with sizeable further charges,' said Mr Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch. 'The charge is going to be substantial enough and involve enough people so that they will not be able to fund the dividend out of cash flow next year,' said Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers. Mr Mandresh also said that IBM may accelerate its plans to separate its operations into autonomous business units. The strong performance of IBM's mid-range computer, computer workstation, service and software businesses were being masked by deteriorating sales of the company's mainframe computers, Mr Mandresh said. 'It appears to us that IBM's board must find a way to accelerate the process by which shareholders can focus in on crisply presented results of the growth segments of the company. We expect sweeping changes at IBM to be announced shortly and we believe that if possible IBM will introduce changes in equity ownership,' Mr Mandresh said. Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency, said that it was considering downgrading IBM's debt from its current triple-A rating. About Dollars 9.6bn of debt is affected. 'The rating action reflects increased uncertainty about the company's ability to restore performance to levels consistent with a Triple-A rating,' S&amp;P said. Previously, S&amp;P indicated that fourth-quarter results and prospects for 1993 would be critical to maintaining the triple-A rating. 'Reports of further write-offs represent an additional concern,' the rating agency said. IBM declined to make any comment. On Wall Street, IBM's shares closed at Dollars 62 5/8 down Dollars 2 3/4 .</p>

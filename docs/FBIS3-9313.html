			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko </F> by Piotr Koscinski in Warsaw; date not given: "A Better  Atmosphere Around Ukraine"]    [Text] [Koscinski] Ukraine has decided to hand over all  of its rockets and nuclear warheads to Russia, where, in line  with the provisions of START I, they are supposed to be  destroyed. Do you think the security guarantees received from  the United States and Russia in return are sufficient for  Ukraine?    [Zlenko] The trilateral Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian declaration,  signed in Moscow on 14 January, defines quite unequivocally the  principles on which our national security is to be based. I am  thinking of such factors as territorial integrity, the  inviolability of borders, and recognition of the sovereignty and  independence of our country, as well as the assurance that no  economic pressure will be exerted on us. I believe that this  can be fully satisfactory for us. We are currently holding  concrete talks with many states to prepare a multilateral  document that will confirm these principles.    [Koscinski] It is generally believed that the West  (especially the United States), in its relations with the states  of Central and East Europe, is concerned only with Russia and  that only Russia is of any real importance. What is your  evaluation of the West's attitude toward Ukraine?    [Zlenko] I believe that the contacts between the Ukrainian  president and his U.S., the results of the recent visit by  President Leonid Kravchuk to Washington, and the signature of  the aforementioned trilateral agreement favorably affect Western  states, which are changing their attitude toward Ukraine. At  any rate, our country is no longer perceived as a nuclear  monster that may threaten others. For example, an agreement on  partnership with the European Union [EU] is expected to be  signed (today--editor's note); this proves that the atmosphere  around Ukraine is favorable. We are the first country in CIS to  sign such an agreement. A positive decision by the EU  represents a positive decision by its 12 member states. There  are also other examples that show that the political atmosphere  is changing to the advantage of Ukraine.    [Koscinski] Ukraine proposes establishing a regional  security zone in Central and East Europe. In the meantime,  Belarus, which is expected to sign an agreement on monetary  union with Russia, will enter the sphere of even greater  political influence from Moscow. How, then, do you envision the  future of the proposed zone?    [Zlenko] Belarus will decide for itself whether or not to  join that zone. I can speak only about Ukraine. We are very  interested in creating a zone of stability and security in  Central and East Europe. Fundamental for us are the proposals  presented by President Kravchuk. We believe that Poland and  Ukraine, large countries located in the same region, should very  soon discuss the principles of both sides' security. We should  do this bearing in mind the Pact on Stability, proposed by the  EU, to lead to the establishment of an all-European security  system.</p>

A candidate may receive and use matching funds for these purposes either after he or she has notified the Commission in writing of his or her withdrawal from the campaign for nomination or after the date of the party's nominating convention, if he or she has not withdrawn before the convention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the candidate has become ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b),he or she may only receive matching funds to defray costs incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility, for goods and services to be received before the date of ineligibility and for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the candidate's date of ineligibility, until the candidate is eligible to receive winding down costs under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in 11 CFR 9035.1, 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For candidates who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility, this paragraph shall not apply to expenses incurred during the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Taxes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses.

Any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility are not qualified campaign expenses. In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses. For purposes of this paragraph, it is presumed that capital assets delivered within 60 days of the first day of the candidate's party's national nominating convention are general election assets; and that a local campaign office that remains open more than 30 days after a state's primary election or the close of any other nomination process in that state is operating in support of the general election campaign. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Negligent Handling of Public Funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The cost of items that are lost or misplaced due to negligence shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. Factors in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned by the committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

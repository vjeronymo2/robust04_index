			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOM MARTIN PROVIDES INTERESTING OPENING ACT  </P> <P> Opening the show for Paul Rodriguez was Tom Martin, an Orange County comic with  a soft style and easy flow.  </P> <P> Here are some examples of why he is worth catching:  </P> <P> He is out to dinner with his family and orders a grilled cheese sandwich, only  to be admonished by his mother and told to get something he can't get at home.  In that case, "I'll have some understanding and compassion, please."  </P> <P> Talking about how messy he and his college roommate were, he says: "The  landlord asked us to wipe our feet before going outside."

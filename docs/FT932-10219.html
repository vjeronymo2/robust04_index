			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ossory talks may lead to restructure OSSORY Estates, the property group, is negotiating with its 30 banks for a new medium term loan agreement embracing all of its Pounds 100m of debt, and that could lead to a capital reconstruction and the raising of fresh capital. That would take the business forward and back to profitability, the directors claimed. Several banks are being asked to convert non-performing debt into equity. Since the breaches of bank covenants arose last September the company has ensured no bank has pursued its security. Part of the reconstruction would include creditors in the Skelmersdale concourse project converting their debt into equity. Ossory lost the High Court action regarding the fire there, and creditors for Pounds 4m will not be reimbursed by the insurers but become a direct liability of the group. In the half year ended December 31 1992 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.4m, against a profit of Pounds 1.52m. At the operating level, the group achieved a substantial reduction in overheads and tackled several inherent management problems. However, Pounds 8.54m has been provided against property values and Pounds 5m for extraordinary interest costs to cover converting the fixed rate preference shares into a variable rate instrument. But that was potentially recoverable. Losses per share were 21.82p (0.63p). In the year 1991-92 the group wrote Pounds 42.7m off investments and properties, and finished with a loss of Pounds 41.6m.</p>

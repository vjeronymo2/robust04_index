			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- In the first quarter of 1994, the number of  resettlers, most of whom come from Russia, has increased over  the previous years. Speaking in Bonn on Friday [1 April], Horst  Waffenschmidt, head of the Federal Government's agency for  resettlers, said that during the first three months of 1994,  49,254 resettlers have come to the FRG, 47,500 of whom are  Germans from Russia. Over the same period of 1993, the total  number was 44,703, while in the first quarter of 1992 it was  47,702.    In March, authorities registered 16,495 resettlers, which  was  2,563 more than in February (13,932). Waffenschmidt emphasized,  however, that the number of applicants wanting to resettle in  Germany has gone down by more than 15,000 (from 72,293 in the  first quarter of 1993 to 57,095 at the moment). Also, the  number of people of German origin moving from Central Asia to  German areas in western Siberia is higher than the number of  people moving to Germany from there. In the former Soviet  republics in Central Asia, there is "growing insecurity" among  the Germans still living there, Waffenschmidt said.</p>

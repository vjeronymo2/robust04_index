			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / DuPont opens in Vietnam US chemicals company DuPont opened an office in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday and said Vietnam would be a focal point for its efforts to quadruple sales in the region by the turn of the century, Reuter reports from Hanoi. It was one of the first US companies to open shop since President Bill Clinton lifted a 30-year economic embargo against Vietnam on February 3. Mr David Pang, vice-president Asia Pacific, said DuPont saw the region as its most significant growth area and intended to develop manufacturing, marketing and technical operations and form strategic alliances. It was looking to quadruple its sales in the region to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) by 2000 and move it from 7 to 20 per cent of global sales, he said.</p>

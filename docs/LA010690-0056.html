			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A fire, begun by a 4-year-old boy playing with a lighter, caused $55,000 in  damages to a Clairemont home Thursday afternoon, San Diego firefighters said.  </P> <P> The boy, who was not injured, had been playing with a lighter in a closet and,  firefighters speculate, probably set some clothes afire.  </P> <P> It took 20 firefighters 20 minutes to knock down the blaze in the two-story  house on Longford Street. The second floor sustained most of the damage,  $45,000 of which was structural and $10,000 to the contents of the house.  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Management: Fresh beginning beyond the Elbe - Judy Dempsey examines the methods used by three companies investing in eastern Germany 'By the time the Americans, British and French arrived (in Berlin in July 1945), more than 90 per cent of Berlin's heavy industry had been spirited away (to Russia). Ironically, this eventually worked in favour of west Berlin's industries; when they came to start up again, they all had to be re-equipped with modern, brand-new machinery.'  -Berlin: The Biography of a City, by Anthony Read and David Fisher. Nearly 50 years later, eastern Germany is going through a similar experience. But, in place of the devastation of war, investors face an uncompetitive and often obsolete, industrial base, whose markets were dependent on eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The chemicals group BASF, the optical business Jenoptik, and the electronics company Siemens have risen to this awesome management challenge. All have been attracted by generous investment grants or subsidies from the eastern German states, all have parent companies willing to invest in the long term, and all found a skilled and adaptable work force in eastern Germany. But, despite these similarities, the three companies have gone about their investments in very different ways. BASF bought a plant direct from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and is investing DM1.3bn (Pounds 520m) in the enterprise at Schwarz-heide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg. Jenoptik, once part of the Carl Zeiss optical enterprise, and still under the state of Thuringia, has razed all the old buildings at Jena in the south of the old east Germany and is starting afresh with a DM3.6bn modernisation programme. Meanwhile, Siemens bought a greenfield site last December and this week began work on its new plant, part of what will ultimately be a DM2.7bn investment. BASF's advantage was that the old Kombinat SYS chemicals plant was in relatively good condition and had a sound infrastructure. 'It has direct links to a natural gas network, so energy costs are low; it has an excellent sewage plant - one of the few modern ones in the former GDR; and it is located on the main motorway, less than one and a half hours from Berlin,' says Hans-Hermann Dehmel, BASF's chairman in Schwarzheide. BASF was also attracted by a looser regulatory climate and faster decision-making structure than in the west of the country. Furthermore, it acquired more capacity. 'It is very difficult to obtain this kind of space - 240ha - in western Germany, let alone acquiring the planning permission and regulations,' Dehmel explained. The government of Brandenburg granted planning permission within two months. 'It would normally have taken about 18 months in west Germany,' says Marc Vogel, BASF's spokesman at Schwarzheide. By early this year, BASF had already invested DM800m, of which DM200m was spent installing several new production lines. These included a water-borne coatings line, a non-solvent product spread over paint used primarily by the car industry. Nearly four years since acquiring Schwarzheide, Dehmel reflects on the decision to invest in eastern Germany. 'I think productivity is still too low,' he says. On some lines productivity is about 60 per cent of west German levels, partly because of the recession, and also because BASF is committed to employing 2,150 full-time staff, 300 apprentices and 1,000 subcontractors. Officials at the plant reckon they need just 2,150. At Jena, before 1989, 30,000 people worked in the Carl Zeiss plant, which had run up losses of more than DM1bn. Today, the Jenoptik workforce has been cut to 1,250 employees after a programme of early retirement, redundancy payments, and financial support for would-be small entrepreneurs. In the past two years Uwe Reinert, a consultant from Hanover and now manager of Jenoptik, has transformed the company from an outdated defence-based enterprise to one based on four production lines. These include a microfabrication division, providing high-performance equipment for microsystems engineering and semiconductor fabrication; medical engineering; environmental engineering; and automation engineering, which provides optical equipment for quality control and inspection. Reinert then set about providing self-contained and small micro-chip units to companies that do not have their own chip production facilities. Siemens, meanwhile, needed no introduction to eastern Germany. Since unification, it has set up 11 production plants and service facilities, employing more than 16,000 people throughout the five eastern states. But it wanted production and research under one roof. Eastern Germany's capacity and reservoir of skilled electronic engineers made it a suitable location. Last December the company announced its decision to invest DM2.4bn in building a microchip factory in Dresden on a greenfield site. Scheduled to be on line by 1996, it will manufacture 64-megabit and 256-megabit memory chips. Volkhart Matthaeus, finance director of Siemens' semiconductor group, says there was a need to establish a core development centre in Germany itself. 'Through this operation in Dresden, we will be able to carry out joint research projects (with other companies), some of which will be funded by the German government,' he explains. Siemens could have gone to eastern Europe, or south-east Asia, where labour costs are cheaper. But Matthaeus says the company chose the eastern German route for several reasons. 'In eastern Europe, you need investment partners, regional funding, and an environment in which your partners are prepared to invest with you. These conditions, at least for us, do not exist,' he explains. That view is shared by BASF and Jenoptik. As for south-east Asia, there are some logistical disadvantages. 'Any product re-imported by us into the European Union incurs a 14 per cent tax. That's a significant amount. Also, the computer industry costs money. You can find cheaper labour in the region but you have to build an infrastructure in a quality-minded environment,' he adds.</p>

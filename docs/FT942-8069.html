			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Indonesian trial sounds alarms: A bank case's political overtones When Mr Eddy Tansil, an Indonesian entrepreneur, went on trial last week on charges of corruption, alarm bells rang throughout the country's close-knit establishment. The trial, one of the biggest alleged corruption scandals since Indonesia's independence, could affect the reputation of many high-ranking government officials. It could also signal the beginning of tighter supervision of Indonesia's state-owned banks. Mr Tansil, owner of Golden Key, a retail and manufacturing group, received a Dollars 430m loan in 1992 from Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), the government's development bank, supposedly to finance a petrochemical project in West Java. The prosecution alleges that the loan was never serviced and that the funds were partly diverted to Hong Kong. Bapindo, though it continues to do business, is now technically bankrupt and is expected to be rescued by the government. It had been an open secret that Indonesian state banks were riddled with bad debts brought about by collusion between lenders and politically well connected borrowers. According to the government, 21.2 per cent of their loans were bad or doubtful at the end of last year, compared with 17.4 per cent a year before and only 6 per cent in 1990. These figures, however, came from the state banks themselves and the situation could be a lot worse, bankers say. 'We might well see similar cases being unearthed in the near future,' said a Jakarta-based banker. The case has attracted public attention. One disappointed Indonesian wrote in a local daily newspaper: 'I hope that the government punishes the criminals and upholds justice because if they fail it means they are no better than criminals themselves.' The trials of Mr Tansil and Mr Maman Suparman, a former deputy branch manager at Bapindo, began last week in packed court rooms amid yells and catcalls from angry mobs. Both were charged with corruption and violation of banking laws. Prosecutors have been trying to establish during a four- month investigation how Mr Tansil, who had little capital to back him up and had a history of unsuccessful ventures in the motorcycle assembly and brewing businesses, could have qualified for a Dollars 430m loan from Bapindo without collateral. The answer could lie with Mr Sudomo, former minister in charge of political and security affairs and now a government adviser, and Mr J B Sumarlin, the former finance minister and now chairman of the country's audit agency. Mr Sudomo has admitted that he authorised the Bapindo loan for Mr Tansil, and Mr Sumarlin is alleged by the prosecution to have overseen the loan. Both are due to give evidence at Mr Tansil's trial, although they may be allowed merely to have their testimony read out in court. Their participation may help indicate how immune from investigation the state's power brokers are in the Bapindo affair and how serious the government is about putting a halt to illegal collusion between lenders and borrowers. In the central Javanese town of Bandung, students tussled with police as they demanded that Mr Sudomo and Mr Sumarlin stand trial for their role in approving the loan. Mr Tansil and Mr Suparman face a maximum penalty of life sentences in jail under anti-corruption laws. The prosecution says that Mr Tansil obstructed the government's efforts to develop the economy by his abuse of the loan from Bapindo. Mr Tansil's lawyers have said that their client did not receive demands or warnings from the bank about servicing the loan, and that the alleged deviations from legal banking practices were made with the blessing of Bapindo executives. 'What makes the Bapindo case interesting is not so much that it happened but that it was leaked to the public,' said a Jakarta-based diplomat. The case hints at political wrangling taking place among the ruling elite. Some bankers argue that details of the loan were leaked as part of an attempt to discredit Jakarta's technocrats, of which Mr Sumarlin was one. Goverment technocrats are channelling billions of dollars into developing heavy industry, although some economists say this path of industrialisation offers little comparative advantage. Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, finance minister, told the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in France this month that Indonesian banks faced difficulties and that the government would further strengthen banking regulation. The outcome of the Bapindo case may show the extent of the government's determination to carry out this promise.</p>

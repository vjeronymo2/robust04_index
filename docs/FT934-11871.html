			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / SmithKline to move 1,000 in shake-up SMITHKLINE Beecham, the second-biggest drug company in Britain, is to spend more than Pounds 200m consolidating its research and development centres. The company said yesterday that no jobs would be lost but 1,000 people would be asked to relocate. SmithKline is buying the 40-acre site of BP's maritime centre in Harlow, Essex, which is next to one of its existing research centres. This will enable it to stop research at four of its seven centres, at Brockham Park, Great Burgh and Reigate, Surrey, and at Worthing, Sussex. The re-search headquarters will move from Great Burgh to Harlow. The company said: 'There will be significant cost savings through reduction in operating costs by maintaining fewer sites.' It said that more people on a single site would 'improve interactions and efficiency'. The acquisition also 'provides enough land to eventually consolidate all UK pharmaceutical R&amp;D in one location, if desired'. The Pounds 200m capital cost of the scheme, and the costs of relocation, have already been accounted for by the company in provisions for the restructuring of its research side. Staff will be offered relocation assistance. The company conceded that some might be offered redundancy, but that 'the object is not to reduce numbers'.</p>

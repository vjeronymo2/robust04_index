			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Continental expecting healthy profit CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday predicted that it would make a 'significant profit' for the 1992 year. Continental also said that profits for the first nine months of this year were considerably ahead of the same period last year, despite a noticeable slowdown in the third quarter. But the company released no actual profit figures. In the first nine months of the year, group sales climbed by 3.9 per cent to DM7.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn), the company said yesterday. Sales were on course to reach DM9.7bn for the 12 months, against DM9.38bn last year. Growth in turnover would have been higher but for currency movements and the deterioration in the world economy, the Hanover-based company said. The group had been expecting to achieve turnover of DM10bn this year. Last year, the group made net losses of DM128.2m, which was turned round to a profit of DM118m in the first six months of the current year. Yesterday's letter to shareholders from the company's management board said that third-quarter results were not up to the level achieved in the first half because of the economic downturn in Germany and abroad. Despite the slowdown, Continental said it foresaw no serious business difficulties in the rest of the year, although the business environment would become steadily more difficult in 1993. This would slow down the group's efforts to increase profitability. It said that General Tire, its loss-making subsidiary in the US, had managed to halve its losses during the first nine months, as planned. Sales had held up at the level of the previous year, at Dollars 1bn in local currency terms, although this represented a fall of 8 per cent to DM1.58bn in D-Mark terms. General Tire was likely to benefit from the anticipated revival of the US economy and was on course to make a profit next year, Continental said. The group said it would use every opportunity to compensate for an anticipated downturn in sales to domestic vehicle manufacturers by stepping up its export business and sales of replacement tyres.</p>

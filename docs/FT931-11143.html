			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Cab supplier lays off 80 workers ABOUT 80 employees who usually make cabs for Leyland-Daf trucks were laid off yesterday by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based automotive components subsidiary of Mayflower Corporation. In lay-off terms, they were the first significant casualties within the components supply industry of the financial crisis that has taken Leyland-Daf into administrative receivership. But yesterday it was becoming apparent that the leading players in the truck components industry would survive even a total collapse of Leyland-Daf. The 80 laid off at Motor Panels represents less than 10 per cent of the plant's workforce. Mr Terry Whitmore, chief executive of Mayflower's automotive products group, said last night: 'We have already taken the necessary steps to minimise our exposure to Leyland-Daf's problems. We also find it pretty difficult to believe that a way forward won't in the end be found for the company. 'But if they do stop trading, there's 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the market that will still be there - and we will do our best to get that substitute business.' Cummins Engine, the US-owned engine manufacturer that has supplied the diesel engines for a number of Leyland-Daf's models also said its manufacturing operations in the UK would not be undermined by even a total loss of the business. Land Rover, a leading supplier to Leyland-Daf, could lose orders for about 6,000 engines a year installed in Leyland-Daf vans. But it said last night this represented less than 10 per cent of Land Rover's engines output. Like many other dealers, Mr Andrew Milne, managing director of Scotia Leyland-Daf in Scotland said he had received a high level of customer support in recent days - no customers had cancelled orders and the business was continuing to service vans and trucks as usual. 'People have been buying Leyland-Daf for years and years. The original customers are like a club,' he said. Nevertheless, with allegations circling that the banks had pulled the plug on the company even before Monday's announcement, many dealers expressed anger at the government's handling of the events. 'The bank was already bouncing the cheques on Friday - one of ours was bounced,' said a dealer, who refused to be named. He believes that all 177 of the jobs at his factory were now at risk. 'We had no support from the British banks or the government. It just typifies the sickness in British industry,' he added bitterly.</p>

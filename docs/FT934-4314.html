			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Paper war lifts Sinn Fein image If Sinn Fein had claimed three weeks ago that it had been briefed on sensitive cabinet discussions and last year's failed three-stranded talks by a British government representative, the suggestion would have been widely ridiculed. But when the allegation was made by senior figures in the IRA's political wing on Thursday it had enough credibility to be carried prominently by the British and Irish press - and to exacerbate tension between the two governments on the eve of yesterday's meeting between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. One Irish minister - Mr Noel Dempsey - even suggested that the allegation would influence the agenda of the meeting as London would need to clear the air before substantive issues were discussed. 'The initial difficulty will be the revelations and allegations that have been made,' said Mr Dempsey, speaking with the full approval of the Irish government. 'They have to be got out of the way . . . before substantial negotiations can continue.' Sinn Fein's enhanced credibility is the direct result of its successes in the 'document war' that it has been waging with London. Time and again the British government's version of events has been shown up as less accurate than the Republican version. Put bluntly, London is on the defensive. This was underlined yesterday when officials would not be drawn on Sinn Fein's latest claims. Since admitting at the start of this week that it had been in prolonged contact with Republican leaders the British government has also had to own up to errors in the record it published of the messages the two sides exchanged. By conceding 11 mistakes in one key paper the government has accepted that Sinn Fein's version of the document was accurate in virtually every detail. Sinn Fein's propaganda coup is all the more noteworthy since its own record of reliability is not untarnished. For example, it has now belatedly made clear that its 11-paragraph response to the British conditions was not passed on until July - as the government stated - rather than April as was implied by Sinn Fein documents. Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein chief of staff, said on Thursday that this response was 'prepared' in April but not 'lodged with the contact to be passed to the British' until July. In addition, fresh documents released by Sinn Fein on Thursday appear to modify its position over a panicky message received by the government on November 2, shortly after the Greysteel shootings, warning that the country 'could be at the point of no return'. Having denied the message Sinn Fein now appears to acknowledge that a communication was issued, but says it was 'without our authority or knowledge'. A newspaper interview with Mr McGuinness published in September provides a further caution against automatically treating Sinn Fein's public statements with credulity. Asked whether there had been feelers from the government to Sinn Fein, Mr McGuinness is reported to have replied: 'No, there haven't been.'</p>

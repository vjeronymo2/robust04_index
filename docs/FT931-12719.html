			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton inherits thick file of trade problems - Some of the main issues confronting the new administration THE US is expected today to levy steep tariffs on allegedly dumped steel products, the first action on an agenda jammed with potential trade conflicts which now awaits the attention of the Clinton administration. If trade history repeats itself, the tariffs, postponed from yesterday, will result in a series of bilateral 'suspension agreements' and a new round of 'voluntary' steel quotas - with price floors as a new twist. They may also provoke new enthusiasm for a multilateral agreement to limit government subsidies and lower trade barriers to steel around the world. As part of a US administration which talks of providing its own subsidies to assist the development of new technologies, Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, may find it much less difficult to wrap up agreement than did his more ideological predecessors. The same may not be true for the Uruguay Round talks. Evidently briefed by some of the American farm groups, who are dissatisfied with the US-EC farm deal, Mr Kantor indicated 'concern' about the much-trumpeted Blair House deal. That deal was supposed to sweep away obstacles to successful conclusion of the Round. It is widely believed that agreement has been reached to reopen the draft Uruguay Round text prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), for changes necessary to get a deal through Congress. The US has insisted on amendments to the texts dealing with intellectual property, anti-dumping, subsidies, standards, technical barriers to trade, and the proposed multilateral trading organisation. Some progress has been made in talks on lowering tariffs on manufactured goods, at which the US has reportedly agreed to cut its tariff 'spikes' in exchange for negotiations to reduce several tariffs to zero (ie on paper, wood products and nonferrous metals). US officials believe a deal cannot be achieved before March 2, the deadline for informing Congress that the administration intends to proceed towards a Gatt deal. However, there have been talks between trade officials and Congress about extending the deadline (for the second and last time) by between one and six months. Mr Kantor has offered to meet the Senate finance committee over the EC utilities directive, which gives advantages to local companies in bidding for government procurement contracts for telecommunications and heavy electrical equipment. He may soon ask industry to suggest a sanctions list totalling about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 649m). Then he may turn his attention to the US-Japan semiconductor agreement, which set as its goal a 20 per cent Japanese market opening to foreign semiconductors by the end of 1992. The final figures will not be available until March, but initial findings suggest that Japanese companies have fallen 4 percentage points short on the pact. Mr Kantor told the finance committee that by law he is probably free to impose sanctions, but he also stressed that the 20 per cent was a goal, or 'expectation', rather than a commitment. The US motor industry has already put in its bid for favours from the Clinton administration. It would like tighter 'voluntary' restraints on Japanese imports and even restrictions on the number of vehicles produced in the US by Japanese subsidiaries. The latter request is unlikely to win support, but the administration may agree to reclassify Japanese minivans as trucks rather than cars, which would raise their tariff levels from 2.5 per cent to 25 per cent. The toughest decisions have already been taken over the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Clinton has said he must have side agreements covering labour standards as well as the environment and import surges. Without these Nafta will never get through Congress. The administration must still decide how far it can push Mexico on internal standards without interfering with its national sovereignty, thus setting a precedent it may later regret. Mr Kantor will soon have to advise the president on whether to continue the generalised system of preferences, which extends duty-free access to the US for products from developing countries. It is unlikely that a Democratic president - no matter how centrist - would slash a programme meant to help poorer countries. But this Democratic president is under pressure to save the Dollars 500m a year the programme costs the US Treasury. President Clinton has said he wants to provide more help to the republics of the former Soviet Union. His predecessor had been able to have it both ways. He gave grain credits to Russia and called them 'aid,' but when Moscow defaulted on repayments, the 'aid' was firmly withdrawn. The new administration must decide whether to discard the pretence that the republics can repay anytime soon and make a gift of the surplus grain, which in any case is fast piling up in storage bins and depressing US prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTENDERS FOR CLINTON'S TRADE AGENDA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Enforcement of US-Japan semi-conductor agreement  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to pressure from the US auto lobby for action against   Japanese imports and Japanese production in the US  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Renegotiation of Uruguary Round draft agreement on:           intellectual property           anti-dumping           subsidies           standards           technical barriers           multilateral trading           organisation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nafta:   side agreements on:           labour           environment           import surges   decision on how far to push Mexico on internal standards  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Multilateral trade agreement on steel  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retaliatory action on the EC utitities directive  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Review of the Generalised System of Preferences  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade policy towards the former Soviet republics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

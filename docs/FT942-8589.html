			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Johannesburg posted its third consecutive decline as the market continued to correct from recent highs. This week's lethargic performance has been attributed to gold price weakness, light foreign and local selling and nervousness about future economic policy. The overall index fell 69 to 5,388, industrials ended 62 lower at 6,571 after Tuesday's 74-point drop, and golds also lost 62 to 1,773. De Beers was R1.25 softer at R107.75, Anglos shed R4.50 to R228 and Gold Fields dipped R3 to R103. But rand hedges Richemont and Lonrho both posted gains, rising 15 cents and 22 cents to R40.65 and R10.37 respectively.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (4): The clean-up continues - One of the dirtiest rivers in Europe NOW THAT Europe stretches to the Urals, it may well be that more filthy rivers can be found, but the Mersey remains the UK's dirtiest. Dr James Leeming, regional environment quality manager of the National Rivers Authority, says the Mersey basin contains 20 per cent of Britain's most polluted water courses. Dr Leeming estimates that one third of the total length of the basin's waterways are too polluted to support a large population of fish; the water can be used for industry but not for drinking. Half as many are worse, supporting only primitive life such as bloodworms. This sorry state arose because the Mersey basin's catchment area was one of the cradles of the industrial revolution. For more than 100 years, all kinds of industries abused and misused the waterways. Moreover, the basin is huge, covering an area of 5,000 sq km, with 1,700 km of waterways. It also contains 5m people and their domestic sewerage has been and remains the worst problem. Sewers, pipes and other facilities were built long ago and are now overstretched. Storm overflows are inadequate, often dumping domestic effluent straight into the Mersey. The Mersey Basin Campaign - a nationally co-ordinated effort to clean things up - is partly funded by the Department of the Environment and now involves the National Rivers Authority, North West Water, the privatised authority, local authorities and pressure and interest groups. About Pounds 4bn will be spent by 2010 in cleaning up and making onshore improvements. The standards, set in 1983, aim for 10 per cent dissolved oxygen in the water, and the end of fouling of the foreshore. This means making the water fit for drinking after advanced treatment. Coarse fish such as roach and chub could live in it. There are slightly different criteria for estuaries, because of the salt water, but the goal for the Mersey estuary is to achieve equivalent improvements to the fresh water feeding it. Mr Peter Walton, head of the Mersey Campaign Unit, says: 'Given the area's large population and industry, it is probably unrealistic to expect that we can get the rivers up to a much higher standard.' It was only with the privatisation of the public sector water utility into North West Water and the establishment of the National Rivers Authority as its regulatory body that the scale of the problem was fully realised, although the need for better river sewerage had long been understood. As recently as last year largely untreated sewage was being put into the lower river and the estuary - right in the middle of Merseyside or along its coasts. There were 26 outfalls on the Liverpool side and 18 on the Cheshire and Wirral banks, many without even the basic screening provided by grids. Dr Leeming says: 'The biggest source of polluting matter today is from discharges under the control of North West Water. These contains both domestic and trade waste going through their sewers.' North West Water is investing heavily to remedy the situation. At Sandon Dock in Liverpool, a sewage treatment works should make a big difference to Merseyside. This was opened last September on a 20-acre site in the port and cost Pounds 50m to build. A further Pounds 150m is being spent on building interceptors to the outfalls. Six outfalls have so far been linked to the Sandon Dock works. Mr Tony Hampson, general manager, estimates these now carry about 45 per cent of all the discharges formerly emptying directly into the Mersey. Mr John Meacher, Sandon's project manager, says the other outfalls should all be linked up by around 1995. Interim screening has been introduced on the Wirral side and another plant is planned. By the end of the decade there should therefore be primary treatment for all discharges into the Mersey. Whether this will make the Mersey clean enough for the European Commission, however, is another matter. Last year, the goalposts were moved. Anyone who visits Sandon Dock will see that water does not emerge crystal clear. The EC's latest Urban Waste Water Treatment directive demands secondary measures to eliminate suspended colloids, small organic mixtures which do not settle out during primary treatment. On top of this, another EC directive means that North West Water will not be able to deposit the sludge left over from the settlement process in the Irish Sea, as it has so far. It will either have to build incinerators or use landfill to dispose of it, adding to costs. The company has already leased a new 30-acre site adjacent to Sandon Dock. North West Water says it is currently investing Pounds 500m a year, half this on water treatment and half on renewal of assets, such as old iron pipes. The company will have to go on investing at least these amounts to the end of the decade. 'Anyone who feels we are making excessive profits now or raising our prices too much ought to realise the size of the investment needed,' the company says. Charges went up 5 percentage points above inflation this year. The National Rivers Authority, however, is satisfied. 'North West Water is making all the investment needed to meet standards. We have some qualms about the time-scale. We wish they would speed their programme up. It could be 2000 before everything is in place.' But at least by then people should be able to bathe off Crosby beach without feeling they need disinfecting afterwards.</p>

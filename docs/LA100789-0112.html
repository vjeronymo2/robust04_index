			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> PLANTINGS THRIVE IN WATER-WISE PLOTS  </P> <P> Robert Cornell flinches when he hears the term "water-conserving garden."  </P> <P> "People think it means dry and dreary," or a lot of extra work for the  homeowner, "but I want to dispel that," he says. "It's not so.  </P> <P> "The entire landscape doesn't have to be (drought tolerant)," he continues,  "just use water sensibly. That's why I like to call it water wise (instead of  water conserving); you use it appropriately in a limited area."  </P> <P> Cornell is a member of the state Green Industry Advisory Council on Water  Issues, president of the L.A./San Gabriel chapter of California Landscape  Contractors Assn., president of his own landscaping firm. He will speak next  Saturday at the fifth annual Ecological Landscaping Symposium, sponsored by  Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont.  </P> <P> "I've been involved in water conservation for 10 years," Cornell says. "It used  to be very difficult to get (drought-tolerant) plant material, now there's more  variety and people are more open to the idea, especially after three  consecutive years of drought. You can have a beautiful and diverse garden and  still save water."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Styles of Gardens  </P> <P> Cornell is one of six experts in the field who will speak on "Water-Wise  Gardens, California Style." For his part, he will demonstrate six styles of  gardens (though there are many more, he says) from an English-cottage style  (utilizing coral bells, Mexican sage and rock rose) to a seaside style  (including sea lavender, ice plant and echium), and "only one of the gardens  centers on cactus," he says.  </P> <P> The purpose of the symposium, which covers everything from garden design to  alternative grasses to sophisticated irrigation systems, is to educate the  public because they are "part of the problem," Cornell says.  </P> <P> "Change is being forced because of the (water crisis) situation," Cornell says.  But it will "take a change in aesthetics. Nurserymen and landscape contractors  are still feeling their way. It won't happen overnight, it's a gradual  process."  </P> <P> Determined to assist in that process is Melanie Baer, manager of the Theodore  Payne Foundation for Wildflowers and Native Plants in Sun Valley, who will talk  about utilizing colorful plants that naturally adapt to the state's diverse  climates and are found right in our own back yards -- the California natives.  </P> <P> "The main point I'd like to get across is how simple it is," Baer says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Micro Climates  </P> <P> One thing a gardener should be familiar with before planting, Baer says, is the  micro climates in the landscape. Sections of the yard will differ, she says, in  temperature, soil consistency and amount of moisture.  </P> <P> "Dealing with natives involves a sensitivity to environmental factors and a  knowledge of their origins," Baer explains. "With any plant, not just  California natives, you have to find the right place for the plant. Every time  you buy a plant you should know this information. If you go home with a fern,  the nursery person should be able to tell you where the plant came from and how  to care for it."  </P> <P> In her talk on incorporating California natives into the landscape, Baer will  offer ideas on colorful natives that require little care.  </P> <P> "I want to demystify native plants," she says. "A lot of us have such busy  schedules we don't have time to spend in the garden. But if you find the right  plant for the right place, once you get it in the ground it really requires low  maintenance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Native Plants  </P> <P> Baer also will suggest some native plants, such as the California lilac. "It's  a beautiful blue flowering shrub. You see it all over the world," she says,  but, surprisingly, it hasn't caught on too well with California gardeners.  </P> <P> Also scheduled to speak at the symposium: Joe Y.T. Hung, chairman of Cal Poly  Pomona's Agricultural Engineering Department, who will discuss irrigation  systems -- "where you can or can't put a drip system, for example," he says;  Michael MacCaskey, an editor for Sunset magazine, will produce a gardening  update on water awareness; Ron Pecoff, landscape contractor and horticultural  consultant to corporations and government agencies, plans to discuss exotic yet  water-wise designs, and Victor Gibeault, environmental horticulturist at UC  Riverside and editor of California Turfgrass Culture, will discuss  state-of-the-art developments in water conserving and low-maintenance grasses.  </P> <P> Armed with all this information, symposium graduates can return to Rancho Santa  Ana Nov. 4 for the Native Plant Sale, from 8 a.m.-2 p.m. in the garden's  parking lot.  </P> <P>  The symposium will be held from 8:30 a.m.-4 p.m. in the Mudd Theater,  Claremont School of Theology, at Foothill Boulevard and College Avenue,  Claremont. Registration is $61 (includes box lunch, refreshments, materials and  parking). Call (714) 625-8767 or (714) 626-1917.  </P> <P> </P></p>

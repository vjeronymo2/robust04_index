			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Addison buys UK side of AGB ADDISON, the market research group, has reached preliminary agreement with the administrators to buy most of the UK interests of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private empire. Mr Murdoch McKillop, the administrator from Arthur Andersen has also reached conditional agreement with a management consortium to buy the European subsidiaries of AGB. The UK deal would take Addison, which trades under the name Taylor Nelson, from sixth position in the UK market research industry to top position with a combined annual turnover of about Pounds 60m. Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive of Addison, which specialises in market research in food and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, said yesterday: 'It's a good company with good products and good people.' Addison is expected to have a rights issue and to try to attract new institutional shareholders. At yesterday's suspension price of 14 1/2 p it had a market capitalisation of Pounds 9.3m. Addison is buying the trade and operating assets of the businesses involved and is not taking on any liabilities over the pension fund. The AGB part of the Maxwell pension funds should have been worth about Pounds 60m. It is not clear how much of that is left. The purchase, which is expected to be completed within four weeks, will include the AGB continuous research panels in areas such as food and packaged goods and the panels that provide the UK television industry with its ratings information. Addison is also buying the ad hoc market research businesses. No price was disclosed deal but industry speculation last night put the figure at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. MAI, the financial services,marketing and television group, holds 25 per cent of Addison. In 1988 it was about to raise its stake in AGB to 30 per cent until Mr Robert Maxwell swooped and took the company over with an offer which valued the business at Pounds 134m. Since then many parts of the business have been sold. MAI was invited to bid for AGB but did not. The big surprise was that AC Nielsen was apparently outbid for AGB. Opposition to a Nielsen takeover from users of the AGB continuous research panels on the grounds of monopoly and the near certainty of interest from the Office of Fair Trading may have been a factor. The Gutenberghus Group has bought the Maxwell stake in Fleetway Editions,the comic company with titles such as Dan Dare, Roy of the Rovers and Postman Pat. Last October Maxwell's Fleetway and London Editions Magazine, owned by Gutenberghus, set up a 50:50 joint venture. The takeover of the Fleetway 50 per cent is designed to end uncertainty 'following the recent developments in the Maxwell Group'.</p>

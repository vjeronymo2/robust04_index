			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Ashdown sets hectic pace MR PADDY Ashdown launched the Liberal Democrat general election campaign almost single-handedly yesterday, with hectic trips to Wales and Scotland and a plea for Labour and the Tories to address his 'positive, hopeful' agenda for Britain. Opening the Liberal Democrats' first London election press conference, Mr Ashdown shrugged off opinion polls showing a dip in his party's support in recent days. His task was to 'liberate' the 'reservoir of potential out there for this party'. Accompanied only by Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, he released a letter he has written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, calling on them to shun negative campaigning. Later he flew to Edinburgh and Cardiff for similar press launches. The Liberal Democrats have constructed a high-tech press conference facility in the Gladstone Library of the National Liberal Club in Westminster. It includes nine television monitors for graphics displays, juxtaposed with dusty volumes on the library's shelves. Mr Ashdown signalled his determination to capture the moral high ground with a slick campaign that eschews personalised attacks on Labour and the Tories. He said he was not afraid to push potentially unpopular policies - such as the Liberal Democrats' pledge to increase the basic income tax rate by 1p to bring an extra Pounds 2bn for education spending. 'We will say the things that need to be said, even when this makes uncomfortable listening,' he said. Most of the party's 21 other MPs will stay in their constituencies for the campaign, with occasional forays to London. Mr Ashdown's letter calls on Mr Major and Mr Kinnock to set out how they would end the recession, protect the environment, invest in education, and reform Britain's democracy. 'Liberal Democrats have clear and positive answers to these vital questions,' he said.</p>

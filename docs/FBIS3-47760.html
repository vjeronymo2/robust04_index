			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Lieutenant General Myo Nyunt, chairman of the </F> National Convention Convening Commission, to the National  Convention Plenary Session at Rangoon's President House compound  on 18 January -- recorded]    [Excerpts][passage omitted] National Convention delegates:  Let us review the current situation. The current situation is  very delicate as SLORC is striving to achieve national unity.  It will not be necessary to elaborate on the achievements of  SLORC during its term of office in improving national security,  economic, social affairs, education, health, preservation of  national culture, border region development, and infrastructure  improvement nationwide. On the political front, there is  special success in regard to national unity.    There is peace and security in areas where insurgency  prevailed for over 45 years since independence. Most of the  country's territory is now peaceful and tranquil and we still  have to strive to bring about peace and tranquility to the  remaining areas, sooner or later. It is now the time for all  our fraternal national people to work hand in hand to ensure our  country, which we love and cherish, is fully peaceful and  becomes a developed and modern nation. Currently, we are giving  priority to bringing about the highest level of national unity.  Therefore, I urge all national people, including the delegates  and organizations, to have genuine goodwill and to put the  interests of the nation ahead of one's own and one's group.    The delegates at the National Convention had discussed and  presented suggestions to obtain basic principles on which the  fundamental principles of the state should be based in drafting  the State Constitution. The delegates still have to hold  discussions on details of the basic principles for each chapter  to fully implement these basic principles. There may be  differences of opinion or identical opinions on holding  discussions and consultations. It is important not to be  dissatisfied when opinions are not the same. It is important  that one's view and that of others serve the interests of the  nation and that it is viable. Only the views and methods which  serve the basic interests of the national people at the highest  level in the most practical way is desirable.    Presently, various indigenous people are living together in  our nation. As the indigenous people become more aware and  developed, they have an increasing desire to manage their  regions themselves. Therefore, we should be magnanimous in  helping the indigenous people, as that is in accordance with the  prescribed basic principles, to get the right to the management  they deserve. [passage omitted]    It is important that the structure of the state upholds the  three cardinal causes [nondisintegration of the Union,  nondisintegration of national unity, and the perpetuation of  national sovereignty] as its essence. It is important to strive  to further strengthen the Union. It is important for parts of  the Union -- divisions, major regions, and states -- to jointly  strive for the perpetuation of the Union; a prestigious place  for the country in the community of nations; and the emergence  of a modern, developed, and strong nation. It is especially  important for parts of the Union to strive to ensure the  interests of the Union are not violated and to contribute its  welfare.    The basic principles for the chapter on the head of state is  to be discussed at the National Convention. The basic  principles with the president as the head of state and the  system of administration with the president as the chief  executive have been obtained. Details concerning the  qualifications of the president, who elects the president, and  the president's rights and responsibilities are to be discussed  at the convention.    In considering the special needs of the state administrative  system, it should be noted that the world communications and  transportation are not like before; they are developing fast.  The international political, economic, social, and military  situation is changing every moment. Taking these changes into  account, it has become necessary to have a fast and effective  administrative machinery. The future system of administration  must be modern and effective to safeguard the interests of the  nation, to ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, the  defense of the country's land, air, and maritime territory, and  the prevention of violations against the country's prestige and  interests.    Our delegates from the Defense Services will take on the  responsibility we deserve and give our assistance to the best of  our ability in electing the president. This is to ensure the  administrative system with the president as chief executive is  fast and effective and meets the nation's defense requirement in  the fast changing international situation. It has become  necessary to give such assistance because we want to defend the  country in a timely manner, in today's fast changing  international situation that has repercussions on our nation's  interests to a certain extent.    While I have the opportunity, I would like to speak on the  third cardinal cause -- the perpetuation of national  sovereignty, which is crucial to a country. No one should  attempt to undermine and weaken the country's sovereignty. We  shall not tolerate the undermining of national sovereignty in  any way. We shall not tolerate external threats to our national  sovereignty, and we shall not tolerate threats to our national  sovereignty from internal minions. Sovereignty, which belongs to  the people, is the highest [power] and it should be exercised by  a central body according to constitutional provisions.  Therefore, it will be necessary for other organizations not to  infringe upon the rights of the central body. National  sovereignty belongs to all the indigenous people who have the  responsibility to respectfully safeguard the sovereignty with  their lives.    National Convention delegates: The environment we are  currently experiencing provides a very valuable lesson for our  future journey. The conditions are alerting us to be vigilant.  Some of those who are opposing national interests are still  striving to obtain power through a short cut. They are ignoring  the concrete conditions in the country marked by progress and  are espousing a pessimistic outlook in making false accusations  against the state.    In accordance with international norms, international  governmental organizations are not interfering in our internal  affairs. However, some organizations under the influence of  imperialists are busy interfering in the internal affairs of  others and we hear about them daily. It will be irresponsible  to ignore the threat from this neocolonialist group and those  opposing national interests.    National Convention delegates: The six objectives which we  should all strive for without fail are: nondisintegration of the  Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of  national sovereignty; the promotion of genuine multiparty  democracy; the promotion of Lawkapala [universal] principle of  justice, liberty, and equality; and the participation of the  Defense Services in the leading role in future national  politics. I conclude here by urging the delegates to give good  suggestions and hold discussions and consultations for the  emergence of a state constitution which is in accordance with  these six objectives and contribute to the promotion of the  essence of the 104 basic principles that we have obtained for  prescribing the fundamental principles of the state.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Expatriates must pay I have lived in Greece for 15 years and have no intention of returning in the foreseeable future. My savings (in sterling) are in a bank deposit account but I am looking for more attractive returns on this money. Investment trusts seem an attractive long-term proposition. As an expatriate, I am not liable for UK income and capital gains tax. Should I opt for UK-based or offshore trusts? In other words, is there any disadvantage (as far as United Kingdom taxes are concerned) in investing in UK trusts as opposed to offshore trusts? You are wrong in saying: 'As an expatriate, I am not liable for UK income tax.' Non-residents are basically liable to UK tax on income derived from the UK although they are exempt from UK capital gains tax. And your UK bank interest is exempt from UK tax by virtue of article VI(1) of the Greece-UK double taxation convention. As a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, you are entitled to a personal allowance against your UK income tax liability each year. For 1994-95 (as for 1992-93 and 1993-94), the basic personal allowance is Pounds 3,445. Since, clearly, that will exceed 125 per cent of your prospective UK dividends, on an investment of up to Pounds 8,000, you would, effectively, be exempt from tax on your UK dividends and would be able to claim payment of the 25 per cent tax credit carried by each dividend. Therefore, the residual disadvantage of investing in the UK (so far as tax is concerned) would simply be that you would have to wait for your tax credits to be paid to you - although you probably could make instalment claims during each tax year (depending upon the timing of the dividends, etc). We cannot, however, give investment advice (in view of the Financial Services Act 1986). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

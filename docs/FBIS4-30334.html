			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Saturday [25 June] the current tax reform policy will  not change even with the resignation of the cabinet of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Fujii told a press conference held immediately after the  cabinet resigned that he expects the succeeding administration  will continue to seek a higher consumption tax and lower income  taxes, so as to prepare for the aging society.    He said he hoped the final draft on the issue will be  compiled as soon as possible in line with earlier plans to  create a final version by the end of June.    Hata gave up his two-month-old cabinet just hours before the  House of Representatives was to convene to vote on a  no-confidence motion against his administration.    Fujii acknowledged the political turmoil will not be good  for  the economy which is trying to crawl out of the recession.    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told  reporters that the tax issue is already the next  administration's problem.    But Kumagai said the present administration is willing to  wrap up the deregulation plan, which is expected to be unveiled  next Tuesday in line with the March market-access program.</p>

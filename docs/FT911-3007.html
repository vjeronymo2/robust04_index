			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Make the most of high interest - Tessas / A few fixed-rate deals are still available GIVEN THAT base rates are coming down, many savers are no doubt wishing they had locked into fixed-rate savings at the start of the year. Three separate base-rate cuts in February and March - adding up to a 1.5 percentage points and taking the base rate down to 12.5 per cent - have naturally taken their toll on savings rates. Many of the tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) either lowered their rates or stayed put. Competition between banks and building societies in the Tessa market is particularly keen, and they are reluctant to risk losing customers by lowering the interest rate. For savers who want to lock into a high interest rate, there are a few banks offering fixed-rate Tessas. Confederation Bank (tel 0438 744-238) has a five-year fixed-rate Tessa with a gross compound annual rate (CAR) of 11.25 per cent. You have to invest a lump sum of Pounds 8,040 and, each year, the appropriate sum is switched into the Tessa from a feeder account. The rate on the feeder account is also fixed at 11.25 per cent, but remember that interest on feeder accounts is liable to income tax if you are a taxpayer. The penalty for transfer or closure is 180 days' interest. National Mortgage Bank (tel 021 712-2800) recently launched a five-year fixed-rate Tessa, which pays 11 per cent gross CAR. Again, you make your deposit into a fixed-rate feeder account, but in this case, the minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. There is a penalty of 180 days' interest for transfer or early closure. If you are worried about locking into a fixed rate for five years, Save &amp; Prosper/Robert Fleming (tel 0800 282-101) have a one-year fixed-rate Tessa. The rate is fixed at 10.25 per cent gross CAR, and after one year you can choose to switch your money into S &amp; P's variable-rate Tessa or you can opt for another year at the fixed rate - though bear in mind that the new fixed rate could be much lower if the base rate has been cut substantially. The minimum investment is Pounds 500, and the maximum is Pounds 3,000 in the first year. Interest is credited monthly, and you can withdraw net interest quarterly if you want. There is a discretionary Pounds 50 penalty for transfer or closure. Bear in mind, too, that S &amp; P's fixed rate of 10.25 per cent is well below the 12.18 per cent gross CAR being offered on its variable rate Tessa, and that many variable-rate Tessas on the market are offering 15 per cent or more. No one is giving any clues as to whether they will be lowering their rates in the near future, so it is rather a gamble. However, if you do decide to plump for a variable-rate Tessa, you would be wise to choose one with no transfer penalties, as this will allow you to move your money into the most competitive Tessa at short notice.</p>

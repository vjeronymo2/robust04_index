			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Montreal goes for visual dramas MONTREAL'S arts scene is well-known for its vitality, innovation and willingness to take risks. The major talking- point of the fifth Festival de Theatre des Ameriques was a cycle of three Shakespeare plays, Coriolanus, Macbeth and The Tempest, translated and adapted by the Quebecois playwright Michel Garneau and directed by Robert Lepage. The present cycle, which has already been seen in France and which will be seen again in Europe later this year, will appeal to audiences who think visual images are more important than the actual text. Coriolanus is set within a rectangular frame measuring 4 feet by 16 feet. It is like watching a very small cinemascope screen. The frame cuts off the actors' legs; when they stand on tables (which they do quite often) the frame cuts off their heads and they look like ruined figures in a Roman frieze. Shakespeare's tragedy is played for comedy. The action takes place in bars, restaurants and broadcasting studios. Coriolanus and Aufidius wrestle on the ground in the nude in slow motion; but, with the aid of a slanting mirror, it seems as if their sexual foreplay is taking place in mid-air. The battle scenes are played by puppets. The action is punctuated by the modern alarums of a city caught in a traffic jam. Jules Philip's Coriolanus is so young he might still be in the sixth form; it is difficult to imagine him either as a triumphant general or as somebody to whom the Roman people would offer a consulship. The most memorable performance is by Anne-Marie Cadieux, who plays Volumnia, that most formidable of Roman matrons, in a high camp manner. Coriolanus has been translated into modern Quebecois. Macbeth has been put into an archaic and barbaric language, drawn from an abridged dictionary listing words prohibited by the clergy and sprinkled with Norman and Breton dialects. The setting is a wooden passageway on two levels, running the whole width of the stage and made out of rough planks which can be pulled down to form a fence. At one point Macbeth is seen through the slats, running backwards and forwards, giving, with the help of strobe lighting, a magic lantern effect. The Tempest, translated into classical Quebecois, is set in a rehearsal room with a wall of mirrors, a ballet barre and some gym lockers. In the centre are two green- topped tables round which the actors sit. The production begins with Prospero (Jacques-Henri Gagnon) in jeans, in his role of theatre director, reading his opening scene with Miranda. Caliban is played by Anne-Marie Cadieux as a manic female punk-rocker with coarse voice, blackened eyes, hobnail boots and wearing a plastic garbage bag. Marie Brassard's Ariel spends most of her time on top of the light-fitting, which she uses as a trapeze. Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano act their drunken scene on top of the lockers. The Shakespeare cycle played to packed and enthusiastic houses. So did Gertrude Stein's existential oddity, Doctor Faustus Lights The Lights, written in 1938 but not performed until after her death in 1946. Faustus sells his soul to discover electricity. There were three different Faustuses; three Marguerites in identical blue dresses; two Mephistos (one a red-headed clown); a towering transvestite with a sickle; three dwarves in yellow macintoshes and a dog who said 'thank you'. The action, a religious and psychological conflict, took place in Faustus's mind. The music by Hans Peter Kuhn was minimal. The production was by American director Robert Wilson, who has spent most of his working life in Europe. Wilson (like Lepage) is more interested in form, movement and light than he is in text. He feels most actors are too text-orientated and argues that the best actors are those who do not understand what they are saying. Hence his decision to direct a group of East Berlin drama students in English. The text was used for its sound rather than its meaning and the flat German intonation gave the banality an extra dimension. I felt I was watching a ballet. The performance was cold and mechanical and, at an hour-and-a-half, mercifully short for a director whose productions are liable to last five, 12, 24 hours, even three days. Pol Pelletier, founder of the Women Experimental Theatre in Montreal, threw herself energetically into a two-and-a-half hour monologue, Joie, which described her career in the theatre in particular and the lot of women in general. This cri de coeur was much enjoyed by an audience able to follow the references to Montreal's political life during the last two decades. I also saw The Lorca Play, written and directed by Daniel Brooks and Daniel MacIvor, which used extracts from The House of Bernarda Alba and snippets of information about Lorca. The piece was acted by seven actresses, who marched up and down, and one limping male narrator, who stamped his cane. The performance was an unsatisfactory mixture of meticulously rehearsed choral work and messy improvisation. Coriolanus is coming to Nottingham Playhouse at the end of November</p>

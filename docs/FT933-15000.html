			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: The decade of decadence - Patricia Morison enjoys an exhibition of the languid and rather naughty Nineties ANYONE WHO grew up in the late 1960s may well find the latest exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert museum powerfully nostalgic. High Art and Low Life: The Studio and the Fin de Siecle offers a richly textured account of the decade which has etched a clearer image of itself than any other. During my sixth-form years, spent still in the back-wash of the 1960s, the 1890s held a deep fascination. Our tragic heroes were Rimbaud, Oscar Wilde, and Aubrey Beardsley. The latter supplied favourite images, together with posters by Toulouse Lautrec and Mucha, and postcards of Moreau and the Belgian Symbolists. It had all seemed a long time ago - until this exhibition. But now, with so much of the look of the 1960s back on the streets, it seems possible that fin-de-siecle decadence may yet be resurrected for our end-of-century. Indeed, the exhibition reminds us of the V&amp;A's key role in stimulating the cult of the 1890s, first with the 1963 Mucha exhibition which brought Art Nouveau roaring back into fashion, then the Beardsley exhibition of 1966. There are other straws in the wind. At the Almeida, a new opera deals with the life of Rimbaud. This autumn the Barbican will stage an exhibition of Mucha, who as a Czech nationalist is perhaps even more likely to captivate a younger generation than last time round. Easy parallels present themselves between the 1990s and the 1890s. To name but one, Ibsen on syphilis has become horribly topical. Interestingly, the V&amp;A's exhibition looks beyond the languid exponents of decadence. In this, it takes its cue from the character of the influential Studio magazine, launched exactly 100 years ago. The magazine was established to promote 'advanced' taste in furnishings, decoration and the fine arts, but it was never intended to shock. It lay on the occasional tables of people who would never have read the notorious Yellow Book. Nonetheless, 'low life' figures found in the magazine a showcase for their talents. The 21-year-old Beardsley was responsible for designing the cover of the first issue of The Studio. Within its green wrappers was to be found 'The Climax', his famous illustration for Salome. Wilde loved it. Also contained in this first issue were Baron Von Gloeden's photographs of young Sicilian boys - with and without togas. The baron's work still sells well at the bookshop in Taormina, congregating ground for the international gay set. Even so, it is just possible that to an innocent Victorian, photographs like these could have appeared as no more than a stunning recreation of ideal Grecian beauty. The designs of Voysey and Ashbee were much promoted by the Studio and are prominent in the exhibition. Among the artists featured are Charles Conder, famous for paintings on silk, also Frank Brangwyn, Arthur Melville, Whistler, and the inseparable Ricketts and Shannon - Marigold and Orchid, as Wilde nicknamed them. It was a great age of beautifully bound and illustrated books. Would Pooter and Sherlock Holmes have been such a hit without their illustrations? The show marks the relaunch of Studio International, successor to Studio. Its catalogue forms part of a centenary edition which also contains stimulating essays on aspects of the 1890s such as the New Woman, 'the Love which dare not speak its name', the colours of decadence, and smoking. This was the era of Smoking Concerts, advertised by posters on which trails of smoke lent themselves perfectly to the sinuous style of Art Nouveau. Aesthetes and Hearties united in extolling the pleasures of smoking. On the one hand, it was manly, for as Kipling observed: 'A woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.' A cigarette was also an essential prop to decadence, drooping between the fingers of the 'Greenery-yallery, Grosvenor Gallery, foot-in-the-grave young man.' Less familiar than W. S. Gilbert's jokes about the aesthetes is the following vicious characterisation of their tastes which Kipling gives to a dying father addressing his Old Harrovian son: 'The things that I knew was proper, you wouldn't thank me to give And the things I knew was rotten, you said was the way to live For you muddled with books an' pictures, and' china an' etchings an' fans, And your rooms at college was beastly, most like a whore's than a man's' For anyone who nurtures an affection for the Nineties, this exhibition is a treat. * * * Thomas Gambier Parry is pretty dull, at the Courtauld Institute in London (until September 1, then to Cheltenham Art Gallery). Gambier Parry (1816-88) was a clever, wealthy High Church aesthete. He collected Italian primitives at an unusually early period and some fine pieces of Islamic art. Most of this collection his grandson presented to the Courtauld, so the exhibition is by way of a laudatio. Gambier Parry's competent but boring watercolours are on view, also his diaries. In the rarified world of Victorian ecclesiology, he is a notable figure for his invention of a special technique for wall-paintings. You will find his paintings on the roof of Ely Cathedral and at the church he built at Highnam in Gloucestershire, dedicated to the Holy Innocents in memory of two dead Parry children. The church sounds well worth a visit and possibly - since it needs money - a cheque. The church is three miles from Gloucester on the B4215 road; tel. 0452-412341/25567 for keys.</p>

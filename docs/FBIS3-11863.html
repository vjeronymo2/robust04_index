Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer has expressed  a  need for the regional organization to be reorganized to enable  it to fulfill its duty of being the guardian of Latin American  democracy. This position corresponds with the one proposed by  the group of nations supporting the candidacy of Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria. Balaguer also stated that, together  with Argentina President Carlos Menen, he is participating in  Latin American efforts to restore the prestige of the OAS.    Previously, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral and  Foreign Ministry officials had told EFE that the Dominican  Republic would support Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd  Niehaus. The support was based on the fact that Costa Rica is a  small country, as well as on an agreed rotation for  representatives from all OAS countries to occupy the post of  secretary general.    Ambassador Kemil Dipp Gomez, who heads the United Nations  and  OAS Department at the Dominican Republic's Foreign Ministry,  said the Dominican Republic would maintain its support for Costa  Rica even if there was a possibility that Niehaus could be  replaced by Oscar Arias, former Costa Rican president and Nobel  Peace Prize laureate. Niehaus is running against Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria, who has the support of the United  States, Mexico, and Brazil.    In January and March 1994, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin visited the Dominican Republic in an effort to obtain the  government's support for Gaviria's candidacy. On both  occasions, however, Dominican Republic diplomatic officials  reiterated their country's preference for a representative from  a small country, such as Costa Rica, to occupy the post of OAS  secretary general. Therefore, Balaguer's statements have  confused international diplomats as to which of the two  candidates, Gaviria or Niehaus, will receive the Dominican  Republic's support.    According to a source within the Dominican Republic Foreign  Ministry, there are two international policy issues that could  force the government to withdraw its support for Costa Rica in  favor of Colombia. The first is that the United States, the  country that has the most political influence and economic  relations with the Dominican Republic, supports Gaviria. At  this time, the Dominicans are promoting bilateral agreements  with the United States, which, according to the source, could  sway the Dominican Republic's vote in favor of Gaviria.    The other factor is that the Dominican Republic and Colombia  are negotiating the possible release of four Dominicans jailed  in Santa Fe de Bogota in connection with an alleged plot against  the Colombian Government. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin de Rubio proposed to President Balaguer in her two visits  that Colombia might agree to allow the Dominicans to serve their  sentences in their own country if they are convicted, but only  if the Dominican Republic Government agreed to a  prisoner-exchange program. Balaguer is being pressured by  relatives and educational, cultural, and political organizations  to expedite the release of the Dominicans.    After voicing its support for the Costa Rican candidacy for  more than four months, a change in the Dominican Republic's  position would be interpreted as meaning that U.S. pressure or  President Balaguer's interest in obtaining the release of his  imprisoned citizens prompted the turnaround.</p>

The Ukrainian Armed Forces will never  be the first to take a step which might lead to a conflict,"  said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a new conference  held on the Javor military training grounds of the Carpathians  Military District on Wednesday [23 March].    Kravchuk pointed out that Ukraine would not grudge funds for  the Ukrainian Army and will do its best to strengthen it defence  might, create a modern material and technical base and train  highly-qualified personnel. [sentence as received] Special  attention will be paid to the welfare of the Ukrainian  servicemen and their families, the Ukrainian president said.  At present, the Ukrainian Army is being provided with  equipment predominantly produced in Ukraine. "At the same time,  we are disposing of lethal weapons - nuclear rockets," the  Ukrainian president said.    In this connection, he highly assessed the results of a  recent visit to Ukraine by the U.S. Defence Secretary William  Perry. It was announced that the U.S. had allocated additional  funds for the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.    Speaking about relations between Ukraine and the Crimea,  Kravchuk said that the Ukrainian state was pursuing a policy in  accordance with its constitution and other legislative acts.  The Crimea can have neither army of its own, nor any other  military formations, the president said the Crimean Peninsula,  as any other territory of the country, shall be defended by the  Ukrainian Armed Forces, the added.    Touching upon the upcoming elections to the Ukrainian  parliament, Kravchuk pointed our that the elections would be  held in any case and that there is no other alternative. The  problem is that it might take more time than scheduled. The  country must not be left without the legislative power. It is  the new parliament which will have to adopt laws on power  structures, including local bodies of power. Ukraine will not  be able to continue its development as an independent and  economically strong state without these fundamental documents,  and it is with these documents that the Ukrainian president  connects his participation in the early presidential elections.</p>

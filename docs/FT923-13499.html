			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lister falls deeper into the red Increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.78m for the year to March 28 were announced by Lister &amp; Co, the textile products group which also has interests in property investment, engineering and insurance broking. Losses last time were Pounds 1.71m. The directors said that action taken during the year had resulted in two key parts of the business, Joseph Hoyle and Lister Yarns, returning to current profitability. The weakness of the home furnishings and domestic textiles markets had led to a fundamental reorganisation of that part of the business, they said. Turnover fell to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 34.7m). Losses per share increased to 17.11p (10.94p) but the proposed final is maintained at 0.1p after the interim payment was again passed. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 531,000 (Pounds 2.06m) relating to costs associated with the development of the Manningham Mills complex in Bradford.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Blair emerges as the candidate Tories fear most MPs acknowledged yesterday that there were at least six serious candidates for the leadership of the Labour party, and that in such circumstances the prospects of avoiding a damaging and public tussle between leading figures from its modernising and traditionalist wings did not look good. In the atmosphere of stunned disbelief pervading Westminster, few MPs were ready to talk openly about the succession contest that will culminate this autumn at the latest. The front runner - and the one most feared by the Tories - is Mr Tony Blair, the urbane, Oxford-educated lawyer who has made a good fist of shadowing Mr Michael Howard in the high-profile home affairs portfolio. Mr Blair, a leading moderniser, has succeeded in chipping away at the Conservative party's traditionally unassailable position as the party of law and order by portraying Labour as being tougher on crime and the causes of crime. His fluency and ready smile make him arguably the most impressive Labour performer on the electronic media. There were suggestions yesterday that he is also the moderniser with whom backbench traditionalists can most easily live. But Mr Blair must first convince supporters of Mr Gordon Brown, his modernising colleague, that he and not the shadow chancellor has the better chance of winning the race. After years when the pair were virtually inseparable, Mr Brown has recently fallen behind in the succession stakes, largely because of what some see as a patchy performance as chief Treasury spokesman. Some MPs also see Mr Blair, a family man, as a more rounded individual. One leading traditionalist said that the strongest campaign at the moment was a 'stop Gordon' campaign. Most Labour MPs think it inconceivable that both Mr Brown and Mr Blair will decide to run. But Mr Brown's closest advisers have yet to accept that their man has worse prospects. Mr Brown outpolled Mr Blair by 18 votes in the last shadow cabinet election. The leading traditionalist candidate is expected to be Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary. His powerful speech at last year's party conference played an important part in ensuring that Mr Smith won the tense battle to inject greater democracy into Labour's links with the trade unions. The burly former transport spokesman would secure strong backing from the union movement if he decided to run. Many MPs are concerned however that a head-on clash between a leading moderniser and a leading traditionalist would be extremely damaging for the party. They hope that Mr Prescott could be persuaded to run only as deputy leader. Certainly, Mr Prescott's installation as deputy leader would be the minimum price demanded by the Labour left in return for allowing a leading moderniser an unhindered tilt at the leadership. A strategy for such a balanced ticket would run aground if Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, decided not to run for leader. Many MPs believe that she could secure her current post if she did this 'in the interests of party unity'. Many MPs expect that Mrs Beckett will run, however, in which case the strength of her candidacy will largely depend on how she is seen to have done as interim leader and on Labour's performance in the European elections. As a former stalwart of the left, Mrs Beckett could garner heavy support from that wing and from women MPs. Another potential candidate from the centre-left of the party is Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, who topped the poll in the most recent shadow cabinet election. Mr Cook is widely regarded as the cleverest of Labour's leading politicians and has shadowed Mr Michael Heseltine astutely and effectively. For some his main disadvantage is his appearance, but he might emerge as a compromise candidate with some appeal to both traditionalists and modernisers. An outside bet to run is Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, who could construct a platform as the 'continuity' candidate  - the man who would carry on Mr Smith's good work. However, he came within an ace of being voted out of the shadow cabinet last autumn.</p>

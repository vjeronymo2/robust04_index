			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Players' assets ignored in accounts ENGLISH FOOTBALL clubs would add more than Pounds 250m to their assets if they included the value of their players in their accounts, a survey by accountants Touche Ross said yesterday. Only four clubs showed the players' value on their balance sheet as an intangible asset, in spite of the substantial sums paid for transfer fees, the survey showed. In the 1991-92 season - the latest for which figures are available - English football league clubs spent almost Pounds 75m on players. The first division  -now the FA Carling Premiership - spent Pounds 70m, up from Pounds 40m the previous year. Blackburn Rovers spent the largest net amount on transfers - Pounds 6.84m in the year. The survey covered the accounts of 84 clubs. It showed that 53 of the clubs reported pre-tax losses. In addition 27 clubs had their accounts qualified by their auditors over worries that they might not be 'going concerns' in the future. But the survey said that far fewer clubs would show such poor apparent results if they treated transfer fees as investments rather than expenditure written off directly to the profit-and-loss account. Derby County, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Tottenham Hotspur put estimates of their players' worth on the balance sheet. A further nine clubs disclosed the aggregate value of the playing squad in notes to the accounts. Just one club - Manchester United - has obtained an independent valuation to assess the worth of its players. That was conducted by Touche Ross. Survey of Football Club Accounts.

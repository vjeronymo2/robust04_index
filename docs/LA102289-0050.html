			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: ZSA ZSA AND HER DRESS FOR DURESS  </P> <P> Is anyone else Gaboricized to the max? The whole world and all the news in it  have been put on hold while the media push their newest breakfast serial:  Fortified Zsa Zsa Goodies.  </P> <P> The major news pales by comparison. Do we know for sure that Oprah put on a few  pounds? When will Roseanne's tattoos go public? Is it true that Tammy Bakker's  tears are recycled to conserve water? Inquiring minds want to know.  </P> <P> Probably the most illuminating thing to come out of Gabor's trial for slapping  a police officer is the insight into our judicial system. It has focused  attention on an important aspect of the law: what to wear when you go to court,  or more specifically, how to dress for duress.  </P> <P> In mid-September, when Gabor was delivered to court in what she termed her  "jailhouse Rolls-Royce," she was wearing a 5-year-old, Italian-designed,  light-colored outfit.  </P> <P> During the jury selection, accompanied by her hairdresser, she told the press  that in anticipation of the worst, she had designer Bob Mackie come up with a  new $6,000 prison dress, complete with traditional jailbird stripes. This must  have silenced all her critics who thought she wasn't taking the charges  seriously.  </P> <P> Later she alleviated all of our anxieties when she purportedly announced, "I  have enough clothes . . . even if this trial lasts a year."  </P> <P> Here is a woman who knows how the system works. Clothes are important when we  are being judged. Take Ollie North. He chose a power suit to wear to his trial.  He should have stuck with the olive number with the silver chicken accessories  on the shoulder. Uniforms make you look taller and more sincere.  </P> <P> Leona Helmsley should have opted for simple mix-and-match separates from Sears  topped with plastic earrings. People forgive you for anything when your sleeves  are too long.  </P> <P> I looked in my closet the other day and realized I didn't have enough clothes  to get me through a traffic ticket for my dog's violation of the seat-belt law.  It made me very depressed. I have a black outfit that makes me look like a cat  burglar and a drop-dead cocktail dress that could get me life. There is little  in between. The bottom line is, I can't afford to defy the law.  </P></p>

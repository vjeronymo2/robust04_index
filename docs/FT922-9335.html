			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Observer: IMF point man Observer's sympathies go out to Hernan Puentes, the lMF's head PR flunky. He has been given the thankless task of trying to convince ordinary Russians that the IMF really does have their interests at heart rather than those of the west's ruthless capitalists. Hosting his first press conference in Moscow since Russia joined the west's most powerful financial institution, Puentes seemed a bit short of ammunition. Handing out a glossy new booklet about the IMF, which translates its name into Russian as the 'International Hard Currency Fund', is not enough to win over the hearts and minds of the proletariat. President Boris Yeltsin has already said Russia will not take orders from the Fund, and Puentes stressed that his employer never dictates policy to any country. However, if the IMF's experience in Poland is any guide, Puentes and his chums are going to have an uphill struggle convincing ordinary Russians that they have not simply exchanged the tyranny of the central plan for an equally oppressive economic regime.</p>

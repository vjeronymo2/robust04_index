			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Lies, insults and smears There is nothing so absurd as the sound of British politicians in mortal fear of losing an election. If one were to judge the contestants solely by the tone of the campaign over the past few days the verdict is inescapable. None of them deserves to win. Neither of the two larger parties has sought to promote a credible programme of radical domestic reform. As to the Liberal Democrats, some of their ideas may be suitable material for debate, but that is of little assistance to the voter who wishes to make a choice between parties likely to be able to form a government. The first speech of an unedifying weekend was delivered by Mr Neil Kinnock on Friday. He sought, reasonably enough, to pin the blame for the recession on the Conservatives. His rhetoric led him into a personal attack on the prime minister as 'an architect of cardboard city'; for Mr John Major to pretend otherwise was 'deceit or self-delusion.' Yesterday the shadow foreign secretary, Mr Gerald Kaufman, developed a similar theme. He asserted that Mr Major offered 'fibs and fictions about what the Labour government will do and flights of fantasy about what the Tories would do'. Mr Major, who has stood aloof from direct attacks on Mr Kinnock, was content on Saturday to greet with a smile the hiss coming from assembled young Conservatives when he mentioned Mr Kaufman's name. The prime minister did fantasise about the Labour party, asserting that it would raise the standard rate of income tax to 35 per cent. The opposition's policies, he said, would mean 'perpetual recession and terminal decline'. The chairman of the party, Mr Christopher Patten, spoke of 'Labour's double whammy - taxes up, prices up, economy down, living standards down'. Rough and tumble This kind of accusation is part of the rough and tumble of politics. It would not be out of place two or three weeks before polling-day. Its use now, nearly nine weeks before the likely election date of April 9, is explained by the failure of either of the two larger parties to gain a decisive opinion-poll advantage over the other. They still stand neck and neck, the lead in this or that poll over the past month being well within the statistical margin of error. This parity of public esteem is partly due to the perceived similarities between the contestants. The Conservatives have no really new overall vision to offer and a highly questionable record to defend. Labour needs to prove its pretensions to respectability, which it is doing at the cost of offering little of genuine substance in spite of its voluminous policy proposals. Knock down In consequence the Conservatives are trying to set Labour up in order to knock it down during the final weeks of electioneering. A budget that reduced the standard rate of income tax by 1p would be a challenge to Labour to repeat its undertaking to put the 1p back on. The chancellor is under some pressure from his colleagues to play this card. Saturday's pledge by Mr John Major to complete and deploy the fourth Trident submarine leaves Labour vulnerable to the charge that it would countermand the order. In the first instance Labour would be shown to be a party of high personal taxation, in the second, it could be called soft on defence. Labour, for its part, is trying to focus attention on the failings of the Conservatives since 1979. Tax and defence policies are important, and should be fully aired. There are, however, other issues to place before the electorate. The government has evolved a broadly positive strategy for education. Mr Major did explain education policy to the young Conservatives, although very much in headline terms. The government's health reforms are vulnerable to the charge that while the theory may be sound there are many unavoidable cruelties in the implementation. The Labour and Liberal Democrat proposals for constitutional reform need a more rational response from the Tories than a blanket refusal to contemplate any change. In short, the prime minister's call for a 'clean' election should be amended. What is required is a serious political debate.</p>

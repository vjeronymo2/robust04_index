			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Waigel lowers borrowing plans Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, expects to borrow DM55bn (Pounds 22bn) - DM13bn less than he had earlier indicated - to finance this year's budget following higher tax receipts and further savings. Mr Waigel recently said net borrowing requirement had fallen by DM10bn, but yesterday he revised this to DM13bn as he presented his 1995 budget to parliament for the first time since it was re-elected in October. The net new borrowing requirement for the 1995 budget will also be DM10.2bn lower than expected, totalling DM58.6bn, Mr Waigel said. Expenditure in 1995 is expected to be about 1 per cent higher than this year, totalling DM484.1bn. The biggest item is the social security budget which is expected to rise by 1.9 per cent to DM132.3bn.</p>

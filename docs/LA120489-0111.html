			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> RIGHT WING WINS FRENCH SEAT  </P> <P> Right-wing extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front party won a seat in the  French Parliament for the first time in a year, winning 61% of the vote in a  by-election in Dreux, election officials said today.  </P> <P> The anti-immigration party also scored 51% of the vote in a regional  by-election in Salon-de-Provence and 47% in another legislative by-election in  Marseilles.  </P> <P> Political analysts said the support for the National Front indicates a growing  national discontent with immigration policies.  </P> <P> Le Pen, who mustered only 11.4% of the vote in June, 1988, national legislative  elections, has been at the forefront of a heated debate over whether Muslim  women should be able to wear head scarves in state-run classrooms. Le Pen  opposes the wearing of head scarves in public schools, saying it violates  French culture.  </P></p>

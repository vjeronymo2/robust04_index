			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> (1) the RTC has assigned the management and disposition of such asset to a qualified person or entity to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) analyze each asset and consider alternative disposition strategies; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) develop a written management and disposition plan; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) implement that plan for a reasonable period of time; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the RTC determines in writing that a bulk transfer of the asset would maximize the net recovery, while providing opportunity for broad participation by qualified bidders, including minority- and women-owned businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (w)(3) permits the RTC to define ``asset'' to include properties or loans which, although legally discrete, have sufficiently common characteristics that they may logically be treated as a single asset. Such a definition permits the RTC to provide a single asset management and disposition plan for several assets. The statute also expressly allows the RTC to define ``qualified person'' to include employees assigned to the RTC and Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board (TDPOB) employees. Implementation of these definitions requires the RTC to promulgate regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the exceptions created by the $400,000 and $1 million thresholds for real estate and non-performing real estate loans, respectively, subsection (w)(3) establishes two exceptions to the requirements of subsection (w)(3)(A). First, as under subsection (w)(2), subsection (w)(3)(C) exempts assets transferred in connection with a standard purchase and assumption agreement or an insured deposit transfer agreement where a significant portion of the failed institution's assets are transferred, as well as assets transferred to a de novo institution organized by the RTC under section 11(d)(2)(F) of the FDIA or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv) of the FHLBA. Second, subsection, (w)(3)(C) permits the RTC to dispose of assets with book values above the threshold, without complying with the requirements of (w)(3)(A), whenever the RTC determines, in writing, that such a disposition will bring a greater return. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Relationship to the Small Investor Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Congress considered the needs of smaller investors in framing the provisions contained in sections 21A(w) (2) and (3) of the FHLBA. The needs of small investors were addressed by a) an emphasis on individual marketing and sales of significant assets, and b) the structuring of bulk transactions in a fashion which increases the participation by bidders with moderate levels of capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] High-temperature superconductivity technology for  achieving a superconductive state at the temperature of liquid  nitrogen (-196C) instead of liquid helium (-269C) is  approaching the realm of practical application. The Tokyo  Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the Shikoku Electric Power  Company (SEPCO) individually developed power storage equipment  that use the capability to levitate objects, and the  Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL), which was  established jointly by the government and the private sector,  test-manufactured a superconducting IC by using the  characteristic of high frequency. Bearings and sensors also have  been produced. The focus of high-temperature superconductors  used to be on development of material, but gradual progress from  research to application is being made.  <H5>  High-Sensitivity IC Test-Manufactured by SRL </H5>   The power storage equipment developed by TEPCO and SEPCO  stores energy when an object levitated by high-temperature  superconductivity is rotated rapidly. It is said that this is  the world's first of this type.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     A high-temperature superconducting material called MPMG,  which was developed by SRL, was used for this equipment.  Conductive material is mixed with high-temperature  superconducting material, and the magnetic flux from magnets  cannot intersect the boundary surface and is repelled. Thus it  will be levitated by an adequately strong magnet. Repellent  force arises even if the magnets are brought closer together,  but if MPMG and a magnet are placed on top of each other, the  phenomenon of "repulsion in the vertical direction but fixed in  the horizontal direction" occurs.    In SEPCO's device, a permanent magnet is embedded in the  bottom of a revolving element that is 13.5 cm tall, has a  maximum radius of 25 cm and weighs 27.5 kg. This is placed on a  bed on which MPMG has been deposited. When the MPMG is cooled to  the temperature of liquid nitrogen, it becomes superconductive  and the revolving element is levitated.    When charging, the electromagnetic motor increases the  rotation of the revolving element. When discharging, the same  motor works as a power generator. The device is rotated at high  speed, 23,000 rpm, and it can store 102 watt-hours of electric  power. TEPCO's device has almost the same structure and it can  store 50 watt-hours.    Both companies confirmed that the devices they  test-manufactured worked as designed. Hereafter, they will wait  for mass-production of material with three times the magnetic  capability, then they will conduct R&amp;D to increase size and  raise efficiency to about 85 percent.    Ultimately, the goal is to build a facility that can store  around 10,000 kWh in each area substation and create a system to  deal with fluctuations in power demand. Superconductive power  storage equipment loses less power than pumped storage power  plants, and it is thought that there will be few limiting  conditions as far as sites are concerned.    On the other hand, the research group led by Katsumi Suzuki,  chief researcher of SRL's Lab 6, is the first in the world to  test manufacture a high-temperature superconducting IC in which  a high-frequency antenna and signal processing Josephson devices  were integrated on one chip. Because the important parts are  made of a low-resistance superconducting material, high-speed  signals can be picked up with good precision. In a test, music  from a CD player was carried by high frequency, then received by  a superconducting IC, which performed as anticipated.    The developed device is composed of two antennas that can  receive 23 gigahertz (1 gigahertz = 1 billion hertz) microwave  and six Josephson device circuits to extract data riding on the  radio waves. Both are made of yttrium-base high-temperature  superconductors and they were incorporated onto a 20 square  millimeter substrate.    Superconducting circuits have virtually no electric  resistance. Their strong point is that they can operate  adequately even in high frequency bands where normal conductors  lose their utility because resistance is too high.    Application sectors include inter-satellite communications  using 60 gigahertz microwaves and automobile collision  prevention radar. It is said that this can also be used for  portable phones -- to raise the sensitivity of receiving  stations and reduce power consumption.    Other applications of high-temperature superconducting  technology are the magnetic bearings co-developed by SRL and  Nippon Seiko and magnetic sensors developed by the  superconducting sensor research institute, which is financed by  the government and private sector. Both appeared on the scene  this fall.  <H5>  Editorial Comment: Quality Upgrade of Material Contributes </H5> to Success    Behind the emergence of high-temperature superconducting  technology application is the substantial upgrading of the  quality of materials. Ceramic-base materials are used in  high-temperature superconducting materials, but in the early  stages, the characteristics of ceramics -- processing  difficulty, brittleness -- impeded development and application.    Today, however, it is possible to make 1-inch monocrystals  and line up their surfaces. If high-quality materials are made  into substrates, the microprocessing on the substrates can be  done with existing technology. Furthermore, the weak points in  the strong surface are being conquered. Shoji Tanaka, director  of SRL, says that "High-temperature superconductors no longer  have to be ceramic," thereby stressing the fact that  high-temperature superconductors are becoming components like  metal and semiconductors.    Almost all high-temperature superconductivity researchers  have stressed development of new materials, but recently, there  has been a lull in the push to discover materials, and some  thought that research fervor had cooled. In the midst of this,  the SRL was established in Japan with government and private  funding and is working on raising the quality of materials and  upgrading performance. It can be said that this has led to a  series of successes.    It cannot be said that the phenomenon of high-temperature  superconductivity has been fully revealed. As was the case with  semiconducting technology, however, when good material is  created, basic research is advanced, which in turn leads to the  development of even more new materials. SRL Director Tanaka  predicts that this productive cycle will occur with  high-temperature superconductivity as well.</p>

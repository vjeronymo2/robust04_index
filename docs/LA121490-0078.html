			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE R WORD? RODEO, DAHLING;  </P> <P> RETAILING: JUDGING BY ONE DAY'S BUSINESS, A PRICEY SHOP ON THE EXCLUSIVE  BEVERLY HILLS STREET NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT SLOW SALES.  </P> <P> In a back corner of the Theodore women's shop on Rodeo Drive -- after you pass  the $6,000 cat suit, the $550 cashmere sweaters and the $1,000-plus sequined  party dresses -- there's a simple advertising display for the store's own line  of fragrances.  </P> <P> There's no description of the merchandise, just one image-laden sentence of  advertising copy: "I always get what I want."  </P> <P> That line also could be the motto of many of the people who shop at Theodore in  Beverly Hills. "Our customer," said owner Herbert Fink, "is a with-it person  who is on the go."  </P> <P> "She's an important person," he added, "who may run a movie studio."  </P> <P> When the holiday shopping season arrives, these important, with-it people who  always get what they want seem to want even more. At least, they buy more.  </P> <P> Across the nation, a recession appears under way, and many merchants this  holiday season are doing everything but using a hook to pull wary customers  into their stores. But things are done differently on Rodeo Drive, where a  Times reporter spent one day this week gauging the rhythms of commerce at the  Theodore boutique.  </P> <P> Business was steady at Theodore that day, apparently better than it's been at  nearby competitors. Fink said holiday sales at the store, one of his 10 fashion  shops in Southern California, are up about 10% from a year ago.  </P> <P> Customers are buying fewer items, Fink said, but generally they are snapping up  the more expensive ones.  </P> <P> Sure, there are markdowns, but these are Beverly Hills markdowns.  </P> <P> On the "40% off" rack, the price of a leather coat was slashed from $3,100 to a  rock-bottom $2,170, a fake-fur coat was reduced from $980 to $588 and a suit  was marked down from $1,200 to $720.  </P> <P> The price cuts have come a couple weeks earlier this year than usual, in  response to competition from Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and others. Even  if Theodore shoppers typically have big money to spend, "everybody loves a  bargain," Fink said.  </P> <P> And some customers -- call them the untrendy minority -- clearly do fret over  prices. An elderly man who came in to buy a sweater and leggings as a present  waved his hand and left, seemingly in disgust, after being told the total came  to $805.96.  </P> <P> Salesperson Dawn Ortega, a native Texan who started working at Theodore six  months ago, was startled. "We've had people come in to pick up something that  they thought was $140 when it was really $1,400, but that doesn't happen  often," she said. "Most of our customers aren't that price conscious."  </P> <P> Generally speaking, customers appear to be swayed more by fashion and quality.  </P> <P> "I look at prices, but I'm not running around with coupons," said Lianne  Barnes, a knitwear designer with her own firm in Santa Monica who stops at  Theodore from time to time.  </P> <P> "If it's very well made, I don't mind spending money on it."  </P> <P> A woman, looking at a pair of blue jeans, mentioned the P word.  </P> <P> It's $165, the saleswoman reported. "Not bad," the customer replied. Not so,  said her female companion, a tall, glamorous blonde clad in black. "Actually,  that's high for jeans," the friend said softly.  </P> <P> For the most part, it was a very low-key day -- even after actress Joan Van Ark  made a quiet entrance. She said she wanted a patent leather belt. Told that  there were none, Van Ark said "thank you" and left.  </P> <P> The sales clerks played it L.A.-cool, aside from exchanging glances and a  whisper after Van Ark departed. Margie Ketting, a 25-year-old sales clerk,  explained that she often sees celebrities at work and when she goes out to the  club scene.  </P> <P> "You're with them all the time. They're nice people," Ketting confided.  </P> <P> The presence of a Times photographer and reporter didn't whip up any  excitement, either. One shopper after another turned down the opportunity to be  interviewed. "Who are these people?" one regular asked.  </P> <P> Fink explained that his typical customer "doesn't have time to monkey around,"  and that some might be worried that their personal manager, husband or  boyfriend would be angry if the news got out that they were out shopping on  Rodeo again.  </P> <P> "Shopping is a very private thing. It's like going to your psychiatrist," he  quipped.  </P> <P> As for that $6,000 rainbow cat suit on display at the entrance -- a one-piece  body suit covered with small sequins in a variety of colors -- it evoked mixed  reactions.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of stars come in and try it on," said store manager Susan  Sanders. "It'll sell."  </P> <P> Not everyone was impressed. Later in the day, an elegant-looking woman in a red  blazer took a step into the store, pointed out the suit to her male companion,  giggled and walked out.  </P> <P> And not all of the sales pitches succeeded. A sales clerk told a bespectacled,  conservatively dressed shopper who appeared to be in her 60s or 70s that "you'd  look great in these sweats." The shopper replied, "I'm too fat." End of sales  pitch.  </P> <P> No matter how rich most of the customers are, many would be considered  undernourished if they lived in Milwaukee. "You can always tell the girls who  look at Theodore," said Fink, 67, a longtime Beverly Hills retailer who heads  the Rodeo Drive Committee, a merchants group.  </P> <P> "They wear black. Very tight pants. Anorexic."  </P> <P> These customers also can be demanding and aloof. They have been known to pull  in front of the store in their cars and bang on their horns for a salesperson  to come out. Others come in and pace through the store toting their dogs or  talking into their pocket-size cellular telephones.  </P> <P> Still, the sales staff -- all women, mostly in their 20s -- say they like the  respect they get from their better customers. And one of them, Lisa Ross, 23,  recently got a nice surprise. "I've got the best customer in the world," Ross  said. "She sent me flowers and a fruit basket!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> THEODORE ON RODEO DRIVE  </P> <P> About the owner: The Theodore women's boutique on Rodeo Drive is one of 10  apparel shops in Southern California owned by Herbert Fink. His other stores  include the Theodore Man store next door on Rodeo, along with the nearby Sonia  Rykiel and Claude Montana French designer boutiques.  </P> <P> About the merchandise: Theodore sells various types of women's designer  apparel, but it says it specializes in trendy, casual "cruise clothes" or  "beach clothes."  </P> <P> Founded: 1969  </P> <P> Employees: 10  </P></p>

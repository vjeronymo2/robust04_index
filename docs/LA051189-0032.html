			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> LACC STUDENT FILMS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR  </P> <P> There's a bloom on youth some of us never recapture, a spirit about beginner's  films that's hard to match. The 10 short student films shown tonight at the  Directors Guild are a good example: Made at the Los Angeles City College  Radio-TV-Film Department, they have a zest and honesty that puts to shame much  of the commercial product out now.  </P> <P> The school's film programs are populist products. Compared to many other  college film programs, these students come from all ages, races, sexes and  classes. It shows. All of these films have in common a devotion to storytelling  craft and to ideas about the world.  </P> <P> Occasionally, they lack that surface panache that is often the only saving  grace of a current commercial release. But each of them is a movie with a core,  a heart and a brain. They range from a blackly comic cartoon about the price of  good Samaritanism in the animal world (Brian Lee's "Frog Day Afternoon"), to a  sympathetic examination of the plight of the aging (Mohammed Anvarizadeh's  "Growing Again"), to a modern parable of religious mania (Ted Dewberry's  "Second Coming"), to a satire on mind control (Rafaello Mazza's "Shock"), to  two tour-de-force subjective portrayals of the horrors of childhood (Robert  Chodak's comic "Come In, Johnny" and Michelle Johnson's painful "Silence").  </P> <P> Among my favorites: Nick Stamos' "Loose Ends," a tense, modern film noir about  a recently paroled contract killer forced to redo the botched murder he left  behind. Stamos tries for too wild a double-twist climax here, but he is good at  evoking the disaffected mood of a rootless man in the city, the loneliness,  dirt and squalor of small hotel rooms. His lead, Cletus Young, has a great,  gnarled, cold-as-death gangster face, like Lino Ventura; he might have sprung  form the bowels of Scorsese's mean streets. And Stamos' composer, Marjorie Poe,  whose score is chilling and percussive, is a real find.  </P> <P> Carole Kravetz' "Taxi Dance" presents another slant on urban loneliness. It's a  lyrical little film about dance, sex and the power of nocturnal body English,  set on an abandoned stage where two strangers have a brief, blazing encounter.  Saundra Sharp's "Picking Tribes," which I already had the pleasure of reviewing  for the recent Black Talkies on Parade film competition (where it won first  prize), is a marvelous autobiographical tale of a young girl coming gradually  to terms with her mixed black and Native American heritages. It packs so much  into its narration, music, animation and collage that you seem to experience  half a lifetime in barely seven minutes.  </P> <P> Finally there is Rupert Nadeau's "Tracks," a nastily funny road picture in  which a bearish, sweaty vacuum cleaner salesman (Carlo Michael Mancini) murders  his lover and her boyfriend, then takes them along on a perverted parody of the  usual love-on-the-run movie, from "Gun Crazy" to "Badlands." Nadeau seems to  owe much of his attack to the Coen brothers ("Blood Simple" and "Raising  Arizona"), but he adds some acrid spice and weird tricks of his own. In one  virtuoso shot, the camera plays mirror games while the dead lovers spring to  life in a desultory motel dance.  </P> <P> "Tracks" could easily be expanded into a full-length movie. So, with a better  ending, could "Loose Ends." "Taxi Dance" and "Picking Tribes" are fine as they  are. And, like the rest of the films, they are a breath of cinematic fresh air  in the usual wasteland of crazed slashers, careening cars, deal-making and  grosses-worship.  </P></p>

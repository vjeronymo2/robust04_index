			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Two-part article by Tai Dewen (3141 1795 2429), secretary </F> of the Fuyang Prefecture CPC Committee, and Gao Lu (7559 6424),  staff reporter: "Speaking of the Reverse Flow in Season of  Rising `Tide'--Dialogue on Reverse Flow Phenomenon in `Tide of  Rural Labor' (Part One)"]    [Text] Editor's note: The information conveyed in  this dialogue is very valuable. On the one hand, in the "tide of  rural labor" one wave overtopped another wave, but through  correct "dredging" the flow became orderly; on the other hand, a  "reversion" phenomenon also appeared. Of course, it is normal  for a tide to rise and fall, to go out and come back in, but as  the "phenomenon of the regression of an adverse tide" it has a  fairly deep connotation. The peasants who went outside their  native places widened their horizons, changed their ideas,  increased their knowledge, and learned skills. When they  returned to their native places they became the backbone in  developing the economy. This point can help people to recognize  the positive aspect of the "tide of rural labor." Furthermore,  this information proves that the base for the broad masses of  peasants to become well-off is not the city but rather the rural  areas.    Tai: Tai Dewen (secretary of the Fuyang Prefecture CPC  Committee) Gao: Gao Lu (staff reporter)    Gao: In recent years the "tide of rural labor" has became a  big part of the landscape of China's economic and social life.  The various issues initiated by this tide have drawn widespread  attention in all circles of society. Your report on the  investigation and study of the question of the transfer of the  surplus labor force in the rural areas of Fuyang prefecture made  a deep impression on us.    Tai: Making an investigation in this aspect was necessitated  by reality and work. Fuyang Prefecture is a large-population  region with 1 percent of China's population and a large region  for traditional agriculture. Following the deepening of rural  reform, the development of the market economy, and the raising  of the degree of agricultural mechanization, the rural surplus  labor force has become larger and larger. There are now about 3  million members of the rural surplus labor force in Fuyang  Prefecture. This a superiority of our prefecture's economic  development. In 1992 our prefecture exported 1 million members  of the labor force. We cannot but consider the question of  "where the million-strong army is heading."    Gao: Of the two investigation reports you provided, I feel  that the investigation of the phenomenon of "reverse flow" in  the "tide of rural labor" was most enlightening.    Tai: In the process of investigating the question of the  transfer of rural surplus labor, we discovered that over the  past two years a phenomenon of the "regression of an adverse  tide" has appeared in exported labor. Workers, making use of the  skills they learned on the outside, have returned to their  native places and set up and run a large number of township-town  enterprises.    Gao: In what numbers and on what scale?    Tai: According to the initial investigation, there are in  the  prefecture more than 700 enterprises of this type, and they have  a certain influence and are on a considerable scale; some of  them have become the backbone of township-town enterprises on  the two levels of county and township. The township-town  enterprises set up and run by workers who were formerly exported  and who have returned to their native places are becoming a new  "growing point" in our prefecture's development of township-town  enterprises.    Gao: According to our investigations, in the provinces of  Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei, and Hebei, in some prefectures in which  there fairly many rural workers who were in the outward flow,  there has appeared in the past two years this phenomenon of the  "regression of an adverse tide." Of the more than 2,000 peasants  of Jinniu Town in Dazhi County, Hubei Province who engaged in  trade or worked outside the town, more than 700 of them have  returned to the town. It's too bad that the meaning of this  phenomenon of "regression" has not yet drawn sufficient  attention from the people.    Tai: Looking at it from the angle of the future, we see that  the development and use of this returning labor force is more  important than the current export of labor.  <H5>  Returnees: Putting Their Ability to Good Use in the Family </H5>   Gao: In your investigation of typical examples, were any  patterns discovered?    Tai: In our investigation of typical examples, we selected  throughout the prefecture 50 persons who were part of the  "regression of an adverse tide" and who set up and are running  township-town enterprises. The results of the investigation  were: 1) by age, 23 percent were in the 20-30 age bracket, 71  percent were in the 30-40 age bracket, and 6 percent were in the  over 40 age bracket; 2) by education, 35 percent had a senior  middle school education, 46 percent had a junior middle school  education, 10 percent had an elementary school education, and 9  percent were illiterate or semiliterate; 3) by time worked  outside their native places, in general this was five to 10  years; and 4) by skill level, these people have basically  mastered and even become proficient in one or more skills, about  60 percent of them when outside being the skilled backbone  elements of the units they worked in, and about 20 percent of  them when outside being both skilled backbone elements and  middle-level managerial personnel.    Gao: That is to say, among these pioneers who "regressed" to  their native places, the great majority are young and  middle-aged (more than 90 percent being in the 20-40 age  bracket), their educational level is fairly high (more than 80  percent having a junior middle school or senior middle school  education), their time outside was fairly long, and they have  mastered skills.    Tai: Shui Xinyou [3055 2450 0645], a peasant from Aiting  Town  in Linquan County, in 1987 went to work in a leather shoe  factory in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. By his practice  there he gained consumate skill, and the uppers and soles of the  shoes that he stripped could bear a strength of as much as 18  kilograms, far exceeding the ministry-issued standard; they were  given a good appraisal at a national comparison and appraisal  meeting. After staying outside his native place for six or seven  years, he returned in 1993 and set up the Aiting Leather Shoe  Factory, after which the supply of its products could not meet  the demand.    Gao: There are surely not a few such examples. In starting  an  undertaking, for these "regressors" it is indispensable to have  an eye and head for business.    Tai: For the most part, they possess a keen insight into  markets, an insight that was nurtured when they were working on  the outside. For the most part, the rural labor of our  prefecture that flowed outside went to the coastal regions,  where the market economy is fairly developed. From the time that  they began to leave their families, these people placed  themselves in the crests and troughts of the waves of the market  economy.    Gao: In an environment full of competition and risk, it is  fairly easy to learn by experience what the role of market  mechanisms is, thereby forming a consciousness of competition  and an insight into markets.    Tai: A peasant from Ningxiao Village, Wangdian Town, Fuyang  City in 1989 went to Dongyuan [a county in Guangdong Province]  to work in a furniture factory. When he returned to his native  place he discovered through a market survey that the factory's  products, in his province and neighboring provinces, had a good  market, so he set up his own furniture factory. The supply of  its products could not meet the demand for them. After being in  business for over nine months, the factory achieved an output  value of more than 520,000 yuan and obtained a net profit of  120,000 yuan. Niu Wei [3662 0251], a peasant from Guantang town,  Haozhou city, went to the Northeast to work at an agrotechnical  popularization center, where he learned the skill of duplicating  and mixing agricultural chemicals. When he learned that his  native place lacked this kind of product, he became aware that  there was a big market for it that was worth developing. He  returned to his native place and set up a chemical plant that  produced many new agricultural chemical products. The plant  achieved an annual output value of 740,000 yuan and a profits  tax of 60,000 yuan.    Gao: The "regressors" who start undertakings in their native  places are bound to form economic radiating circles with them as  the core, thereby spurring the development of the township-town  enterprises there and the entire economy there, raising the  income of peasants there, and spurring the adjustment of the  rural industrial structure there.    Tai: These radiating radii are at the least one or several  villages and at the most a dozen kilometers. Zhang Dezhi [1728  1795 5347], a peasant from Taihe County, in 1987 returned to his  native place and set up a silk mill, which now is a product base  of considerable size. More than 1,000 peasants in the county  engage in sales promotion work for the mill's products, and the  sales promotion contingent has spread to several provinces and  autonomous regions. These peasant sales-promoters have an annual  net income of at the least between 3,000 and 4,000 yuan and at  the most over 10,000 yuan. Examples of this kind are  innumerable. There is now gradually being formed a new pattern  in the village and district economy that has the "regressor"  pioneers at its core and that breaks through regional boundaries.  <H5>  Reasons for Return: Unlimited Analysis </H5>   Gao: Of the peasants who went outside their native places to  engage in trade or work and who then "regressed" to their native  places and started undertakings, some either returned to the  "yellow earth," which is a follow-up phenomenon that is bound to  accompany the "tide of rural labor." What is needed is to  investigate and study many questions. First of all, the  exciting cause of their reverse flow or "regression" must be  made clear, and then action can be adroitly guided according to  circumstances.    Tai: In our investigation we discovered that the exciting  cause of the "regression" was many-sided. Thinking of one's  parents with affection, being reluctant to be away from home,  and loving one's native place are one of the subjective reasons.  Deng Min [6772 2404], a peasant from Gongdian Town, Lixing  County, and more than 10 other young women from neighboring  villages together went to Wenling in Zhejiang Province to work,  but because their feelings of affection for their parents became  stronger each passing day, one by one they returned home.  Unwilling to return home and still be poor, Deng Min returned to  her native place in 1993 and facilitated the setting up of a  handicraft knitwear mill as a joint venture between the local  government and Zhejiang Province, with herself as mill director.  The mill has now achieved an output value of many ten thousands  of yuan and a profit tax of over 80,000 yuan. Zhang Qi [1728  3825] and Zhang Fangli [1728 7685 0448], peasant sisters from  Yangchao Town, Yungshang Province, went to Changshu County in  Jiangsu Province to work at knitting gloves. Their incomes were  sizable, but they also thought of their parents with affection,  so they returned home and, raising money by all possible means,  led their seven sisters to set up a household glove factory. In  the bodies of Chinese peasants are imbedded strong genes for  feelings for their relationships and for feelings for their  native land. "Every happy festival time I double my thoughts of  affection for my parents," "I feel like going back to my native  place, just as the stranger bird thinks of his native forest,"  "Lifting my head I gaze at the bright moon; lowering my head I  long for my native place"--These lines of poetry reveal this set  of circumstances.    Gao: When encountering setbacks or rough spots in human  relationships, work, hardships, or other aspects, the language  barrier and the difference in living habits will, because of the  inhibition of the spirit, intensify the thoughts of affection  for one's parents and the love of one's home. This is man's  natural reaction or his reaction under certain circumstances.    Tai: Next, the raising of the level of demand is also one of  the exciting causes of this "regression." Following their  increase in income, for those who work outside their native  place the pressure of the requirement for survival lessens day  by day, and the pressure of safety requirement, emotional  requirement, social requirement, and requirement for realization  of self-worth becomes stronger day by day. They become  dissatisfied with the lifestyle of drifting all over the  country; and they hope to get greater respect, hope to get for  their worth fuller realization and social recognition. Returning  home and starting an undertaking become the optimum choice for  satisfying these requirements.</p>

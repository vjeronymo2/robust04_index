			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has made its position clear that  India will support nonproliferation measures which are  universal, comprehensive, nondiscriminatory, and verifiable.  The minister of state for external affairs, R.L. Bhatia,  informed the members in the lower house of parliament today that  New Delhi has expressed deep concern to the U.S. Administration  at the proposed transfer of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. He said  during the visit to India, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,  Mr. Strobe Talbott, was told that the transfer of such  sophisticated aircraft to Pakistan will necessitate that India  reappraise its own defense capabilities and take adequate steps  to safeguard its security.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: L.A., LET MAGNOLIA BE MAGNOLIA  </P> <P> "Look Out Melrose! Magnolia Boulevard Is on the Way."  </P> <P> That arresting slogan on a bus stop sign in North Hollywood advertises one of  the more controversial civic face-lifts ever undertaken by Mayor Tom Bradley,  the Los Angeles City Council and the Community Redevelopment Agency. If the  city succeeds, the San Fernando Valley's dowdy old Magnolia Boulevard will be  transformed into another Melrose Avenue, L.A.'s world famous street of funky  and smart shops, restaurants and theaters.  </P> <P> North Hollywood business people and property owners dreamed up the idea more  than a decade ago. Government, they said, should step in and clean up the  slums. Councilman Joel Wachs took up their cause and pushed the North Hollywood  Redevelopment Project through the council.  </P> <P> It's not cheap. Last year, the CRA spent $44 million to buy land, subsidize  developers' construction projects, draw up plans and pay bureaucrats' salaries.  </P> <P> And not everyone thinks North Hollywood is blighted.  </P> <P> Take Eddie Searles, who does occasional work as a movie stuntman, even though  he's long past his 70th birthday. The back closet of his house, near Magnolia,  is filled with costumes and vintage clothes. The yard is littered with old cars  and motorcycles. Hire Eddie's car, motorcycle or costumes and you also get  Eddie as a stuntman. He shares the house with his wife, Othelia, who makes  wigs. They also raise a few chickens.  </P> <P> The CRA wants their lot for a shopping center. The agency offered the Searles  $232,000. If they don't accept the offer, the CRA has said it will force them  to sell, using its powers of eminent domain.  </P> <P> "If I lose the place, it kills me," Searles said as we sat in his front room  several days ago. ". . . I couldn't get a place like this for $232,000."  </P> <P> The CRA says that the Searles and a few other dissenters are a minority. As  evidence, they cite continued votes of confidence from something called the  Project Area Committee. Residents elect these 25-member committees in  redevelopment areas to give the CRA grass-roots advice.  </P> <P> Searles and the other dissidents contend that the North Hollywood Project Area  rigs its elections and is dominated by the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.  "I went to vote and presented my drivers' license," one property owner told me.  "I always have presented my driver's license (to prove eligibility to vote).  This time, they said they needed my tax bills and utility bills."  </P> <P> Two city council members, Richard Allatore and Gloria Molina, have promised to  look into the allegations.  </P> <P> What the council members fear is that there might not be support for the  redevelopment project. And without that support, a fundamental question arises:  Why redevelop Magnolia Boulevard at all?  </P> <P> I walked down the Valley's Melrose-to-be Monday. I parked nearby on Lankershim  Boulevard, in front of a plain one-story building housing the West Coast  Detectives World Headquarters. It was obvious what the CRA and the business  people envision for Magnolia. A tall, sleek CRA-sponsored office, hotel and  apartment complex that will include the home of the Academy of Television Arts  and Science that already is being built. Farther on is Magnolia Towers, a CRA  low-rent development for seniors.  </P> <P> Also on Magnolia, though, Western Surplus was selling guns, ammo and clothes --  nothing more fashionable than L.A. Gear shoes. Down the street was the Survival  Store, which displayed in its window such books as "The Art Of Getting Even --  The Do It Yourself Justice Manual," "Combat: House to House," and "Hardcore  Poaching." Down the street were the North Hollywood Billiards Parlor and three  stores selling used clothes. A few doors away was T-Wheels &amp; Deals,  advertising tires as low as $1.85.  </P> <P> Of course, the real Melrose Avenue wasn't so chic a few years ago. Then  interior decorator shops moved east from West Hollywood into Los Angeles.  Clothing shops and restaurants followed. Melrose Avenue redeveloped itself, or  at least private enterprise did. No tax dollars were needed.  </P> <P> The point is, these neighborhood transformations sometimes just happen  naturally in cities. And they work better that way. Melrose Avenue is more fun  than the CRA's downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Leave Magnolia alone, and the fashionable people may someday discover Kathy's  Vintages and Razamataz, a second-hand clothing store. And nearby, that small  used book store on Lankershim may yet attract the literati.  </P> <P> And until that happens, Magnolia Boulevard will still be of value. Where else  can you buy a tire for $1.85?  </P></p>

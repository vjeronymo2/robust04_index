			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican silver close to melt-down - Low prices are threatening many mines MEXICO'S SILVER industry is facing crisis. 'Everything you see out there is due to silver' says Mr Raul Rodriguez Marquez, planning minister in the once fabulously rich Mexican state of Zacatecas. 'Now, what's certain, and it's no secret, mines are going to close.' Mexico is the world's largest silver producer, accounting for about one seventh of total output. But the silver industry, once the backbone of the country's economy, with production sustaining both New and Old Spain for more than two centuries, is now in trouble. World silver prices tumbled from more than USDollars 50 a troy ounce in 1980 when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market, to an average of Dollars 7 an ounce in 1987 and about Dollars 3.90 in the first quarter of this year, though a recent recovery has since lifted it above the Dollars 4.20 mark. Hundreds of smaller mines have already been closed or restructured, forcing thousands out of work. Mr Jaime Lomelin of the Penoles group, the largest silver producer in the world, reckons that no more than 20 low-cost Mexican mines will survive the current shake-out. Given current prices, his group has stopped exploring for more silver. Earlier this month, the governor of the state of Zacatecas announced closure of the mine at Real de Angeles - the largest open pit silver mine in the world, with annual production of about 250 tonnes. With it would go some 400 to 500 jobs directly and another 800 indirectly. Mexican mines are particularly sensitive to low silver prices because they tend to produce silver as a primary or co-product with currently loss-making metals such as lead or zinc, whereas, say in the US, the second largest silver producer, mines generally extract silver as a by-product of copper, which is still just about profitable. Mr Jose I. Villanueva, director-general in Mexico's ministry of energy, mines, and state industries, says: 'I think we are at the limit. A price of around Dollars 3.60 would make any company in the world worry'. He warns that production could crash if prices do not rise. Until recently, the worst affected in Mexico had been the hundreds of small mines and the individual miners who scour the landscape looking for silver and other metallic ores. Mr Rodriguez Marquez, the head of planning, mines and tourism in the state of Zacatecas, says in his state alone about 80 to 90 out of some 270 small mines have closed in recent years. The Penoles group has closed down seven of its smaller mines in the past five years while increasing production in the 11 larger, minerally richer ones. The small mines have the highest costs, often little access to capital and no liquidity - a bad year would put them out of business. The new satellite technology that allows large mining companies to detect silver deposits under the ground is rendering much of their explorative work redundant. Up to now overall Mexican silver production has held up, thanks to greater efficiency in the larger mines - which account for about 85 per cent of production. Mr Lomelin says his remaining mines produce at some of the lowest costs in the world and could survive at a silver price of Dollars 3.50 an ounce. However, with the imminent closure of Real de Angeles, the mining ministry expects non-refined output this year to fall to 1,805 tonnes, from 2,098 last year, and 2,290 in 1991. The mine at Real de Angeles, owned 51 per cent by Empresa Frisco of Grupo Carso, and 49 per cent by the Canadian company Placer Dome, is closing principally because of lower silver prices, and recent falls in prices of the mine's by-products, zinc and lead. But after more than 10 years of intensive exploitation, the quality of the ore has deteriorated, while the cost of refining has increased three times, and reserves were falling. Mr Carlos Slim, the president of Grupo Carso, says the closure is temporary, while prices of silver and metallic bi-products remain low. The company will continue to look for silver in the area, and Real de Angeles will be kept in operating condition in case silver prices rise again. 'What is irrational,' says Mr Slim, 'is to carry on taking out silver when losing money on operations while also reducing your reserves.' The closure will leave two neighbouring towns of Noria de Angeles and Real de Angeles without any source of employment. 'It is going to hit us very hard. Almost the entire population of the area worked there,' says Mr Marquez. 'The region is not fertile, the rain is not generous and the people are accustomed to working in just one industry.' Among the villagers of Real de Angeles there is bitter resentment at the treatment they have received at the hands of the government and mining company. The village itself was moved from the old site to make way for the mine in 1981 - but the promised riches residents felt they were going to receive never materialised. The mine has already cut the labour force from 2,500 in 1987 to 500. 'They were supposed to compensate us,' says Mr Marco Antonio Mora, a 24-year-old who once worked at the mine. 'But what they gave us was not that much.' The village's new houses have been built with aluminium roofs, making them like ovens in the summer, and in place of the promised gardens and patios is a large dusty gravel square. Many worry that the town will die when the mine closes and, they fear, the water is cut off.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Testing personal capital Yorkshire Enterprise, one of the longer-established venture capital funds in the English regions, is using psychometric testing on entrepreneurs asking for finance and help in growing their businesses. The tests, which assess personality, motivation and inter-personal skills, are being used where teamwork and team building are essential to business development. Trained consultants administer the tests and interpret the results. Peter Claydon, YE's commercial director, says: 'We are not basing our decisions entirely on what the tests reveal, but we use them to confirm views we may have formed in interviews.' Testing has been used six times in the last nine months, three times involving new funds and the rest on business development, involving adding more people to a management team. The sixth proposal was turned down. 'I wouldn't say it was because of the tests, but they certainly underlined the worries we had,' Claydon says. YE invests in the Pounds 100,000-Pounds 250,000 range. About a third of its 150 investments have resulted in healthy exits through trade sales or buy-backs by their managements. A third are still active with YE as a hands-on investor, but the rest have failed. There is a marked reluctance to back one-person managements nowadays, so team quality and relationships are critical. 'Small businesses need a consensus builder to lead them, complemented by a completer-finisher,' Claydon adds. 'Growing companies usually need a chairman who can stand back and conciliate, a shaper of policy and a resource gatherer. 'In the history of management buy-outs and buy-ins, there seems a critical period after about three years. If the team is not complementary within itself, this is when the strains tell and things start falling apart. Testing looks like a good early warning system.'</p>

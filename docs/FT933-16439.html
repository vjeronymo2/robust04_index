			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: In search of happy bellringers - Neil Buckley reports on the plans of a revitalised retailer BY THE exit of one of Asda's newly-revamped stores at Wolstanton, near Stoke, is a customer satisfaction bell. Shoppers are invited to 'ring the bell and keep us smiling if you've had good service'. Shareholders might already be ringing the bell for Asda's new management team, headed by Mr Archie Norman. The severe financial difficulties the chain found itself in at the end of the 1980s have been largely solved. Net debt has been reduced from more than Pounds 700m when Mr Norman took over, to Pounds 76m, helped by the sale of Asda's stake in MFI, the furniture retailer, Pounds 57m of site disposals, and a Pounds 347m rights issue. Mr Norman has set a clear strategy of keeping the Asda chain to 200 stores and redesigning and rebuilding existing stores. The company has abandoned its disastrous late-1980s strategy of trying to be another Sainsbury or Safeway. It is returning to its roots, aiming to 'satisfy the weekly shopping needs of ordinary working people and their families'. The 'Asda Price' slogan has been revived, with the aim of beating prices at Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco by 3 or 4 per cent. The chain is also experimenting in four stores with a new discount format called Dales. The key to success will now be whether Asda can attract shoppers back to its stores. It has already had some success. Like-for-like sales growth of 2 per cent last year was better than any of the big three. It is putting its hopes in its store renewal programme. Four stores have already been refitted and 40 more will undergo the treatment this year, at a cost of about Pounds 95m. The five-year-old Asda at Wolstanton was the first example. Asda spent Pounds 2.3m last August turning it from a somewhat dark and cluttered place into a light and airy flagship, installing new lighting, signing, and fittings. It also moved fresh foods to the store entrance, replacing the bottles of detergent and car accessories which used to greet shoppers. As important as the physical changes were the managerial ones. Several layers of management were removed and staff divided into 25 teams covering different product areas. Each team runs its area as a business, and is given weekly and daily sales figures, as well as information on items such as wage and wastage costs. The teams are experimenting with adjusting the product mix, and in many cases reducing the range. Mr Norman said yesterday he believed Asda, whose superstores used to carry more than 20,000 product lines, had become 'over-ranged'. The total might be reduced by as much as 20 per cent. Wolstanton's management believes it has taken sales from nearby Tesco and Sainsbury superstores, and Asda's four 'renewal' stores have seen sales increase by about 20 per cent since their refits. Mr Norman said he expected to see similar results from all 40 renewal stores this year. Forty minutes down the M6 is an example of the other prong in Asda's programme. At Tipton, a 20-year-old superstore has been converted into a Dales discount outlet. Asda spent Pounds 2m on ripping out the false ceiling to create more of a 'shed' environment, and installing warehouse shelving. Dales carries only 7,000 lines, the margin structure is 'significantly lower' than Asda, and prices are about 12 per cent lower than the big three superstore operators. That puts prices on a similar level to those at Kwik Save, the UK's largest discount food chain, but Dales has twice the range. Again, emphasis is placed on fresh food, which accounts for about a third of the range, and which many discount stores cut to a minimum because of the high costs and special skills involved. 'You could argue that what we are doing (at Dales) is going back to Asda's roots,' said Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director. 'But we are trying to make it classless. We want to put across the idea of good value without festooning the roof with Day-glo signs.' Dales' sober white-washed walls and airy feel may not accord with the public's traditional view of discounting. Yet the format is showing promise. Tipton is thought to have taken sales both from a nearby Kwik Save, and from Tesco. Volumes in the Dales conversions have increased significantly, and Asda plans to open two new Dales this year in south-east England, one on a new site at Sittingbourne, Kent, and one in a converted DIY superstore in Hertfordshire. Eventually, Mr Norman said, Dales might provide the avenue for the group's physical expansion. With saturation in the food market increasing, the Asda format itself is unlikely to grow. Once the renewal programme is complete, Asda will rely for profits growth on constantly improving its performance, along the lines of Marks and Spencer, rather than through constant expansion, like Sainsbury or Tesco. It is an ambitious vision. Mr Archie Norman has yet to prove if he can deliver, and keep that satisfaction bell ringing.</p>

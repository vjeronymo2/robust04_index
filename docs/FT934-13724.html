			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Movies bolster Time Warner TIME Warner, the largest US entertainment group, yesterday posted an 8 per cent improvement in underlying earnings for the third quarter. It attributed the advance partly to the popularity of Warner Brothers' summer movies. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation climbed to Dollars 726m, on revenues of Dollars 3.7bn, against earnings of Dollars 675m and revenues of Dollars 3.5bn in the third quarter of 1992. However, the operating results exclude the effect of Time Warner's heavy debt burden and high non-cash amortisation charges associated with the formation of the group in 1989. With these factors included, the group remained in the red, though its net loss narrowed to Dollars 136m, or 36 cents, against Dollars 152, or 41 cents, in the 1992 quarter. The improvement partly reflects the benefits of the group's redemption of some preferred stock in February, and the exchange for other preferred shares for debt in April. On the operating level, four of the group's five divisions reported record earnings. The film business turned in record earnings of Dollars 204m, against Dollars 185m a year ago, with the division's 1992 results restated to reflect Time Warner Entertainment's purchase last month of the remaining 50 per cent of Six Flags theme parks. Warner Brothers led the film industry in US box office receipts this summer, with The Fugitive, starring Harrison Ford, generating Dollars 172m in ticket sales. The music division also had its best quarter, with Dollars 428m in earnings. US sales of recorded music and worldwide sales of music publishing rights were higher.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah and Yasir Zari'] </F>   [Text] Reliable sources have revealed some very important  information to AL-'ARABI, which is being published for the first  time, about a long series of contacts between Israel and the  groups carrying out religious violence in Egypt during the last  five years. Approximately 30 contacts have been monitored by  the security service in this country.    AL-'ARABI has secured a letter confirming these contacts and  asking the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to provide Israeli researchers  and research centers with specialized information on the results  of secret contacts with these groups, in particular with the  al-Jihad organization.    Israeli attempts to contact these groups in Egypt started in  1989. These contacts used to take place under the slogan of  information and press dialogues.    The Israeli researchers used to introduce themselves to the  members of the religious groups as reporters for Western media  organization. The following is what happened in a contact  monitored by the Egyptian security service in the summer of 1989  with a student in the School of Agriculture at Cairo University:    He was a prominent member of the Islamic group at the  University. An Israeli researcher succeeded in introducing  himself to the student as a correspondent for the German  magazine DER SPIEGEL. Through this student, the Israeli  researcher managed to meet a large number of members of the  group who were also members of the Student Union.    In 1990 an Israeli journalist from the magazine HA'OLAM HAZE  visited Imbabah accompanied by a member of the Islamic group.  The latter knew the real identity of the journalist. The  Israeli journalist met in Imbabah with a large number of leading  figures from the group and learned about their activities there.  This journalist resided in Egypt many weeks during which he  managed, through another member of the Islamic group who at that  time was training to become a journalist in a newspaper that  labels itself Islamic, to meet with leaders of the group in the  Governorate of al-Minya. He met with these leaders after a  seminar that he attended with them at the Sudanese Student  Union's headquarters in Cairo and after the sectarian sedition  incidents in Abu Qurqas in al-Minya Governorate in 1991. A  lawyer called M.W., who is also a member of the Islamic group,  accompanied a number of Israeli researchers to the city of Abu  Qurqas after he learned of their true identity. This caused a  serious dispute between the leaders of the group in al-Minya  regarding contacts with Israelis. In this dispute, one group  defended contacts with the Israelis under the pretext that the  call also targets the Jews since they are the People of the Book.    The document that AL-'ARABI has procured reveals an  important aspect of the Israeli contacts with the religious  groups in Egypt and the U.S.-Israeli cooperation in this field.  In the summer of 1991 an Israeli researcher from the Gustav  Heineman Institute, which is part of Haifa University, held many  meetings with members of the Islamic groups. He also met with a  number of leaders of a group called the Husam al-Battuti group,  which has seceded from the al-Jihad group in Bani Suwayf led by  a man named Majdi Kamal. In this context, we have the  "document," which is really a letter from the director of the  Asian and African Studies Center of the Heineman Institute dated  5 September 1992 to an American researcher named Dr. Harold  Marthuni from the University of California. The letter refers  to the meetings mentioned earlier that the Israeli researcher  held. The literal translation of the letter is as follows:    "Dear Dr. Harold, (5 September 1992)    "We thank you for the valuable documents you provided to the  Israeli researchers in Cairo. In fact, we are looking for a  different kind of cooperation. Our colleague Dr. Dick Bergman  contacted some of these fundamentalists who took him to the home  of one of them in the city of Bani Suwayf. They presented him  with documents similar to your papers on the concept of judging  the state authorities as heretical. However, our researchers  doubted the results of all the contacts. This is why we asked  our embassies to mediate with the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to  inform us of the results of their contacts with the al-Jihad  group in particular. We also hope for your cooperation in this  framework. In addition, we hope you will place the study you  are currently carrying out on the agenda of the special seminar  we are holding in cooperation with your renowned university.    "Thank you    "[Signed] Gavri'el Warburg, director of the institute"    The value of the letter lies in the fact that it shows the  tip of the iceberg on this subject. It notes the visit by one  of the most famous Israeli researchers on Egyptian matters to  Cairo. This researcher is Dick Bergman, the researcher at the  African and Asian Studies Center of the Heineman Institute. His  objective was to prepare a field study on the religious groups  in Egypt.    The sources confirm that some of the reasons that prompted  the Israeli researchers to doubt Bergman's results were the fact  that some of the people he met with who belong to the Islamic  groups confirmed that they might agree to accept Israel in the  region as soon as they assume power. According to him, they  consider the ruling regime to be further away from God than the  Jews, since the Jews are the People of the Book.    The sources confirm that the Israelis were very careful  about  getting the largest amount of information possible from the  Americans regarding their meetings with the religious groups in  Egypt, especially after they learned that these contacts  continued outside of Egypt after the contacts between these  groups and the U.S. Embassy were revealed.    Proceeding from an American proposal, the Israelis organized  a research roundtable in June 1993 at Haifa University. Four of  the most prominent U.S. researchers specializing in studying the  fundamentalist groups in the region and Egypt took part in this  roundtable, in addition to Israeli researchers from the Gustav  Heineman Institute.    The sources confirm that this roundtable went on for three  days, during which they discussed and analyzed all the reports  and U.S.-Israeli contacts with members of religious groups in  Egypt. Researchers who participated in this roundtable explored  the various scenarios that could be expected from the contacts  and changes in behavior of the religious groups toward Israel  should they assume power in Egypt.</p>

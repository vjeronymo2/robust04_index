			<p>BFN     [Text] The pro-western wing in the Jordanian Government has  temporarily scored a partial success when it was decided to  resume the Jordanian-Israeli talks in Washington today, Monday,  and to reinvigorate the Jordanian-American-Israeli economic  cooperation committee at the same time.    AL-MAJD has learned that this pro-western team, which claims  concern for Jordanian interests, has sought the help of its  friends in Washington, London, and elsewhere during the past two  weeks in order to pressure the higher Jordanian authorities into  abandoning the option of comprehensive solution, easing  political and economic rapprochement with Syria and Lebanon,  and, consequently, reactivating negotiations and normalization  with the Israeli enemy and the Gaza-Jericho protectorate.    AL-MAJD has also learned that the higher authorities, known  for their ability to deal with crises, have reluctantly given  the pro- western team partial freedom to secure some sort of  balance in Jordan's relations with the neighboring states on the  eve of King Husayn's visit to Washington.    According to reliable sources, AL-MAJD can emphasize that  Jordan will not go too far in its political and economic talks  with the Israeli enemy and 'Arafat, and that the strategic  option of the higher Jordanian authorities is still that of  adherence to Arab coordination and attainment of a comprehensive  solution.    AL-MAJD can also affirm that the higher authorities will not  risk signing a separate peace treaty with the enemy as desired  by the Israeli-American alliance--an alliance that is seeking to  weaken the Arab negotiating position by attracting Jordan,  terrorizing Lebanon, and singling out Syria.</p>

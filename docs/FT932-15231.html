			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading HOPES of further reductions in interest rates and a feeling that the UK economic recovery was at last on the way together led to an active day derivatives trading, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the strong opening in dealings in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,846 - some 11 points above its close last Thursday - was clear evidence of the positive mood in the market. The contract advanced steadily throughout the morning, pulling the underlying equity market higher along the way, though turnover remained thin. By 12.30pm the June contract was trading at the day's high of 2,870. A period of sideways trading then followed but the June contract continued to trade at the higher levels boosted by the firm opening on Wall Street but a slight bout of profit-taking was seen towards the close. The June contract finished at 2,865, up 34 on its previous close and around 9 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 11. Turnover was poor with a mere 6,328 lots dealt by the close. In traded options, volume reached 29,715 lots, with 8,512 contracts of that total dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and 5,071 lots in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Among stock options, Glaxo was the most active with a day's total of 2,437 trades. It was followed by J Sainsbury at 1,596.</p>

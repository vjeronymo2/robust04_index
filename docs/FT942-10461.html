			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (24): Invisible energy from 'the hot sun' - Andrew Jack on the informal economy Mwangi drives his battered green Peugeot between Nyeri and Nairobi four times a day, squeezing in eight passengers - plus additional children wrapped around the gear lever - at Ks200-250 each in his high-speed 'matatu' or shared taxi. He pays a commission of about Ks100 a trip to the office, which provides his customers, insurance of Ks24,000 a year and a road licence fee. He hopes in a few years to have saved enough to open a butcher's or a car repair shop. He also pays no tax. Mwangi is one of hundreds of thousands of Kenyans not readily visible to the authorities in their business activities, and yet who are responsible for much of the heat of the economy. Drive around any city, and the presence of the informal economy is ubiquitous: the presence of the informal economy is ubiquitous: hawkers, hovering in the road at traffic-lights or street corners, offering flowers or magazines for sale; temporary lean-to shacks in industrial areas selling food and drink at lunchtimes; sellers of secondhand clothes lined up in makeshift markets. There is even a Swahili phrase for the sector: Jua Kali. Literally, it means 'hot sun' - a reference to the sheet-metal workers and car mechanics who traditionally have bashed away at road-side stalls or under trees, hardly protected from the heat. But there is an enormous official ambivalence towards the sector. On the one hand, the government has recognised in innumerable documents and plans that the jua kali sector is an essential element within the economy, and one that needs to be fostered. On the other, there are innumerable instances in practice of the premises of jua kali workers being demolished and the individuals concerned driven away by city councils in response to demands by landowners to clear patches of land. 'Most entrepreneurs see the city as their enemy, not as city fathers. If you drive a city van into the jua kali areas, everyone runs away,' says Kimanthi Mutua, managing director of the Kenyan rural enterprise programme, a charity which has provided more than 16,000 loans totalling over Ks160m in the past four years. Part of the problem is that the phrase is now used so widely - to encompass the original mechanics, retailers, the informal sector or black market, or all 'micro' or small and even medium-sized enterprises  - that it is impossible to readily summarise its characteristics. 'It is unfortunate that jua kali is sometimes used to mean something sub-standard,' says Mr Mutua. 'These workers serve a big proportion of the population. They are an important source of quality employment and a nursery for larger businesses.' However, it is a sector that is little understood and defies easy enumeration. A study completed in March attempted for the first time to assess the significance of micro and small businesses within the country. The 'Gemini' study (Growth and equity through microenterprise investments and institutions) concluded that previous calculations had under-estimated the size by more than a third. It suggested that there are 910,000 such enterprises, occupying 2m people, many based in people's homes and 99 per cent with one to 10 workers. Most are agriculturally-based and in rural areas. Nearly half are controlled by women, and few seek formal sources of credit. They are adding 270,000 jobs a year, and 38 per cent are expanding. These figures are borne out by the work of a number of non-government organisations which have been providing support to the sector. Promotion of Rural Initiatives and Development Enterprises (Pride) has been offering credit-support and training to the sector since the late 1980s. Jonathan Campaigne, managing director, stresses that he sees himself as an entrepreneur first, and that Pride's activities are essentially commercial and profit-making. He despairs of the approach of some to encourage enterprise, when he believes it is already available in abundance within the country through the informal sector. An increasing number of development agencies are now focusing attention on the informal sector, including the US Agency for International Development - which helped fund the Gemini study - and the UK's Overseas Development Administration. More controversially, the World Bank has approved a Dollars 24m programme of vouchers to assist training for the sector. 'Recognition of the jua kali sector is overdone,' says Mr Mutua. 'We are all crying for action.' He highlights three areas of greatest political need. The first is premises, and ways in which the authorities allocate and recognise land where workers can build workshops. 'I am convinced the shanties in the cities would disappear if they were given land,' he says. The second is licensing. 'There needs to be streamlining to recognise the needs of the sector, rather than two or three different departments with contradictory requirements,' he says, adding that licences are generally seen simply as a costly hindrance to many traders. Third is what he calls measures to develop an 'enabling environment' for the sector: incentives, financial support, anti red-tape measures and legislation to tackle hindrances to the support of small business. Other than that, he says, government might do best to 'leave well alone'.</p>

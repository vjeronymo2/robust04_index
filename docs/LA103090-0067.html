			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Just in Time for Sweeps: Michael Tuck, who began as KCBS Channel 2's 6 p.m.  anchor less than two months ago, will begin offering commentaries on Southern  California issues every weeknight on the station's 11 p.m. newscast, beginning  this week. Tuck came to KCBS from the ABC affiliate in San Diego, where he also  regularly expressed his opinions on the air, won several awards and generated a  good deal of controversy. KCBS has not had on-air commentaries since Bill Stout  died last year. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

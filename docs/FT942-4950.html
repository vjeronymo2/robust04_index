			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philips leaves darks days behind  -The semiconductor side is investing again After years of cost-cutting, the semiconductor division of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is spending again as it celebrates a return to profitability. Philips is even considering a new chip factory, which could cost up to Dollars 1bn. If built, it would represent the largest single investment by the company since its financial crisis began in 1990. A decision on the plant is expected later this year - but the fact that such a large investment is being contemplated underscores the change in fortunes at Europe's biggest semiconductor maker. Even without the plant, Philips is aiming to double investments in fixed assets this year, to around Fl 600m (Dollars 325m) from Fl 300m in 1993, according to Mr Doug Dunn, who is about to mark his first anniversary as head of Philips' semiconductor business. He was formerly managing director of GEC Plessey Semi-conductors. Expenditure on research and development is set to remain at 15 per cent of sales, although this will rise in absolute terms because of an expected sharp increase in the division's turnover during the next few years. Besides stepping up investments, Mr Dunn says he wants to pursue swift sales growth, putting an end to the bad times of the early 1990s when the division concentrated on retrenchment. Recalling his arrival at Philips' semiconductor division, Mr Dunn notes: 'The organisation had been focused - quite properly, as you have to be for survival - not on growth, but on cost-cutting, cost-cutting and more cost-cutting.' Philips' return to heavier investment in semiconductors is a milestone for the division and a welcome turnround from 1990, when the group abandoned pilot production of one-megabit static random access memory (S-Ram) chips. It did this to staunch the drain of cash into a project that had generated prestige but produced heavy losses. Semiconductors returned to profitability in 1992. The rise became more pronounced in 1993 and, in the 1994 first quarter, continued to strengthen. Precise figures for semiconductors, which are part of the components and semiconductors product sector, are not published. However, the components and semiconductors sector as a whole was the group's biggest earner in the first quarter, contributing Fl 372m of total group operating profit of Fl 695m. It edged out lighting as the company's traditional 'cash cow'. Philips does not dispute Dataquest's estimate that 1993 sales of semiconductors amounted to around Fl 4.1bn. On profitability, Mr Dunn will say only that margins are clearly in double digits. 'When it comes down to income from operations, or profit, we are the best in Europe, and very close to the best in the world,' he says. The business generates enough cash to pay for investments, including the possible chip factory. However, Mr Dunn stresses that a completely new plant is not the only option, and he has yet to present any one plan to the group's board. One alternative would be to increase capacity at Philips' plant in the Dutch town of Nijmegen, where there is still some vacant space. This, however, would not produce as much extra capacity as a new plant. Mr Dunn said Philips might also consider building the plant with other semiconductor makers, thereby spreading the cost. The plant could be built anywhere in the world, he added. Philips currently has chip factories in the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, France and the US, as well as assembly operations in several locations in Asia. The division's return to profit is partly due to the general industry upswing. However, the rebound at Philips is also the result of an internal shake-up by Mr Dunn's predecessor, Mr Heinz Hagmeister, who cut operating costs by Fl 500m a year and pruned unprofitable products, roughly halving Philip's range of semiconductors and integrated circuits to some 20,000 products. Philips' strong growth in semiconductors has been achieved in spite of the company's absence from the market's two fastest-growing segments, memory chips and micro-processors destined for personal computers. This absence is a legacy of Philips' own withdrawal from PCs, plus the halt to S-Ram development. The company, however, has profited from its strength in chips for computer peripherals, and in products for mobile communications. Another best-selling item is the '1-chip TV', an electronics component used in advanced television sets. 'We are still astonished by demand for this chip, and we still are struggling to meet our customers' expections and, indeed, we cannot meet their expectations in quantity terms,' he says. In spite of the division's improvements, there are still challenges to be met. One goal is to develop expertise in memory chips with imbedded logic for signal processing, in keeping with the television set's development as a multimedia machine based on digital rather than analog signals. 'We have a straight choice of developing these ourselves or doing a licence (deal),' he says. Another priority, according to Mr Dunn, is to improve Philips' identification of marketing opportunities and to come up with solutions demanded by the marketplace. 'We're feeling very pleased with ourselves, but we can do even better,' he says.</p>

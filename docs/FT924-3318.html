			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Public pay throws up quirks MANY public-sector workers are expected to receive pay increases of more than the government limit of 1.5 per cent next year because automatic incremental rises, linked to seniority, will be paid to some groups in addition to their basic pay rise. Union leaders have criticised some of the anomalies in the implementation of the pay squeeze which may also mean that some workers will get less than 1.5 per cent. Mr Jack Dromey, a national secretary with the TGWU general union, said: 'The implementation of this squeeze is shot full of inconsistencies - they're just making it up as they go along.' Mr Dromey cited the fact that the 70,000 industrial civil servants will receive bonuses and special recruitment payments in addition to the 1.5 per cent while workers in the executive agencies will have to include performance bonuses within the 1.5 per cent ceiling. The extent to which performance pay will be included in, or additional to, the limit is not always clear. The pay review body covering nurses has been asked not to proceed with its investigation of performance pay over the next 12 months. That means nurses will continue to receive incremental rises as they move up the seniority scale. For civil servants, the situation is much less clear, as most groups have recently agreed new performance pay arrangements. Union leaders hope that any performance pay will be on top of the minimum rise. Inland Revenue staff are in a particularly anomalous position as they have no pay agreement at all. The main tax union, the IRSF, is negotiating a new one, but relations with the Inland Revenue have been put under strain by market testing. The union is organising an industrial action ballot against market testing. In local government, the employers have been discussing various options from a total freeze to targeting most of the increase on the lower-paid. The most likely outcome, though, is a 1.5 per cent rise across the board, with normal incremental rises for white-collar staff. For many local authorities, redundancies will still be required because the government has built in an assumption of job reductions into its pay bill calculations. In the NHS, the new hospital and ambulance trusts, which have the freedom to set local pay and conditions for newly recruited staff, appear ready to toe the government's line on pay. West Dorset Mental Health NHS Trust, which this year agreed a local performance-related deal with unions, which also abolished annual increments, said: 'We will not increase our total wage bill by more than 1.5 per cent, and how we distribute that will be a matter of negotiations with the unions.' Northumbria Ambulance Trust, among the most radical in its approach to local pay and conditions, said it had not started negotiations for next year but would work within the 1.5 per cent limit. Earlier this year, before the government set the 1.5 per cent limit, personnel officers from trusts expressed anxiety about levels of nationally determined pay awards. Traditionally those have been at the top end of pay rises. The national association of health service personnel said that trusts might be faced with choosing pay or jobs if forced to pay awards recommended by pay review bodies.</p>

Sources said the  moderate Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) of Kemal Burkay and  other peaceful movements which had joined the DEP in the past  are considering setting up a separate party.    Party sources told the TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] on Thursday  that the executive assembly had met in order to decide the fate  of the DEP, which is expected to be closed down by the court at  the end of April. The Constitutional Court, which was scheduled  to decide on the closure next week, recently gave an additional  five weeks to the party's attorneys to prepare their defense.    Referring to the imprisonment of five DEP deputies by the  Ankara State Security Court, the party's acting chairman, Remzi  Kartal, said on Thursday that this was an act "placing the  Kurdish problem in prison."    He accused political leaders of adopting a negative attitude  toward the DEP and said President Suleyman Demirel had given the  signal "for the sentence to be passed."    The DEP was first established under the name of the Peoples'  Labor Party (HEP) and after this was closed down by the  Constitutional Court. It reopened as the Freedoms and Labor  Party (OZDEP), which was also closed down.    In the new debate, party executives and the grassroots are  discussing whether Turkey would tolerate the creation of a new  party and how measures will be taken to protect party executives  from being subject to political bans. If a decision to continue  activities on the political platform is made, the DEP is  expected to announce that it has "expelled" all of its  provincial and district executives to avoid any legal action  against them when the closure takes place. Deputies of the DEP  who were members of the party when charges were filed against it  will automatically lose their parliamentary status and face  trial.    Sources told the TDN that there were some DEP members who  were supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) and who  wanted to create their own political--and legal--party.  Supporters of the Hevgirtin [Unity] group and the Rizgari  [Liberation] movement also believe that they should reorganize  outside the DEP, but complain that they do not have enough  grassroots support to be able to do so. However, the general  feeling within the party is that none of the groups are strong  enough to stand on their own. During this meeting the party  assembly is also expected to decide on the fate of executive  assembly member Ali Baskoylu who recently made a public  suggestion that all DEP officials should seek political asylum  at foreign missions in their territory. Baskoylu had called on  DEP executives to enter embassies and seek asylum there and  claimed that there was "no need to use the political platform."    Observers say the expulsion of Baskoylu would imply that the  DEP may decide to stay in the political arena despite the recent  campaign of harassment it has faced.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Traffic builds up on the Access trading highway - Laurie Morse examines the after-hours trading system's modest success while the fate of Globex remains uncertain AS RIVAL Chicago derivatives exchanges battle over the future of Globex, the after-hours electronic futures trading system, the New York Mercantile Exchange's Access computer system is building volume quietly. The Access system, launched in June, trades energy futures contracts overnight, and is currently confined to about 80 subscribers in the US, with 10 Access terminals scheduled to become operational in London late this month. In comparison with Globex, which carries financial contracts from three exchanges across 350 terminals on three continents, Access is a modest undertaking. Globex was developed jointly by Reuters, the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange at a cost of Dollars 78m, while Access, which offers only Nymex products, was set up at a fraction of that cost. It is being closely watched, however, because it is the first electronic highway for 24-hour trading in global commodities - crude oil futures and other energy derivatives. Turnover on Access is slim but respectable, averaging below 2,000 contracts per night. Traders who track the system expect volume to grow, but say that it will not eclipse floor trading in New York or at the International Petroleum Exchange in London. Access traded 53,805 contracts in July and August, slightly behind Globex's 61,010 volume for its first two months of operation in July and August last year, but above Nymex's conservative expectations. North American oil traders are using the system to update futures positions at the start of trading in other time zones; Nymex data show Access is busiest between 6pm and 8pm New York time, and between 4am and 8am. Very little volume is generated between 8pm and 4am, when New York and London markets are closed. While Access enjoys its modest success, the Globex partnership appears to be torn asunder by recriminations. Last month the Chicago Board of Trade was accused by its Globex partners, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, of blocking Globex's expansion. CBOT officials have retorted that Reuters has been slow to respond to Globex users' needs, and that Reuters' Globex fees are far more expensive than those for its own local system, called Project A. CBOT directors widened the rift recently by supporting a referendum that could put the CBOT's active Treasury bond and note futures on Project A, rather than Globex, during late afternoon hours. As the CBOT backs away from Globex, its Chicago rival, the CME, is working hard to promote the system. Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of the CME and of Globex, is planning a fresh marketing push for Globex, and announced on Tuesday that the CME would add its stock index futures contracts to the system on September 20. While Globex has expanded steadily this year, little growth has originated in the US. Of 566,725 contracts traded on Globex in August, 87 per cent was generated by Paris's Matif, which is phasing out its own local after-hours computer trading system. The fate of Globex, and the direction of innovative technology within the futures industry, are likely to be prime topics at the international gathering of futures officials and derivatives regulators in Burgenstock, Switzerland, which starts today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>   [Text] Following MA'ARIV's 18 April report on Assistant  Foreign Ministry Director General Eytan Bentzur's assessments  regarding of the functioning of the U.S. Administration, the  foreign minister's bureau sought to clarify that Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres "highly appreciates the efforts of the  U.S. secretary of state and the American peace team, who have  greatly contributed to the peace process, and thanks the Clinton  Administration in general for the warm attitude it has shown  Israel."    The bureau's statement asserted that the Foreign Ministry  "was not party to the opinions of the senior official with  regard to the policies of the Administration and the peace team  and these opinions are merely his own personal views."</p>

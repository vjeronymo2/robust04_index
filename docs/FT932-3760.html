			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Company 'equipped Iraq testing complex' A GOVERNMENT-owned defence company equipped an Iraqi complex which could have been used for testing missiles, including Exocets, after ministers justified the contract, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday. Previously classified Whitehall documents read out by the inquiry's counsel Miss Priscilla Baxendale QC show that ministers approved the contract involving International Military Services after ignoring warnings from Foreign Office officials that the complex had a potentially lethal military use. The final go-ahead for the project was given after Mr Norman Lamont, towards the end of his period as minister for defence procurement, had insisted that the contract did not significantly enhance Iraq's military capability. It was also argued at ministerial level that the contract was not subject to the guidelines as it had been signed before they were introduced. The documents also show that ministers decided that the completion of the IMS contract in 1986 should be kept secret. The existence of the IMS project surfaced in a report published by the Financial Times in July 1991. Both the MoD and IMS refused to comment at the time. Further details of the project emerged yesterday during oral evidence given to the Scott inquiry by Mr Alan Collins, a senior Foreign Office official. He was chairman of the interdepartmental government committee in charge of vetting sensitive defence-related contracts to Iraq and Iran in the 1980s. Mr Collins told the inquiry that the contract for construction of a concrete bunker and installation of safety and monitoring equipment had first been negotiated with the Iraqis in 1981 when the government had agreed fully to guarantee it financially in the event of non-performance. But the subject of its completion became embroiled in an inter-departmental controversy after Mr Collins and Mr Richard Luce, then minister of state at the Foreign Office, had argued with defence officials that it ran contrary to the guidelines restricting defence exports to Iraq announced to parliament in October 1985. In a minute dated August 30 1985, apparently based on intelligence information, Mr Collins wrote: 'We need to keep a close eye on this project . . . it could be used to support Exocet missiles.' Asked by Lord Justice Scott whether he thought it was unsuitable for a government-owned company to be involved in such a project, Mr Collins replied: 'We felt it should be debated and we wanted to be assured at the highest level that it fell within the guidelines.' Under the guidelines announced to parliament by the then foreign secretary Sir Geoffery Howe, no defence equipment should be exported to Iraq or Iran that would significantly 'enhance the capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate' the conflict between the two countries. A high-level source close to the Scott inquiry said after yesterday's hearing that evidence given during the periodic oral hearings so far was only the 'tip of the iceberg' of what is being gathered from a mass of previously classified documentation and written evidence. The oral hearings will continue next Tuesday with evidence by Sir Stephen Egerton, the former British ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Mr William Waldegrave, a cabinet member and Foreign Office minister, is expected to be called as witness before the summer recess.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Sidorovich Khlopkin, professor, </F> academician, Hero of Socialist Labor, Lenin and State Prize  laureate, director of department, Kurchatov Institute, by  Mikhail Rebrov, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, date, place and occasion  unknown, under rubric "Pertinent Interview": "Nuclear Powered  Ships Are Sending an SOS, but the Nuclear Powered Fleet Is To  Be"; photograph of Khlopkin included]    [Text]    [Box insert]    From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's dossier    Nikolay Sidorovich Khlopkin. Born in 1923. Went through the  Great Patriotic War, signed his name on the Reichstag, was  seriously wounded. Devoted his labor activity to nuclear powered  ships. He has been in the Kurchatov Institute since 1949,  beginning as a laboratory assistant working on a degree thesis,  and now is a department director. He is a professor,  academician, Hero of Socialist Labor and Lenin and State Prize  laureate. As his colleagues say, "From the first tholepin to  today on nuclear powered ships--surface and submarine, civilian  and military." As he himself says, "This is interesting work and  a long and difficult search, the meaning of which lies in  arriving at reliable simplicity after having mastered the  incredibly complex."    [End box insert]    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Nikolay Sidorovich, the first nuclear  powered submarine went on alert status three and a half decades  ago, and a year later the first nuclear powered icebreaker was  placed in operation. Now the attitude toward these events is  contradictory and at times even negative...    [Khlopkin] Our time generally is full of  contradictions. All and everything is criticized without  sufficient argumentation. It would be naive to assert that  atomic energy does not have its dark sides, but how can one  perform the missions facing the Navy without it? Only nuclear  powered submarines can keep from coming to the surface and can  perform their assigned missions during an entire independent  deployment. And how can we turn the Northern Sea Route into a  permanently operating artery without nuclear powered ships?    The logic of developing marine nuclear power engineering  depends to a considerable extent on the country's financial  capacities, which must be used wisely.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Alas, to this day we have not learned  to count money; more precisely, to count the options in order to  see the real prospects. But returning to submarines. What has  been done during these years?    [Khlopkin] A great deal, although we succeeded in  creating a fully unusual construction already for the first  submarine--I have in mind the small, powerful plant. This was  done under the direction of Academician A. P. Aleksandrov. Many  solutions found here proved very successful and were used in  subsequent design projects...    Now, thanks to powerful, compact plants our submarines as a  rule have higher speeds than foreign ones, while being inferior  to the latter in concealment. Already in 1970 we had nuclear  powered submarines with a submerged speed of over 40 knots. A  further reduction in noise of combatant ships is expected, which  will ensure concealment of their operations. Integrated acoustic  designing, where design solutions are aimed at reducing acoustic  emissions to the minimum, will become a mandatory component in  creating the new submarines. In other words, the submarine  should become a unique acoustic "black hole" in the sea which  will not succeed in being detected by any method.    I am setting forth only my own opinion. Quiet submarines  have  been developed with powerful fourth-generation plants. Concepts  for fifth-generation plants are being developed...    This is no simple task. Replacing the propeller with a water  screw and making the transition to full electric propulsion  similar to that used in diesel submarines open up prospects. One  other kind of electric propulsion is worth mentioning--without  screw or water-jet. A propelling pressure is created for the  ship by passing a current through sea water in strong magnetic  fields. Superconducting cables and superhigh magnetic fields are  needed for such a motor...    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Nikolay Sidorovich, what main  directions does science see here today?    [Khlopkin] There are several such directions.  Safety of marine power engineering is coming to the foreground.  Increasing the reliability of plants and the self-protection of  their reactors by creating negative feedbacks in the core,  excluding losses of the heat-transfer agent, additional barriers  preventing a spread of radioactivity... These are only some of  the measures aimed at precluding both accidents themselves as  well as their consequences.    Safety at sea has its specifics, for a reactor on a ship is  not only a source of danger, but also a means of saving the ship  in extreme circumstances.    Then there is the search for new areas of applying atomic  energy and its improvement. There are numerous interesting  prospects here. To some they may seem unrealistic, but the fact  is, even the nuclear powered submarine was considered a  fantastic concept in the late 1940's.    Special mention should be made of control. Anatoliy  Petrovich  Aleksandrov demanded that it be just as simple as in the  automobile--step on the gas or take your foot off... And such a  reactor was created. Reactor power increases when you increase  the feed water flow rate and power drops when you decrease the  rate, and this without any shift in the absorbers controlling  reactivity.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] You mentioned technical measures, but  does the so-called human factor also exist?..    [Khlopkin] It does, and its importance is very  great. And I am thinking not just of operator errors at the  console in a stress situation. The question posed is broader.  The entire safety management system is being examined in order  to preclude the possibility of making incorrect decisions back  in the design stage and not allow poor quality in manufacturing  equipment or unsatisfactory operation. This is a very complex  problem, but it is solvable.    Also among questions which must be solved by scientists are  ecological ones, not just in the course of operation, but also  when removing reactors from operation... Very strict monitoring  is important here. We have developed supremely sensitive gear  for researching radioactivity of sea water. The sunken submarine  Komsomolets was inspected with its help. The result was that the  leak was less than 0.1 curie per year. At a distance of a few  meters from the submarine hull, the level is so low that it is  not detected.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Nuclear powered ships are sending an  SOS, equipment is aging, appropriations are being reduced, and  yards are standing idle. But on all corners one hears one and  the same: conversion, conversion... But the fact is, words and  actions do not always coincide. How are things with you?    [Khlopkin] There is much that is contradictory  here, and not in the idea itself, which is indisputable.  Conversion is not only the result of disarmament, but also its  stimulus. There are a multitude of questions here: scale, time  periods, state support, consistency and thought-out nature of  programs... Conversion... We still did not know that word, but  we began engaging in it around 40 years ago. Nine nuclear  powered civilian vessels were built and the tenth had been  launched. By the way, speaking of reasonable approaches, it is  advisable to replace today's diesel powered icebreakers, which  have exhausted their service life, with nuclear powered ones.  This will be cheaper for Russia. Now yards are free for a number  of reasons. It would appear they should be loaded down with  orders, but we give these orders for icebreakers to foreign  firms. I can illustrate the parity of prices with the following  example. Taymyr with a single reactor unit was built together  with Finland and cost $140 million. Sibir, more powerful with a  double reactor unit, was built here and cost 120 million. But  that was rubles!    Here is another example. Floating atomic electric power  stations for supplying heat and electricity to northern coastal  cities and mineral enterprises. The degree of necessary  construction for a building site in this case is enormously less  and the area of condemned lands is less. Such atomic electric  power stations can be shifted to any spot...    We have created small, unique power plants without analogues  in the world. They have no moving parts, current is produced  without a turbine--by a thermoelectric generator operating from  an atomic reactor. Self-adjusting thermoelectric power stations  with a minimum of servicing are intended for supplying small  settlements and military posts with electrical energy. Thermal  output can be taken to five megawatts, electrical output to 150  kilowatts, and the service life is up to 25 years.    Here is another example. The Rosshelf Joint-Stock Company  has  been established. It proposes to use the potential of defense  sectors to carry on oil and natural gas production on the shelf.  The initial settling-in of enterprises in areas with an ice  situation, where enormous reserves of hydrocarbons already now  have been discovered, can be done with the help of nuclear  powered icebreakers. They will give the enterprise electrical  energy and will protect it from ice. Submarines can survey  deposits, map the bottom, and select routes for laying pipelines.    Atomic plants successfully solve the problem of distilling  water, they are very promising for use in outer space, and they  are being purchased willingly abroad. In short, the peaceful  atom is not a phrase, but action.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Today the question is heard more and  more often: With disarmament going on, is it necessary to  upgrade combatant ships and their power plants? The country is  growing poor...    [Khlopkin] Yes, a considerable reduction is going  on in the Navy now. Orders for new nuclear powered ships are  being cut back sharply. Some of them, which were just not  completed, are being scrapped. And this is not only in Russia,  but in other countries as well. But again, let us proceed from  the realities: war, as the last means of solving conflict  situations, is not excluded from consideration by a single  state. Russia is a maritime power, and this year its Navy  celebrates its tricentennial. The Navy was its glory, it  guaranteed its safety, and that is how it should remain even  now. It is another matter that the might of a maritime power is  determined not so much by the number of ships as by their  fighting qualities. The motto of Admiral Makarov, "Remember the  war," is pertinent even now.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] And the final question, Nikolay  Sidorovich. You went down the front roads. What was the most  memorable in those years?    [Khlopkin] The war itself, with its horrors, its  losses, its distorted fates, but also the joy of victory... The  war mercilessly shoved customary concepts together, transferring  people's lives into another dimension often inconceivable in its  tragedy. The last terrible battle was on 1 May 1945, when our  division was holding back an avalanche of German divisions  heading for Berlin. We held out... Later came the meeting with  the Americans, but already beyond the Elbe... I took off my  greatcoat and captain's shoulderboards in 1945 and since then  have been a civilian and have been very busy with civilian  matters. But Russia's military interests are dear to me, and so  I say: The nuclear powered fleet is to be! There is for now  simply no alternative to nuclear power engineering for the  oceangoing submarine fleet.</p>

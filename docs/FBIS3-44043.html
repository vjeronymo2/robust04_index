			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Balasso Anastacio,  military commander for Cabo Delgado Province, has prevented  media professionals from visiting troop confinement points.  Such behavior is in clear violation of the Law on the Press.  Radio Mozambique reporter Emilio Manhique visited Cabo Delgado  Province's Montepuez District last week and he was not allowed  to visit government troop confinement areas.    [Begin Manhique recording] It is true that I went to  Montepuez last week to tour northern region troop assembly  points. Though I was carrying the necessary identification,  including UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, credentials, I  was not allowed to visit the troop confinement center. I was  not even allowed to talk with the soldiers.    Center Commander Major (Babe) showed me an order issued by  radio whereby Lt. Col. Daniel Balasso Anastacio, military  commander for Cabo Delgado Province, gave instructions that no  journalist should be allowed to interview, film, or visit the  premises where the government troops are confined.    I was surprised, but I tried to convince Maj. (Babe) that  such an order was at least nonsensical. Maj. (Babe)  categorically replied that orders are orders and that he was  there to carry them out. Nevertheless, he agreed to establish  radio contact with the Cabo Delgado Provincial Command to report  my presence. The Provincial Command did not budge.    Then, I proceeded to contact the Unomoz forces stationed at  the center and it was enough for me to identify myself to get  all the information I needed. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

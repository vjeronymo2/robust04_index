			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`mes'-signed report: "Scharping Supports Lafontaine"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  leader Rudolf Scharping has said that if he takes over the  government, he will subject state benefits to continuous review.  After holding talks with his financial and social security  experts, Oskar Lafontaine and Rudolf Dressler, he said in Bonn  on Wednesday [18 May] that this did not mean a lowering of  social benefits, but an urgently required modernization of the  state's social activity. In this way, Scharping was reacting to  Dressler's sharp criticism of Lafontaine, who had announced that  the SPD would also be examining social benefits to consolidate  the state's finances.    Scharping said that the state's permanently increasing debt  was strangling the budget, erasing the government's political  room for maneuver, and turning taxpayers into debtors with the  banks. "The SPD," he said, "will not continue with this policy.  Instead it will subject all state benefits, including tax and  social benefits, to constant review."</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Lavalin plans big sell-off LAVALIN, the big Canadian engineering and manufacturing group, plans to return to basics after a decade of heady expansion. Most of its industrial holdings are being put up for sale. The group, with annual revenues of more than USDollars 1bn, wants to concentrate on its engineering and project management business, developed internationally in the 1960s and 1970s. Lavalin has built its reputation in energy, transportation, aluminium smelting, pulp and paper and many other industrial sectors. Mr Bernard Lamarre, chairman, is offering half Lavalin's 85 per cent interest in UTDC, an Ontario rail equipment maker, and all of Kemtec, a specialised petrochemical producer in Montreal. Together, they have annual sales of about USDollars 500m, are losing money and require injections of new capital. Lavalin bought UTDC in 1986 from the Ontario government, which retains a 15 per cent interest. UTDC pioneered the Vancouver Skytrain people-mover, which Lavalin has tried to sell worldwide. Kemtec has taken a severe blow from declining petrochemical prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       NRI TOKYO BOND INDEX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      PERFORMANCE INDEX                            Average December 1983 = 100        yield    Last    12 wks    26 wks                    9/5/91   (%)     week     ago       ago Overall            154.46  7.11   154.36   153.74     146.23 Government Bonds   152.18  6.95   152.23   152.07     143.03 Municipal Bonds    156.32  7.21   156.12   156.37     148.94 Govt.- guaranteed Bonds              159.09  7.27   158.86   158.41     151.54 Bank Debentures    151.52  7.16   151.31   150.29     144.49 Corporate Bonds    157.48  7.38   157.26   154.90     149.15 Yen-denom.

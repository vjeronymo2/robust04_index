			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 23, RIA -- "Members of the Russian  parliament are monitoring the situation around the Crimea," said  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee on  International Affairs. "I believe that the State Duma should  support the statement of President Yeltsin to the effect that  the use of force, in any form, to settle the conflict is  inadmissible."    He said he was afraid that the forthcoming presidential  elections in Ukraine could negatively affect the situation in  the Crimea, as presidential candidates might attempt to play the  Crimean card to prove their patriotism. It would be best to  freeze the situation until the elections, and to encourage Kiev  and Simferopol to hold talks and refrain from "war-mongering."</p>

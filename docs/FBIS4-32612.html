			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Milan Kurucz, "expert on international relations </F> at the Bratislava Institute of Strategic Studies": "Rationally  and Without Emotions"]    [Text] It is no secret that the victory of the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) in the most recent parliamentary elections has raised no  small expectations in neighboring countries, including Slovakia.  The preelection declarations of the Hungarian Socialists and  liberals, as well as their election programs, signaled a  substantially different policy toward the surrounding countries,  different from that of the Antall and Boross government, under  the tutorship of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF).    The Socialist and liberals, instead of making complicated  maneuvers around the problem of the borders, as interpreted by  the MDF, have sufficiently clearly formulated their standpoint  rejecting any revision of the existing borders in Central  Europe. The future coalition partners, both of them, have  simultaneously distanced themselves from the so-called Antall  doctrine, according to which the problem of the Hungarian  minorities was more important than organizing and developing  relations with the neighboring countries. Its implementation  has reduced Hungary's interstate relations in Central Europe  almost exclusively to the problem of minorities, which obviously  complicated bilateral and multilateral contacts in the entire  region.    Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ are building on the idea that  the  best way to support the Hungarian minorities abroad is to  improve relations with the neighboring countries and thus create  an atmosphere of mutual trust between them and Hungary. This  would mean that a turnabout toward better relations may take  place even in Slovak-Hungarian relations, including the signing  of a basic treaty between the two countries.    However, it would be erroneous to expect that this will be a  simple process without problems. On the contrary. We have to  examine and evaluate attentively, rationally, and without  unnecessary emotions all of the obstacles that the normalization  of interstate relations between Slovakia and Hungary might  encounter.    Even though it is possible to expect that the  "proportionalization" of the Hungarian minorities problem (that  is, reduce its inflated proportions compared with other goals),  in addition to cleansing it of irredentist nostalgia, will  become one of the priorities of Hungarian foreign policy, it is  more than likely that, in the understanding of this problem,  there will be differences between Hungary on one side and  Slovakia or Romania on the other.    The Socialists, who are most likely to take over the Foreign  Ministry in the coalition government, have based their election  program on the fact that the basic treaties with the neighboring  states, as well as the principle of the inviolability of  existing borders, should also contain mutual obligations  regarding securing the ethnic minorities' rights in line with  European standards and international documents on safeguarding  the rights of ethnic minorities. Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ  are building on the equality of individual and collective rights  of minorities, which will certainly not meet with great  understanding on the part of their future partners.    The search for mutually acceptable ways out and formulations  regarding the problems of minorities' rights will be greatly  complicated, above all, by the fact that both new government  parties consider the right to autonomy to be a decisive part and  parcel of collective rights. In their program, the Socialists  have elaborated their autonomy concept in very minute detail.  They consider several forms of autonomy, starting with cultural  autonomy and ending with territorial autonomy, while the process  of its establishment is understood as a process that should go  through several stages. Most essential is the fact, however,  that both the Socialists and liberal democrats have pledged to  push for the demand of autonomy for Hungarian minorities as for  right corresponding to European standards.    Even today it has become obvious that this will be one of  the  most complicated points in future talks between the new  Hungarian Government and its Central European partners because  their negative stance on autonomy (above all, territorial  autonomy) is generally known.    The new Hungarian Government, when discussing basic treaties  with Slovakia and other neighbors, will also have to count on a  very cautious attitude of most West European countries and  European international organizations toward the problem of the  collective rights of minorities. Their definition is contained  neither in the Vienna Declaration of the Council of Europe nor  in the document from the Stability Pact initial conference,  which was also signed by Hungary. The negotiating position of  Hungary will not be so easy.    MSZP and SZDSZ representatives have several times expressed  their willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue with  Hungary's neighbors. Today, the first signs of a positive  change taking place in the atmosphere of Slovak-Hungarian  relations have begun to appear. This is an important  prerequisite for searching for a mutually acceptable compromise  in such a complicated problem as minorities and securing their  rights. However, the way to this compromise will certainly be  neither easy nor short.</p>

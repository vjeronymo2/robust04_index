			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Leslaw </F> Paga"]    [Text] As of this writing, the government coalition has not  yet decided whether it will replace [Minister of Finance] Marek  Borowski with one person or with two. What is known, however, is  that the subsequent candidacy is being considered. Among those  who may have a chance to be finance minister is Leslaw Paga,  chairman of the Securities Commission.    Several other names have been mentioned to date, as well,  among them: Henryk Chmielak, lreneusz Sekula, and Wladyslaw  Baka. Leslaw Paga got on the list of potential ministers right  after the decision of Adam Tanski, the current chief of the  State Treasury's Agency for Farm Property and former minister of  agriculture, who told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he was forced to  refuse the proposition of taking over the Finance Ministry for  "purely personal, family reasons."    SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) leader Aleksander Kwasniewski  claims that one should not expect a fast decision on a  nomination. Final decisions will come only after the budget is  passed by the Sejm.    Leslaw Paga holds a Ph.D. in economics. He began his  professional career as an assistant at the Maria Sklodowska  Curie University in Lublin. He was chief of the Center for  Social Research at the Lublin regional Solidarity office. From  1989 to 1991, he served as adviser to the minister of finance.  Later, he was in charge of the Securities Commission at the  Ministry of Ownership Transformations [aka Privatization]. After  the commission became independent of the ministry in 1991, Paga  was named its chairman.</p>

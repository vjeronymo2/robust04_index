			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Germany The German stock market has risen by 7 per cent over the past week, and yields on 10-year government bonds have dropped 3 basis points to below 7.5 per cent. This reflects growing confidence that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition will be re-elected in tomorrow's general election. If so, euphoria is likely to be short-lived as investors start to concentrate once again on fundamentals. Earnings for Germany's bigger companies are set to rise by around 80 per cent this year and 40 per cent in 1995, but this still leaves the market on a high valuation of 16 to 17 times next year's earnings. As for bonds, an encouraging headline figure for August M3 growth disguised an acceleration in bank lending, a red rag to the Bundesbank bull. German industrial production is likely to pull back this autumn after a blip this summer. The more robust the recovery, the less Germany's unions will be prepared to settle for a moderate wage increase. That is an environment in which the Bundesbank is likely to tighten interest rates. The complexity of Germany's voting system and the closeness of leading parties in the opinion polls make it hard for investors to guess the outcome. The least desirable development for the markets would be an alliance between the leftwing SPD and the Green party, supported by the former communist PDS party. Marginally more palatable would be a coalition between the SPD and the rightwing CDU/CSU. Either result would unsettle the markets next week. Thereafter it would serve to turn the spotlight more acutely on the fundamentals.</p>

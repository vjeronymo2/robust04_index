			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Painter of charm and menace MAGRITTE by David Sylvester Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 45, 352 pages, illustrated TO BECOME a fully paid-up member of the Surrealist Movement in Paris before the Second World War and enjoy the notoriety and demand the group's exhibitions aroused you had to get the okay from Andre Breton. And he was as fussy about who he let in as the most rulebook-conscious trades union boss. More than 60 years later, Magritte seems to have been the surrealist painter par excellence; but he did not seem like that at the time to Breton. For one thing he was Belgian and not French. That, as David Sylvester explains, might not have mattered if Magritte had migrated permanently to Paris to plunge whole-heartedly into the activities of the group; but as a young painter eking out a living by commercial artwork in Brussels, Magritte worked among a small circle of Belgian artists, writers and journalists who had their own notions of surrealism. These derived in part from Italian futurism and from de Chirico. Then in September 1927 Magritte and his wife Georgette moved to Paris and the painter's involvement in the politics of the Movement began. Magritte started to appear in the journal, La Revolution Surrealiste, and Breton began to acquire Magrittes. But the honeymoon was soon over. When the Second Surrealist Manifesto was published in 1930, Magritte was not among the signatories, and by then he and his wife had returned to Belgium for good. Magritte's chief point of difference with the Paris-based surrealists turned on the degree of conscious control exercised by the painter over the imagery in the painting. Pure surrealism insists on the artist totally letting go, on a great gush of subversive imagery welling up from the unconscious and spilling frighteningly onto the canvas. Even in Dali's paintings, where the the flow seems to be totally associative and uninhibited, there is too much control for the surreal purist, and far too much for him in those of Magritte. When after the Second World War, a new international surrealist exhibition opened in Paris in 1947, the official list of surrealist painters did not include the name of Magritte; but by then he had become too important to be wholly excluded and they compromised by hanging some of his work in the category 'Surrealists in spite of themselves'. At that time Magritte had, as it happened, temporarily turned away from surrealism to experiment with a painterly parody of impressionism - a rainbow palette applied to females a la Renoir. Some of these curiously atypical Magritte works are included in this book, and Sylvester explores the economic as well as the psychological motivation behind this phase of Magritte's career. He thinks the quasi-impressionist paintings have been under-valued and he has an even stronger admiration for the work of the brief, violent fauve period that followed. Magritte's dialogue with Breton was to continue for many years. Magritte defended his combination of 'charm and menace' by reference to the Alice books. Like Carroll, Magritte achieves his effects of witty disturbance through a misuse of logic. Writing to his little girl friends Carroll would pick on an expression of ordinary speech such as 'it is raining cats and dogs' and interpret it literally; in Magritte's late, great painting 'Golconda' it is raining little men in bowler hats. Carroll's trick of subjecting Alice's body to magnification or diminution is pure Magritte. Sylvester distinguishes several more types of distortion employed regularly by Magritte - displacement, defiance of gravity, transparency, and in some beautiful late grisaille paintings, petrification; in these paintings the human beings and their environment have turned to stone. The book subordinates the biography of Magritte to the task of tracing his inner development as an artist. In one illuminating chapter Sylvester discusses the significance of the titles of the paintings which usually have an abstruse or oblique relation to the content, and in another he deals with the series of paintings in which objects are labelled with words that apply to something else. Magritte came here as an absolute godsend to Derrida and the deconstructionists with their mistrust of language. Foucault has a 60-page essay on the famous painting by Magritte, 'The treachery of images'; the oil painting of a pipe under which is writ large - 'This is not a pipe'. Whether or not the object depicted there is in reality a pipe, what is beyond doubt is that Sylvester has given us a fine book about Magritte, calmly authoritative and lucidly perceptive. His publishers have done him deservedly proud in both lay-out of the text and the copious illustrations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Front for the Restoration of Democracy in Haiti  [Front pour Restorer la Democratie en Haiti], FRDH, asks General  Raoul Cedras to show goodwill by respecting the Governors Island  agreement, which demands his early retirement and the return of  constitutionally elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Since the enforcement of Resolution 917 of the UN Security  Council, consisting of a total embargo, which has already been  imposed on our country, we in the FRDH -- jointly with four  other people's organizations -- cannot remain indifferent toward  the suffering of the Haitian people. This is the reason we are  again asking Gen. Cedras to show goodwill by standing behind his  signature.</p>

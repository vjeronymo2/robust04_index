			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO FACTORY OUTLET CENTER GETS NEW OWNERS  </P> <P> San Diego Factory Outlet Center, the first of its kind in the Southland, has  been purchased by Wohl Investment Co., Irvine, from Plaza Mayor Investment, San  Diego.  </P> <P> American Senior Inns and Urban Group represented both parties in the  transaction. The four-building, $14-million center opened last November just  west of Interstate 5 on Camino de la Plaza in San Ysidro, the last exit before  the U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> A second phase, valued at $1.2 million, is expected to be in construction this  summer. The additional 20,000 square feet to the 125,000-square-foot project  will bring the total number of tenants to 28.  </P> <P> The converted shopping center is 80% leased with tenants such as Revlon, Izod,  Corning, Bass, Black &amp; Decker, Nike, Mikasa, Van Heusen, Gitano, Aileen and  Leatherloft. The retailing concept originated on the East Coast in such cities  as Reading, Pa., Freeport, Me., and North Conway, N.H., where manufacturers  lease space and sell direct to the public.  </P></p>

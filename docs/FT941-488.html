			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Changes called for on employers' liability insurance Insurance buyers at large UK companies are warning that changes will need to be made to employers' liability insurance. Most risk and insurance managers are concerned about the continuing viability of the present system, according to Airmic, the risk managers' association. Under the present system all employers are legally obliged to buy cover to pay claims from employees who are injured or who suffer illness through work, the association found in a survey whose results were reported on the first day of its annual conference. 'It does appear that we have created a dinosaur which, in the eyes of our members is costly, outdated and counter-productive,' said Mr Geoff Saunders, risk manager with RTZ and chairman of Airmic. Too often the present system involved expensive legal confrontation, he said. 'We should scrap EL insurance in favour of a fairer no-fault, structured-settlement approach, probably incorporating an arbitration procedure,' added Mr Saunders. Beneficiaries of no-fault compensation systems do not have to prove that they are injured as a result of negligence. The survey also found that member companies were concerned by the incidence of industrial diseases, which now account for more than 50 per cent of all liability claims. Risk managers are also worried by the possibility of future restrictions which insurers are expected to introduce for liability policies. Moves to introduce a limit of indemnity have been triggered by developments in the reinsurance market. A separate survey found that member companies still regard a fire or explosion as the most significant threat to their business.</p>

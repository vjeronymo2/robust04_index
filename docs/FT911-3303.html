			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Bonds: Investors snap up Spain's offer as ratings improve SPAIN's second and largest Ecu bond offering was sold out almost instantly as pent-up demand for sovereign benchmark issues fuelled investors' enthusiasm. Unlike Italy, whose triple-A credit rating is under review, Spain, rated Double-A2 by Moody's, the US agency, is considered an improving credit. The five-year bonds were priced to yield 9.08 per cent, the same level as Spain's outstanding Ecu500m issue due 1995, launched a year ago. The old issue was quite tightly held by investors, so there was little paper available in the secondary market. Although the deal was easy to sell, underwriters in London were unhappy at the handling of the offering. First, the indicated range for the yield was changed, when demand proved firm. Then, allocations of bonds were smaller than underwriters had been led to expect. Some underwriters had shorted the issue, that is, sold bonds they did not yet have; when allocations were reduced, they were forced to cover their short positions by buying them back at higher prices, given the strong demand, traders said. Nearly 20 per cent of the deal has been reserved for placement in Spain, where an extensive marketing campaign is currently under way. However, only 5 per cent of the first deal was placed in Spain, so more bonds could find their way to international investors in a few weeks' time. Spain had been expected to extend its maturity profile, but instead chose to bring a second five-year deal. According to lead manager Banesto, Spain did not wish to lock in Ecu rates over too long a maturity, because Ecu yields are likely to fall in the longer term. An Ecu300m deal, fungible with an outstanding Ecu335m issue, for the European Investment Bank, was largely pre-placed in Japan. Lead manager Nomura International said the issue was targetted at Japanese retail investors in an attempt to widen the investor base for Ecu bonds. Consequently, there was no clash with the Spanish issue. In the dollar sector, a Dollars 250m three-year deal for Compagnie Bancaire met firm demand, but put tightly priced issues for two other European financial institutions, Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg and Credit Local, launched on Tuesday under further pressure. The Compagnie Bancaire deal was priced to yield 82 basis points above the three-year US Treasury, compared with 48 and 47 basis points respectively for the LKB and Credit Local deals. Although Compagnie Bancaire is a slightly lesser credit, the 35 basis point differentiation was considered excessive. The LKB spread widened to 58 basis points, and the Credit Local spread to 56 basis points. In the equity-linked sector, Merrill Lynch introduced its LYONs (liquid yield option notes) structure to the Eurobond market, issuing a Dollars 150m European tranche of a Dollars 1bn US offering for WR Grace, the chemical, healthcare and energy group. The zero-coupon 15-year notes are convertible into shares, and puttable after five and 10 years. Sumitomo Bank, the world's third largest bank, has had its Aa1 credit rating put under review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. Sumitomo lost it's top triple-A rating from both Moody's and IBCA, the European rating agency, last year. The bank has Dollars 4.3bn of long-term debt outstanding. The French government received close to 50 per cent acceptances for its Ecu OAT exchange offer. Holders of Ecu950m 8.5 per cent OATs maturing 1997, out of a total issue size of Ecu1.9bn, opted to receive in exchange new 8.5 per cent OATs maturing 2002. Additional acceptances from retail investors, who have until April 30 to exchange, should give the new issue an initial size of around Ecu1bn. The new bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points more than the old shorter-dated issue.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: The Venetian Twins THE Venetian lawyer Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793) was told his face was too jovial for the profession. Turning a jolly disposition to good account, he found himself better fitted for writing commedia dell'arte than subpoenas, and embarked on an extraordinary career in Venice and Paris which yielded nearly 300 plays in Italian and French. Now Goldoni's The Venetian Twins (1746) at the Oxford Playhouse (Oxford Stage Company) opens his bicentenary. This is anarchic comedy looking back to Rabelais, sideways at Marivaux and forward to Feydeau. Goldoni's subjects are social, rarely political: 'The secret of the art of writing comedy,' he wrote, 'is to cling to nature, and never leave her.' The quality of the invention and insight is a reminder that Goldoni has been overlooked and undervalued. The plot beggars belief. Zanetto and Tonino are identical twins, one simple-stupid and the other suave-clever. Unknown to the other, each arrives in Verona. There, Zanetto is betrothed to local beauty Rosaura, a horror in fluffy mules; meanwhile Tonino is awaited by his pudgy fiancee, Beatrice. The ensuing confusion runs out of breath after two deaths, two marriages and the appearance of the twins' long-lost sister. The mistaken identities and cross-purposes are like The Comedy of Errors or the last act of Twelfth Night. Robert David MacDonald's stiff translation is laced with Shakespearean borrowings in true commedia dell'arte style. Goldoni was one of the first commedia dell'arte playwrights to give written parts to actors used to improvisation. The dialogue here keeps up a Whose Line is it Anyway?  unpredictability: 'I managed to purloin a gondola and make my way here' - 'By land?'  - 'My adventures would amaze you.' The acting, especially from Peter Jordan as the twins and Clare Cathcart as the winsome Beatrice, is robust and energetic. Jordan's best scenes are when Tonino visits Rosaura and takes his brother's bride-to-be for a whore and his future in-laws for pimps, and a wonderful scene where the two brothers meet, offstage, in a public lavatory. Other highlights include Polly Kemp as Rosaura's lubricous maid and Malcolm Scates as Lelio, who wears an amoebic waistcoat and a fixed grin whilst pursuing Beatrice. Juliet Hill's busy pastiche score keeps the action flowing, while Mark Brickman's direction finds a measure of mess within the ordered plot. The moral, from the lips of a dying Veronese: 'If we were always good, we should not need to be wise.'

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The season's fifth tropical storm may be born by this morning, a hurricane  specialist said, as a tropical depression moving west-northwest through the  open Atlantic gained strength through the night. "The environment is not ideal,  but we wouldn't be surprised to see it become a tropical storm," said Hal  Gerrish, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The center of  the depression was located about 1,400 miles southwest of the Azores, the  center said. The depression was moving near 20 m.p.h. with maximum sustained  winds near 35 m.p.h. -- just 4 m.p.h. shy of tropical storm strength. If the  depression reaches tropical storm strength, it would be named Erin.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Sana' </F> al-Sa'id; place and date not given]    [Text] [Al-Sa'id] There has been a great deal of criticism  of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement called the Oslo document.  Can the agreement lead to a Palestinian state?    [Musa] The agreement was one of the major events of 1993. It  does not involve only Gaza and Jericho. It is a declaration of  principles between the two sides and an introduction to other  developments, starting with the transfer of power to the  Palestinians and moving on to autonomy and  self-determination--which means the establishment of a  Palestinian state.    The development, undoubtedly, is important for  Palestinian-Israeli relations and the Arab-Israeli conflict. We  are currently in the implementation stage.    [Al-Sa'id] But the implementation is faltering.    [Musa] Arab-Israeli negotiations are not an easy matter.  Given the long history of the conflict and the opposing  interests and demands, obstacles are always expected. But with  the determination of the negotiators and the help of other  parties, the obstacles can be removed and the agreement can be  implemented. The gap between the two sides, no doubt, is a  result of the great hopes of the Palestinians and the great  reservations of the Israelis. It is only through negotiations,  the implementation of the agreement, and the demonstration of  good faith that the gap can be bridged. This requires some  relaxation, such as the release of prisoners. We must not  continue to live under the same old standards. The rationale  for the conflict is over, and we must benefit from the new world  climate.    [Al-Sa'id] The issue of the border crossings is still the  main obstacle.    [Musa] This concerns the two sides; we will not interfere in  this issue. Ultimately, however, we do not differ from the  Palestinians' view.    [Al-Sa'id] Some saw the delay in the implementation of the  agreement, which was due to begin on 13 December, as a sign that  the peace talks have failed.    [Musa] Moves toward peace have not failed. Both sides are  eager to see that the negotiations do not fail. They agree on  the importance of reaching an agreement. The delay in  implementation does not mean that the process is over or that it  has failed or gone backward.    The region has indeed entered the first stage of settlement.  The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is important, but it is the  beginning, not the end. It has opened the door for other steps  on the Syrian-Israeli, Lebanese-Israeli, and Jordanian-Israeli  negotiating tracks. But all this needs care, patience, and  determination. This is what we are doing. The goal is to  achieve a comprehensive solution that addresses the issues of  land, rights, and security.    The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is an extremely important  step, not a trick or a tactic to buy time. This is a  psychological change. Anyway, the agreement will be judged soon  through its honest implementation. The agreement is important.  It means the recognition of the Palestinian people, the PLO,  and the Palestinian land. If it succeeds, the two sides will  live as neighbors, and fears and caution will disappear.  However, this requires precise implementation.    [Al-Sa'id] But Israel objects to the establishment of a  Palestinian state.    [Musa] No, this is not true. There is no objection to the  existence of a Palestinian state. The agreement can lead to a  state, and it will not be annulled by the establishment of a  state. The PLO cannot be besieged and asked not to think of the  great Palestinian hope--a state.    [Al-Sa'id] Which is more important now, the  Palestinian-Israeli or the Syrian-Israeli negotiating tracks?    [Musa] At this stage, we are actively following both tracks.  We are doing all that we can to stimulate the peace process and  make progress on all fronts. This is a process that should lead  to a full peace based on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories. It is up to the concerned parties to  decide on a specific agreement with Israel based on all the land  for total peace.    [Al-Sa'id] But do you feel that the general climate has  actually changed and the region can now formulate new relations  with Israel?    [Musa] The general psychological climate is obviously  changing. All the parties are engaged in contacts and  cooperation. We hope the talks between the Palestinians and  Israel will end in an agreement that preserves Palestinian  rights. We also hope that the resumption of the bilateral talks  in Washington will lead to a peace agreement among all the  sides. Peace in the region, with its political and economic  implications, is a source of great interest to us. We are  talking about laying the foundations for future cooperation. We  feel a great responsibility. Things must proceed in the right  way so that we do not go back to our previous state of affairs.    [Al-Sa'id] What about the Syrian track?    [Musa] We hope the next talks will produce positive results  and enable the two sides to move closer to an agreement. The  United States is playing a major role, and we are trying to  advance the Syrian track because if there is no peace on this  track, there can be no comprehensive peace. We support Syria's  right to regain its territory. Syria cannot accept, and we  cannot accept, any other kind of withdrawal. The implementation  of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and Israel's withdrawal  from all the occupied Arab territories will mean an end to all  theories of expansion.    [Al-Sa'id] What do you mean by withdrawal? Are the Israeli  settlements included?    [Musa] We mean complete civilian and military withdrawal.  The settlements are part of this withdrawal.    [Al-Sa'id] How do you evaluate U.S. policy in the region?  Some believe it upsets the balance with the Arab countries in  favor of Israel. They say Israel is being supported so that it  will dominate the Arab world.    [Musa] We cannot proceed from this assumption. This is in  harmony with the language of today. The United States is a  friendly country, and it is in our interest to be friends with  it. It is not true that the United States is supporting Israel  so that the latter will control the Arab world. On the  contrary, the U.S. role in the Egyptian-Israeli agreement, for  instance, is known by all. Under that agreement, Sinai was  restored, and there was no Israeli domination. Such domination  was not a price we had to pay in advance. It is not in the  interest of the United States to let a certain state control the  region. We are talking about balance and reconciliation, not  pressure and coercion.    [Al-Sa'id] But the United States still adopts a policy that  is essentially based on maintaining a strong Israel. It has  recently supplied Israel with F-15 and F-16 aircraft and  reaffirmed its commitment to qualitative Israeli superiority  over the entire Arab world.    [Musa] This inclination is indeed reflected in some aspects.  We are discussing this, and we view U.S. eagerness for  qualitative Israeli superiority as serious. At this stage of  peace, we must be interested in the theories of balance, not  those of superiority. The region needs balance because this is  what will boost security. Superiority, on the other hand, pushes  the region toward an arms race, which is in no one's interest.    [Al-Sa'id] While Warren Christopher was touring the region  in  November, U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Frank Wisner visited  Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and the Gulf states. In his statements,  he appeared to install Israel as a nuclear deterrent that will  defend the interests of the United States and its allies in the  region.    [Musa] Our position is very well known. We will not waver or  retreat. Question marks and tension over disarmament will  continue in the region as long as there is no balance. Peace  cannot be maintained without balance. In order for this balance  to be achieved, no side should be given privileges over the  others. If the principle of preference continues, with only one  party possessing deterrent weapons in the region, things will  remain unresolved. Balance is needed for the interests of all  sides.    [Al-Sa'id] On the other hand, a U.S. senator said during a  recent visit to Pakistan that Egypt was pressured by the United  States to abandon the idea of producing a nuclear bomb?    [Musa] I responded to him at the time, and I repeat that  Egypt was not under any pressure to abandon the idea of  producing a nuclear bomb. Egypt simply had no intention of  producing such a bomb. On the contrary, Egypt has called and is  calling for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the  Middle East. This is a principled position based on established  Egyptian policy and has nothing to do with the U.S. position or  the position of any other state.    [Al-Sa'id] But some people have the impression that the  United States is pressuring Egypt to adopt certain positions  toward some states and issues in the area?    [Musa] There are no pressures on Egypt from this or any  other  party. We follow and uphold the policy that we think is  consistent with our interests. This applies to our position on  chemical and nuclear weapons. Our positions are known and  established, and there is nothing called U.S. pressure. Our  policy does not stem from this or that country.    [Al-Sa'id] There are some who say that Egyptian policy is  occasionally guided by U.S. signals that dictate the adoption of  certain positions toward some states in the region. I mention  as an example Egypt's position toward Iran and Sudan. Egypt has  accused them of supporting terrorism and refused to improve its  relations with them?    [Musa] This is nonsense. It is totally untrue and unfounded.  No one is applying pressure on us regarding any policy we have  adopted. We make our own decisions, and no one dictates any  specific course to us. Generally speaking, it is not strange to  hear accusations from here and there. Such accusations are made  by a few insignificant voices. When a certain state--and I do  not want to mention names--attacks Egypt and I respond, does  this take place because of U.S. pressure? This is something  strange and illogical. In our policy, we are always seeking the  Egyptian and Arab interest. There are numerous examples,  including our position on the peace process. But we might  occasionally adopt a position that agrees with the positions of  other states, such as the United States or the European states.  There is nothing wrong with this. We are not bothered by such  senseless remarks made by people who live in the past. We are  not ashamed that our views are sometimes consistent with the  views of the United States, the European states, or any other  state, because these are issues of policy and not personal  issues. Our policy, as I have said, basically seeks to  represent the Egyptian and Arab interest.    [Al-Sa'id] Mentioning Sudan and Iran, some ask what basis we  have to accuse them from time to time of supporting and  exporting terrorism? Has their actual involvement in terrorism  been proved?    [Musa] If an accusation was leveled, there must be proof. No  accusation can be made without basis. But this does not mean  that I am leveling a specific accusation against this or that  state.    [Al-Sa'id] In your recent remarks about relations with  Sudan, you said Egypt's intention is to achieve stability and  not inflame emotions. What about Egypt's sheltering of the  Sudanese opposition, and is this consistent with Egypt's  eagerness not to inflame emotions?    [Musa] Egypt has always been a repository for Arabs with  differing views. We have a large Sudanese community, a large  Somali community, and brothers from all the Arab countries here.  This is a very old Egyptian tradition.    [Al-Sa'id] Who is threatening Egypt's national security  today, especially since Egyptian officials have said that the  border with Israel is a safe border; the borders with Libya are  the second safest; and the borders with Sudan are third safest?    [Musa] We are not in the process of selecting enemies,  naming  countries, and (?so on).    [Al-Sa'id] What is the current status of Egypt's ties with  Sudan?    [Musa] They are not as they should be, but any issue can be  resolved through dialogue. No matter what the relations are  like, our stand will continue to call for preserving Sudan's  territorial integrity. Sudan's control over all its territories  is an important and vital point.    [Al-Sa'id] What about Iran?    [Musa] There are long-standing relations between Egypt and  Iran, and the present tension can be attributed to political  reasons related to the situation in the Arab and Islamic worlds.  We believe in the need to create a suitable climate to improve  the relationship, but we are still hoping that Iran's  inclinations will shift away from issues that cause such  tensions in the Arab world and parts of the Islamic world.    [Al-Sa'id] If 1994 results in a new form of Arab-Israeli  relations, it is appropriate that we are hoping that this year  will also see serious Arab reconciliation.    [Musa] Arab reconciliation is truly required and the Arab  world must move toward solidarity and calmness. President Husni  Mubarak is clear in this respect as he calls for solidarity and  calm. There are moves under way, and we are trying to create a  fertile groundwork to build sound inter-Arab relations. Iraq's  clear recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence would  begin to clear the atmosphere.    [Al-Sa'id] What about lifting the blockade on Iraq? Could  this happen in 1994?    [Musa] We hope so. We also hope that all the factors exist  to achieve at least the Iraqi nation's interest. Iraq is a  fraternal Arab nation, and we hope it will emerge from its  current dilemma.    [Al-Sa'id] What can be done for Somalia at present,  especially in light of the United States' decision to withdraw  its forces in March?    [Musa] We have demanded a clear-cut plan in Somalia. The  cease-fire must be backed; the factions should be disarmed, and  then a national reconciliation must be reached with the  agreement of all parties. These parties should meet according  to the Addis Ababa agreement, and the settlement should be in  the interest of all the parties, not just in one party's  interest. Since the U.S. decided to pull out from Somalia in  March, we must act quickly to resolve this issue in the coming  weeks.    As a state, Egypt is very interested in the situation in the  Horn of Africa, which affects Egypt's national security because  it is part of the security of the Middle East, the Indian Ocean,  and the Red Sea. Therefore, we must have a say in it. The  Ethiopian president has a mandate to follow the situation in  Somalia, and we are confident that things will turn out the way  Somali people want.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Observer: Polymorphous polytechnic Everything in yesterday's edition of the FT's sister publication - Les Echos, the French financial daily - seemed normal, but for the prominence of the bylines. What was Jean Peyrelevade, the head of Credit Lyonnais, doing writing about the French economy? Or Jean-Louis Beffa, the head of the St-Gobain glass company, writing about German wage rows? Or Serge Dassault, the jet-maker, writing about devaluation of the French African franc? The answer is that they are all graduates of the Ecole Polytechnique. To help celebrate that elite institution's 200th anniversary, Les Echos invited 60 of them to put their master-of-all-trades training into practice by producing the entire issue. Ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing was not required actually to turn up at the office to pen his editorial on 'full employment'. But 54 other polytechniciens were called in to work at Les Echos' Paris headquarters. 'We selected the subjects for them, but they chose the angle of the articles,' said a real Les Echos journalist. Five of those absent abroad on business were converted into special correspondents, with Jean Gandois, the boss of Pechiney, filing a story from Chicago on the new US threat of 'Super 301' trade retaliation. And what about taking the role reversal the other direction, letting the hacks run some companies for a day? The businessmen's response was not overwhelming . . .</p>

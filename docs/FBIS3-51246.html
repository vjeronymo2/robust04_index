			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary  Party [PRD] presidential candidate, believes Arnulfist Party  presidential candidate Mireya de Gruber and Ruben Dario Carles  represent the same groups, and so it is not correct to consider  them as two independent candidates. Perez Balladares was  interviewed live during our morning newscast:    [Begin recording] [Perez] We foresee a confrontation between  groups that oppose this government and the government,  regardless of the government candidate's name. [sentence as  heard] We believe there is still time to comprise the alliances  that are necessary to remain in power. We will also, obviously,  lead the people's opposition proposal against the current  regime, the government that failed to yield results, the  government that resulted in frustrations, that we [words  indistinct].    [Unidentified reporter] Regardless of the government  candidate's name, meaning Ruben Dario Carlos or Mireya de Gruber?    [Perez] Regardless, we think there will be a government  candidate and our own candidacy.    [Reporter] It does not matter if the candidate is Mrs.  Gruber or Mr. Carles who is reportedly going along those lines?    [Perez] That is not the important issue. In any case, I  think they both represent the government. Former Comptroller  Carles was a conspicuous member of the current government until  recently. He now reneges on many of his promises, but we will  remind him about those promises in due time. Mrs. Gruber is  president of the Arnulfist Party and, evidently, she seems to be  its standard-bearer. We believe they are both one in the same.    [Reporter] Is the PRD willing to relinquish a vice  presidency either to the PALA [Labor Party] or the Liberal  Republican Party, in case an alliance is comprised, particularly  when the PALA.... [pauses] Dr. Carlos Lopez Guevara said here,  in a "Telemetro Reports" morning newscast, they will leave if  they are not given the opportunities they expect.    [Perez] I think it is more serious, meaning it is more  important and worthy for us to present a proposal that is  capable of implementing our government platform than to go  around, like some parties are doing, making a show of themselves  by handing out what they do not even (?have).    [Reporter] You specifically mean the ruling parties.    [Perez] Of course. I specifically mean them. Consequently,  I believe our directorate board, which shall meet quite soon,  will be the one to decide the terms and conditions of the  alliance. [end recording]</p>

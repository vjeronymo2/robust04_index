			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 19 SAPA -- Water affairs and forestry  minister Prof Kader Asmal on Thursday unveiled his department's  new initiatives and policy adaptations to make water and  sanitation available to all communities in South Africa. Prof  Asmal told a media conference in Pretoria the initiatives were  aimed at achieving the objectives of the government's  Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and his  department hoped to achieve its immediate goals within the next  three years.    For many years the department had functioned in terms of  political assumptions which had now changed fundamentally. This  called for the department and all water related institutions in  the country to change direction towards achieving water security  and safe sanitation for all South Africans. "The urgent task of  the department is to transfer the functions from the myriad of  authorities which existed under the homelands in such a way that  the national interest is not affected as a result." The  department would prepare draft legislation to consolidate and  rationalise water laws so a single system prevailed throughout  the country, he said.    Prof Asmal said a revised water act would be necessary to  implement the policy changes. "All numerous amendments  promulgated since 1956 will have to be rationalised and the act  will have to be updated to reflect the changes and to provide  legislative framework for the equitable, rational and  non-competitive distribution of water," he said. A draft white  paper would be published with an invitation for public comment.    Prof Asmal said for the department to achieve its goals it  would need maximum involvement of all stakeholders, including  communities at grassroots level. The department was reviewing  all water related institutions in order to ensure transparency  and accountability. Effective representation of all citizens and  users on water institutions would be a priority.    Prof Asmal said his department was already in the process of  establishing a directorate of rural water supply and sanitation  to support rural communities in the task of achieving water  security and safe sanitation. Control of rural water supply and  sanitation would be co-ordinated by local committees in which  women had to play an important role, said Prof Asmal. The  department would also involve non-governmental organisations,  local authorities, water boards, the private sector and  provincial authorities, while it would play a monitoring and  supportive role to ensure the RDP's objectives were met.    On tariffs, he said a lifeline tariff for low income  consumers was likely to be sufficient to cover the operating  costs so South Africans at all levels were able to afford water  services. He said training programmes linked with universities,  bursary schemes and recruitment processes would be reviewed to  alleviate the shortage of professional and technical staff. A  new departure for the department was the planned establishment  of the national water council to increase public involvement in  water policy formulation, resource appointments and financial  allocations. Other issues that his department was already  looking into were forestry, conservation, international  developments, the national public works programme and funding  requirements.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Row as Mercedes picks France - German carmaker to build Swatchmobile in low-wage, flexible Lorraine Germany's Mercedes-Benz and Swiss watch group SMH are to go ahead with plans to build a DM750m (Dollars 503m) car factory in France despite political and trade union protests. Construction will start next autumn, and production of the micro-compact two-seater model - dubbed the Swatchmobile - will start in late 1997 in preparation for a pan-European launch in early 1998, Mercedes said yesterday. The city runabout, priced at 'well under DM20,000', will be marketed by about 90 main Mercedes dealers and in department stores, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary said. As revealed by angry German trade union leaders last week, the assembly plant is to be built in Hambach, around 5km from the town of Sarreguemines on the French-German border. The factory will be able to make up to 200,000 cars a year, and employ up to 1,900. The decision was confirmed yesterday by the Daimler-Benz board following a fevered debate over Daimler's alleged neglect of its responsibility to build the ground-breaking new model in Germany. The argument effectively ended on Monday night after Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, and Mr Nicholas Hayek, head of SMH, explained the rationale for the decision to assemble in France to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Reuter had earlier been pressed to reconsider by Mr Erwin Teufel, prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, Daimler's home state. He had also received a protest letter from Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, the senior party in the ruling Bonn coalition which is governing with a majority of only 10. According to Daimler, MCC, the joint-venture company set up to run the project, in which the German group has a 51 per cent stake, had examined more than 70 possible sites. Hambach was selected because it was located in the centre of the main market for the Swatchmobile, and because of its competitive wage costs and highly flexible working times and conditions. Other considerations included ideal road and rail links: Hambach is close to the A4 trunk road from Paris to Strasbourg which joins the German autobahn network in Saarbrucken. However, the decisive factors were most likely to have been payroll bills - unit labour costs in France are about 40 per cent lower than in Germany, according to the VDA automotive industry association - and more co-operative unions. Although details have not yet been published, the lean assembly procedures for the Swatchmobile are expected to demand maximum flexibility from the workforce in terms of working times and practices. The cars will be assembled mainly from complete modules and large components supplied from outside the Hambach site, where only about 20 per cent of the necessary parts are to be made. As a result of the demand for bought-in modules, Daimler claims, component suppliers - mostly in Germany - will need to hire about 7,000 additional workers. 'Strategically important' parts would be made by Mercedes and SMH. The president of the Sarreguemines district, Mr Hubert Roth, said he hoped the Hambach site would become 'a pole of attraction' for the car industry, noting that Mercedes had taken an option on a further 14 hectares, in addition to the 50 hectares on which it will build the car plant. Mr Gerard Longuet, the former French industry minister who still heads the Lorraine regional council, said the investment fitted with Lorraine's cross-frontier development strategy. It would create more than 2,000 jobs directly and another 8,500 indirectly. In Paris, officials said France would give aid up to the permitted ceiling of 17 per cent of the DM750m investment, but this would have to be cleared by the European Commission in Brussels.</p>

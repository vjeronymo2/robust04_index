			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Managers claim an end to long lunch The days of senior managers lingering over long and liquid lunches are over, it was claimed yesterday by a group set up by brewers to promote sensible drinking. A survey by the Portman Group said that six out of 10 senior managers claimed they never touched alcohol during their working day. Dr John Rae, chairman of the group, said: 'The days of the liquid business lunch are gone. Today, deals are more likely to be clinched over a bottle of mineral water.' But an examination of the drinking habits of executives at some of the City's most fashionable watering holes showed that, while customers may be drinking less alcohol they are still enjoying a glass, or two. At Le Pont de la Tour - one of the City's most fashionable restaurants  - 137 sober-suited executives yesterday drank 55 bottles of wine and 72 bottles of water at lunchtime. It is a similar story elsewhere in the City. The Corney &amp; Barrow restaurant in Cannon Street sold 1,253 litres of water last month. But its customers still managed to consume more than 2,000 bottles of champagne and 6,000 bottles of wine - though this includes evening drinking. Portman Group researchers felt health awareness, fierce competition as a result of the recession and stricter drink-drive laws were factors in a corporate-culture change.</p>

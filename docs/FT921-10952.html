			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: Gertler, a story of doubt At certain decent intervals the attempt is made to restore the reputation of the painter, Mark Gertler. The last was nine years ago, at the Ben Uri Gallery; the one before that, a touring show put together by the Minories at Colchester in 1971. This latest retrospective study has been organised by the Camden Arts Centre, which it now fills (Arkwright Road NW3, until March 8, then on to Nottingham and Leeds). Again, sadly, it just will not do, quite. The trouble is clear and simple enough: his own life. Intriguing and ultimately tragic, it was one of manifest talent and early promise followed by years of struggle, doubt and failure, both critical and financial. In the high summer of 1939, it ended in suicide, at the second attempt, at the age of 47. Gertler came of a Polish-Jewish immigrant family lately settled in the East End. As with Epstein and Bomberg, his Jewishness was always to be a positive element in his work, though not always overtly so. He was handsome, bisexual and evidently charming, once he had overcome his youthful shyness. From his student days he enjoyed the interest of powerful friends and supporters, found largely within Bloomsbury and the broader circles of Jewish cultural life. He had been recommended to the Slade by William Rothenstein, where he was sponsored by the Jewish Educational Aid Society. Later he was supported by the collector, Sir Edward Marsh, lionised by Lady Ottoline Morrell, at whose house at Garsington he became one of her wartime, pacifist coterie. He was an intimate of Lytton Strachey and his friends, and indeed had been the lover of Dora Carrington whom he had met at the Slade, who left him for Strachey. To be a painter in an essentially literary pool, Bloomsbury's most important painter even, is not all that much: small wonder that the circumstances of the life should so readily be entered as special plea for work so long decently obscured and disregarded. Gertler had been a star pupil at the Slade, in a period of conspicuous stars, with such as David Bomberg, Paul Nash, Christopher Nevinson, Edward Wadsworth and Stanley Spencer among his contemporaries. While not following, with Bomberg, Wadsworth and the others, along Wyndham Lewis's Vorticist path, he was radical enough in his way, in those pre-war years, aware of the general work of the avant-garde. He was, if anything, closer to Spencer in his symbolist figure compositions, with their mannered and exaggerated groups, yet looking too at Matisse and Gauguin, seen at Roger Fry's post-impressionist exhibitions, for practical example. Yet he had won prizes for his drawing in the academic Slade tradition, supposedly the best draughtsman since Augustus John though the line would continue quite as well in the hands of such as Strang and Kennington. The drawings shown here are fine, strong portrait studies, powerfully sculptural in their modelling, the studies of his mother oddly close both in feeling and likeness to those that Henry Moore would make of his own mother more than ten years later. These are indeed the work of the gifted, conscientious student, just as there is the gifted, conscientious student in every generation. And it is precisely this quality that gives us pause. Here is Gertler as a young man, looking sensitively and intelligently now this way, now that and producing, it must be said, usually creditable and sometimes positively beautiful versions, but versions of something not yet, if ever, convincingly his own. This search for an authentic personal vision was to become increasingly desperate as his life went on and, quite as much as anxiety and ill health, was eventually to kill him. The irony is that it is in this early period, of the Slade and just after, when the work is most various and yet unselfconscious in its acceptance of other influences, that it seems most personal and true. The painting of his mother, of 1911, is a straight-forward essay in the way of the Slade and the New English Art Club, shades of Steer and Rothenstein, but none the worse for that. The Violinist of 1912 is no more than the head of a young woman with a mop of hair, set, as a Renaissance head might be, against a clear blue sky, could hardly be stylistically more different in its close and meticulous description. It is the single most beautiful image in the show, and so distinct as it might be by quite another hand. There is no doubting the competence, again the good student. The composition is sound, the realisation unfailingly thorough whichever scheme or convention proposed. But always the more modest and straight-forward the work the better: the portrait that for all the mannerisms of handling and surface betrays a true, transcending interest in the sitter; the still-life that so engages the artist that he forgets himself, and his artfulness, in its complete and little world. The later the work, the more uncertain it becomes, a curiously decorative amalgam of Renoir and Cezanne misunderstood, or increasingly desperate reworkings of the painting then coming out of Paris, of Picasso especially. I said, of the Ben Uri show in 1982, that it was easy to see how convincing he must have seemed in his early days, and equally easy to understand how desperate his sense of his own subsequent failure must have been. I thought those later paintings extraordinary, flailing exercises in pastiche, but not in any knowing or cynical way. Rather more poignant than that, they suggested a repeated and despairing effort to catch the secret of another's authentic vision. In this he inevitably failed, and stood revealed as a truly tragic, unenviable figure. In the light of this latest show, I would moderate that judgment only for the 'flailing exercises in pastiche', which is clearly unfair. For the rest, it stands. Gertler was an honourable, serious, sympathetic and persistent painter, but never the outstanding artist his apologists claim and he tried so hard to be.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Observer: Eminence Beeb So familiar is the seemingly unchanging screen presence - lined face, silver hair, clear voice - that it is a shock to discover that Charles Wheeler, the veteran BBC TV reporter, reached 69 last week. He is nearly twice as old as most of the competition, and twice as good. He began work as a tape boy at the old Daily Sketch in 1940 before joining the Royal Marines. After a spell in naval intelligence - during which he developed a suspicion of George Blake, later unmasked as a Soviet spy - he joined the BBC in 1947. These days he is employed as a freelance for 'Newsnight', so he doesn't have to retire. In the back-stabbing world of broadcasting, he is one of those rare people for whom respect is universal. Speak to the top people in BBC current affairs, or politicians like Mrs Thatcher, and the impression is that Wheeler would be their first choice on practically any major story anywhere in the world. Viewers still remember his years in Washington, where he and Gerald Priestland shared the job, not entirely amicably, but he has also been the BBC's chief correspondent in Berlin, Europe as a whole, and Southern Asia. There has been no shortage of offers to come in off the road. But like James Cameron or Alistair Cooke, he has always seen himself as just a reporter.</p>

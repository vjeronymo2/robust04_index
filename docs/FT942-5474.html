			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Rivals go for land-speed record McLaren, the grand prix and electronics group, yesterday became locked in a technology battle to take the world land-speed record beyond the sound barrier. Mr Richard Noble, the current holder, said that Castrol, TI Group and other UK companies had joined to help him build a rival to a McLaren car intended to travel at 1,000mph. It is being prepared by McLaren to break the 633mph record set in Nevada's Black Rock desert 10 years ago. The rivalry has led to a technological breakthrough for the Ministry of Defence's Proof and Experimental Establishment at Pendine, south Wales. RAF officers from the establishment were at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' London headquarters yesterday to demonstrate equipment which generates precise data on the dynamic behaviour of vehicles travelling at very high speeds in close proximity to the ground. The MoD said the system and the information it was capable of generating would be sold to commercial customers. The equipment was used to accelerate a model of Thrust SSC, the intended record vehicle, from standstill to 812mph in eight-tenths of a second. The Noble team also unveiled the twin Rolls-Royce Spey jet engines which are to propel the 54ft car and which will provide it with 100,000 horsepower for a design speed of at least 850mph. Mr Noble, whose first record attempt took more than seven years to complete, said McLaren, in spite of its much larger resources than the Pounds 2m Thrust project, was likely to find breaking the record 'a lot more difficult than it might appear'.</p>

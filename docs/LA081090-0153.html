			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE BARS WILDMON ART BROCHURE MAILING  </P> <P> A New York judge has barred a conservative religious organization from  distributing a brochure containing out-of-context excerpts from a controversial  New York artist's work.  </P> <P> The judge also ruled late Wednesday that the Rev. Donald Wildmon and his  American Family Assn., a Tupelo, Miss.-based media watchdog organization, must  send a court-approved correction to the 4,000 churches, members of Congress and  others who received the pamphlet.  </P> <P> The court rejected multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz's claim for $5 million  in damages, however, and ordered Wildmon's group to pay the artist a token $1.  </P> <P> Wojnarowicz accused the American Family Assn. of reprinting severely cropped  segments of 14 large images he created (for a one-man show titled "Tongues of  Flame") and mailing them in an inflammatory broadside to religious groups and  government officials as part of Wildmon's ongoing attack on the National  Endowment for the Arts' funding of sexually explicit works. The suit was filed  in May.  </P> <P> "Tongues of Flame," which was funded in part by a $15,000 NEA grant, is on  display at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and runs through Sept. 5 in  conjunction with the Los Angeles Festival.  </P> <P> The images excerpted in Wildmon's brochure, which were not identified as being  taken out of context, all contain strong sexual or religious overtones. Many of  the cropped fragments included depictions of homosexual intercourse.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William C. Connor barred further publication of the  pamphlet, "Your Tax Dollars Helped Pay for These Works of 'Art,' " claiming it  had probably harmed the artist's professional and personal reputation.  </P> <P> Judge Connor said that because no gallery or museum exhibit of Wojnarowicz's  work had been canceled, the artist had not proved financial damage and only  awarded him $1 of the $5 million in damages he sought to recover in the  lawsuit.  </P> <P> Wojnarowicz applauded the decision as a blow to forces attempting to stifle  creative expression.  </P> <P> "Wildmon used distortion, half-truths and manipulation of facts and the judge  in this case has determined that such practices violate the law," Wojnarowicz  said in a telephone interview. "If this ruling inspires other people whose  rights have been trampled to realize that you can fight back and win, I think  it's great."  </P> <P> The Rev. Donald Wildmon could not be reached for comment, but his brother Allen  Wildmon, the American Family Assn.'s associate director, said the group does  not view the judge's ruling as a defeat.  </P> <P> "When somebody sues you for $5 million dollars and a judge only awards him $1,  I think that's about as close to a victory that you can get," Wildmon said. "We  feel the judge placed the proper value on Wojnarowicz's work -- we feel that $1  is about all it's worth."  </P> <P> Wojnarowicz acknowledged that he felt shortchanged: "What I want to know is  whether I get the dollar in cash or check?"  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Koei Kaga: "Secret Strife in MITI </F> Erupts With Resignation Drama, Greatest `Shame'"]    [Text] It was 1010 on 16 December 1993.    Masahisa Naito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau  (class of 1961), Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI], was suddenly summoned by a telephone call from the  minister's private secretary, "Please come immediately."    What can it be?    Tilting his head to one side, he thought, "It must be that."    A few days before, Naito had sat around a table of Chinese  food with MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. It was about that time.    "Hey, I'm asking you for economic countermeasures," said the  small-statured minister. It was a scene where he impishly began  massaging both of Naito's shoulders in an exaggerated manner and  the associates who were with them convulsed with laughter.    The Diet was being pressed for discussion on the political  reform bill and economic countermeasures, and Kasumigaseki was  also being pressed for measures. Moreover, the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] had left public office with the July  general election, the 1955 rule that had built postwar Japan had  collapsed, and the coalition cabinet that was borne in its place  had been calling for reform of the bureaucratic system which  continued to support the old rule.    The bureaucratic society of Kasumigaseki was about to face a  crisis, but those around Naito were full of peace and harmony.    Minister Kumagai has been criticized as "a capricious man  who  is an associate or lackey" of Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] secretary general (political source), but he is a  former MITI bureaucrat two years junior to Naito and they are  not entire strangers to each other.    Thinking that it must be a discussion on economic  countermeasures, Naito trotted toward the minister's office  carrying the related data.    However, when Naito stepped into the minister's office, he  noticed something unusual about Kumagai. He usually keeps his  private secretary present, but for some odd reason, Kumagai  seemed not to want his secretary around, but to be alone with  Naito, and he was trying to feel out Naito's demeanor with an  upward place.    When Naito sat down, abruptly Kumagai said coldly, just as  if  in jest, "It's hard for me to say this to you, but I want you to  resign."    "Based on cabinet policy, I want to change public feeling  completely," he added.    The blood ran out of Naito's whole body. Frightened, he  asked  in return "Er, when?"    "During this month or next month. I would like it carried  out  as soon as the personnel system is settled."    It normally is the Kasumigaseki custom that the  administrative vice minister orders personnel changes. This case  was unprecedented. When Naito rushed into the vice minister's  office flustered by this unexpected development, Vice Minister  Hideaki Kumano said with an expression filled with bitterness,  "Actually, I spoke with him two hours last night and one hour  this morning for a total of three hours, but couldn't get him to  change his mind."    "How many are targeted for resignation?"    "...only one, you."    "That is strange. That is absurd. There can't be complete  change in public feeling with the resignation of just one  person. I cannot accept it."    When Naito protested, Kumano merely hung his head and was  silent.    What about the deputy vice minister? The deputy vice  minister, who is said to be one with the vice minister, should  have known about this matter. When Deputy Vice Minister Chikara  Makino heard Naito's story, however, he squeaked, "What?" He  jumped back with his mouth still wide open.    "I haven't heard anything about that!"    Not only MITI, but Kasumigaseki got wind of this sudden  affair and it ultimately became an uproar. Furthermore, this  became the occasion for the factional strife that secretly had  been proceeding in MITI and the move by Shinseito to gain  supremacy over MITI to surface all at once. Some even said that  politics was intervening in administration.    However, why was Naito, who was the number one candidate for  next administrative vice minister and was called Mister MITI,  forced to resign? When one investigates into the particulars,  one will comes to feel that actually a preposterous scheme lurks  behind this strife, and the firing of Naito is in line with a  carefully and minutely elaborated scenario.    Naito met with the treachery of his colleagues who, so to  speak, have stepped over the fence between administration and  politics and "shaken hands with the devil," and his bureaucratic  career of 32 years and nine months came to an end. This was a  kind of coup d'etat.    At the same time, this tumult unintentionally brought to the  light the "greatest shame" which had been fervently concealed  for many years by MITI, reputed to be a first-class government  agency -- the factional strife which has even involved  officials' wives who hang out in MITI and some allegations  concerning grants of the Japan Keirin Association (bicycle  racing) that was called the MITI moneybag.  <H5>  "Responsibility for Darkening MITI" </H5>   The issue of the resignation of Director Naito of the MITI  Industrial Policy Bureau that shook Kasumigaseki at the end of  1993 was widely reported even by first-rate newspapers.    Ultimately, this uproar was seen to have calmed down some  because Naito accepted the minister's advice to resign on 22  December and gave his resignation dated the 24 December 1993.    However, here again the issue has begun to fan a new fire.  "Why did Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau have to  resign?" There is no sufficient reason to explain that.    Minister Kumagai made public two reasons for recommending  Naito's resignation. They were: 1) on the occasion of Hirobumi  (1987 group), eldest son of the former Administrative Vice  Minister Yuji Tanahashi, retiring from MITI in January 1993 to  run in the general election of July 1993, Naito, who was then  the deputy vice minister, was responsible for using favoritism  in a prestigious personnel change, and 2) responsibility for  darkening MITI.    Regarding the first reason, the majority was occupied by  those who said that "Prestigious personnel changes were a  customary practice in Kasumigaseki and certainly cannot be  called good. However, what about the sacking? This was absurd  like pronouncing a death sentence by commiting a public  indecency like urination by the roadside. What explanation  would he offer about Minister Kumagai himself receiving that  prestige when he set out in the political world" (MITI former  official)?    Regarding "chief of the Policy Discussion Office, Small and  Medium Enterprise Agency," the prestigious post which Minister  Kumagai himself received, the people in Kasumigaseki firmly  believe that "It was nothing like the post, `planning officer,'  of Hirobumi Tanahashi which has now become the issue, Kumagai's  post was closely associated with local small and medium  enterprises, and it was a highly prestigious position that  served straight in the election. The title, study abroad at  Harvard University which Minister Kumagai effectively uses in  election [campaigns], is also a permission for study abroad  which Naito originally received after passing a rigorous  examination, and Minister Kumagai has received concession of the  privilege for nothing. He should not bear a grudge when he owes  Naito gratitude.    "Tanahashi is said to have a special promotion to seventh  class with prestige, but that too is misunderstood. There was no  skipping of years and no pay raise. It is difficult to  understand why he said such a thing when the minister himself  should have known that" (MITI former official).    Then there is the second reason.    That originated by the circulation of a mysterious  defamatory  document that divulged the prestigious personnel change of  former Vice Minister Tanahashi's son and censured the former  vice minister (consultant to Industrial Research Center) in the  first part of August 1993. A second mysterious defamatory  document appeared in September. After this happened, at the  beginning of October, a Komeito representative in the House of  Representatives Budget Committee questioned this incident and  Minister Kumagai promised enforcement of official discipline.  Meanwhile, a clamor arose when a group of lawyers brought a  charge against former Vice Minister Tanahashi to the Tokyo  District Public Prosecutor.    However, it has also been strongly voiced that "What  darkened the ministry was the one who circulated the mysterious  defamatory documents. The mysterious defamatory documents  generally censured Tanahashi and did not directly reproach  Naito. In spite of that, Naito was forced to resign for merely  having been the confidant of Tanahashi. If this is allowed to go  unchallenged, the people who are put out the mysterious  defamatory documents will all have to resign. Conceding that it  is a dispute between fellow factions, the Tanahashi faction  versus the anti-Tanahashi faction, the common sense is that the  two guilty parties should be punished together. It is absurd  that just to have Director Naito resign" (MITI division chief).    Moreover, the questioning in the House of Representatives is  reported to have been an extremely shabby collusive backdoor  maneuver of questioning. It was said to have been requested by  Minister Kumagai himself who handed over the mysterious  defamatory document to a Komeito Diet member (he has denied it  in the newspapers), and the allegations have raised bugbears.    Regardless of the special promotion and so forth, a powerful  vice minister's preferential treatment in the ministry for his  own son to sent him out in the election with a completely new  title cannot escape censure of mixing public and private  matters. On that point, the disparity with general common sense  and the lack of work ethic that permeates all of Kasumigaseki is  outrageous. Moreover, criticism cannot be helped of the  deviation from political neutrality which is sought in public  servants such as the closeness between Tanahashi and leaders of  the LDP such as Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary general, and  the assistance in his son's election, which was touched on by  the series of mysterious defamatory documents censuring  Tanahashi. Actually, the initial general response of public  opinion was strong cries for proper punishment in this drama of  dismissal from office.    However, the issue is that this drama of dismissal from  office was a scheme devised to correct such indulgences of  bureaucratic society and slackening of official discipline. In  the first place, regardless of how much responsibility there is  as the authority in personnel matters, the dismissal from office  of the incumbent director of the Industrial Policy Bureau just  for that is utterly unreasonable.    In other words, the reason for recommending Naito's  resignation is not clear.    Far from that, it is now openly mentioned in Kasumigaseki  that "The ringleader who contrived the resignation of Director  Naito related in any form to the mysterious defamatory documents  was Takashima, director of the Industrial Location and  Environmental Protection Bureau (1963 group, two years below  Naito) of the anti-Tanahashi faction with cooperation of Hisashi  Hosokawa, director of the Basic Industries Bureau (1964 group);  Masataka Nakano, director of the International Economics  Department, International Trade Policy Bureau (1967 group); and  Takeyuki Isayama, director of the Economic Cooperation  Department, International Trade Policy Bureau (1967 group), and  that it linked to Yukiharu Kodama, former administrative vice  minister (director of Central Cooperative Bank for Commerce and  Industry)."    However, it is said that "Neither the minister nor Vice  Minister Kumano has any intention of finding the culprit" (MITI  source). What in the world is this?    Is Director Takashima really the ringleader? We will  investigate this matter in due time, but before that, let's  touch a little more on the details of the Naito resignation  uproar. One can feel as if one were actually being there how  MITI might have fallen into the absurd situation with this drama  of personnel change.  <H5>  Whole Story of Dismissal From Office Drama </H5>   Combining the testimony of Naito that was obtained at the  end  1993, several opinions from inside MITI together with the  testimony of former Vice Minister Tanahashi, we shall try to  reproduce that time as faithfully as possible.    Having suddenly received the advice to resign on the morning  of the 16th, Naito immediately made telephone calls from the  Industrial Policy Bureau director's office to former officials  Toshinobu Wada (president, Petroleum Resources Development Co.),  Keiichi Ohase (president, Arabia Oil Co.), and Yoshihiki  Morozumi (power development consultant) with experience as a  successive administrative vice ministers. It has been a common  practice in the past to put a call through in some form to the  former officials about such personnel changes. However, they  knew nothing about it.    Meanwhile, Minister Kumagai was making calls to the former  officials to explain the situation about the same time that  Naito was making the calls. However, in addition to those two  reasons mentioned earlier, the minister had two more reasons:  One was the issue of Naito's closeness to specific businesses.  The other was that he had gone too far into politics. Regarding  the latter, the minister made the explanation to the former  officials that "Former Administrative Vice Minister Tanahashi,  who has deep connections with the LDP, has been carrying out a  movement to unseat the cabinet, and Naito has cooperated in  leaking information to him. Or, Naito is on close terms with  Secretary General Takemura of Sakigake [Harbinger] and has  leaked information that the minister himself does not know.    Moreover, when the minister went visiting back home after  becoming minister, Naito, who went with him to Shizuoka as an  aide, humiliated him by saying that "You should discuss such an  important matter with Kajiyama" when he received petitions from  local supporters.    Regardless of whether the details are authentic, undoubtedly  there was a political opposition structure of "Sakigake versus  Shinseito" under the coalition regime or "Ozawa/Kumagai  Shinseito versus Kajiyama LDP" behind this tumult from the start.    Meanwhile, what about collusion to special enterprises.    This was the involvement in a scandal long ago with receipt  of a kickback from an oil company with close ties to MITI.    However, Minister Kumagai, when he mentioned that, was  perplexed at the reply returned by one of the former officials  that "Is there clear proof of that?" and backed down threatened  back by, "We are absolutely opposed to the firing of Naito. If  you do such an unreasonable thing, all of MITI will become your  enemy. All right?"    That night, it is said that in the ministry, "Vice Minister  Kumano summoned Bureau Director Takashima and the two had a  secret discussion alone for about an hour and a half. Moreover,  Minister Kumagai and Deputy Vice Minister Makino discussed the  Naito problem, but there was no headway in agreement on the  matter, and later Vice Minister Kumano joined them" (talk inside  MITI). What did they discuss?    On 16 December 1993, the political world was in great  disarray by the death of former Prime Minister Tanaka. In the  afternoon, Vice Minister Kumano entered the prime minister's  official residence in a fluster. There is evidence that a  considerable quarrel took place there about the Naito problem.    That night, a person identifying himself as "someone from  MITI" telephoned newspapers and reported: "Industrial Policy  Bureau Chief Naito just received the advise to resign. The  reason was favoritism in personnel changes and closeness to  special businesses." Someone clearly had come to stab Naito.    On the next day, the 17th, at 1100, in the minister's  office,  Kumagai again pressed for Naito's resignation, citing two  reasons.    "Whether it was common practice or not, I apologize for  having carried out the prestigious personnel changes. However,  I cannot accept the assessment of resignation. After all, you  too move out to the political world with a prestigious personnel  change."    When Naito protested this way, Kumagai asserted, "It is not  an issue of legality. It is an issue of propriety."    When Naito touched upon his collusion with special  businesses, etc. which Kumagai himself spread, Kumagai suddenly  changed his attitude, and holding his head in his hands and even  with a smile on his face, he said:    "Oh, what to do! I am troubled because you say such a thing.  I am troubled that such misleading information has been  circulating around when I haven't said anything about the  slightest dishonesty regarding you."    Ultimately, Naito stood up and left, saying, "If you must  insist on my resignation, why don't you fire me?"    When he went immediately to the administrative vice  minister's office, Vice Minister Kumano looked at the state of  Naito and in a fluster called Makino, "Deputy Vice Minister,  Deputy Vice Minister!" The two, however, only bowed their heads  upon receiving Naito's report. The silence was unbroken.  Ultimately, the three remained silent for five minutes.    Within the ministry, on the other hand, "The rumor of  Takashima's quite unforeseen appointment to director of the  Industrial Policy Bureau circulated." (MITI employee)    Around 1400, Naito again confronted both Kumano and Makino  in  the vice minister's office. Here, for the first time, Kumano  broached the matter, "As the authority for personnel changes, I  would like you to resign."    However, when he was told by Naito that this was a strange  way of making a personnel change, he said, "It cannot be helped  because it is an order from the minister." When asked the  reason, he again said, "The same reasons as those of the  minister."    Moreover, when he was questioned by Naito on the propriety  of  each reason for dismissal, he mentioned that "No, I myself do  not believe the second one that you have darkened it  (ministry)...."    "Actually, when the first mysterious defamatory document  came  out, Director Naito twice advised Vice Minister Kumano to seek  the culprit. However, the vice minister refused, saying that  `The ministry will be darkened if there is a search for the  culprit.' In September, however, the second mysterious  defamatory document came out. It was senseless ethics because  even the responsibility for the second mysterious defamatory  document came to hang over the head of Naito by saying that `he  had darkened the ministry'" (MITI bureaucrat).    Ultimately, Vice Minister Kumano broke off with Naito by  persisting, "Resign right now."  <H5>  Administrative Vice Minister Kumano Laments </H5>   However, an unexpected situation occurred. The news, "Naito  advised to resign," was reported in the evening edition of that  day's ASAHI SHIMBUN.    Confound it!    Although this was what he thought, it was too late. Naito  was  resigned to the fact that he no longer would work beneath the  surface.    However, this report drew out unexpected results. The MITI  bureaucrats who became clearly aware of the situation by this  pushed their way into the administrative vice minister's office  in a body. That continued the next day, Saturday, and Sunday,  and it is said that they exceeded 100 in number.    Many pressed Vice Minister Kumano, "Can you permit such an  absurd personnel change? This is improper political  intervention." However, surprised Vice Minister Kumano "only  cried bitterly with no explanation of the reasons at all, and  we, too, were perplexed" (MITI bureaucrat).    Among them, the group who had joined the ministry in 1978  gave notice, "Since all 13 of us are submitting letters of  resignation, both the administrative vice minister and deputy  vice minister should also submit them and negotiate with the  minister. Such a thing cannot be permitted."    In the common sense view of Kasumigaseki, it is the  invariable principle that in such a case the vice minister also  write a letter of resignation and battle with the minister.  However, Vice Minister Kumano just cried at this point and made  no move to act.    On the other hand, there were constant telephone calls of  encouragement to Naito who kept to his home on Saturday and  Sunday, and even bureaucrats from other government agencies  visited his home to encourage him. Hails came from acquaintances  in the United States.    At this point, however, Naito and the bureaucrats were  seized  by an idea. In other words, everyone thought that the reasons  for the advice to resign clearly made no sense at all.  Therefore, there must be something bigger behind this series of  unusual situations, and the real reason could be that such as  the whole MITI itself would be saved by Naito's resignation.    At the beginning of the week on the 20th, Naito himself  pressed Vice Minister Kumano for an answer on that point.  However, the scene that unfolded from that was even more strange.    Naito pressed Vice Minister Kumano twice on this day, but  Kumano only said, "It's not that."    When Naito appealed to him with a desperate expression that  he should tell him now if he were hiding something and if he did  not let everything out in the open, MITI will be questioned  about it and would be eternally devastated by politics in the  future, lo and behold, Kumano began crying in a loud voice.    "I haven't lied to you for 30 years, please believe me.  Please believe me."    Then, the lamenting vice minister faced the deputy vice  minister next to him, "Hey, Makino, what do you say?"    Then this time, Makino in turn let out a big cry, "Naito!  You  are the senior that I most respect. I am speaking only from my  heart. There is absolutely no such thing."    The two merely cried.    On this day, Naito decided to write his resignation.  Something collapsed within his heart. He felt that work should  not be stagnated because of him.    Soon afterwards, white flowers were delivered to Naito's  home.    "I was told that it was a bouquet of whilte lilies. Since  they are funeral flowers, Naito was surprised and looked for the  name of sender and found that it was from the wife of former  Vice Minister Kodama. I thought that it was so thoughtless when  I heard about it, so I told them to `throw them away!'" (wife of  an acquaintance of Naito family).    This wife of Kodama was called the grande dame of the  association of wives of MITI bureaucrats. Like the factions of  their husbands, factions have been built up in the society of  wives. We will mention more on this later.  <H5>  Who Ensnared Naito? </H5>   Speaking about the factional struggle in MITI, there was the  "Sabashi incident" that occurred during the era of the Ikeda  cabinet.    This originated from unscrupulous Shigeru Sabashi, who  called  himself "a unique bureaucrat," formed factions with forced  personnel changes and resulted in the creation of an  anti-Sabashi faction in the ministry.    Sabashi was seated in the chair of Corporate Bureau (now  Industrial Policy Bureau) director, which was called specified  seat for those who were expected to become vice minister, but in  1963, when the long-desired vice ministry was imminent, he was  disliked by then minister Hajime Fukuda and skipped over. This  became an occasion for the factional struggle within the  ministry to intensify.    At a glance, it seems to resemble the current tumult. In the  "Sabashi incident," however, a policy dispute between the  Sabashi faction (national faction) and anti-Sabashi faction  (international faction) surrounding the propriety of economic  liberalization that would control Japanese commercial policy in  the future was at the root. However, there is no policy debate  in the recent tumult.    Whether it be the mysterious defamatory documents or the  actions of Minister Kumagai, only a fairly deep-rooted malice  can be felt in the undercurrents of the recent tumult.    Naito grumbles, "I still don't know why I had to resign."    It will be much easier to understand if we interpret this  tumult that the firing of Naito was the sole objective and the  reason for his dismissal from office by favoritism in personnel  changes was appended afterward.    Who in the world ensnared Naito, then?    The fingerprints appear in the first mysterious defamatory  document which became the origin of the resignation drama.    It was distributed at the beginning of August 1993.  According  to a MITI source, it was mailed to all those who were division  chief or above and about 600 copies were sent.    There is a point that we should note. The senders were "all  concerned younger members of MITI," but the contents of the  document was not something that they ounger members could have  written.    For example, the information about Hirobumi Tanahashi's  appointment as planning officer (prestigious) on 25 December  1992 and retiring from the post one week after and that the same  post was eliminated (recently changed to that form) after that,  etc... The specific date pointed out in the mysterious  defamatory document and the fact that the post was eliminated  (recently changed to that form) were known only to specific  people at a considerably high level among those concerned at  MITI who were familiar with personnel change information.    "The information in the mysterious defamatory document has  to  be perceived as coming from people inside MITI" (Masahiro  Fujita, chief of Public Relations Division, MITI).    In other words, it is certain that people inside MITI  contributed to preparation of the mysterious defamatory  document. This is a decisive fact.    Who was that?    Actually, the name of the "culprit" was already rumored  within MITI from the time of the first mysterious defamatory  document delivery. For example, there is this story:    About 20 days before circulation of the first mysterious  defamatory document, "There was a person who said to a person  from a certain private think tank, "`It'll be creating a big  problem. I'll do it thoroughly. I'll turn it upside down. But  you must absolutely keep this matter quiet" (MITI former  official). It was the director of the Industrial Location and  Environmental Protection Bureau Takashima, of the anti-Tanahashi  faction.    Then there was the delivery of the mysterious defamatory  document.    July and August are around the time in government offices  when the ordinary June personnel change transfers have been  completed.    "It is amazing that the mysterious defamatory document was  delivered accurately to residences. Although there were people  who had just moved and changed addresses and therefore they were  not yet in the register, the mysterious defamatory document was  accurately delivered to them. It is only that person who had  the information on personnel changes could have known the new  addresses of those who were not yet on the list (the same former  MITI official).    It's amazing. According to MITI sources, there is an officer  who is called "the boss of the Personnel Division that handles  personnel changes." There is only one person who has had  experience as the assistant to the chief of the Personnel  Division, chief of the Personnel Division, and who has been the  general affairs councilor in the Secretariat and can get  complete information even from the non-career people. This is  also Director Takashima. What is this?    It is openly acknowledged that Takashima is in the  anti-Tanahashi faction.    "He became closeer to Kodama. The two often discussed `who  would be the next vice minister and who would be the deputy  minister.' He was a generous person and often treated junior  members to sumptuous meals. He was on the vice minister course  and the man himself was of that mind.    "However, when he fought with Makino for the post of chief  secretary which is called a mandatory post to a vice minister,  in spite of Kodama's recommendation, Tanahashi chose Makino, and  he was transferred to director of the Industrial Location and  Environmental Protection Bureau. It seems that was unbearable  for him, and Takashima was often seen with Kodama and speak  maliciously of Tanahashi at restaurants. For about the past  year, he has borne a grudge against Tanahashi, complaining that  `the rail (personnel changes) laid by Kodama was destroyed by  this'" (MITI former official).    Let's take a look at the actions of the anti-Tanahashi  faction.    First, there is Kodama.    When Minister Kumagai cited the words "darkened the  ministry"  as the second reason for recommending Naito to resign, there was  an former official who was startled when he heard it.    According to him, "Around summer of 1993, Kodama was  frequently telling the crowd in MITI that `I'll never let Naito  become vice minister.' As the reason, Kodama said, `If Naito is  made vice minister, the ministry will be darkened.'"    Then, as for Director Hosokawa, "There is a famous story in  MITI that at the time of the first mysterious defamatory  document was circulated, when a certain employee asked,  `Hosokawa, you must have distributed this,' he unintentionally  divulged, `No, it wasn't me. It was Kodama'" (MITI division  class chief).    Moreover, when the recent tumult began, Hosokawa made a lot  of telephone calls to presidents in the oil industry and  reported unilaterally that, "You should not associate with  Naito. He is acting smart now, but he will soon be arrested."    In September, the second mysterious defamatory document was  distributed. This was largely divided into three items, and it  criticised Tanahashi with various specific examples such as  "election measures for his son" and "closeness with  politicians." However, fingerprints remain here also.    "The special conference expense is pointed out here. The  document points out that while Tanahashi was vice minister, `the  special conference expense quickly increased from 30 million  yen a year to 60 million yen.' Since the mysterious defamatory  document was distributed, I was flustered. So, I checked into  the matter and found that it was true. However, this would not  be known unless you checked by leafing through the chits from  restaurants, etc., one by one. It is not information that can  be known except for a specific bureau. The one that has those  qualifications is the Budget and Accounts Division of the  Secretariat. The division chief at that time was Isayama" (MITI  former official).    He is also said to be in the anti-Tanahashi faction.  <H5>  Kodama Faction Knew!? </H5>   The more you investigate, the more figures who gathered in  the anti-Tanahashi faction network with Kodama at the top that  could be called the Kodama faction are making an appearance.    Actually, Vice Minister Kumano, who recently took an  incomprehensible action, is tied to this Kodama faction.    Kodama and Kumano come from the same high school affiliated  with Hiroshima University, have a senior-junior relationship,  and it is said in MITI that they are closer friends than  brothers.    They were so close in this tumult that it is rumored "Kumano  calls Kodama's place every night and complains" (MITI source).    It seems that Kumano has come to be ridiculed in MITI as  "the  crying Kumano" due to this tumult, but there is a possibility  that this crying has been an act.    As mentioned before, Kumano explained to Naito that he first  heard about the intention to fire Naito from Kumagai on 15  December. However, it seems that he knew it far in advance.    "In the latter part of September 1993, Kumagai summoned  Nobutsugu Fukugawa, a former powerful vice minister from Kobe  (vice president of Kobe Steel) and they met at a restaurant in  the city. On that occasion, Kumagai discussed the firing of  Naito. Fukugawa said, `That is outrageous,' but it seems that  Kumagai stubbornly refused to listen. Fukugawa immediately  called Kumano. When he explained the situation, Kumano just  said, `That's too bad'" (one of the former top MITI executives).    Why didn't Kumano discuss it immediately with Naito or the  deputy vice minister? Because of his responsible post as vice  minister endeavoring to protect his own ministry, it is  customerly that he devise some countermeasures. Kumano's actions  are utterly difficult to understand. Of course, the possibility  is great that this matter was reported by Kumano to Kodama.    In short, the Kodama faction knew about Kumagai's intention  to "fire Naito" considerably in advance, and there is suspicion  that they conspired in it.    Right after 16 December when Naito received the advice to  resign, a Diet member said to be a close associate of Ozawa  revealed the following:    "Kumagai has considered this firing since directly after his  appointment as minister. I did not know about the timing. The  cause was the coercive methods of the former Vice Minister  Tanahashi. He flung his son into the electoral district of Iwao  Matsuda (Shinseito) of whom Kumagai is fond, and MITI did not  support him when Kumagai ran as a candidate. It truly was a  grudge of many years. Ozawa said, `Do whatever you can.'"    There are two points here. One is that Ozawa and Shinseito  participated in this personnel change, and the other is that  there was a grudge against MITI or against Tanahashi in the  origin of this recent Kumagai action.    Kumagai and Takashima are very friendly.    "In MITI which did not support Kumagai, Takashima was the  only friend of Kumagai" (political source).    The two have a grudge in common. Furthermore, the grudges  against Tanahashi and Naito are shared by all of the Kodama  faction. Instances believed to have become the cause have been  revealed by several people in MITI.    This will be mentioned later, but among the successive  administrative vice ministers, the attacked Tanahashi is reputed  to be the one who stood out from the crowd in policy capability  and political power.    Tanahashi is the son-in-law of former House of  Representatives Diet member Yukiyasu Matsuno, and his eldest son  Hirobumi, who became the recent problem, run for candidacy to  taking over that base.    He has strong friendship with LDP Diet members topped by  former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama, and along with  the recent dramatic change in political administrations, "There  has been a move, centering on the Shinseito, to hunt  bureaucratic war criminals under the old rule. Beginning around  fall of last year, the information has been circulating that  there have been sackings one by one from MITI, the Ministry of  Finance (MOF), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Different  from MITI, MOF has solidified into a monolith of unity and seems  to have checked this move" (Nagata-cho source).    If this story is true, it is not strange that he would be  put  in the position of the number one target.  <H5>  Grounds for Tanahashi and Naito Were Detested </H5>   Naito, who was supported by Tanahashi, overwhelmed others in  the ministry with his capability. Both shared being "the ablest  workmasters of MITI" recognized both by themselves and others."    There is a very interesting episode. During the  semiconductor  negotiations when Tanahashi and Naito formed a team for the  first time, Tanahashi was deputy director of the Machinery and  Information Industries Bureau, and Naito was chief of the  Secretariat General Coordination Division. The words that MITI  officers spoken to Tanahashi upon viewing this matching were  that "We have placed a subordinate who is difficult to employ  with a superior who is difficult to serve."    It seems that both were strict in policy evaluation and  arguing without regard to who was superior or subordinate. For  that reason, they were harsh on unreasonable statements and the  failures of their fellow workers.    Although valued within the ministry, "they stung  subordinates  more than necessary and made them nervous" (younger bureaucrat).    Later, the two built a golden era with Vice Minister  Tanahashi who was "the greatest political expert in  Kasumigaseki" and Deputy Vice Minister Naito who was "the first  international policy man since MITI began."    It was the whole Kodama faction who embraced a sense of  crisis about these two.    There was once that Kodama tried to squash the Naito's  chance  by pressing Tanahashi that he should put "Masaaki Nangaku,  director of the Consumer Goods Industries Bureau (at the time,  same class as Naito), in as deputy vice minister."    "In the `VAN [value added telecommunications network] war'  fought by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and MITI,  the front line commander was Kodama and the his junior Kumano  took general command of the battalion. The result, however, was  a crushing defeat for MITI. Responsibility for what the  Kodama-Kumano line had done at the time was shifted on others.  Single-minded Naito criticized this like a raging fire. Kodama  and others have painful thoughts of that time.    "Unfortunately, however, it was the Tanahashi-Naito team who  succeeded afterward. They plotted a repechage and fought with  the Ministry of Education concerning computer program rights  along with revision of the copyright law where Kodama had failed  and scored a real gain. This also angered Kodama" (a MITI old  boy).    Moreover, in his days as chief of the Basic Chemicals  Division, when Naito was appointed post, the petrochemical  industry, which up to then Kodama had boasted was "my industry,"  instantly was swayed by Naito. Kodama was said to have been  extremely angry about this.    Moreover, unfortunately, "Takashima and then Hosokawa  followed as his successors, but the industry went to Naito for  discussion when anything happened and took no notice of them"  (MITI officer).    Gradually, Tanahashi and Naito began to incur hatred from  the  Kodama faction because of their excellence. There was an  incident that when various ministries were united in drawing up  two bills related to information processing, with Naito as its  leader, "It happened that Nakano forgot about making a budget  request for a `law concerning promotion of information  processing.' It was an unbelievable error, and his  responsibility amounted to whether he should resign.  Ultimately, Naito ran around appealing to the Cabinet  Legislation Bureau and succeeded without incident. Nakano could  not hold up his head before Naito" (MITI former official).    However, that conversely became the occasion for the birth  of  the buds of hatred for Naito within the heart of Nakano.    There is another story that when Isayama went full of  confidence to the post of JETRO [Japan External Trade  Organization] industrial investigator in the United States which  is considered to be an elite course in MITI, he became  dispirited confronted by an enormous network of Naito who is  reputed to be internationalist.    There is still more story that after Kodama retired from  government office as vice minister, he was rejected by  Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd. where he was supposed to have  gone as vice president with implications of president, and after  that, he had difficulty in golden parachuting.    "Kodama was said to have complained to those around him that  `This, too, is the result of Tanahashi and Naito not being  staunch for me,' and he felt resentment toward them" (MITI  former official).    In short, for the Kodama faction, Tanahashi and Naito were  an  eyesore. That may be the natural result produced by the enormous  envy and lust for power of the elite bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki  hidden in the lining of their well-pressed suits. Apart from  Tanahashi who has retired from government office, there would be  no favors to them if a Vice Minister Naito were born. That  probably produced in the hearts of Takashima and others an  impatience resembling a sense of panic. "The people in Kodama  faction were saying, `It's either Naito dies or we will be done  for'" (MITI source).    Shinseito or Minister Kumagai can take advantage of a  vulnerable point there.    With regard to the Kodama faction, another faction is pasted  to them as a lining, forming a pair with the male faction. It  probably is necessary to touch on this too.    The fact that Kodama's wife runs the association of MITI  elite bureaucrat wives was touched upon a little previously.    The name of that association is "Ranfini." In French, it  means "infinity." This association also is tremendous.    "The wives who dress up in high-quality brand clothes begin  talking about Paris or Spain. They do not appear to be wives of  public servants at all. Their manicures are perfect. Some of  them wear rings with huge jewels and when they place their hands  on the table, their palms turn over with the weight" (a  participant).    This wives' association holds intact the scheme of  opposition  of their husbands who continue the factional strife in  Kasumigaseki and at present is forming "a wives' version of the  Kodama faction."    The core members are the wife of Kodama on down to the wife  of Kumano, the wife of Nangaku, and others. Only the wives of  officers who sometimes are permitted there can participate.    One wife who participated says, "I really hate it, but I  participate to have my husband pulled along."    Worried, a husband would come asking, "I wonder if  everything  is all right; no one has called yet to invite my wife" (MITI  source).    The husbands and wives together have tremendous influence.  What is more surprising is the activities of these wives.  Bearing the dignified name of "an association of wives of MITI,"  they go on tours once or twice a month to businesses under the  jurisdiction of MITI. Moreover, the members are the wives of  officers only. It flusters the places to which they visit.  <H5>  "Let's Go for a Ride in Tank" </H5>   On a factory tour of a chemical company, the chairman  expressly came out and sweating with an uncertain hand, prepared  food and served them. How ridiculous!    Moreover, the wife of Kodama suddenly said, "Let's ride in a  tank." So, she planned a tour of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and  surprised the members. Actually, it is said that Naito dealt  harshly with such collusive groups. This too grated against the  nerves of the Kodama faction.    However, a more serious secret is hidden in the Kodama  faction. That is the unusual closeness with Ozawa and Shinseito.    In 1991, when Ozawa visited the Soviet Union and had a  audience with then President Gorbachev, he took with him a plan  called "return of the northern territories in exchange for $24  billion of economic aid." Actually, it was the Kodama faction  that prepared this plan.    "Kumagai introduced Kodama to Ozawa, and Kodama is linked to  Takashima and Nakano. It was Nakano who put together the  substance and Takashima was the captain.    "When that plan for $24 billion surfaced, MITI received  protest from the various related ministries such as Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance because it was an  unprecedented act exceeding authority. This has also became a  problem in MITI itself" (MITI former official).    Moreover, it is said that Nakano and Isayama were in charge  of the parts relating to MITI in Ozawa's book, Blueprint  for Building a New Japan, and Takashima is said to be a  member of "the association to make Ozawa prime minister" in  Kasumigaseki.    Ozawa and the Kodama faction have been very close ever since  the old LDP era. Viewing the series of introduction,  development, turn, and conclusion which started with the  mysterious defamatory document uproar, there is a possibility  that the Kodama faction was deeply involved in the recent Naito  dismissal drama.    From here on is only bold inference. However, we think that  the Kodama faction that had been nervous about birth of a Vice  Minister Naito was waiting for a chance to overturn prescribed  personnel changes when the unforeseen collapse of the 1955 rule  occurred, and a coalition regime substantially controlled by  Ozawa and Shinseito was born. It was the chance of a lifetime.  The luck of MITI minister appeared to Kumagai. The scenario  started from here.    Kumagai's aim is "securing the vested interests of  Shinseito.  In the political contribution allocation ratio to political  parties by industry, the steel, auto, and electric power  industries, which are called the three great families, stand  side by side. The decision on the percentages by the three great  families is made from January to February every year. The  maximum influence should be exerted on the industry directly  before that" (political source).    Naito was the target. They would fire Mister MITI. The  effect  would be tremendous and there would be merits for both sides.  What they miscalculated, however, was that there was no decisive  scandal about Naito. Therefore, they put the Tanahashi scandal  on Naito. So, on that fateful day, 16 December 1993, Kumagai  gave Naito advice to resign....    Of course, this is not outside the realm of conjecture.    However, the voices of Ozawa's Shinseito about this tumult  in  Kasumigaseki have overwhelmingly been, "It is a warning and  threat to us." It is no reason just to fire him. If that is the  case, the recent uproar has become the greatest scheme in  Kasumigaseki executed in the name of "bureaucratic reform."    On 1 January 1994, Kumano made an appearance at the prime  minister's official residence. He was accompanied by his wife  and paid a New Year's greetings to the prime minister.    "In a normal year, all the Kasumigaseki vice ministers and  wives come to the official residence. This year, however,  everyone hesitated because of the tumult over Naito's sacking at  the end of 1993, and the vice ministers refrained from making  New Year's greetings to keep their distance from politics. It  was surprising that Kumano came. He was the only vice minister  that came" (official residence beat reporter).    Kumano was said to have been happy, looking askance at this  atmosphere in Kasumigaseki.    Then, on 6 January, "Minister Kumagai, accompanied by  Director Takashima, met Ichiro Ozawa at a restaurant in the  city. An executive of Itochu was present there, and according to  him, Director Takashima was in unusually high spirits and  talkative" (MITI former official).    The new year without Naito was probably the beginning of a  happy lot for the Kodama faction.    Meanwhile, however, the irritation at MITI was becoming  bigger.    "Consultation for `wanting to resign' by younger career men  is growing because of the criticism and feeling of despair about  the recent uproar. Criticism against the Takashima group has  appeared in the ministry" (MITI source).    Voices such as "dismantle MITI and establish a Resources and  Energy Ministry" are heard from other government agencies. MITI  has suffered its biggest crisis since the war.    The appearance of two mysterious defamatory documents during  the recent tumult was previously mentioned. However, another  mysterious defamatory document which should be called phantasmal  exists. It was distributed around September 1992, and for some  reason, this was said to have collected and put lid on it. Why  was a lid put on it?    This document, entitled "Suspicious Issues Concerning a  Previous MITI Administrative Vice Minister," comprised six  items, and "suspicions of backdoor money concerning the Japan  Keirin Association" were pointed out. When we pursued this  issue, some strange information gushed forth, and from among  that, the company IBC, Ltd. surfaced. When inquiring about this  company, however, several MITI bureaucrats said, "That is  Takashima's company."    On the occasion of establishing the company, Takashima and  Nakano and Isayama who are his juniors seemed to have put  considerable effort in the related section.    The brunt of the suspicions on the Japan Keirin Association  backdoor money noted in the mysterious defamatory document  pursuing Tanahashi conversely are directed to the people in the  anti-Tanahashi faction. That is probably the reason that this  mysterious defamatory document was sealed.    IBC is a mysterious company.    It is well known that the the Japan Keirin Association  transfers about 3 to 5 percent of the sales for bicycle racing  to public corporations. A MITI source says, "Accounting is  rigorously checked by the Vehicle Races Council. It is in full  view."    On the other hand, however, there are voices saying that  "the  Japan Keirin Association is MITI's moneybag, so to speak."    It is said that "In the office regulations at MITI,  government offices will look after employees until they are 70  years old. A system for taking care of them has been created so  that when MITI bureaucrats assigned to related public  corporations after retirement, money is given from the Japan  Keirin Association to their destined corporation to help with  the meager salary" (MITI career man).    In other words, although the check is rigorous when money is  transferred from the Japan Keirin Association to the public  corporations, there probably are various methods for the way  that it is used after that.  <H5>  Unexpected Networks one After the Other </H5>   The money from the Japan Keirin Association flows into IBC.  There are suspicious that the system where money of the Japan  Keirin Association flows to individuals through corporations,  which the aforementioned MITI career man pointed out, is applied  here.    In order to understand this IBC, we find our way to a  company  called TeleJapan International (hereafter, TeleJapan), which  should be called its predecessor, and here again, an  anti-Tanahashi faction surfaces. Toshiko Tsuji, who has been  called "political and bureaucratic wirepuller" or "patron of  bureaucrats," is involved in the company called TeleJapan. Tsuji  is the daughter of that fixer, Kiroku Tsuji, who drew the  capital for founding the Liberal Party, predecessor of the LDP,  from Yoshio Kodama.    Takashima, Isayama and all go in and out of Tsuji's office  which is in Bicycle Kaikan Building, and "Not just MITI, but  elite MOF bureaucrats, all visit Tsuji. At MITI, currently  Director Takashima is said to be the central member" (a  bureaucrat). It can be said that Tsuji still has a fixer-type  existence which boasts hidden power.    The TeleJapan was established in 1982, and "it was created  by  Dentsu and Nippon Shineseru, each with a 50 percent investment  ratio, with MITI leading the chorus and influenced industry"  (person concerned at the time).    The president is a person called Junichi Kiyonaga.    Tsuji substantially controls this Nippon Shineseru and it is  a company that is jointly managed with Kiyonaga. Incidentally,  Kiyonaga is the husband of actress Shio Fujimura and former  private secretary of Yasujiro Tsutsumi, Seibu Group founder. The  business is movie production and PR [public relations].    First, let's touch on a part of the relationship between the  company and MITI.    For example, 94 of the 96 videos ordered by the Agency of  Industrial Science and Technology from fiscal 1980 to fiscal  1988 were made by Nippon Shineseru. (See "Government and  Government Related Agencies Foreign Language PR Film and Video  List.")    Furthermore, "if the people of Nippon Shineseru are refused  business by a company, a call immediately comes from MITI. `We  hear that you refused them, is that true?' They are so blunt"  (other production company).    Moreover, a bureaucrat says, "I received Shio Fujimura dance  tickets from Nippon Shineseru, so I went to the theater. When  turn about to look, to my surprise, the threater was the heads  of MITI bureaucrats and their wives line the place."    At the time of its establishment, MITI was prompted by the  necessity of PR and lobby activities for the United States.  Therefore, TeleJapan was created and the plan was to develop  activities with money flowing in from industrial groups.    However, it was held up because of a fight over interests  with MOFA. Ultimately, a system of cooperation was created  whereby the money from industry groups entered a MOFA-related  group once, and after a certain percentage was paid for activity  costs, it flowed intact to TeleJapan.    This MOFA-related group was no more than a window for  accepting capital.    According to people concerned at the time, the annual budget  was about 1 billion yen. The capital was supplied by the auto  industry, electrical-related, or the Japan Machinery Industry  Federation, etc., and "millions of yen annually" (person  concerned at the time) from the Japan Keirin Association came in  through the Japan Machinery Industry Federation.    However, the use of this about 1 billion yen which came in  every year without doing anything is not understood very well.  This money is said to have been used to the fullest.    While there are people who say, "Production of videos for PR  use was done and it was all in full view of the public," there  is a person concerned at the time who says, "It seems to have  had a money laundering aspect for money which government  officials could not use publicly.    That TeleJapan entered a sabbatical state in 1990 because of  trouble in the United States. At the same time, IBC was  established with Hiroshi Yomo, a former newspaper reporter in a  Kiyonaga-related company, as the substantially responsible  person and senior managing director.    The configuration was creation of the IBCC (International  Business Communication Council) a voluntary group with the  Automobile Industry Association, Electronic Industries  Association of Japan, and Japan Machinery Industry Federation,  etc., as members, the influx of money from the members there,  and entry into IBC. You might say that both are one body and the  group is simply no more than a tunnel existence for passing  money. Moreover, about 250 million in money from the Japan  Keirin Association came in through the Japan Machinery Industry  Federation. It is exactly the same system as TeleJapan. The  annual budget is about 700 million yen. This enters IBC without  doing anything and it uses up all that money.    However, it is not clear what it does. It is called  "overseas business communication business," (Japan Machinery  Industry Federation source). Upon investigating, we found that  it contributes to welfare groups of the United States or hold  journalist symposiums. It irregularly sends out bulletins and  newsletters from the United States to its members, but to be  honest, these are of poor quality. Also it has a branch office  on first class land in New York. While saying it is  communications business with abroad, Yomo, the substantially  responsible person, cannot speak English. It has only 13  employees and yet it uses up about 700 million yen every year.  It is a strange company.    "When they closed TeleJapan after it became embroiled in  trouble, MITI wanted to keep something similar to a TeleJapan.  So, they established IBC. (TeleJapan source)    Yomo, of course, denies this and says that there is no MITI  involvement at all. However, a MITI bureaucrat says, "We are  participating in everything, from budget allocations, etc."  What is this?    Speaking in regards to Takashima, people say that he lives  in  grand style. He lives by renting an ultra-high class apartment  at Shoto in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo where "house rent is about 1.5  million yen. If it were the Bubble era, it would be 2 million  yen" (realtor remark) and takes subordinates to high class  restaurants, paying the bills on the spot.    However, about two or three years ago, he was said to have  been complaining to a superior, saying that "I must purchase a  condo because I have to look after my mother, but I do not have  the money."    It is a fact that in the deputy vice minister personnel  change, which was the start of Takashima's hatred of Tanahashi  and Naito, one of the former top level official vigorously  opposed, saying that "Takashima as deputy vice minister is  absolutely no good. A money scandal will surface."    In the ministry now, various information is running wild,  and  the untransparent portions of MITI are being brought to light.    Why was Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau  forced  to resign?    We have asked Minister Kumagai, key persons of the Kodama  faction from Vice Minister Kumano and on down, and former  officials for information; however, they have all not complied  with our request. Answers are escaping still far away.    When one considers it, bureaucratic reform has formed the  nucleus of the policy vision worked out by Ichiro Ozawa. It is  true that the bureaucratic kingdom of Japan is demanded of  restructuring. The advice for Director Naito of the Industrial  Policy Bureau to resign is believed to be the first step.  However, not even looking at the facts of the recent tumult,  this has destroyed the point that distinguishes politics from  bureaucracy and even smashed the basic rules that bureaucrats  execute administration by fairly maintaining political  neutrality.    Naito, who has been called as Mr. MITI, is to leave Japan  for  a while and is to become a visiting professor at Georgetown  University in the United States. He was, perhaps, a bureaucrat  who was caught up in an unexpected storm of the collapse of the  1955 rule.</p>

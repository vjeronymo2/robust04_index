Some observers see that as being tantamount to an  appointment of Maj. Gen. Lemari as second defense minister. The  matter seems to have caused sharp arguments at the military  command's meetings last Wednesday and Thursday. Although Maj.  Gen. Lemari rejected the post of defense minister when Zeroual  became president and also objected to anyone else assuming that  post, as a result of which President Zeroual himself assumed the  post, giving the chief of staff this authorization now means  that those opposed to President Zeroual's move toward political  dialogue have scored an important point, particularly as it  coincided with the partial acceptance of Maj. Gen. Lemari's call  for a change of military district commanders. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  has learned that 5th Military District Commander Major General  Abdelhamid Jouadi, First Military District (the capital)  Commander Major General Jnouhat, and Land Army Command Major  General Khalifah Rahim have been relieved of their posts. The  names of the officers who will replace them have not been  revealed yet but they may well be supporters of Maj. Gen. Lemari  and the hard-line trend in the Army.    Meanwhile, the military forces are launching attacks on the  areas where fundamentalist gunmen are active. According to some  sources, these attacks have resulted in a large number of  victims described by the security authorities and the media as  "terrorists." Maj. Gen. Lemari and the hard-line trend appear  to be banking on achieving tangible results in the field of  security that would provide the answer to those who claim that  the regime has no option other than dialogue following the  failure of the security option.    In the capital, Algiers, yesterday there was a gathering of  secular forces opposed to political dialogue with the Islamic  Salvation Front. Some 30,000 people, mostly women, attended.

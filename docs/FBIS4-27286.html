			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Bright signs have appeared  on the horizon for Japan's jobs market, with fewer firms  complaining that they are overstaffed, a Labor Ministry survey  showed Monday [30 May].    The survey, based on hearings at about 1,000 major firms in  late April, found that about 40 percent, or 10 percent points  less than in the previous poll in late January, still feel they  are laden down with an excessive workforce.    About 50 percent, also 10 percent points less, said they  were  implementing some kind of labor-cutting program.    The results are in line with another finding in the survey  that about 50 percent of those polled saw the business climate  as bad, down about 10 percent points from the January poll.    Employers remain cautious, however, with only 10 percent of  firms intending to increase recruitment for the next fiscal year.    Thirty percent of those surveyed are planning to skip or  reduce the number of recruits, while another 30 percent plan to  keep next spring's recruitment at this fiscal year's levels.</p>

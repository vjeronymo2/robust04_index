The commenter suggested that EPA more fully review all the technical aspects of operating and maintaining cooling tower systems before issuing the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the permit, the purpose of general permits is to extend environmental and regulatory controls to a large number of discharges and reduce some permit backlog. It is a mechanism through which the Region can properly regulate many of the minor non-contact cooling water discharges, it can provide quick coverage to a large number facilities. Time and resources do not allow for individual review of each of the facilities cooling water systems and the types of additives used. If a facility wishes it may apply for an individual permit which can address this issue separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter from New Hampshire expressed concern regarding the pH requirements for the permit, the commenter was concerned that excursions of pH caused by precipitation or intake water are not allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final permit requirements for New Hampshire do allow for pH excursions due to natural causes as part of the State Surface Water Quality Regulations (see the New Hampshire general permit, Part B, State Permit Conditions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix B_Final General Permits Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following three general NPDES permits have been combined for purposes of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .

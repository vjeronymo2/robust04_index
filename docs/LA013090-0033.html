			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAMAICA;  </P> <P> PANAMA INVASION DRAWS CRITICISM  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle's three-day peacemaking mission to Latin America  ended on a sour note when Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley told him the  U.S. invasion of Panama was a violation of international law.  </P> <P> "We exchanged views on Panama," Manley said, "and we are friends, but friends  do not always agree." Quayle visited Honduras and Panama in addition to  Jamaica. But the trip had to be scaled back because several Latin American  nations indicated he would not be welcome so soon after the invasion.  </P></p>

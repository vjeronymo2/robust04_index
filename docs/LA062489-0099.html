			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENOMINATION LEADERS OPPOSE MOVE;  </P> <P> LUTHERANS MAY INVITE GAY TO LEAD MINISTRY  </P> <P> In one of three recent moves around the country to extend church acceptance to  homosexuals, some Lutherans in the San Francisco Bay Area say they may call an  openly homosexual seminary graduate to lead a special ministry with the city's  gay and lesbian community.  </P> <P> The prime candidate is Jeff Johnson of Lancaster, is one of three openly gay  seminarians refused ordination last year. The three refused to make a pledge to  abstain from homosexual acts as demanded for the clergy by the  5.3-million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the nation's  fourth-largest Protestant body.  </P> <P> Church officials in the denomination's Chicago headquarters said they would not  recognize the ordination as valid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Must Be Certified'  </P> <P> Two Lutheran congregations, St. Francis in San Francisco and St. Paul in  Oakland, have voted their willingness to engage openly gay and lesbian  ministers on their staffs, according to the Rev. James DeLange, pastor of St.  Francis.  </P> <P> "While authority to select pastors lies within the congregation, under current  Lutheran rules the ordination must be certified by the regional bishop," said  DeLange in an interview. "However, there is historical precedent in Lutheranism  for congregations to ordain pastors," he added.  </P> <P> DeLange also noted that if Johnson were ordained by a congregation, any clergy  taking part would risk disciplinary action.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a "covenant of support" for the proposed ministry, which commits  signers "to participate in the ordination of Jeff Johnson . . . who has been  certified to be qualified for the ministry of word and sacrament" has already  been signed by more than 200 people, including 40 clergy.  </P> <P> Johnson was certified as qualified to be ordained by a committee of the  Lutheran Church in America -- a predecessor body of the Evangelical Lutheran  Church in America -- shortly before he graduated last year from Pacific  Lutheran Theological Seminary in Berkeley.  </P> <P> But Johnson's bishop refused to accept the certification after Johnson refused  to pledge himself to lifelong celibacy.  </P> <P> Indeed, Bishop Lyle Miller of the Northern California-Northern Nevada synod  said last week in a statement: "While we affirm ministry to and with gay and  lesbian people, we do not endorse a ministry of ordained people who are not in  compliance with the guidelines of the ELCA that ordained pastors are not to be  practicing homosexuals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Condemned Homophobia'  </P> <P> "The spirit of the church in this synod is very much standing with lesbian and  gay people," Johnson said in an interview with United Press International. He  said at the synod's convention in March that delegates "overwhelmingly  condemned homophobia as a sin and urged congregations to undertake programs to  eradicate it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, fewer problems seemed to be in store for a Minnesota congregation  accepted into the United Church of Christ and for an Episcopal diocese-backed  ministry in New Jersey.  </P> <P> The Spirit of the Lakes Ecumenical Community Church in Minneapolis became the  nation's first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline church when it  was accepted into the United Church of Christ in April, its leader said this  week.  </P> <P> "We hope that we're breaking ground and leading the way for other churches and  other denominations to open up and recognize gay and lesbian people's rightful  place in the church," said the Rev. Dan Geslin, pastor of Spirit of the Lakes.  </P> <P> Most Christian churches accept homosexuals as members, equally beloved by God  as others, but condemn the practice of homosexuality.  </P> <P> But the United Church of Christ, a 1.8-million-member Protestant church formed  from a 1957 merger, approved in 1969 its first resolution supporting civil  rights for homosexuals, and three years later it became the first mainline  denomination to ordain an openly gay minister.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Master's Degree  </P> <P> Geslin, 39, received a master of divinity degree from the Pacific School of  Religion, a United Church of Christ-affiliated school in Berkeley. He took over  as pastor of Spirit of the Lakes in September and immediately began pursuing  membership in the denomination.  </P> <P> In Newark, N.J., Episcopal Bishop John S. Spong this week established a new  ministry called The Oasis, designed to make homosexuals feel more welcome in  the church. Led by a deacon who is openly homosexual, the ministry will work  out of an office in All Saints Episcopal Church in Hoboken, N.J.  </P> <P> "We take seriously the baptism vow of our church 'to respect the dignity of  every human being,' " said Spong, who is author of the controversial book,  "Living in Sin? A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality."  </P></p>

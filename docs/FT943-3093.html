			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cott warns on margins despite gain Cott Corporation, the fast-growing Canadian supplier of private-label beverages, lifted second-quarter earnings by 50 per cent, but confirmed that intensifying competition was eroding margins in some important markets. The company's latest balance sheet provided ammunition to both supporters and critics of the controversial, Toronto-based company which has been a prime target of short sellers on North American stock exchanges. On the one hand, accounts receivable, inventories and long-term debt rose sharply in the second quarter. However, Cott also reported a large increase in accounts payable, capital assets and goodwill. Net earnings rose to CDollars 15.9m (USDollars 11.5m), or 26 cents a share, in the three months to July 30, from CDollars 10.7m, or 19 cents, a year earlier. Sales climbed 62 per cent to CDollars 320m, due mainly to a 39 per cent jump in US volumes, which accounted for more than half the 64m cases sold during the quarter. Volumes in Canada rose 12 per cent, while volumes outside North America were up 14 per cent to 9.2m cases. Gross margins declined to 16.3 per cent of sales from 17.2 per cent last year and 16.5 per cent in the first quarter. Cott attributed the narrower margins to weak prices in Canada and the low margins of Ben Shaw, its UK canner. Long-term debt rose to CDollars 71.3m on July 30 from CDollars 41.6m three months earlier and CDollars 23.2m a year ago. The latest jump was ascribed to ambitious capital investments and a US acquisition. But Cott said its cash flow was 'more than sufficient to fund heavy seasonal demands for non-cash working capital as well as increases in other assets'. Mr Robert Mason, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, said the company 'is still considerably under-leveraged'. Its share price lost 75 cents to close at CDollars 19 1/2 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.</p>

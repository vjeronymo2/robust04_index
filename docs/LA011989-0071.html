			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP!: GETTING A MAIL PROBLEM NAILED DOWN  </P> <P> While visiting back East, Bill O'Brien of La Habra saw a wall-hung  mail-and-magazine catchall about 3 feet long and 28 inches wide, with brass  grommets at the corners and the top made of white canvas. It had six  various-size pockets with labels, including bills and junk mail. But where to  get one here? Can you help sort things out for O'Brien, or will our failure to  come through drive this male right up the wall?  </P> <P> A Duarte reader named Esther is looking for Magic Lady panties of nylon and  spandex made by Exquisite Form, with garter attached; she doesn't want to use a  garter belt. Can you help hold things together for Esther, or are  belt-tightening measures called for?  </P> <P> Walter Stern of Santa Barbara has some 100-year-old copper pots that he would  like to have relined with tin, so that they can be used in the kitchen. Can you  help stir up a source, or will Stern never find out what's cooking in his  potpourri?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: For years, Jaelline at (213) 851-3909 has been  using Faberge's Woodhue fragrance -- cologne, toilet water, perfume, or  whatever -- but understands it has been discontinued. Anyone out there who nose  of a source? . . . Alda at (818) 706-8960 needs the sheet music for "You Made  Me Love You," copyright 1913. Any kind of help would be music to her ears.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> A. L. Singer of Hollywood, who was looking for plastic insert tabs for men's  shirt collars, can keep his chin up; he's had enough tabs mailed to him to last  for years. But if he ever runs out, he can follow the advice several readers  sent in: Cut up outdated credit cards or plastic pocket calendars with  heavy-duty scissors.  </P> <P> Hain cannot answer mail personally but will, space permitting, respond in this  column to readers who need -- or have -- helpful information. Write (do not  telephone) to You Can Help!, You section, the Times, Times Mirror Square, Los  Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

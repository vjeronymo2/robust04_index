			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Angola deal takes shape A POSSIBLE political solution was beginning to take shape in Angola last night, despite an outbreak of fighting in several parts of Luanda and the mobilisation of rebel Unita troops in several provinces. Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, has emerged as a key mediator in Angola's tense political crisis and is negotiating a possible deal between Mr Jonas Savimbi, the hardline leader of the former South African and US-backed rebel Unita movement, and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the leader of the former Marxist MPLA government. Mr Botha yesterday flew to the central Angolan city of Huambo and met Mr Savimbi, who has alleged that Unita's defeat in the war-shattered country's first democratic elections was rigged. In a four-hour meeting, attended by the Financial Times, Mr Botha began the process of hammering out a political deal between Unita and the MPLA to pull the country back from renewed conflict. He also urged Mr Savimbi to take the 'moral high ground' and pledge himself to 'discussion and dialogue' rather than threaten the southern African region with renewed civil war. Mr Botha's mission came as the United Nations and western observers are beginning to accept that the elections have been flawed, more out of incompetence and ignorance than out of design, and that it is time to broker a political deal between the two sides. Convinced that alleged irregularities in the electoral process had cast doubt on the credibility of the outcome of the poll, Mr Botha put forward the outlines of a possible political compromise on genuine power sharing in a government of national unity. He also suggested some negotiation on a new form of administration of the provinces such as Bie, Huambo, Benguela and Cuando Cubango where Unita swept the polls. 'The irregularities of the elections, the small margin the president has above 50 per cent and the starkness of the choice must force each side to reach for a political solution,' he said. 'It will take time to ripen and we need a balance of interests to see that resorting to force will only make both sides losers but that striking a deal will make both sides winners.' Mr Savimbi asked Mr Botha to 'convince President dos Santos that he needs us to bring this country together. There is an important part of the country which does not want him anymore. But I accept that we also need President dos Santos.' Mr Savimbi also promised that he would not 'use force to achieve a political solution but I categorically reject the electoral fraud,' he said. 'We need another pragmatic and just solution which is not imposed on us.' He said he could not accept the election results, which show him trailing Mr dos Santos with about 39 per cent to Mr dos Santos's 50 per cent after 90 per cent of the results were announced. If Mr dos Santos does not get more than 50 per cent then the law dictates a second round run-off between the two candidates. Mr Botha took several messages from Mr Savimbi back to Luanda for President dos Santos, including his agreement to meet the president 'anytime anywhere' and a warning that the government should not publish final election results, expected today, before the conclusion of an investigation into Unita allegations of fraud. 'I want you also to tell dos Santos that I can listen to you because you have been my friend and you have never betrayed me like others have betrayed me,' the guerrilla chief told Mr Botha.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Olivetti seeking L2,000bn to expand Olivetti, the Italian computer group, is seeking shareholder approval to raise up to L2,000bn (Dollars 1.17bn) in fresh funds to bolster growth and investment, especially in telecommunications and multi-media ventures. The decision to raise extra money was taken on Friday at a board meeting presided over by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the chairman. In June, Olivetti raised L902bn but this was primarily intended to alleviate the group's losses, which for 1993 are expected to be in the order of L400bn - 450bn. By contrast, officials said the fresh call was to take advantage of investment opportunities in the fast evolving telecoms and multi-media sectors. The decision was announced just as preliminary bids closed for the contract to operate Italy's new Europe-wide standard GSM mobile phone network. Olivetti is heading one of the three consortia considered most likely to win the contract. The consortium, Omnitel, in which Olivetti has a 51 per cent stake and includes Bell Atlantic and Swedish Telecom, recently increased its capital to L200bn. But industry analysts believe this would have to be increased further if Omnitel were to win the contract. The Ivrea-based computers group has also given a foretaste of its 1993 performance, saying group sales rose 7.3 per cent to L8,610bn, back to the level of 1990.</p>

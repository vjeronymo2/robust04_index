			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Fraud detection guidelines revive fears - Legal Briefs US guidelines for rewarding companies that report internal white-collar crime are causing renewed concern among lawyers. Lawyers say that, as feared, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organisations are being used as a mechanism for controlling and shaping corporate conduct rather than as a mere sentencing device. Under the guidelines, one year old this month, fines are reduced if a company detects a crime before any government organisation does, brings it to the authorities' attention and accepts responsibility. This summer the guidelines were used in settling government claims of fraud against Salomon Inc. Salomon agreed to pay Dollars 290m, and avoided criminal charges, by replacing its top management, sacking the principal culprits, co-operating fully with the government investigation and taking steps to ensure there would be no recurrence.</p>

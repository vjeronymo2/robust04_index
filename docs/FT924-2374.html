			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead ASDA, the grocery chain, announces its interim results on Friday and is forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m, with most estimates around the Pounds 35m mark. Analysts expect the improvement to be due to the reduction in debt and increase in interest receivable due to Asda's Pounds 350m rights issue last year, rather than an uplift in trading. The operating profit is expected to be little changed. The considerable efforts of the new management team, led by Archie Norman, will take a while longer to pay off. HP Bulmer Holdings, the premium cider and drinks group, is set for a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31. Analysts put interim profits at about Pounds 10.7m compared with Pounds 9.07m last year, with the dividend likely to be increased 10 per cent to 3.8p (3.45p). Devenish, the West Country pub retailer, is expected to report a 16 per cent rise in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m on Thursday. Pubs suffered from poor tourist trade in the first half but the second half has been helped by acquisitions. Tiphook, trailer and container rental group, is expected to report on Monday a decline in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 35m from Pounds 39.2m. Slower economies across Europe have taken their toll but the group is likely to lift its dividend by about 10 per cent from 4.4p a share a year earlier. Southern Electric is reporting its delayed interim figures on Tuesday. It had postponed them until after its chairman had testified to the House of Commons on coal. Its pre-tax profits are likely to rise by about 30 per cent to around Pounds 18m, a bigger rise than achieved by some of the other regional electricity companies. Daily Mail and General Trust should unveil on Wednesday a modest increase in full-year profits to around Pounds 50m from Pounds 47.7m. Advertising markets have been weak. Electronic Data Processing, the computer services supplier, is expected to report on Monday full-year profits of about Pounds 4.8m, up from Pounds 4.1m a year earlier. It had a good first half with profits rising 30 per cent to Pounds 2.4m but trading slowed sharply in the second half. Ferranti International, the electronics group brought to its knees by its disastrous acquisition of ISC in the US, reports interim results on Tuesday. The market is looking for further rehabilitation under the new leadership of Eugene Anderson.</p>

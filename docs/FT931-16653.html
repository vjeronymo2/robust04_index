			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: BHP sells further stake in Beswick BROKEN Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a further reduction in its involvement in Beswick, a stockholding company set up as part of its defence against a hostile takeover attempt by the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court. BHP said it had sold Beswick class A redeemable preference shares with a face value of ADollars 300m (USDollars 206.8m) to the government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, bringing the group a step closer to achieving its intention of selling its holding of Beswick preference shares. The deal follows the sale of class A preference shares with a face value of ADollars 400m to Westpac Banking Corporation last year. It leaves BHP with Beswick class A preference shares with a face value of ADollars 290m. BHP said the sale was on similar terms to the Westpac deal. The group is believed to have sold both tranches of shares at a premium to the face value. BHP has said it hopes to dispose of its A class shares by the end of May. Beswick, which holds 322.6m BHP shares, equivalent to 20 per cent of the company, was set up in 1988 to hold BHP shares obtained by Elders IXL, now Foster's Brewing Group, during Mr Holmes a Court's takeover bid. A second stockholding company, known as International Brewing Group, was set up to hold shares in Elders acquired by BHP as part of a deal with Mr John Elliott, then Elders' chairman and chief executive. Foster's remains a shareholder in Beswick, together with ANZ trustees. In addition to its A class shares, BHP retains ordinary shares valued at ADollars 73m, and non-voting convertible preference shares valued at ADollars 500m. BHP shares rose 32 cents to ADollars 13.60 after the share sale was announced on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

If nuclear  program is frustrated, a revolt is possible within a year" View  of Park Gab-dong of "National Salvation Front," organization of  defectors from North Korea.    "It is the Army that Kim Il-song of North Korea fears the  most. The army of North Korea, much dissatisfied with Kim  Il-song's system, they even exchanged fire with each other in  front of Kim Il-song's official hall in the spring of last year.  After that, by the demand of Kim Il-song, the ammunition of the  army around Pyongyang were confiscated.    Temporarily returned to South Korea after taking part in the  "Rally for Democratization and Recovery of Human Rights of North  Korea," held under the auspices of "National Salvation Front for  Democratic Unification of Korea" (National Salvation Front is  short for it) in Washington D.C. last October 22, Mr. Park  Gab-dong (74), the standing chairman of National Salvation  Front, said that he had heard that "the Army of North Korea was  very agitated." He thought that an internal coup could possibly  dismantle Kim Il-song's system within two years."    Mr. Park said that he had heard the following from the  members of the Front who participated in the Washington Rally as  well as its members living in exile in Russia and China, etc. If  a coup occurs in North Korea, the new military authorities,  officers who are higher in rank than the colonel who had studied  in the old Soviet Union, will become the main power in place of  Kim Il-song Faction.    The National Salvation Front, whose standing chairman is Mr.  Park, is an anti-Kim Il-song organization which was formed in  Moscow in January, 1992 by the defectors from North Korea. Its  executives are made up of Mr. Lee Sang-jo, ex-North Korean  ambassador to USSR (a lieutenant general of the People's Army);  Mr. Suh Hui, ex-chairman of Pyongyang Special City Party Chapter  of Korean Workers Party; and Mr. Park.    The Central Standing Committee are made up of 15 members,  who  have all served as ranking executive members in the Korean  Workers Party and People's Army. It includes Kang Sang-ho  (ex-Vice Minister of Home Affairs), Chung Sang-jin (ex-Vice  Minister of Culture and Art), Park Byong-yul (ex-Director of  Kang Dong Political School), Yu Song-chul (ex-Chief of Operation  Bureau of Supreme Headquarters of the People's Army), Chang  Hak-bong (ex-Head of the Military Academy), Shim Su-chol  (ex-Assistant Chief of Bureau of Ministry of People's Armed  Forces), Yu Song-gol (ex-Head of the Air Force Academy), etc.  The Front has a membership of about 300.    Its branches are set up in the USA, China, Japan, Kazakhstan  and Uzbekistan Republics of Russia, among others. The National  Salvation Front, through "National Salvation" published in three  languages, Korean, English, and Japanese, is pushing for  recovery of human rights of North Korea's 23 million people who  are dying of hunger, cold, and physical beatings. Its supreme  task is "to drive out Kim Il-song and his son."    The Front, in the Declaration of the Washington Rally,  demanded eight items. These are: 1) Eviction of "Human  slaughterer Kim Il-song and his son from office at once!" 2)  release of political prisoners, 3) freedom of the press, 4)  freedom of assembly and association, 5) freedom of residence, 6)  right to choose occupation, 7) guarantee of the reunion of  separated families, 8) guarantee of free hometown visits.  Appealing to President Kim Young-sam to "keep an eye on the  terrible scenes of North Korea's 23 million people who are  forced to live like slaves, groaning under the tyranny of Kim  Il-song and his son," the Front emphasized that "harmonizing  with and helping Kim Il-song were quite the same as massacring  the North Korean population."    The writer asked the Standing Committee Chairman of the  Front, Park Gab-dong, who temporarily returned to South Korea,  about the activities of the Front and the unrest of the North  Korea's army as well as that of the population of which the  Front knows.    To what extent is North Korea's army agitated?    "According to the information we obtained, North Korea,  after  the Gulf War, had officers higher in rank than regimental  commanders watch the videotape of the Gulf War to let them know  the American tactics of war. But it brought about a contrary  effect. The commanders who watched the videotape realized that  the outcome of modern war depends on up-to-date weapons. They  are therefore infected with defeatism, saying that if North  Korea with conventional weapons brought about a war, it would be  defeated. The enlisted are in a very bad state of health due to  long underground life and extremely demoralized due to long-term  services."    Through what channels do you obtain information from the  closed society of North Korea?    "We obtain information from Russia, China, Japan, etc. The  details of the channels should not be disclosed for their  personal safety." (According to the first issue of "National  Salvation," the Front is working in cooperation with an anti-Kim  Il-song organization in North Korea.)    You said that there was a gun battle in Pyongyang City,  didn't you?    "To construct apartment buildings of 50,000 families in  Pyongyang City in the spring of last year, North Korea enforced  the construction, mobilizing a corps of military force in a  district. The soldiers from the country, seeing that the  soldiers serving in the Capitol were treated much better than  themselves, forced their way to Kim Il-song's official hall to  protest. As the Presidential Security Guards fired upon the  soldiers to hold back, a gun battle broke out. After that, Kim  Il-song ordered the troops around Pyongyang to surrender their  ammunition."    If a gun battle had broken out, it must have been a big  problem.    "Responsible persons were rebuked. But the corps commander  of  the troops mobilized from the country, lieutenant general Kim  Song-il received immunity from responsibility, because he was  the son of Kim Il-song and Mun Song-ja."    I haven't heard that there was a son called Kim Song-il  among  Kim Il-song's sons.    "That is because Kim Il-song's relations with women were not  exposed. It is a widely known fact that Kim Song-il is Kim  Il-song's son. According to the information we obtained, there  is a fierce power struggle between the group of Kim Chong-il who  is Kim Il-song's son and the other group of Kim Song-ae who is  Kim Il-song's wife. Kim Song-il takes the neutral attitude. Kim  Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon and Chang Song-taek (husband of Kim  Kyong-hi, Kim Il-song's daughter) belong to Kim Chong-il's  group. Kim Yong-ju, Kim Il-song's brother, and Kim Pyong-il, Kim  Il-song's son, belong to Kim Song-ae's group."    It is said that a military coup was carried out and that the  persons connected with it were executed in North Korea.    "Although we also heard of this, we were not able to confirm  it. According to the information we obtained, a coup was carried  out last July and some rebel army escaping from North Korea were  besieged by North Korea's troops at a mountain near the border.  At that time the Chinese Army moved in, which once took a stand  against the North Korea's army. At about that time, North Korea  limited entry of the pro-North Korean residents in Japan into  the country. Such a measure has been very rare. The rumor of a  coup circulated around this time."    Is there the possibility of a military coup in North Korea?    "Yes, as I said before, North Korea's military authorities  are in much discontent and are infected with defeatism. If they  were provided with ammunition, they will point their guns at  Pyongyang. They are the most threatening power of and the only  substitute power for Kim Il-song's system. Split into the old  and new generations, the military authorities unitedly will  seize power. Thereafter, the new generation will gain supremacy  over the old generation, I expect."    What power do you mean by "the new generation of the  military  authorities" exactly?    "Ranking officers higher in rank than colonel, most of whom  studied in the USSR, are the new military authorities. Because  they served under the members of the Front in the past, they and  the Front will, I think, understand each other. To restrain the  new military authorities, Kim Il-song replaced company officers  with those who did not study abroad, I heard."    When do you expect the coup by the new military authorities  to break out?    "If the North Korea's nuclear program is sanctioned  immediately by the U.N., a coup will break out within the year.  If North Korea enters into diplomatic relations with the U.S. or  Japan, it will endure another two years before collapsing. Even  if the new military authorities seize power, the unification of  North and South Koreas will be possible only after five to six  years from that point," I suppose.    Will it be possible for North Korea to bring about a war?    "A rumor of an outbreak of a war is nothing but Kim  Il-song's  threat. How can he bring about a war with such out-of-date  weapons and demoralized soldiers? Because South Korea's  government does not react strongly to North Korea's threat,  North Korea is spreading such a rumor."    How much information about North Korea's nuclear program do  you have?    "We once obtained information that North Korea had requested  a testing ground of nuclear bombs from the USSR under Brezhnev.  Judging from this information, the nuclear weapons development  of North Korea seems to have been ripe for testing. I also,  during my stay in North Korea in 1956, heard a member of the  South Korean Workers Party speak about the construction of  nuclear weapons underground works. But nuclear weapons are  merely a threat to South Korea and Japan, and can never be used."    Is there any power collaborating with the Front in North  Korea?    "Two hundred thousand political prisoners detained in the  prison camps and 3 million nonsupporters, who are permanently  detained in the collective farms in the mountains near the Yalu  and Tumen Rivers, are opponents of Kim Il-song. They have the  same opinion as we. Twenty thousand North Koreans who defected  to China, now known to have been collectively housed in Inner  Mongolian regions, may also be collaborators with us."    To contact those people, what measures is the Front taking?    "Although the Front is planning a variety of measures such  as  running broadcasting stations, etc. to let the population of  North Korea know the truth about the outside world, it is in  trouble for lack of funds. At present it concentrates its  efforts on publicizing of what the Front really is."    By what methods do you raise funds?    "Those who defected to Japan while being active members of  the South Korean Workers Party in the past total about 30,000.  Many of them are rich. The Front manages to keep going with  their help."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw (DDP/ADN)--According to the German and Polish  interior ministers, Manfred Kanther and Andrzej Milczanowski,  there have been some initial difficulties with the  implementation of the German-Polish asylum agreement. This is,  however, normal and there is no question of Poland having  circumvented the agreement, as was reported by some German media  at the weekend, Kanther told journalists in Warsaw today.    In the six months after the agreement came into force on 1  July 1993, 2,697 people who had illegally entered Germany from  Poland were turned over to the Polish authorities by the German  side, Milczanowski said. Another 975 refugees were sent back  under a simplified procedure.    During those six months there were only 28 cases where the  Polish side refused to accept the persons to be returned. The  main reason for this was problems with the interpretation of the  papers which the German authorities must produce to document the  refugee's transit route through Poland. The Polish side  believes there are still some unresolved points regarding this  question.    Kanther said, on the other hand, that the documents'  plausibility was "sufficiently proven" by the agreements already  reached. Nor did he wish to comment on the figures quoted by  Milczanowski. Different categories in counting the refugees  preclude any comparison. Milczanowski announced that liaison  officers will be named by the end of February to bring about a  more rapid settlement of contentious issues.    Milczanowski conceded that some of the persons returned from  Germany have once again illegally entered Germany from Poland.  This resulted among other things from the fact that he could  not detain deported refugees for longer than 48 hours in  accordance with a decision by Poland's Constitutional Court.  However, this problem would be "sorted out" during the next  month and a half. Individuals refused entry should then be  flown back to their country of origin within 48 hours.    Kanther and Milczanowski also discussed cross-border  cooperation in fighting crime. An agreement to this effect is  to be drafted in the near future. The ministers described  cooperation between the interior ministries and police forces of  both countries as smooth.</p>

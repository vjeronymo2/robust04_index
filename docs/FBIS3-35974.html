			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We now go over to our political commentator Valeriy  Kiosa. He is on the phone to the studio from Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin's news conference. Over to you.    [Kiosa] Thank you. The prime minister was actually expected  above all to sum up the results of his visits to Italy and to  the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, but of course we could  not do without issues from back home. Let us be chronological,  however.    First of all, the Russian prime minister singled out the  talks on the possible expansion of G-7 into a G-8 -- by the  addition of Russia. But -- and this is, I would say, a new  element in the prime minister's standpoint -- he stressed that  we should realize the difficulties of this issue. These include  the prices -- it is against our interests too to bring them  down; and also the customs rules. So possibly one should start  from the political aspect of Russia's inclusion in G-7, and then  pass on to the economy. In the prime minister's words, there is  a certain degree of understanding from our partners.    As for relations with European countries, Viktor  Chernomyrdin  emphasized again that Russia was not laying claim to any special  status, but that it had a right to have the same status as  anyone else. Here too there are lots of questions. For  instance, we produce so much aluminum that, as Viktor  Chernomyrdin put it, one could bury half of Europe in it, while  their works would have to stop. So this is a delicate issue,  and all the details have to be worked out carefully.    Another problem is our debts. Our partners say: First you  pay, then we'll have cooperation. Russia, however, believes  that through cooperation it will get the opportunity to pay off  its debt. Here too some progress has been made, but talks are  continuing.    As I've said, however, we could not possibly do without  issues relating to Russian internal matters. A question was  asked about Georgia's possible membership of the ruble zone.  Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed a certain degree of surprise, and  said the question had not been raised at the talks, and Russia  was not ready for this. As for the ruble zone in general, the  prime minister stressed that many dozens of documents on the  economic union were being prepared now, including various fiscal  policy options. In any case, though, and here I quote Viktor  Chernomyrdin, the government will not do anything to the  detriment of Russia.    Talking about his short-term plans, the prime minister  singled out first of all his preparations for an important  government session, which is to take place not on 17 February,  as originally planned, but on 24 February. The date was agreed  only today, after a meeting with the Russian president, to whom  Viktor Chernomyrdin, at the start of the news conference, wished  a happy birthday. He said he had handed Yeltsin, on behalf of  the government, the best bunch of flowers of all those that will  appear in the president's office today. That is about all I can  tell you about the prime minister's news conference.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Excerpt] Hard coal miners have ended their two-week  strike. This was possible thanks to an accord between the trade  unionists and the chairmen of the coal companies. In a number  of cities, Solidarity organized strikes and demonstrations.  This is a part of the protest action the continuation of which  was decided upon yesterday by the National Commission. The  action is to continue until the time that the government  undertakes bilateral talks with Solidarity on the subject of  national postulates.    [Unidentified correspondent] The miners will not receive pay  for the period of the strike. In the course of talks during the  night, the protestors agreed to work off the strike days during  time normally off work. They can also include the strike days  as part of their holidays or take them as unpaid leave. Before  the miners receive payments for the days worked off, they will  be able to apply for advances. Now they are awaiting the  implementation of the decisions adopted.    [Begin recording by miners Solidarity official Karol  Luzniak,  identified by caption] Eleven postulates out of 12 were settled  or agreed upon yesterday and set down on paper, which does not  mean that they are implemented yet. Here, miners will surely be  awaiting on an immediate basis a report on what is taking place  during the meetings of the teams that have been created. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] Production has recommenced at the hard coal  mines, starting from the second shift today. The miners also  ended their occupation of the State Hard Coal Agency in  Katowice. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CONVICTION IN ACID ATTACK IS UPHELD  </P> <P> The murder conviction of a man for throwing acid into the face of a Sylmar  woman was upheld Monday by a federal appeals court, which said he was properly  prevented from acting as his own lawyer because of a severe stutter.  </P> <P> "Communicating with . . . a jury is the essence of a trial," said the 9th U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals in a 3-0 ruling.  </P> <P> Although self-representation in a criminal case is a constitutional right, it  can be denied to those who cannot follow court procedures, the court said.  Defendant Bobby Ray Savage's "inability to communicate his thoughts orally"  would have left him unable to question witnesses or argue to the jury, the  court said.  </P> <P> Savage, of Las Vegas, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the fatal  attack on Patricia Worrell, 34, at her home in August, 1980.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Richard Gilman, Worrell's former fiance, hired Savage and  another man for $750 to attack Worrell after she broke off their engagement.  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Foreign Affairs: Price of rapprochement - Japan could try to buy the Kurile islands but Mr Gorbachev may not be in a position to sell Ever since the Dutch paid the Indians Dollars 24 to buy Manhattan, it has been getting more expensive to acquire territory occupied by somebody else. In 1803 Thomas Jefferson paid Dollars 27,267,622 to the French in the Louisiana Purchase because he wanted the port of New Orleans. Admittedly Alaska, for which the Tsar accepted a measly Dollars 7,200,000 from the US in 1867, was, in retrospect, a bit of a bargain, but the Russian monarch was keen to sell. This week, according to some reports, Japan may offer about Dollars 26,000,000,000 in order to get back four tiny islands with minimal commercial and questionable strategic value, occupied by the Soviet Union since 1945. Even then, all these extra zeroes may not be enough, for it is far from clear that President Mikhail Gorbachev, on his 'historic' visit to Tokyo, is in a position to sell, even though, heaven knows, his country needs the money. Soviet-Japanese relations are indeed one of the more curious anomalies of the present day. There are historical and contemporary reasons for this, starting even before the Meiji restoration in the 1860s and running through the Cold War to the present. What they seem to amount to is an almost inherent mutual nervousness and suspicion, compounded by intermittent political paralysis in both nations and watched over, with acute interest, by the US itself. Though Japan and Russia hardly intruded on their consciousness, both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson had things to say which, taken out of context, have a certain resonance to the current relationship between Tokyo and Moscow. Washington, for example, pronounced in his farewell address that the 'great rule (in regard to foreign nations) is, in extending our commercial relations to have as little political connection as possible'. This advice is the perfect description of modern Japanese external policies, except that it only applies in part to the Soviet Union. Even though they are neighbours, even though Siberia's riches ought to attract resource-poor Japan and the vast Soviet population be a magnet for Japanese consumer goods, Japan's trade with the Soviet Union has never amounted to much more than 2 per cent of its total foreign trade. Political exchanges, however, have conformed to Washington's dictum. Jefferson once said that if trade were freed of its shackles, 'the greatest mass possible would then be produced of those things which contribute to human life and human happiness'. Modern mercantilist Japan would subscribe to the principle, but has hardly begun to practise it with the Soviet Union, where human happiness has not been a natural state. This stands in sharp contrast with the approach to China, with which Japan has a complex and ambivalent relationship but which it sees as a bulwark against the Soviet bear and therefore more worthy of commercial cultivation, with three times the Soviet volume of trade. Of course, Japan and the Soviet Union now constitute an almost classic mismatch. As Gerald Segal points out in a Chatham House paper* released this week, 'the basis for this . . . is the geopolitics of north-east Asia, where a thinly populated Soviet superpower faces a densely populated Japan which cannot defend itself. Yet Japan has emerged as an economic superpower while the Soviet economy stagnates and thrashes about for a suitable policy for reform'. Neither Mr Segal nor Dr Wolf Mendl, in his more cogently argued contribution to a new book, The International Relations of Japan,** believes that settling the territorial dispute would necessarily instantly transform the relationship. This, Dr Mendl argues, may only be attainable within the context of a broader north-east Asian co-operation, covering economic, security and environmental issues. But even then, he concludes 'it will take time'. In his more creative moments, Mr Gorbachev has allowed himself to contemplate such a brave new Asian world. Ever since he assumed power the style of contacts with Japan has improved, from his initial appointment of a new professional Soviet ambassador to Tokyo through to his visit on Monday to Japanese war graves in Khabarovsk. The Soviet rapprochement with South Korea is a move in the same direction, as would be the establishment of a new regional arms control regime, a blueprint of which he promises to unveil in Tokyo today. But this is still in the theoretical stage and must be set against powerful countervailing forces in the Soviet Union. The Kuriles are part of the Russian federation and Mr Boris Yeltsin is not exactly keen on having his great rival sign them away, regardless of the price. Nor is the Soviet military persuaded that they are militarily without value. Nor are the Start negotiations with the US, a necessary precursor of any new Asian regime, now going well. Thus it can have come as no great surprise that Mr Gorbachev declared in Khabarovsk on Monday that 'we are not going to use territory or policy as an instrument to make deals'. He may have no greater freedom or inclination than to acknowledge that at least the territorial problem exists, which the Japanese claim was conceded in part in 1956, but never since. Equally, in Tokyo, there is no great inclination to settle for half a loaf - that is, the return, for now, of two of the four islands and unspecified future commitments. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who resigned last week as secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, did go to Moscow to explore the Soviet intent. But the process of selling an agreement of any sort to the Japanese public, which has been conditioned to settle for nothing less than resumed sovereignty of all the islands, has not even begun. Indeed, there is even apparent a new steel in Japan's external policies, at least where money is concerned. Over the past week, Japan has said, first, that its aid contributions will take into consideration the amount the recipient country spends on defence (a wholly laudable statement); second, it has taken exception to debt forgiveness for Egypt and Poland, apparently because it does not necessarily share the political judgment behind these US-led proposals. This sounds like the Ministry of Finance asserting itself domestically, as it liked to during the whole debate over Japan's contributions to the Gulf effort. Neither pronouncement is necessarily the last policy word, since both involve conflict with the US. But if both are taken even at a discount from face value, the Soviet Union cannot expect to be receiving any Japanese blank cheques. Still, the US could serve as broker to a Soviet-Japanese settlement. Wolf Mendl points out that since the origins of the territorial dispute lie in Soviet-American relations during and after the last war the US may have 'a moral responsibility to work for a resolution', which is a fair point. But any mediation would have to be 'indirect'. If it is taking place at all, it certainly is not a visible part of President Bush's 'New World Order'. With the benefit of hindsight, there probably was an open window of opportunity for a territorial settlement about two years ago. Then Mr Gorbachev might have been able to deliver domestically, Japan might have been pushed to turn him down, and the US might not have objected. And the Soviet Union would have been enriched by more than the Indians got from the Dutch, though looking at the state of Manhattan today they were probably wise to sell. *Normalising Soviet-Japanese Relations; RIIA Special Paper. **The International Relations of Japan; edited by Kathleen Newland; Macmillan</p>

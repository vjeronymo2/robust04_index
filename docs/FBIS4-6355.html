			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet during its meeting yesterday approved a  draft protocol on the Malaysia-Thailand joint authority which  was earlier worked out by Thai and Malaysian governments. The  protocol is designed to solve the problems concerning petroleum  concessions in the joint development area lying on both  countries' territorial claims in the South China Sea. The  delegations of both countries late last month held talks on the  avoidance of double taxation in Kuala Lumpur. They agreed that  technical fees and petroleum income tax collected by both  countries be reduced by half. The protocol will be part of the  agreement on the avoidance of double taxation between Thailand  and Malaysia. The two countries to equally share bebenfit  reaped from the joint development area. They are expected to  sign an agreement to start their petroleum exploration in the  area this week when Prime Minister Chuan Liphai visits Malaysia.</p>

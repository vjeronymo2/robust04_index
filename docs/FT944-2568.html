			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Golf club drives at greater accuracy An oversized, remodelled golf club could be the answer for golf enthusiasts who yearn for greater accuracy and distance. Spalding, a US equipment manufacturer, has designed a driver in which 20 per cent of the weight of the head has been redistributed to its perimeter and sole. The head's higher moment of inertia and lower centre of gravity gives the ball less spin, allowing it to go further. The weight shift also makes the driver more stable, helping the golfer attain greater accuracy. The Top-Flite Magna Heat Driver, which is designed for mid-to-high handicap golfers, will go on sale at the beginning of next year at around Pounds 99.

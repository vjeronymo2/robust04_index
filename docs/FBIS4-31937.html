			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Temporary Nuclear Burial Site at </F> Paks"]    [Text] An agreement has been reached between the Paks  Nuclear Power Station Rt. and the Paks local government on the  site for temporary storage of burnt-out heating elements. On 15  June, a news conference was held at Paks Town Hall on the  results of the public opinion poll preceding the decision and  the conditions of the agreement.    As we have already reported, the construction of a storage  place was made necessary by the fact that Russia accepted the  heating elements in the past and is now showing reluctance to  accepting further deliveries of radiating waste.    Mayor Imre Bor said that the local government wanted to  represent the population's interests all along; this is the  reason they carried out a public opinion poll before making the  final decision. This demonstrated that, with adequate  guarantees, 56 percent of the town's population accept the  construction of the storage place; only 39 percent oppose it.  This removed the last obstacle to reaching an agreement between  the power station and the local government.    In addition to the guarantees, the agreement also provides  130 million forints to the local government which can, among  other things, be used for individual electric power allowances,  based on need. The storage facility will be built in the  vicinity of the power station.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (7): Face-lift is overdue - Sally Bowen examines the infrastructure After years of neglect, the vital 500km road link between the rich agricultural flatlands of Santa Cruz and Cochabamba in the central cordillera is being repaired. Along the highway, caterpillar trucks and bulldozers - many belonging to Brazilian road-builders Andrade Gutierrez and Odebrecht under Bolivian government contracts - are shovelling, levelling and asphalting. Flood-damaged bridges are being re-fashioned; new ones built. The country's road system is getting a face-lift, and not before time. Historically, according to Mr Lucio Paz, transport minister, Bolivia's road and rail system has been the prime obstacle to national economic development. Only 4 per cent of the country's 43,000km of roads is asphalted; more than three-quarters are virtually unusable for six rainy months each year. Now that Bolivia's development plans hinge on becoming a strategic hub for the South American continent, transport is a high priority. The ministry's ambitious brief is to build 2,700km of roads within the next five years - at an estimated cost of Dollars 1.9bn - as well as improving and asphalting many of the existing land connections. 'Our road communications are a hundred years behind our telecommunications,' says Mr Paz. 'Unless we can make a dramatic leap forward, investors simply won't come to Bolivia.' Road improvements could cut high Bolivian transport costs by as much as 50 per cent, he says. Underlining this message is the rapidly improving condition of the road between Chile's port of Arica (presently the principal route for Bolivia's imports and exports) and La Paz. By late next year, travelling time will have shrunk from as much as six days in bad weather conditions to six hours. With the decline in relative importance of minerals transportation, and the boom in soya and other agricultural exports, roads rather than railways have become the focus of attention for Bolivia's planners. Officials hope to leave the new investor-operator of soon-to-be capitalised state railways company Enfe to resolve the problems of upgrading, boosting standards and investing in the vital 'missing link' between Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. But road-building is costly. One Bolivian kilometre can cost Dollars 300,000 on the flat eastern plains and Dollars 1m or more on a mountainous stretch. The government has some Dollars 280m in its present annual budget for roads, 'but we need to find new sources of financing construction,' says Mr Paz. One plan is to hive off as concessions certain potentially profitable sections to private companies which would build, collect tolls and maintain highways. Bolivia's rugged terrain means that efficient air links are essential. Many of the 37 airports are rudimentary: only 10 have tarmac and just two (La Paz and Santa Cruz) are classified as international. By the end of 1996, the government plans to have 17 more provincial landing strips surfaced and their infrastructure improved. The government of Japan, meanwhile, is donating Dollars 30m to re-equip the capital's El Alto airport, extend the runways, upgrade lighting and improve communications and traffic control systems. Japan has also helped out with road-building equipment and seven bridges to link primarily Japanese agricultural colonies in Santa Cruz department to main highways. 'We're knocking on everyone's door for financing,' says Mr Paz. He has Dollars 12m in the bag from the Inter-American Development Bank to upgrade the road link from La Paz to the Peruvian frontier at Desaguadero, thus opening up access to the as-yet undeveloped free port facilities and coastal strip granted by Peru to Bolivia in Ilo. In the other direction, an international tender will soon be sought for upgrading the 640km dirt road eastwards from Santa Cruz to San Matias on the Brazilian border. This will open the way for thousands of tonnes of soya beans from the Mato Grosso in south-west Brazil to cross the continent through Bolivia for eventual shipment to Asia through Peruvian or Chilean Pacific seaports. Also arousing the enthusiasm of top-level politicians and planners is the so-called 'hidrovia', a 2,700km Paraguay-Parana waterway system which provides a link between landlocked Bolivia's Puerto Suarez, a river port on the frontier with Brazil, and the River Plate estuary. Initial investment - in dredging the shallow upper reaches and providing proper signalling so that barges may also move cargo by night  - is estimated at about Dollars 11m. These improvements, say analysts, will cut transport time in half and slash the high costs (between Dollars 15 and Dollars 18 a tonne) between Bolivia and Buenos Aires. Financing has already been offered by the IADB and the UN Development Programme. A totally new port is also planned at Puerto Busch, on the Paraguay river and some 140km south of existing Puerto Suarez. The state will build the road, say government officials, and leave private enterprise to develop port facilities. The European Union, and in particular the Belgian government, has offered assistance.</p>

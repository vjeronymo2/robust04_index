			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: El Oro Mining down to Pounds 0.75m El Oro Mining and Exploration, an investment and dealing company, announced a fall in pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 751,000 for the half year to June 30. Earnings per share declined to 11.73p (17.67p) and there is no dividend (24p). El Oro has a 48.26 per cent interest in the Exploration Company, which in turn has 34.45 per cent of El Oro. The Exploration Company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 827,000 for the six months to end-June, compared with a restated Pounds 1.41m. Earnings were 4.89p (8.24p) per share. No dividend is declared (12p). Mr Michael Woodbine Parish, chairman of both companies, said the results had been affected by the decision to switch from short-term deposits into growth investments. That had resulted in a reduction in interest receivable and an increase in the market value of group assets.</p>

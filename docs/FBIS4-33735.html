			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran Foreign  Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today declared that the American  nations must work within the framework of the OAS and remain  "flexible" in dealing with the situations in Cuba and Haiti.    Upon his return to Honduras, Paz also said the 110 members  of  the Nonaligned Movement support Honduras' candidacy for the UN  Security Council seat, which is up for election in October.    During the recent nonaligned meeting in Egypt, Paz was  invited to visit Cuba by his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina.  The Honduran minister would not say whether he had accepted the  invitation.    The foreign minister said: Cuba must show signs of  democratization in order to return to the OAS, and the rest of  the inter-American community must be "flexible" in efforts to  normalize the Cuban and Haitian situations.    He noted: "We support the democratization process in Cuba  and  the restoration of democracy in Haiti." The foreign minister  indicated that both cases must be resolved peacefully within the  framework of the OAS.    In the case of Haiti, the United States has proposed that  Central America become a sanctuary for those fleeing from Haiti,  but at the last meeting of the region's presidents, Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina said the United States "called on  the wrong place."    In Honduras' Caribbean region, there are more than 50  Haitians who do not want to stay in the country and have asked  the government for visas to travel to either the United States  or Canada.    Honduras broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in the 1960's.</p>

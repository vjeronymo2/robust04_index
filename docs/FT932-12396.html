			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iran to buy palm oil IRAN IS to buy 100,000 tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia, according to Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister for primary industries. The order, worth MDollars 130m (USDollars 50m), will be undertaken under Malaysia's palm oil export credit scheme. Under the export credit scheme, which has been in force for the past two years, countries who buy at least 200,000 tonnes of Malaysia's palm oil in one year are given up to two years to repay. China, India, Pakistan, Russia, Algeria and Egypt have all been offered the facility but to date only Pakistan and Algeria have taken it up. Iran was offered the facility following a recent visit there by Dr Mahathir Mohmad, Malaysia's prime minister. It is not clear whether Iran has agreed to buy a further 100,000 tonnes of palm oil this year in order to conform to the terms of the credit arrangements or whether Malaysia has relaxed its rules on the scheme in an effort to encourage more exports.</p>

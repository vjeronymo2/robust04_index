			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Camas 44% ahead to Pounds 4.9m - Upturn in UK building materials market fuels the advance Increases in sales and prices in UK building materials lifted pre-tax profits of Camas, Britain's fifth largest aggregates group, by 44 per cent from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m in the first six months of 1994. Turnover grew from Pounds 174m to Pounds 210m. The company yesterday announced its first half year figures since it demerged from English China Clays at the beginning of June. Mr Alan Shearer, chief executive, said the first-half profits had gained from an initial contribution from the Kost building materials businesses, acquired in the US for Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21.5m) earlier this year. Camas, which is paying an interim dividend of 1.25p, expects to pay a total of at least 3.75p this year. Earnings per share rose from 0.98p to 1.6p after adding back Pounds 1.5m exceptional costs of the demerger. Profits from the European division, of which the UK accounts for about 90 per cent, rose by more than a third to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 6.5m). Sales volumes of crushed rock, sand and gravel rose by about 13 per cent. Prices had increased by an average 10 per cent since the beginning of the year. The sales increase was mainly the result of a sharp rise in private sector housebuilding and increased private industrial construction. Coated stone sales had risen by 5.6 per cent, reflecting a higher level of road construction and maintenance, said Mr Shearer. The group's operations in the Channel Islands also increased profits, helped by two land reclamation contracts in Jersey. US profits increased from Pounds 804,000 to Pounds 1.4m, including a first time contribution of Pounds 747,000 from the former Kost businesses in North Dakota. Without this contribution, US profits would have fallen from Pounds 804,000 to Pounds 656,000. The decline was because of the completion of construction and a subsequent delay in opening Denver's new airport. This had led to the postponement of private infrastructure projects, such as hotels, which were expected to go ahead when the airport opened, said Mr Shearer. Profits from Minneapolis and St Paul's, the group's other regional US business, were slightly higher than at the same stage last year. Net debt at the end of June was Pounds 75.2m, representing 34 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 223.1m. The company said that this was likely to reduce to about Pounds 65m, with 30 per cent gearing, by the year end. COMMENT The UK has performed better than expected and the US worse because of the delayed opening of the Denver airport, which is likely to continue to affect the group into the first half of next year. A few eyebrows also might be raised at the company's report of increased costs in its non-aggregate UK building materials business. Elsewhere there were few surprises. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m this year and Pounds 25m next would put the shares on prospective multiples of more than 18 and 14, which is fair value but already in the price - which should be expected for a company which published its demerger prospectus only four months ago.</p>

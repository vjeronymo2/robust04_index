			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Peek falls 7% but sees improvement IN THE FIRST half of 1992 Peek, the traffic and field data systems company, reported pre-tax profits down 7 per cent. This, however, was considered a creditable performance and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.05p. Mr Ken Maud, chairman, said that in the second half the current order book and the successful conclusion of anticipated new orders would result in an improved result. On turnover of Pounds 39.1m (Pounds 38.1m) first half profits were Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 3.02m). Earnings per share came out at 1.74p (2.01p). During the period road traffic activities were acquired in Scandinavia and the sale of Greenpar Connectors and Dubilier ended its connectors interests. As a result future trading will be weighted towards the second half. At the end of the period net cash stood at Pounds 6m.</p>

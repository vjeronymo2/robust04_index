The meeting will open at  15:00 on Thursday [24 February], ITAR-TASS learnt at the public  information centre of the headquarters on coordination of  military cooperation between the CIS member states.    The meeting agenda consists of five items, including the  approval of regulations on the Council of Defence Ministers of  CIS member states. The decision on setting up the Council was  adopted at the Commonwealth summit in Minsk in February 1992.    Today's meeting will sum up the results of drafting the main  issues for coordinating military construction in the CIS.    The meeting will also decide on the staff establishment of  the headquarters on coordination of military cooperation. It is  supposed that the headquarters' divisions will be staffed on a  coordination basis.    Its staff will consist of 250 people, including 120 from  Russia. The headquarters is charged with collecting, summerising  and analysing open information on the military and political  situation in the world and regions of interest to the CIS  countries.    The headquarters will also concert efforts to give mutual  aid  in creating and developing national armed forces.    The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has become a  traditional item at defence ministers' meetings over the recent  past. The present meeting will decide on additional measures to  stabilise the situation there.    The ministers will also discuss the celebration of the 50th  anniversary since the end of the second world war. Meeting  participants are supposed to take two decisions: measures to  prepare for the celebration of the victory anniversary and to  hold a spartakiad of CIS Armed Forces.</p>

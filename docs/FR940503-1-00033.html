			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress specifically limited field citations to minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations, as defined by the Agency. While EPA's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of minor violation does not specify each and every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation that might be considered minor, it does set clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits on the kinds of violations that will be considered minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations. The many different kinds of violations that may meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of minor violation will exhibit common features.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the typical minor violation will involve a clear and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straightforward violation, both factually and legally, of limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency or duration and limited environmental impact. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factual and legal issues that EPA expects to arise in field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation assessments are, overall, expected to be simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncomplicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basic private interest at stake is the assessment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil penalties of up to a maximum of $5,000 per day for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation, as well as the resources needed to contest such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments where considered appropriate. The maximum penalty is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly lower than the maximum administrative or judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil penalties authorized under sections 113, 205 and 211 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary governmental interest is implementation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program that fairly fills a gap in EPA's enforcement programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without undue drain on EPA's limited enforcement resources. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes this interest is best served by addressing minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations in a straightforward and direct manner, somewhat akin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a traffic enforcement program. The deterrence effect from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this program will come in large part from the issuance of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation immediately upon or shortly after detection of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation, with final assessment of the penalty occurring shortly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after issuance of the citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has considered these and other factors in evaluating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three options proposed today for hearing procedures, and believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all three fully implement Congressional intent and satisfy due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process requirements. The three options draw different balances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between complexity and simplicity, formality and informality, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are all designed to implement a program aimed at simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncomplicated violations, involving penalties significantly lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than others authorized in the Act, and requiring straightforward,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quick and fair adjudication to obtain the desired deterrent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect without undue drain on limited Agency resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Modified 40 CFR Part 22_Consolidated Rules of Practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Revocation or Suspension of Permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the first Agency proposal, administrative hearings on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citations would be conducted pursuant to the procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by EPA <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s consolidated APA rules of practice for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative assessment of civil penalties, 40 CFR part 22. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate rulemaking, the Agency would propose to amend part 22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where appropriate, to make that regulation applicable to field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU (RB) report: "Greenland Surplus"] </F>   [Text] In spite of the fishing crisis and a generally low  level of economic activity in Greenland, the Greenland Bank had  a surplus of 42.1 million kroner in 1993 compared with a deficit  of 6.9 million the year before. This is due primarily to falling  interest rates that led to an exchange rate profit on bonds. The  exchange rate loss of 22.2 million kroner in 1992 changed to a  surplus of 32.6 million kroner in 1992. Greenland Bank's general  banking operations were almost unchanged in relation to 1992.  However, net interest and fee income rose from 74.5 million to  83.8 million kroner. Losses and set-asides amounted to 8.2  million kroner in 1993 -- almost the same as in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY / DEFENDING THE COLORS;  </P> <P> BRITISH REGIMENTS BATTLE TO SURVIVE DEEP BUDGET CUTS  </P> <P> For centuries, the regiment has been the keystone of the British army.  Generations of soldiers have fought not just for queen (or king) and country  but for regimental honor as well.  </P> <P> Unlike the American army regiment, identified by a mundane number with random  assignment of personnel, the British army regiment has always had a descriptive  name, a selection process and its own identity, and most are steeped in  history.  </P> <P> But today, some regiments are threatened with extinction by the reduced British  defense budget, following the end of the Cold War.  </P> <P> With army personnel due to be whittled down by one-third, defense specialists  say it is more than likely that some regiments will have to be disbanded or  combined with others.  </P> <P> The stiff-upper-lip units will not go without a fight.  </P> <P> "The best regiments have very powerful lobbyists working for them in  Parliament, in Whitehall and in high business circles," observed one defense  specialist. "They will fight tooth and claw to keep their old regiments from  being disbanded."  </P> <P> Some of the more recently formed regiments are considered top-notch militarily  and probably won't be affected by budget cuts. These include the Parachute  Regiment, which won two Victoria Crosses in the Falklands War, and the  anti-terrorist, all-purpose Special Air Service Regiment (SAS).  </P> <P> Because regiments have anywhere from one to three battalions operational, one  way to retain many regimental structures would be to pare down extra  battalions.  </P> <P> The last major threat to the regiments, a military reorganization in the late  1960s, led to intense lobbying for individual units. The venerable Scottish  Argyll regiment, for example, managed to survive by combining with another  regiment as the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders.  </P> <P> The history of the regiments parallels much of the history of the nation. The  Life Guards date to 1659, when they were formed to support King Charles II. The  Blues, whose horses can be seen on guard at London's Whitehall, were organized  a year later and won their first battle honors at Tangier in 1662.  </P> <P> Several regiments, including the Foot Guards, fought at the Battle of Waterloo  and still toast the victory over gleaming regimental silver at formal mess  evenings. Royal Family members are honorary colonels-in-chief of select  regiments.  </P> <P> Each infantry and cavalry regiment has its own special uniform, with plumes or  braid or spurs -- and often with Saville Row tailoring. In civilian dress, the  regimental tie is a distinctive item of clothing.  </P> <P> There are 52 serving cavalry and infantry regiments plus four Gurkhas units.  But because of their traditions and attractions, some are considered more  fashionable -- the less grand meanly called "fish-and-chip" regiments.  </P> <P> Those standing highest in the social scale are generally considered to be the  Horse Guards, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals -- with their shining  helmets and breastplates -- and the Foot Guards, the Grenadiers, Coldstreams,  Scots, Irish and Welsh.  </P> <P> Guards alumni include such luminaries as former NATO Secretary General Lord  Carrington, ex-Deputy Prime Minister Lord Whitelaw and Archbishop of Canterbury  Robert A. K. Runcie.  </P> <P> Military experts maintain that the British army regiment is not simply a  fancy-dress organization but rather an efficient way of life for soldiers, who  are brought into it as recruits and often spend their entire careers there.  </P> <P> "The British regimental system encourages personal loyalty, dedication and  esprit de corps," said one military commentator here. "It would be a great pity  to see a fine regiment disbanded."  </P> <P> Or as British author Duff Hart-Davis put it: "I served in the Coldstream Guards  for less than two years, almost 35 years ago. But if ever I learn that the  regiment is to be disbanded or even to lose one of its two battalions, I shall  reckon it a personal as well as a national disaster."  </P></p>

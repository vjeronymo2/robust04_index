			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- An international  organization and organizations of different countries bitterly  denounced the Japanese authorities' suppression of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon).    The International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and  Human Rights in South Korea in a statement on June 2 said their  anti-Chongnyon campaign contradicts the universally accepted  provisions on human rights and it is a wanton violation of the  Vienna declaration Japan signed officially.    It called on all the democratic figures and human rights  organizations across the world to launch vigorous activities  urging the Japanese authorities to promptly stop the suppression  of Chongnyon.    The Malian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in a statement  June 1 said the suppression of Japan-resident Koreans by the  Japanese authorities is an undisguised act of disturbing peace  in the Northeast Asian region. It urged the Japanese prime  minister to exercise his influence to promptly stop all acts  which may cause distrust between the Japanese and Korean peoples.    The Nepali Intellectuals Forum sent a letter to the chairman  of the National Public Safety Commission of Japan on June 3.    Noting that the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese  police is obviously part of the hostile policy towards the DPRK,  it demanded that the Japanese authorities stop the gross abuses  of human rights at once and ensure human rights and safety of  the Koreans in Japan.</p>

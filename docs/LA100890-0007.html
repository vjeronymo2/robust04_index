Their weapons are disguised in bright alluring packages and they are sending  millions of these time bombs, known as cigarettes, over to the Soviet Union,  (Part A, Sept. 14).  </P> <P> The tobacco companies will make a lot of money from this gesture of greed. Is  this American capitalism at its best?  </P> <P> ROBERT CHERNO, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

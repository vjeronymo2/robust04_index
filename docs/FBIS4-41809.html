			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Volodymyr Skachko: </F> "O. Moroz Does Not Change His Views"]    [Text] At a news conference in Kiev, chairman of Ukraine's  Supreme Council O. Moroz stated that his trip to several oblasts  and to the Crimean Republic was a working one and that its aim  was "to get the peoples' approval or disapproval of the trends  in the work of the new parliament and government." In Moroz's  opinion, he received such an approval, because people were in  favor of "strengthening order and discipline in the state and  harmony in all spheres of life, irrespective of where a person  works." Consequently, according to the chairman, the parliament  and the government will continue their efforts to overcome the  crisis in a concerted and responsible manner, and it may take  between one and a half and two years ultimately to curb the  crisis phenomena, as the deputies agreed.    Commenting on the situation in the country regarding  presidential elections, Moroz stated that the talk on the  absence of a clear-cut idea of what kind of president we need to  elect is inappropriate, because there is a Constitution, which  reads that the president is the head of both the state and  executive power and, in order to change this norm, it is  necessary to change the Main Law. Regarding rumors on the  possibility of withdrawing from the presidential contest, Moroz  joked: "It is a "canard," and the people who launched it suffer  from "incontinence" of the "canard" ["utka" can mean both  "canard" and "bed-pan"]. He added that he would not cede his  votes to anyone, all the more so since, when he met with people,  he "felt their genial support."    Regarding the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Moroz was  quite  specific: The fleet cannot be divided, it must be used jointly,  under joint command, and with double responsibility for its fate  on the part of Ukraine and Russia. Moroz believes that, in  resolving problems of the Black Sea Fleet, one must proceed from  the fact that the Black Sea Fleet is a zone of specific  interests of our two countries and that a military entity cannot  be efficient if some officers in it are paid better than others.  Moroz also said that Ukraine must develop its own naval forces.  As for a possible creation of joint armed forces of the CIS,  the chairman of the parliament pointed out that he never voiced  such an idea, and since 1992, he has been advocating the concept  of creating collective security forces. "The broader the  international structures for security provision, the more  reliable the security will be," Moroz concluded. As for the  proposals by the speaker [Ivan Rybkin] of the Russian State Duma  on the creation of a confederation of Russia, Ukraine, and  Belarus, Moroz said: "Those who do not regret the  disintegration of the Union are heartless. Those who want to  restore the Union today are brainless." In the  Ukrainian-Russian relations, the chairman of Ukraine's Supreme  Council, according to him, is in favor of resolving, first of  all, economic problems and advocates Ukraine's coming out with  the initiative of signing a multilateral document on economic  cooperation, a document in which the main principle would be  stated -- on the inviolability of the borders of the participant  states.    Nor did Moroz change his attitude toward the problem of  nuclear disarmament, which, in his view, cannot be tackled  contrary to Ukraine's interests. Commenting on the accusations  against President Kravchuk voiced by the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists [KUN] to the effect that he had betrayed Ukraine by  transferring tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, Moroz said that  KUN is entitled to voicing its opinion in any form, but the  president's actions "by their content, conform to such  assessments." Moroz spoke in favor of Ukraine's pursuing such  active external policy as would not allow anybody to ignore the  interests of our state.    The chairman of the parliament also answered other questions  asked by journalists, and it became clear from his replies that,  as a leader, he does not change his views from day to day  depending upon the prevailing situation.</p>

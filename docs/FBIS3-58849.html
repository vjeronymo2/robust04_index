			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Barometer: SPD Leading in </F> Economic Competence"]    [Text] Mainz -- A total of 48 percent of Germans expect the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to win this autumn's  Bundestag elections, while only 17 percent think the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] will come out  on top. This is the result of an opinion poll conducted by a  Mannheim-based research group for the ZDF television network's  "Political Barometer."    If elections were held now, the CDU/CSU would gain 36  percent  of the votes --this is 1 percent less than last December. The  SPD still holds at 39 percent and the Free Democratic Party of  Germany at 6 percent, while the Greens/Alliance 90 are supported  by 10 percent, the Republikaner by 4 percent, and the Party of  Democratic Socialism by 3 percent of the voters. Scharping, the  SPD candidate for chancellor, has the approval of 52 percent of  the voters, while Chancellor Kohl's (CDU) rate of approval is at  34 percent.    The research group conducting the poll considers the main  reason for this trend to be a shift in competence regarding  economic issues. Thus, 39 percent of those polled are confident  that the SPD could solve the problems in eastern Germany -- this  is 7 percent more than six months ago, while only 24 percent  consider the government able to do so -- 4 percent down on last  July. Only 30 percent think the present government is able to  solve the economic problems in the west (minus 6 percent); 41  percent consider the SPD competent (plus 8 percent).</p>

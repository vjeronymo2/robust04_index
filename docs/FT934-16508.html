			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Management: Shorter low-fat lunches The days when staff ate spam and chips in the canteen and directors had rack of lamb in their own dining room are long gone. In the modern canteen, directors sit next to cleaners, and they eat a subsidised, healthy lunch washed down with soft drink in a smoke-free environment. And both regard this mid-day meal as being one of the most important perks of the job. This rosy view of lunching at work emerges from a survey* of British mangers which was carried out jointly by Director magazine and Compass Services, a catering company. The survey finds that nine out of 10 directors think that it is iniquitous for directors and staff to eat separately; in a similar number of companies, segregated dining has been scrapped completely. In only 8 per cent of British companies is it possible to have an alcoholic tipple over lunch, and in only 5 per cent is smoking unrestricted. Directors not only pay lip service to their classless canteen, they actually use it. Two-thirds of the directors eat in their canteens frequently, while 85 per cent believe that the long business lunch out at a restaurant is a thing of the past. However, the clean-living egalitarian lunch is better established in some areas than others. Blue-collar workers are still offered processed, fatty food, as fewer than half of their companies have any policy on making food in the canteen more healthy. By contrast, 80 per cent of employers in the service sectors have healthy eating programmes, encouraging employees to eat as many fresh vegetables as they care to. The vast majority of companies provide subsided or free meals, and despite the effects of recession, almost none plans to make staff pay more for their meals. In return, companies felt they were buying better staff morale, higher productivity and shorter lunch-breaks. * The Lunchtime Report 1993. Compass Services. Tel: 081 741 1541.</p>

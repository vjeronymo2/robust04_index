			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Wandsworth to get more than 8% of council tax relief funds THE Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth is to get Pounds 28m of the Pounds 340m national budget for transitional relief to ease the introduction of the council tax. Wandsworth, with 0.5 per cent of the population of England, is to receive more than 8 per cent of the money, it emerged yesterday. The borough, which announced its council tax levels for 1993-94, will qualify for more than Pounds 28m of the Pounds 340m budget provided for transitional relief by the Department of the Environment. Its residents will pay what is likely to be one of the lowest council tax rates in the country, at an average of Pounds 145 for a band D house - worth between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000. The average Band D council tax bill for England is likely to be around Pounds 550, according to a survey carried out by Public Finance and Accountancy magazine and Channel 4 News. The survey is based on tax figures adopted or recommended by 410 of the 419 local authorities in England. A further Pounds 9.5m of transitional relief will go to Westminster, another Conservative-controlled London borough, to hold the Band D tax down to Pounds 202. The boroughs - regarded as Tory flagship councils - will together account for more than 11 per cent of the transitional relief total. The Environment Department confirmed yesterday that Wandsworth would have swallowed a bigger share of transitional relief if the rules had not been hurriedly changed to stop the borough setting a budget to maximise the relief it received. The rules for transitional relief, announced last November by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, were meant to limit to Pounds 130 a year the maximum increase band D households will have to pay over their last poll tax bill. However, it became apparent that Wandsworth planned to increase its budget by much more than was necessary to maintain services at last year's levels, using transitional relief to hold down household bills. Since Wandsworth had levied a zero poll tax for the past two years, the maximum council tax payable in a Band D home would be Pounds 130 - with transitional relief paying any extra. The cost of the transitional relief for Wandsworth would have been Pounds 35m, pushing the total bill for the relief over its cash limit. To avoid this, the transitional relief paid to Wandsworth was capped by changes to the rules notified to local authority chief executives on Monday. Though the change will in theory apply to every council, officials do not expect more than one or two to be affected in practice. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, accused Wandsworth council of trying to use taxpayers' money to improve services to boost the Conservatives' chances of survival in the London borough elections next year.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK alone over EU fisheries The UK faces being outvoted by its European partners when EU fisheries ministers reconvene in Brussels tomorrow after two days of talks failed to agree terms on Spain's full integration into the Union's common fisheries policy. The UK held out yesterday against limited Spanish access to its western coastal waters. But Madrid has said it will block enlargement, to bring Austria, Sweden and Finland into the EU on January 1, unless it gets satisfaction. Senior German officials said they would put the dispute to a vote on Thursday rather than risk jeopardising EU expansion, leaving Britain facing isolation. The German presidency of the EU has proposed a compromise on the sensitive 'Irish Box' - the waters surrounding the island of Ireland - which would let 40 Spanish trawlers inside. This is roughly the same proportion of vessels in these waters as fleets from other member states send into the Irish Box, and therefore, in the EU majority view, treats Spain equally.</p>

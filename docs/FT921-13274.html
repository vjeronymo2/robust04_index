			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / British Coal streamlining to cost over 1,000 jobs at Yorkshire pits BRITISH COAL yesterday announced plans to cut 1,100 jobs at four collieries in the Yorkshire area. It said the cuts at four pits - Kellingley and Prince of Wales near Pontefract, Sharlston near Wakefield, and Whitemoor, part of the Selby complex - were intended to increase competitiveness by March next year when contracts with the power generators expire. It fears it may be priced out of the market without streamlining. The numbers, which were released at a regional meeting of British Coal, are not official but British Coal confirmed that they were indicative. It is understood that voluntary redundancies will be sought before March 28 this year when an enhanced payment agreement expires. Union officials fear the losses could total more than 1,300. Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of Yorkshire National Union of Mineworkers, said: 'I'm disgusted. This is not rationalising the industry, it's butchering.' He said he expected more cuts to be announced tomorrow at a meeting of the company's South Yorkshire group. Mr Alan Houghton, Selby group director, said: 'The contracts with the electricity generators expire in March next year and our policy is to make the Selby group of pits strong enough to claim a major share of the market.' Mr Houghton will meet NUM leaders at the four pits today to spell out how they will be affected. Mr Kevin Barron, shadow energy minister, is understood to have received a letter from the NUM totalling the job losses. He said: 'The Tories are determined to kill off everything that doesn't make them a fast buck - even at the expense of the long-term interests of the country.' During question time in the Commons yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, expressed regret at the job losses. Responding to Mr Barron, Mr Major said: 'I am sorry to hear of the job losses to which you refer, but the only secure future for the coal industry or indeed any other industry is to put itself in a position where it is producing, at a price people can afford, something that people want.' One Selby miner said: 'Miners feel betrayed. They were tempted into taking on larger mortgages and now they are being kicked in the teeth.'</p>

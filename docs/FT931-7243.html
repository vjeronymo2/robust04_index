			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rover still in loss as further jobs go ROVER, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, incurred an operating loss before interest of Pounds 49m last year, compared with a loss of Pounds 52m in 1991 and an operating profit of Pounds 65m in 1990. The company cut another 1,277 jobs from its UK workforce last month through an enhanced voluntary redundancy programme, Mr George Simpson, BAe deputy chief executive and chairman of Rover, said yesterday. Rover eliminated 1,800 jobs last year with a reduction in the workforce to 33,200 at the end of 1992 against 35,000 at December 1991 and 40,500 at the end of 1990. BAe said it expected Rover to move back into profit in 1993 after two years of losses, helped by: stronger new car demand, with UK new car sales forecast to rise from 1.59m to 1.65m in 1993, a further reduction in costs, following a 7.5 per cent improvement in productivity in 1992, the launch of the new Rover 600 large family car range in April, and improved competitiveness gained by last autumn's devaluation of the pound. Mr Simpson said break-even point had been reduced to a production of about 440,000 vehicles a year. The targeted break-even level remains 400,000 vehicles a year. Rover vehicle production declined from 419,881 to 404,971. Car output fell by 4.8 per cent to 347,639 (including 32,444 Honda Concertos for the Japanese car maker). Output in 1992 was supported by the success of the Land Rover four-wheel drive vehicle business, which raised production by 5 per cent to 57,332 against 54,594 in 1991. BAe has taken a charge of Pounds 36m for the write-off of its 10.9 per cent holding in Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, which collapsed into receivership three weeks ago. Mr Simpson said it had managed to sell the holding in recent days via the Amsterdam stock exchange for just over Pounds 1m or Fl 0.60 a share. Turnover declined marginally to Pounds 3.68bn (Pounds 3.74bn), in spite of a 10.4 per cent decline in wholesale vehicle sales to 421,000, (470,000). Retail vehicle sales to customers fell by 6.7 per cent to 445,000. Rover's retail vehicle sales in the UK declined by 7.4 per cent from 243,082 to 225,199, and its share of the UK new car market fell to only 13.5 per cent (14.4 per cent). The company is still dependent on the UK market for about 57 per cent of its vehicle sales. Sales in its three main continental European markets - France, Italy and Spain - fell marginally, but export performance improved in the second half and should be boosted this year by the devaluation of the pound. Capital expenditure is forecast to rise to Pounds 233m this year against Pounds 210m in 1992 and Pounds 250m in 1990, while spending on new product development is expected to continue at about Pounds 150m a year.</p>

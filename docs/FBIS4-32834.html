			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Honduras will  officially join the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) on 30 May, Foreign  Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar confirmed today. In remarks to  NOTIMEX, Paz explained that Honduras was not allowed into the  NAM during the past decade, when the country served as a base of  operations for the Nicaraguan contras who were fighting the  Sandinist regime. The official indicated that the nonaligned  countries agreed to let Honduras join its ranks in the wake of  the inauguration of President Carlos Roberto Reina, who is  regarded as a leader of social democratic ideas and defender of  human rights.    Paz, who will be the first Honduran foreign minister to  participate in a meeting of that organization, said that he will  attend the NAM conference with an "optimistic" attitude and that  the conference will be held from 30 May to 6 June in Cairo,  Egypt.    He added that he will attend the meeting with confidence  that  the new realities ruling the world will provide just and  equitable participation to the Third World countries in that  international movement.</p>

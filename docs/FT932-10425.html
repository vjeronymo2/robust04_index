			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Investing for income: consider the risks - Serious Money THE FINANCIAL services industry is becoming ever more ingenious at offering investors what they most seem to want - income. Many investors have become used, in the high interest era of the early 1990s, income in to double digit percentages . This represents both a problem and an opportunity for the industry. The problem is that, with base rates at 6 per cent and equities yielding 4 per cent, achieving a 10 per cent income is tough. But the opportunity is that, if a company can devise a way of paying 10 per cent, the world might beat a path to its door. Common sense tells us that, by aiming for a higher income, you accept a higher risk. Normally, income comes at the expense of capital and indeed in some products, capital loss is automatically built into the structure. It is possible, occasionally, to get round this difficulty by exploiting an anomaly in the market. The forthcoming investment trust from Ivory &amp; Sime does so by making use of the Pounds 5,800 annual capital gains allowance to give investors tax-free income. (The trust does have its risks, however, of which more when it is launched.) Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial has already achieved success in raising money with a unit trust that uses futures and options to achieve a 10 per cent return. It will be interesting to see whether this trust can achieve that level of income without losing capital. Save &amp; Prosper is the latest to test ingenuity on the market with a 'high income bond' which bears many similarities to a product launched by Acuma last month. The bond offers a choice of income levels - 8 per cent or 10 per cent, net of basic rate tax. These income levels are guaranteed. However, the capital value of the bond is dependent on the UK stock market. At worst, if the stock market falls, or fails to rise, over the next five years, the investor will receive 60 per cent of capital back (at the 8 per cent income level) or 50 per cent (at the 10 per cent level). In effect, this will mean that the investor will have received income and capital payments equal to his or her original investment. This is the same 'money back' offer which is made on most guaranteed equity bonds - just packaged in a different way. Of course, if all you did receive was your money back you would have lost out - both from the effects of inflation and from having missed the opportunity to invest elsewhere. What investors really want, of course, is to get back all their original capital on top of the income. To achieve this, the stock market, in the form of the FT-SE 100 index, would have to grow by 25 per cent over five years (on the 8 per cent option) or 60 per cent (on the 10 per cent option). How likely is this? Save &amp; Prosper analysed all the five-year periods from the start of January 1984 to April 1993 period (ie Jan 1 1984 to Jan 1 1989, Feb 1 1984 to Feb 1 1989 and so on). It found the 25 per cent growth was achieved on 88 per cent of occasions. The higher growth rate of 60 per cent - needed to repay the capital of those who opt for the 10 per cent income level - was achieved on only 54 per cent of occasions. However, S &amp; P offers a 'lock-in' facility if the 60 per cent growth rate is achieved at any time over the five years. Over the 1984-1993 period, this increased the chance of reaching the hurdle rate to 67 per cent. What happens if the stock market grows by more than zero, but less than the hurdle rate of 25, or 60, per cent? The investor would receive less than the original capital back, depending on the amount of growth. At the 8 per cent income level, if the FT-SE 100 index rose 12.5 per cent, the investor would get 80 per cent of the original capital repaid. If the market grows by more than the hurdle rates over the five years, investors are not entitled to any of the excess. Nor do they benefit from FT-SE 100 Index yield; like most other guaranteed products, they return the capital growth of the index only. An example may help. If you invest Pounds 10,000 and take the 10 per cent option, you will get Pounds 1,000 a year for five years. If the market falls over the period, you will be repaid Pounds 5,000. If it rises by 30 per cent, you will be repaid Pounds 7,500. If it rises by 60 per cent at any time, you will get Pounds 10,000. Income can be paid quarterly or annually. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,500 (Pounds 5,000 for those who want quarterly income) and there are no additional fees. Higher rate taxpayers may face an additional tax charge, reducing the returns to 6.9 per cent or 8.62 per cent respectively. The offer runs from May 17 to June 25. Is it a good deal? Only if the stock market does rise enough to pay back your original investment. Otherwise, you are merely turning your capital into income - and you can do that for yourself via the building society. The chances of getting your money back are rather better than they were for some of the other products of this type - the Scottish Widows annuity/Pep launched last year required a 13 per cent growth rate per annum to repay capital. On S &amp; P's 8 per cent income option, the FT-SE 100 has to rise at a more modest 4.56 per cent per year. Put another way, FT-SE would have to reach 3500 by 1998, a not unreasonable target. So retired basic rate taxpayers who want income might consider the product. But as with all the other attempts to market high income products, investors should buy only if they understand the risks.</p>

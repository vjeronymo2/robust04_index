			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Eagle Star man joins Bermuda reinsurer MR MICHAEL BUTT, former chief executive of Eagle Star, the UK insurer, is to become vice-chairman of Mid-Ocean, the recently formed Bermuda-based catastrophe reinsurer. His appointment marks a strengthening of management resources at Mid-Ocean, which has grown rapidly since its formation late last year and comes amid signs of increasing investor interest in the high-risk catastrophe reinsurance market. Shrinkage of capacity and rapidly increasing rates have increased prospects for profitability in a market which has recently suffered heavy losses. Earlier this week it emerged that Mr John Head, the Manhattan-based financier, was aiming to raise Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) to form a London reinsurance company. The brighter outlook for the reinsurance market will be an important selling point for Lloyd's of London, which will announce today how it intends to attract corporate investors to the market. Mr Butt is the only insurance executive to have lost his job as a result of the industry's exposure to mortgage indemnity insurances. He spent just over a year with Phoenix Securities, the corporate finance boutique, advising on mergers and acquisitions in the insurance industry. At Mid-Ocean he will play a prominent executive role, alongside Mr Ian Heap, the group's president. Based in Bermuda, he will have responsibility for administration and worldwide marketing. Launched with capital of Dollars 400m last October by Marsh McLennan, the New York-based insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the merchant bank, Mid-Ocean has already earned more than Dollars 50m in premium income and could exceed the Dollars 200m target set for its first year. Mr Butt says he believes the growth of the Bermudan market will help rather than hinder recovery in the London market. 'The window of opportunity for Mid-Ocean was widening as a result of continued withdrawals from the market in recent months,' he said. The company is one of a number of new insurance ventures formed in Bermuda in the past few months. Earlier this year, Marsh and Morgan were also involved in the launch of a Dollars 70m Bermuda-based venture, Underwriting Capital (Merrett).</p>

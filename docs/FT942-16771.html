			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: A Beauty to remember - Ballet To stage Sleeping Beauty, or not to stage it? Directors of ballet companies embarking upon this sublimest, supremest challenge should be on their knees with the words 'Lord, we are not worthy' ever on their lips. But hubris and chutzpah being what they are - and endemic in the dance world - companies go ahead. They trim, alter and, damn them, re-interpret, and Beauty suffers. So, by a nice twist of fate, do their dancers, who founder in the choreography - Petipa is not to be mocked. So, alas, do audiences, who are given dross instead of gold. Now Scottish Ballet enters the lists with a new Beauty. Stacked against the company are the facts that it does not have enough dancers to produce the work as it should be seen, and, frankly, it does not possess enough dancers with the schooling, the stylistic grace, to cope with Petipa. (I must observe that such demands are ill-met by any troupe in this country.) On the positive side, in this battle for classic order and dignity, is the fact that Galina Samsova - whom we have much admired in Beauty - directs Scottish Ballet, and is plainly not prepared to sacrifice the piece on the altar of gimcrack production and artistic expediency. There results a staging far better than we might dare hope. The text is decent, given the concessions made to reduced numbers. Petipa's architecture, his finest choreographic ideas, are honoured. The dancers are learning from the demands made upon them, and Samsova has invited guest artists to bolster her ranks. The standards of the company's orchestra (53 musicians) and conductor, Alan Barker, are notably good: Tchaikovsky is safe. For her medium-size touring version, Samsova could not aspire to the decorative splendours properly needed so, in an intriguing compromise, she has commissioned sets from Patrick Kinmonth and costumes from Jasper Conran. It is here that my worries are strongest. Kinmonth's permanent set is of grey walls that can move to become various locales, with a vivid red bed as a glaring accessory, and a series of receding portcullises as the magical forest. Clever, elegant, this scheme becomes claustrophobic, and the viewer's imagination is trapped. The idea is effective, but is, I suspect, for another, less airy ballet. Conran's costumes are subtle - colours unexpected, with fairies in sorbet-shades, courtiers in black and white, busily patterned - skilfully cut and often dazzlingly conceived. Period is well suggested, but these clothes do not always register strongly. The final effect, though, is stylish: neither design nor ballet has been compromised. Faced with the perils of Petipa's dances, the Scottish artists do of their best: the troupe looks far more secure as an ensemble than when I reported last year on their Anna Karenina. There are optimistic moments, and variations when the school report reads 'Must do better', but if Beauty is seen as a way of aspiring to classic decorum, then Scottish Ballet is on the right path, and this justifies the staging. What totally justified Wednesday evening's performance (which I saw in Oxford's hideously uncomfortable Apollo Theatre) was the presence of Ludmila Semenyaka as a guest Aurora. Semenyaka has been one of the glories of Bolshoi Ballet seasons throughout the world. In her performance as Aurora we see everything that the role demands: noblest Petersburg schooling; an ideal physique, and a style light, clear, harmonious; a grandeur that comes from the traditions of her education as a pupil of Petersburg's greatest ballerine - Semyonova and Ulanova; and that sense of classic form that is the mark of the rarest performers in the academic style. Her Aurora is a portrait of youthful charm, drawn with a simplicity and a technical authority that only come when the role is fully understood. It is utterly engaging and, ultimately, utterly mysterious. We see how pure the dance is, with phrasing sprung from the score, with a dulcet mastery that makes triple pirouettes in the first act solo seem the most natural and happy expression of Aurora's delight. We sense, also, the long, long perspectives of Semenyaka's art, which go back by way of her teachers and coaches, and their teachers in turn, to Petipa's time, so that what she does is not only right but inevitable. It is extraordinary classical dancing, and extraordinarily beautiful. And it was, on this occasion, sensitively judged for the confines of the stage and the means of the staging itself. Semenyaka's partner was Marcello Angelini, clean in style, well-mannered and attentive. I must salute one other performance - that of Yurie Shinohara as Florine in the Bluebird duet. To what can often seem a test of archness as much of technical facility, Miss Shinohara brought wit, an enchanting freshness, and a sense of joy, that were irresistible. It was most memorable dancing. Scottish Ballet is at the Apollo Theatre Oxford until April 9; then plays 'Sleeping Beauty' in Newcastle (April 12-16), Hull (April 19-23), Edinburgh (April 26-30), Inverness (May 4-7).</p>

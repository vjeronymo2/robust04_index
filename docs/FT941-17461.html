			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: De Crespigny hits a rough patch  -A rare Australian corporate 'tall poppy' Until last week, the corporate career of Mr Robert J. Champion de Crespigny almost seemed to be fashioned by the gods. The Australian mining executive, head of the flourishing Normandy Poseidon gold empire, rejoiced in the oft-bestowed title of the country's only surviving entrepreneur. The title has been well-earned. Since 1985, Mr de Crespigny has parlayed a ADollars 500,000 position in an obscure Australian resource company into a web of companies which are today capitalised at close to ADollars 5bn (USDollars 3.3bn) and control annual gold production of well over 1m oz. This heady growth record seemed set for another spurt in mid-December when a Normandy offshoot launched a ADollars 260m takeover bid for Aztec Mining, the Australian affiliate of Alumax, the US metals group. But just days later, all was thrown into doubt with notification that Mr de Crespigny and one of his former executives were to be charged by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Consistent with the aggressive style that has become his trademark, Mr de Crespigny took the unusual step of foreshadowing the charges himself through a note to the Australian Stock Exchange. The note said the charges would allege that Mr de Crespigny and then fellow executive Mr Thomas Meiklejohn failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that takeover documents delivered in 1989 did not contain misleading information. Mr de Crespigny maintains that he is innocent of the charges and will defend them vigorously, but he admits they are bound to cause him 'enormous personal damage'. So far, no charges have been formally laid, but commercial judgment was swift, with initial falls in the share prices of most listed entities in the Normandy Poseidon group. Pronounced 'de krepney' and dubbed not so affectionately 'discrepancy' by some of his gold industry rivals, Mr de Crespigny is one of the few surviving corporate tall poppies in a land renowned for lopping them off. No-one builds an empire like Normandy Poseidon without making some enemies. Those on the receiving end of his many takeover forays have often accused Mr de Crespigny of being a front for Anglo American, the South African mining group. The Anglo group is Normandy Poseidon's biggest shareholder, with just under 20 per cent of the capital. But few realistically dispute that de Crespigny, with the title of executive chairman, effectively controls the group with a personal interest of just 11 per cent. Other large shareholders include the AMP Society and the National Mutual group, Australia's two largest investment institutions. This structure forms the basis of another snipe from de Crespigny's rivals - that he sits atop a convoluted corporate web much in the style of Mr John Spalvins' failed Adsteam group, with control often based on interests of less than 50 per cent. Mr de Crespigny's aristocratic name is itself sufficient to make him an oddity in the rough and tumble Australian mining industry. But his aristocratic connections are distant. Mr de Crespigny's forbears lived in Normandy, hence the name of his flagship company. His family migrated to Australia via England in the 1850s, making Mr de Crespigny a fifth-generation Australian and the first to move from the family base in conservative Victoria to the racier atmosphere of Western Australia. His group's current bid for Aztec has its ironies because Mr de Crespigny got his start in the mining industry as that company's finance director before going solo with a company called Amad. Mr de Crespigny has always seen himself as a financial manager rather than a miner or explorer. His companies have grown through takeover rather than minerals discovery. He is seen as one of the most frugal managers in the business, shrewd in hiring top resource specialists. Among a string of corporate deals since 1985, two stand out as shaping today's Normandy Poseidon. One was the successful raising of ADollars 114m through equity issues just before the 1987 share crash. This financed the purchase of Poseidon, the most enduring remnant of Australia's infamous 1969-70 nickel boom. Poseidon now controls some of the country's lowest cost gold mines. The other deal involved Mr de Crespigny in the ADollars 350m sale of some key gold interests in 1987 to Mr Alan Bond, now a bankrupt. Mr de Crespigny was able to repossess the assets because an ailing Bond group could not meet the terms of the arrangement. This allowed Mr de Crespigny to emerge as a pivotal stake holder in Kalgoorlie's Golden Mile, at the centre of Australia's gold mining industry. Mr de Crespigny has made a specialty of taking on some of the world's leading mining houses in corporate battles. Apart from the current joust with an Alumax associate, Mr de Crespigny has also locked horns with Freeport McMoRan and Newmont of the US and Germany's Metallgesellschaft. As if to show he is an all-rounder, Mr de Crespigny has also performed on the defensive side, having fought off the unwanted attentions of TNT, the Australian transport group.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROJECT RESCUE;  </P> <P> PROTESTERS WANT POLICE TO STOP USING NUNCHAKUS  </P> <P> Complaining of broken bones, dislocated shoulders, torn tendons and nerve  damage to their wrists, more than a dozen anti-abortion protesters Wednesday  called on a police advisory board to recommend that San Diego officers no  longer use nunchakus and other pain compliance techniques on peaceful  demonstrators.  </P> <P> The protesters, who have been arrested at recent weekend rallies, also  criticized many police officers for seeming to enjoy hurting the members of  Project Rescue who refused to obey a court order and stop blocking the front of  abortion clinics.  </P> <P> Robert Rousen said many of the officers were "sneering, mocking and full of  laughter" as they injured the protesters to force them to abandon their  demonstrations.  </P> <P> Dawn Bell of Escondido added: "I feel like a lot of the police officers had a  personal vendetta. I saw one man thrown into a police car, and I saw one  officer smile and say, 'Go ahead and hurt him. He just loves it.' "  </P> <P> The Citizens' Advisory Board on Police/Community Relations took no immediate  action on the recommendations from the group. Andrea Skorepa, acting chairwoman  of the panel, said it was the largest public gathering to address the board in  its four-year history.  </P> <P> The board has only advisory authority, but according to city officials more  than 90% of its recommendations have been adopted by police.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Committee to Study  </P> <P> But the panel did form an ad hoc committee to study the issue of pain  compliance by police officers, and the full board is expected to vote on the  matter when it meets again next month.  </P> <P> George Penn, an assistant to the city manager, read a letter from City Manager  John Lockwood in which he defended the use of pain compliance against civil  demonstrators who refuse to obey lawful orders.  </P> <P> "Pain compliance techniques are neither bizarre nor cruel and rarely result in  injury," the letter said. "The amount of pressure applied is directly  proportionate to the amount of resistance offered."  </P> <P> Deputy Chief Manuel C. Guaderrama, a member of the advisory board, also  defended the use of nunchakus, a relatively new police tool that is applied to  a person's wrist or arm and then twisted to inflict pain.  </P> <P> "We have a responsibility as a Police Department to make sure that laws are not  violated," he said. "And we are only going to use the amount of force we  believe is absolutely necessary."  </P> <P> Penn said several of the protesters have filed formal complaints alleging  excessive force with the department's Internal Affairs unit. He also said that  several protesters have filed monetary claims against the city.  </P> <P> But exactly how many protesters were injured, and how serious those injuries  actually were, remained unclear. None of the protesters speaking at the  Wednesday meeting were wearing arm bandages, casts or slings.  </P> <P> Glen Phelps, a spokesman for the group, said 30 to 40 people were severely  injured and required medical attention, including one Fallbrook doctor who  suffered a broken bone in his hand.  </P> <P> "He's been unable to practice surgery for three weeks or so," Phelps said.  </P> <P> Connie Youngkin, another Project Rescue activist, said she saw an officer twist  a woman's arm behind her back, causing a dislocated shoulder and severe damage  to the nerves and tendons on the woman's arm.  </P> <P> "Now she is permanently damaged," Youngkin said.  </P> <P> Richard Bell of Escondido said he witnessed another woman's arm being broken.  "She tried to walk, and they were dragging her," he said. "Another police  officer came up and said, 'Let up, you're going to break her arm.' But it was  too late. Her arm was already broken."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used When Necessary  </P> <P> Police said the officers have used the pain compliance method only after  protesters repeatedly refused to obey verbal orders to move away from clinic  doors and entryways.  </P> <P> Many of those speaking to the advisory panel suggested that police instead use  stretchers and wheelchairs to remove protesters. They also said officers should  pick up protesters or drag them away.  </P> <P> Police said such strenuous activity could cause injuries to the officers, such  as straining their backs. But the protesters discounted that argument.  </P> <P> "If they're hurting their backs, then they're not in shape to be police  officers," said Joanne Marsh of Santee.  </P> <P> "A stretcher saves the policeman's back," added Sylvia Sullivan of Lemon Grove.  "And his public image."  </P> <P> Although most of the speakers were critical of the officers, a few in the  audience stood to offer support for the Police Department's decision to use  pain compliance.  </P> <P> Betty Dempsey, an administrator of O &amp; B Medical Group Inc., said that,  although the protesters pretend to be nonviolent, they actually pose a serious  threat to medical patients who are trying to enter the clinics.  </P> <P> "What about the patients who want to get in the buildings for medical  purposes?" she said. "We are the victims, and police should use whatever is  tried and true to accomplish what they need to have to remove a crowd."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHAMINADE TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY BEATS MARSHALL'S SLOWDOWN, 62-52  </P> <P> Simi Valley High overcame Marshall's slowdown tactics and Hank Hou's game-high  31 points to post a 62-52 win Wednesday in pool play in the Chaminade  basketball tournament.  </P> <P> Marshall (7-5) used a deliberate offense that, at times, left one player at  midcourt holding the ball. The Barristers waited patiently for a  high-percentage shot, and the tactic worked for 3 1/2 quarters.  </P> <P> "Our kids got caught up in it, mentally, and they were frustrated," Simi Valley  Coach Dean Bradshaw said. "They wanted to play."  </P> <P> Simi Valley (6-4) began to do that midway through the fourth quarter when the  Pioneers used a 9-2 run to take a lead they never relinquished.  </P> <P> Tim Jaqua began the spurt with three free throws that gave Simi Valley a 46-45  lead with 3:44 left. After Hung Diep hit a jump shot to give Marshall a 47-46  lead with 3:04 left, Simi Valley answered with three consecutive baskets.  </P> <P> Kenny Hood, who finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds, hit a short jump shot  and Steve Carnes fed Mike Wawryk for two jump shots, giving Simi Valley a 52-47  lead with 1:52 left.  </P> <P> Marshall pulled to within 54-52 on Mark Umemoto's three-point shot with 48  seconds left, but Carnes, who had 19 points and seven assists, made a free  throw and added a three-point play with 22 seconds left that gave Simi Valley  its biggest lead of the game and allowed Bradshaw a sigh of relief.  </P> <P> Wawryk added 12 points for Simi Valley, which will play Chatsworth today at 3  p.m. in a game that will conclude pool play. The winner will advance to the  championship bracket of the 11-team tournament.  </P> <P> Granada Hills 77, Cathedral 46: Jermoine Brantley scored 12 of his game-high 20  points to lead a 28-10 third-quarter spurt that gave Granada Hills a 33-point  lead.  </P> <P> Osiris Nalls and Gene Barshtak scored 11 and 10 points for Granada Hills (6-5),  which will play Santa Monica tonight at 7:30 for a berth in the championship  bracket.  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sidney C Banks Integration of acquisitions and reduced interest rates helped Sidney C Banks, the grain and agricultural specialist, lift annual profits to Pounds 2.87m pre-tax, against Pounds 2.29m. Turnover in the 12 months to April 30 improved to Pounds 280.6m (Pounds 236.7m) reflecting the influence of sterling's withdrawal from the ERM on cereal prices; sales included a full contribution from Doltons and nine months from Rucker &amp; Slann. A proposed final dividend of 2p brings the total for the year to 9p (8.25p), covered 2.5 times by earnings of 22.5p (19.9p).</p>

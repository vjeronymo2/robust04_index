			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Inspiration should be gained from the future, not the past Sir, Why do we British, as a nation, have such an urge to indulge in nostalgia when we try to improve our future? Moves by political parties to create national networks of technology centres are welcome, but must we name them after Faraday or Newton? ('Parties agree on technology plans', February 20). Cannot inspiration be gained from the excitement and challenge of the future without looking to names from the past? We must look forward or our fortunes are doomed. Ronald Mellor, secretary, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 1 Birdcage Walk, London SW1H 9JJ</p>

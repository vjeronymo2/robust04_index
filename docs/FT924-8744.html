			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Khmer Rouge shatters Dollars 2bn UN peace plan: Brutal rebel group grows stronger in its north Cambodian fastness ONLY a few days ago it was still easy to find United Nations officials and western diplomats who believed that the left-wing Khmer Rouge guerrilla group would stop defying the UN and start co-operating with the Cambodian peace plan agreed in Paris in October last year. The Khmer Rouge, already notorious for causing the deaths of an estimated 1m Cambodians when it ruled the country between 1975 and 1978, has in the past seven months repeatedly flouted a nationwide ceasefire, fired on UN helicopters, and sabotaged bridges. It has also refused to allow UN forces access to the areas it controls and refuses to disarm its troops in accordance with the peace agreement. But the optimists persistently argue that the Khmer Rouge was merely playing for time and making last-minute 'tactical moves' to consolidate its recent territorial, political and economic gains before yielding to the UN and taking part in the elections scheduled for next May - elections which the Khmer Rouge was confidently expected to lose. Such hopes were dashed over the weekend by the failure of the international talks in Beijing aimed at bringing the Khmer Rouge to heel. Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, ignored the pleas of the various sponsors of the Paris peace accord, shrugged off a UN deadline of November 15 for Khmer Rouge compliance and said his organisation would not participate in the elections 'in the prevailing conditions'. The consequences of continued Khmer Rouge intransigence are likely to be severe, both for the credibility of the UN, which is committing more than 20,000 troops and civilians and Dollars 2bn to the largest peacekeeping operation in its history, and for the future of Cambodia as it struggles to emerge from two decades of war. 'I'm finding it harder to maintain my optimism,' a western diplomat who follows events in Cambodia said yesterday. 'The Khmer Rouge appears to have concluded that the whole election process will not be to its benefit.' One immediate worry for the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) is that the other three Cambodian factions will start to reverse the disarmament process, which they had begun without the Khmer Rouge. About 55,000 troops, most from the Vietnamese-installed administration of Mr Hun Sen, have reported to cantonment areas, out of about 450,000 soldiers and militiamen in the four factions. The UN is now casting around for ways to prevent the entire accord unravelling. The first step is likely to be a UN Security Council meeting this month to consider the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on the Khmer Rouge, which has been building up financial reserves by selling gems and timber from the territory it controls to Thai businessmen across the border. The new Thai civilian government has said it will try to implement whatever the UN decides, but doubts remain over whether a formal closure of the frontier would have much impact on the trade between the Khmer Rouge and Thailand. The rugged border makes control of smuggling hard at the best of times, and the Thai armed forces which supervise the area will be reluctant to forgo the 'protection money' they earn from Thai entrepreneurs who deal with the Khmer Rouge. Another course of action being considered by the sponsors of the Cambodia peace plan is a rewriting of the original accord in order to exclude the Khmer Rouge. This was previously regarded as out of the question because of the enormous efforts needed to negotiate the original plan. 'Now that we have been unable to reach agreement. . .some appropriate adjustments must be made to the Paris agreements,' Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister and one of the chairmen of the Paris peace conference, said after the failure of the Beijing talks. The danger of excluding the Khmer Rouge once for all, western diplomats say, is that it would be free to denounce the election results, then bide its time in the fastnesses of northern Cambodia until the UN is forced by a shortage of funds to extricate itself from the country, and ultimately challenge the future elected government. The Khmer Rouge has been stridently emphasising its nationalist credentials and successfully exploiting popular distrust of neighbouring Vietnam by blaming the Vietnamese government and the numerous Vietnamese settlers inside Cambodia for most of Cambodia's problems, and for its own intransigence. Critics of UN operations in Cambodia say Untac officials have consistently over-emphasised the weaknesses of the Khmer Rouge, have been fooled by repeated Khmer Rouge hints that the organisation was on the verge of co-operating with the UN, and have failed to use even the threat of military force to tackle blatant Khmer Rouge violations of the peace accord. They have also, critics say, played into the hands of Khmer Rouge anti-Vietnamese propagandists by leaving too much authority in the hands of the Hun Sen government, which is, in terms of the peace accord, only one of the four factions. While UN officers speak of Khmer Rouge guerrillas defecting in search of food and money, Mr Raoul Jennar, a Brussels-based consultant who monitors Cambodian affairs, says that the Khmer Rouge is poaching troops from the other, less-belligerent factions and now has a presence in 20 of the 21 provinces. 'Today,' he wrote recently, 'the Khmer Rouge display the contempt with which they hold the concern that has been shown to them by the governments and diplomats from the 18 countries who signed the peace agreement.'</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / MPs vote themselves a 2-phase 5.4% pay rise MPs in the early hours of this morning voted to award themselves a two-stage pay rise totalling 5.4 per cent over two years. Opening a late-night debate on MPs' pay in the House Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, defended the proposal to award MPs a pay rise larger than the one it is trying to impose on public-sector workers. Mr Newton confirmed that the government was proposing to offer MPs a salary increase of 2.7 per cent next year and 2.68 per cent in 1995. Trade union leaders and some MPs have strongly criticised the proposal. They say the government plans to impose a much more stringent pay round on public-sector workers, amounting to 1.5 per cent this year and a possible freeze next year. Mr Newton said the planned pay increase for MPs reflected wage restraint. He recalled that MPs had received no pay increase since January 1992, despite the rise in consumer price inflation. He calculated that inflation had risen by 4.6 per cent since the last pay award, and that the 2.7 per cent increase for next year would therefore make up a little over half the amount that MPs have lost in real terms over that period. Miss Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, gave a guarded welcome to the proposal. She insisted that it was not an increase above the rate of inflation, 'but rather one, properly in the circumstances, behind the rate of inflation'. She argued that MPs had received no increase for 18 months. Under the proposals, the salary of an ordinary MP would rise to Pounds 31,687 next year and to Pounds 32,538 in 1995. Those receiving a non-parliamentary salary would receive Pounds 23,854 next year and Pounds 24,495 in 1995. It is also proposed that, from 1996, increases in MPs' pay would be annually linked to a range of civil service bands.</p>

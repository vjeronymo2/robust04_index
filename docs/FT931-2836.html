			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Experts examine Hoechst plant after toxic claims INDEPENDENT experts were sent into the Hoechst chemical group's plant outside Frankfurt yesterday following claims that highly-toxic dioxins were released in an explosion there on Monday, writes Christopher Parkes. Scientists from the Fresenius Institute collected samples for analysis at the request of the regional environment ministry, after Greenpeace members blockaded part of the works on Tuesday. Results of the analysis will be published. Greenpeace had suggested that dioxins would have been released in the explosion and fire which killed one worker and burned PVC cladding on part of the building involved. Hoechst said temperatures in the fire seemed not to have been high enough to release any dioxins. Bayer profits, Page 28</p>

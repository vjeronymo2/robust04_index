			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO NEWS  </P> <P> Review  </P> <P> **** "Floating Weeds"  </P> <P> Connoisseur, $59.95.  </P> <P> Yasujiro Ozu's 1959 remake of his 1934 silent classic retells the story of an  itinerant theater troupe. Not one of Ozu's best films -- though one of only a  handful available on video -- it is, still, clearly the work of one of the  cinema's greatest stylists and creators. The style is simple, serene; nothing  is overstated; the camera is always at a low angle (suggesting the first row of  a theater, the world from a tatami mat, or a posture of Buddhist  contemplation); the writing has a Chekhovian mix of humor and pathos; the  actors play with restraint, precision and buried passion. Beautifully  photographed in color by Kazuo Miyagawa ("Rashomon," "Ugetsu"). MICHAEL  WILMINGTON  </P></p>

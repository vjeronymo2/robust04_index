			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Southern Newspapers surges to Pounds 7m midway Profits at Southern Newspapers, the regional newspaper group, surged from Pounds 3m to Pounds 7.15m pre-tax for the 26 weeks ended January 1. The figure included a Pounds 3.5m profit from the sale of the group's shareholding in Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers. Turnover improved to Pounds 36.62m (Pounds 35.41m), generating operating profits of Pounds 3.58m (Pounds 2.95m). The group had noted a 'slight improvement' in trading conditions since July. The main contributor to the improved trading performance was the newspaper division, although the magazine contract printing division increased turnover by a 'significant' amount. Earnings emerged at 25.28p (8.88p) and the interim dividend is being lifted to 3.5p (3p). The directors said the acquisitions of the Stour Valley News, Monitor Business Magazine and the seven titles of the west country-based Star Newspaper Group had yet to make a real impact on the results. They added that the benefit of rationalisation programmes in all cases should be seen in the second half. The half year pre-tax result virtually matched the Pounds 7.51m returned for the previous full year.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / COUNTRY: THERE'S A DROUGHT, BUT THREE NEWCOMERS SHOW PROMISE  </P> <P> The search continues in country music.  </P> <P> From the late '40s through mid-'70s, the country world produced so many great  singers and records that it was easy for outsiders to underestimate the degree  of artistry required.  </P> <P> All you needed was a singer with character and conviction, instrumental backing  that accented rather than diluted the emotion and a memorable song. The latter,  preferably, included at least one easily quotable line.  </P> <P> And there seemed no end of a supply of great artists: from Hank Williams and  Lefty Frizzell to Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, and from Kitty Wells and Patsy  Cline to Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris.  </P> <P> But the great artists and great records have now become the exception in  country music. Only two mainstream Nashville figures have emerged in the last  dozen or so years to even approach the consistency or vision of the singers  cited above -- John Anderson and Randy Travis -- and both seemed more echoes of  the earlier stars than breakthroughs.  </P> <P> Two other, more recent arrivals, k.d. lang and Lyle Lovett, have shown  exceptional promise, but both are mavericks who haven't been fully accepted in  Nashville as part of the official country family.  </P> <P> This lingering drought in country music is why so much attention in Nashville  is focused these days on newcomers. Here's a look at some of the lastest  country contenders. None joins the honor roll on the basis of these new albums,  but there are some twinkles of promise. The albums are rated on a five-star  scale, from one (poor) to five (a classic).  </P> <P> *** Jann Browne's "Tell Me Why" (Curb) -- One reason the music of this veteran  of Southern California honky-tonks seems so reminiscent of Emmylou Harris is  that Steve Fishell, who used to play steel guitar in Harris' band, produced it  and other musicians who have been associated with Harris play on the album. It  also doesn't hurt that Harris sings harmony on one track.  </P> <P> However, the main reason Browne makes you think of country music's most  enchanting female singer is that Browne sings with a similar purity and sense  of integrity as Harris. She, too, can can make a new song (her own "Mexican  Wind," a soulful tale of romantic loss) feel like a classic or inject new life  into an old favorite (Harlan Howard-Fuzzy Owen's "The One You Slip Around  With"). Strong potential.  </P> <P> *** Mark Collie's "Hardin County Line" (MCA) -- Collie would have been at home  in country in the '50s, when rockabilly and honky-tonk shuffle were the rage.  He sings both styles with a biting authenticity and is backed by a first-rate  band that includes guitarist James Burton, who was Elvis Presley's guitarist  for years. He also writes lots of quotable lines.  </P> <P> Collie is a little too intent on touching all the thematic country bases  (ramblin' fever, the old days), but most of his songs about relationships have  a wry, bittersweet edge. In the opening track, Collie tells about stumbling  home after working the all-night shift to find a note attached to the freezer:  "The good news is she loves me / The bad news is she's gone." Elsewhere, he  offers, "Now where there's smoke, you'll find my old flame."  </P> <P> * 1/2 Alan Jackson's "Here in the Real World" (Arista) -- Jackson aims high.  He's quoted on the inside sleeve of the album package as saying, "You know that  country song, 'Who's Gonna Fill Them Shoes?' I don't know whether I can fill  'em, but I'd sure like to try 'em on." In this debut collection, Jackson is off  to a fast start commercially. The album has been in the country Top 10 since  April 21.  </P> <P> If he's truly hoping to fill the shoes of such country greats as George Jones,  however, he's got a long way to go. The artist he most resembles (in cowboy-hat  image and musical style) is contemporary Dwight Yoakam.  </P> <P> Like the latter, Jackson is good at approximating emotion, but he doesn't show  much original vision or musical soul. Selections such as "Blue Blooded Woman"  have quotable lines, but they're mostly Nashville hokum. Sample: "She loves a  violin, I love a fiddle / We go separate ways but we meet in the middle / Don't  see eye to eye, but we're hand in hand / A blue-blooded woman and a red-neck  man."  </P> <P> * 1/2 Travis Tritt's "Country Club" (Warner Bros.) -- Joining Alan Jackson in  the country Top 10 these days, Tritt is equally suspect. He deals in a  harder-edged, semi-rock brand of country, suggesting his model is more Hank  Williams Jr. than George Jones. There's a sense of drama in his singing and in  the arrangements, but the themes -- as telegraphed in such song titles as "Son  of the New South" and "The Road Home" -- have been part of the accepted country  songbook for years. The singing is generally undistinguished, the arrangements  are routine and the album's most quotable line comes from a song ("Country  Club") that Tritt didn't write.  </P> <P> ** 1/2 Kelly Willis' "Well Traveled Love" (MCA) -- This 21-year-old,  Austin-based singer exudes such personality and spirit that she reminds you of  the early promise of Lone Justice's Maria McKee, a point that wasn't lost on  Carlyne Majer, who worked with Lone Justice and now manages Willis.  </P> <P> Willis balances feelings of spunky optimism and lesson-learned caution so well  in the opening track that you think the album is going to soar. While her voice  continues to dazzle, the album is limited by often pedestrian instrumental  backing and by too few top-notch songs. The next album may be the real test.  </P></p>

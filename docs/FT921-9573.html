			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Observer: Cross-bench Never mind the animosity throbbing daily across the front benches in Britain's House of Commons. Political solidarity across the party divide still exists. Both Conservatives and Labour are setting up a fund to ease Birmingham's veteran Labour leader, Sir Richard Knowles, out of a costly libel embarrassment. Knowles, a feisty but apparently not wealthy pensioner, went out delivering leaflets at a council by-election in June 1990. Unfortunately for him he never bothered to read one. Result: a libel writ from Liberal Democrat councillor John Hemming. Consequence: the search is now on for Pounds 20,000 to calm the ruffled waters. Rushing to Knowles's assistance are Roy Hattersley, engineering union chief Bill Jordan, Sir Neville Bosworth, former Birmingham Conservative leader and John Cartwright, the Social Democrat MP. Now is the time for all good men. . .</p>

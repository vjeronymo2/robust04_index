			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Geomar Garcia] </F>   [Text] It was learned today that the National District  prosecutor, Ramon Gonzalez Hardy, will analyze new charges  brought yesterday by the National Directorate for Drug Control  (DNCD) against those accused of trafficking 399 kg of cocaine to  Miami, to determine whether the reopening of the case is in  order. These individuals received the benefit of a "no cause"  verdict on Friday, 14 January.    The new "evidence" reportedly was turned over to the  prosecutor this Thursday morning, during a visit to the DNCD  headquarters, where a meeting was held with high officials of  the antidrug agency.    The content of the report said to have been prepared by the  DNCD legal office was not explained. However, the statement was  made that, "it is consistent to keep those benefiting from the  `no cause' verdict in prison, and to take them to the criminal  court."    Those who benefited from the release order of the Santo  Domingo Classification Chamber are Roberto Antonio Tonos Mauad,  Ramon Emeregildo Abreu Diaz, Guillermo Enrique Torchio  Hernandez, Manuel Orlando Barrcus, Julio de Jesus Sanchez,  Tirson Cesar de Leon Reyes, Julia Rosina Oneyda de la Cruz,  Carlos Juan Robles Sosa, Benito Rodriguez Nunez, Anibal  Alcantara de los Santos, Julio Valentin Alcantara Rosario,  Francisco Valdez Garcia, Benjamin Valdez Jaquez, and Sergio  Tulio Fontana.    The attorney general of the Republic, Efrain Reyes Duluc,  and  the prosecutor of the Santo Domingo Court of Appeals, Jose  Leonardo Duran Fajardo, investigated to learn whether there were  any anomalies in the release order that benefited the accused.    Dr. Duran Fajardo claimed that the investigation had been  ordered because of "charges and information" to the effect that  this decision had been handed down improperly.    The judges who issued the "no cause" verdict are Jose Ramon  Lantigua, of the Santo Domingo Court of Appeals; Danilo Diaz  Diaz, of the National District's Ninth Chamber of Criminal  Proceedings; and Juan Ubaldo Castillo, of the Monte Plata court.    The notice of the Classification Chamber's decision was  given  to the National District prosecutor's office on Monday, 17  January, through the Criminal Department.    Prosecutor Gonzalez Hardy began studying the case records on  Tuesday, 18 January, and, on Wednesday, the 19th, announced that  he would sign the release order if no new charges were submitted  to him against the accused.    The official said that he would take note of Dr. Duran  Fajardo's statements regarding the investigation of the  Classification Chamber's decision.    The procedure has been established whereby, after the  Classification Chamber's "no cause" verdict is officially  announced, the Public Prosecutor's Office has 48 hours to order  the release of those benefiting from the decision, if no new  charges are brought to reopen the case.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials on the resumption of North-South  dialogue carried by Seoul vernacular newspapers on 1 and 2 March.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 1 March carries on  page 3 an 800-word editorial urging the ROK Government to be  prudent in enforcing its policy toward North Korea. The  editorial reports that the North-South working-level contact for  the exchange of special envoys will encounter many difficulties,  noting the fact that North Korea failed to respond immediately  to our side's proposal to hold the contact and that it has  bitterly denounced President Kim Yong-sam's 25 February new  conference. The editorial notes that "such an attitude by North  Korea, though an hackneyed one, may be a tactical trick designed  to lead the contact favorably." The editorial continues that,  nevertheless, our government's attitude toward the upcoming  North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special  envoys gives the impression that it has forgotten such a  hackneyed attitude of North Korea. The editorial stresses that  "negotiations require strategies and tactics," and advises that  the government use adequate negotiating cards in the upcoming  working- level contact.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 2 March carries on  page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "We Should Be Hasty in  Dealing With the North-South Issue." Noting that North Korea is  actually interested mainly in talks with the United States, not  in North-South dialogue, the editorial urges the government to  be prudent and not to show the North Korean side a hasty  attitude in the course of the upcoming North-South working-level  contact. Citing the difficulties in dealing with the North-South  issue and North Korea's cunning tactics, the editorial  concludes: "We should not repeat our past mistakes in the  upcoming North-South dialogue. We need to learn from past  lessons with modesty."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 2 March carries on  page  3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Oppose Unsubstantial  Exchange of Special Envoys." Stressing that the realization of  the exchange of special envoys depends entirely on North Korea's  sincerity, the editorial reports that the prospect of the  exchange of special envoys is not so bright because North Korea  has reluctantly accepted the North-South working-level contact  with the aim of suspending the Team Spirit military exercise and  holding a third round of U.S.- North Korean talks. The editorial  continues that if the exchange of special envoys is realized  without producing substantial agreements, it will be meaningless  and will not be conducive to easing tension on the Korean  peninsula. In this connection, the editorial stresses that our  government should adhere to and achieve the precondition it has  put forth, that is, the realization of simultaneous inspections  in the North and the South. In conclusion, the editorial  stresses that the government should cancel its plan to announce  the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise at an early date and,  at the same time, should make efforts so that the United States  refuses to hold a third round of talks with North Korea in case  North Korea shows an insincere attitude at the upcoming  North-South working-level contact.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries  on page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "There is No Short Cut  to the Settlement of the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The  editorial welcomes North Korea's acceptance of International  Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, nuclear inspection. The editorial  stresses that if North Korea's nuclear transparency is to be  firmly guaranteed and the upcoming North-South contact is to  start off on the right foot, there will be many barriers to  overcome. The editorial, however, warns that the IAEA  inspection is just the beginning and that we should not expect  much. The editorial urges the government to act prudently in the  negotiations with North Korea and not to tread upon thin air --  believing that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspection is  the realization of the normalization of North-South relations.  In conclusion the editorial emphasizes that we should clearly  present our demands to North Korea and keenly grasp North  Korea's strategies toward South Korea in order to avoid becoming  entangled in them.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries  on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Expecting Productive  North-South Dialogue." The editorial analyzes that the delay in  the North-South working-level contact for the exchange of  special envoys is due to North Korea's indifference to dialogue  with the South.    The editorial stresses that "ROK is the only country in the  world that can quickly and accurately provide North Korea with  what it needs desperately, including food, energy, economic aid,  and even active support in the improvement of relations with the  United States and Japan."    The editorial reports our side's delegate to the contact  should convey this point to North Korea because past dialogues  were only superficial and each side had different objectives.    The editorial hopes such mistakes will not be repeated so  that the exchange of special envoys will be realized soon for a  more productive dialogue in the consequent North-South summit  talks.    SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries on page 4 a  1,000-word article by Yang Sung-hyon summarizing the advantages  and disadvantages of the 25 February agreement. The editorial  reports the game cannot be won one-sidedly as Foreign Minister  Han said: "It is not a zero-sum game but a nonzero-sum game."    The article explains that "the two sides' goals of the  nuclear negotiations are not necessarily conflicting but  complementary." The editorial continues that North Korea did not  "win" the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, which the ROK  and the United States had little intention to continue as they  did not include it in their budgets for this year, but used the  suspension to convince North Korea to accept the inspections.  The article contends that all sides desired the third-round  talks.    The article reports, however, North Korea did not lose  everything because it has succeeded in obtaining written  promises to suspend the Team Spirit exercise and to resume the  third-round talks in return for North-South working-level  contacts, which it can suspend anytime with trifle excuses. The  article adds that the exchange of special envoys was not  mentioned in the agreement and nuclear inspections were defined  to only provide assurance of the continuity of safeguards, thus  North Korea still has the initiative on this subject. The  article concludes the score is ROK and the United States, 55;  North Korea, 45.    The pro-government HANGYORE SINMUN on 2 March carries on  page  2 a 1,400-word article by Kang Tae-ho and Yi Sang-ki on the  delay of the North-South working-level contact.    The article analyzes there are two reasons for the delay:  one, because the ROK Ministry of National Defense postponed the  announcement to suspend the Team Spirit exercise to the  afternoon of 1 March to coincide with the arrival of the IAEA  inspection team in North Korea; second, because North Korea  misinterpreted "the resumption of working-level contact" as  "agreement on the resumption," not "actual holding of  working-level contact."    The article expresses optimism because North Korea showed a  different attitude by saying "the exchange of special envoys is  an urgent task that cannot be delayed" in its telephone message.  Therefore, the article expects it will not be very difficult to  reach a compromise on the follow-up steps, including the methods  of the exchange and the duties of special envoys.    The article concludes that the government should be prepared  for North Korea's additional demands to suspend other military  exercises, including the Ulchi exercise.</p>

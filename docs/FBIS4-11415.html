			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba  visited centers of the western scientific hub and made  statements to this newscast.    [Begin recording in English with simultaneous translation  into Spanish] [unidentified reporter] This afternoon, the  official conversations between Cuba and Zambia began. What is  the result of this first session, and what types of cooperation  will be established between Cuba and Zambia?    [Chiluba] The discussions were held in a very cordial  atmosphere. We learned a great deal from President Fidel Castro  in all areas. We discussed cooperation in the fields of health  care; agriculture; the biotechnology and pharmaceutical  industry, of course; as well as the field of tourism. We believe  there is much that we can do to develop these areas.    We also looked at matters of common interest in the global  politics of today; the problems of Angola, which are about to be  resolved now; and the problems of Mozambique. [words indistinct]  that today they have begun voting in South Africa in the first  democratic elections. We believe there will be more peace in  that area.    We also looked at the development of Third World countries.  We should begin to rely on our own efforts, and with a bit of  sweat and toil and commitment, as well as perhaps a little help  from outside, we may manage to build strong foundations for the  development of all countries. [end recording]    At the center for genetic engineering and biotechnology,  Frederick Chiluba received a detailed explanation from Manuel  Limonta, the director of this scientific institution, and  expressed interest in the diverse areas of research conducted at  the center.    At the Finlay Institute, he visited one of the plants for  the  production of vaccine and was accompanied by [Politburo member]  Dr. Concepcion Campa, director of the Finlay Institute; and  Gustavo Sierra, deputy director of that center.    For tomorrow, Zambian President Chiluba is scheduled to  visit  health care centers, and in the evening is scheduled to meet  with the African ambassadors accredited in our country.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Development and the environment THE WORLD Development Report from the World Bank has a stark message: poverty is increasing. Among its symptoms are the rising number of people drinking contaminated water or huddled in smoke-filled rooms, and the deaths attributable to water-borne disease and land over-use. The report proposes urgent policies to deal with these problems, starting in many cases with better education for women, whom the bank sees playing a crucial role in reducing the numbers of people born into poverty. However the timing of today's report, less than three weeks before the opening of the Earth Summit in Rio, as well as its title 'Development and the Environment' are a reminder of how the debate about poverty and its remedies has shifted in recent years. The two issues, once quite separate, have become closely interwoven. As it happens, many of the Third World countries' most serious environmental problems of land degradation, growing deserts and deforestation can be traced directly to their primitive level of development: the state of their economies gives the people no choice but to destroy their natural endowments to survive. As a result they slip into a downward spiral in which they waste ever more resources as they get poorer. Useful focus The World Bank's report thus provides a useful focus on a major aspect of the environmental debate at a time when the developed world's mind is too easily fixed on more fashionable pollution issues, such as greenhouse gases and the ozone layer. As the report remarks, 'for the 1bn people in developing countries who do not have access to clean water or the 1.7bn who lack access to sanitation, these are the most important environmental problems of all.' Again, in the second half of the 1980s 1.3bn people living in urban areas were threatened by respiratory disorders caused by airborne particles. Similarly, soil depletion may be causing annual income losses in some countries equal, says the Bank, to 0.5-1.5 per cent of gross domestic product. These are serious environmental problems. Fortunately, their solution does not require a global compact; it requires, first, more development and, second, that those responsible for economic expansion are forced to take account of the environmental consequences of their actions. Those who doubt whether policies that improve economic efficiency will also improve the environment need look only at the polluted landscapes of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which are a monument to distorted energy prices and industrial protection. By contrast, industrial countries have solved most of the problems that worry the developing countries. For poor countries, development is the heart of the solution. International co-operation It is not so everywhere, above all not for the main international environmental issues, on which the Rio conference should focus: global warming and protection of biodiversity. Here economic development is the problem, not the solution. The answer rests in international co-operation. But developing countries feel, quite understandably, that they are expected to pay for solutions to problems they did not cause. It is important the Rio Summit not be side-tracked into a long and probably futile argument about backwardness and aid. This would inflame the north-south confrontation, which has already obstructed many of the preparatory meetings and scuppered some of the agreements which should have been signed at Rio. None the less, the Rio agenda cannot avoid questions of equity. What is at stake is the right to exploit such globally scarce resources as an atmosphere low in carbon dioxide. The World Development Report shows that the total output of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption and cement manufacture in the industrial countries is far greater than in developing countries. If the rich want the threat of global warming removed they will have to bear the cost, because it is they who are benefiting most from what is causing the danger. That is the heart of the matter. It cannot be evaded.</p>

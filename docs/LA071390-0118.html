			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SUBSIDIES APPROVED FOR SOME DWP  CUSTOMERS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioners on Thursday  approved new subsidies for low-income residents, which could trim about 15% off  the average water and power bill for low-income residents.  </P> <P> Water bills for disadvantaged families could be cut by $1.98 a month and  electricity bills by $3.35 a month under the plan, which must be approved by  the City Council.  </P> <P> Others would see an increase of less than 1% in their bills to make up the  difference, DWP officials said.  </P> <P> Officials said more than 340,000 households could be eligible for the  subsidies. Almost 100,000 other customers, elderly or disabled, already receive  "lifeline" subsidies that are even larger. Combined, the eligible households  amount to more than one-third of the 1.16-million residential DWP customers.  </P></p>

Vladas Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based Selma  association, was arrested last week when over 40 searches were  carried out in apartments of former and present Defense Ministry  employees. Officials said the measure was taken to further  investigate the purchase of weapons for Lithuania's defense  forces in 1992-93.    "There is and will be no influence on the troop withdrawal  from Latvia and Estonia, or construction work in Kaliningrad.  State affairs must not be mixed with personal matters,"  Petkevicius said at a press conference Thursday [24 March].    The lawmaker emphasized that Selma is not a Lithuanian  organization since last September, and law experts will have to  find out how the company managed to continue its existence in  Lithuania without paying taxes.    In Petkevicius' opinion, the case started in the fall of  1992  when Lithuanian Provisional Money, also called talonas, was  introduced instead of Soviet rubles. The lawmaker said around 2  million rubles were then taken out to the Kaliningrad region at  that time. He said the money was escorted by certain services  but did not specify them. "This is investigated by the  prosecutor's offices of both countries."    Petkevicius said it is necessary to find 12 million lits and  several million dollars that disappeared in the weapons deal.  He said the prosecutor's office established that those who  directly participated in purchasing weapons have huge sums at  their disposal now.    Petkevicius said he was surprised by ex-Defense Minister  Audrius Butkevicius stormy reaction to Selma president's arrest,  because the former minister is not mentioned in the  investigation carried out by the parliament's economic crimes  commission.    The lawmaker noted that various companies acted as mediators  in the weapons deal. He mentioned a case when Russian  helicopters, offered for 800,000 U.S. dollars per unit, were  later purchased for 1,200,000 each, and the price difference  went to fictitious firms.    Petkevicius said the Russian prosecutor's office is also  interested in the case because "many facts available to  Lithuanian and Russian prosecutor's offices coincide."</p>

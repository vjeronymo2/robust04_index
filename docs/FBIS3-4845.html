			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 1 KYODO -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major expressed concern  Tuesday [1 March] about Japan's trade policy and urged Japan to  further open up its markets to foreign products.    The United States and Britain will also support advancing  the  implementation date of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) trade accord to January 1 next year, Major said.    Major, who met with Clinton over breakfast Tuesday, told  reporters that he and Clinton spent "some time" discussing  Japan's markets for foreign products.    "We both share a wish to support the growing measure of  opinion that exists in Japan, for example, for the further  opening of Japanese markets," Major said after emerging from the  White House session with Clinton.    "This is a matter of concern to the United States. It's a  matter of concern throughout the European Union as well," Major  said, with Clinton looking on by his side.    Japan runs big trade surpluses both with the United States  and the European Union. Trade talks between Tokyo and  Washington collapsed last month on ways to whittle down Japan's  trade surplus with the U.S.    On another trade matter, Major said he and Clinton agreed  that "it would be desirable" to move up the starting date of the  so-called "Uruguay Round" accord concluded last December under  GATT auspices.    "The sooner that agreement can be implemented, the better it  will be," Major said.    Under the terms worked out by 117 GATT member countries last  December, the trade pact is tentatively scheduled to go into  force on July 1, 1995.</p>

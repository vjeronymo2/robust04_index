			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Vickers cuts its interim dividend: UK engineering group blames continuing losses at Rolls-Royce Motors VICKERS, the UK engineering group, blamed continuing losses at its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary when it yesterday cut its interim dividend from 3.7p to 0.5p. The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.1m in the six months to June 30, compared with a Pounds 4.3m loss last time, although turnover increased from Pounds 330.2m to Pounds 349.3m. Vickers, which cut last year's final dividend, said the latest reduction reflected the losses at Rolls-Royce Motors, and consequent restructuring costs. The 950 job cuts at Crewe announced yesterday will be taken as a Pounds 12m exceptional charge in the second half, but the first half also included an exceptional restructuring and redundancy charge of Pounds 1.7m, half incurred at Crewe. Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said: 'Prospects for the year are uncertain and it is therefore prudent to conserve cash and ensure our ability to support our defence, aerospace, marine engineering and medical businesses, and Cosworth, all of which are trading satisfactorily.' Sir Richard said the board intended to adopt a policy of continued dividend growth, albeit from a lower level, reflecting the sustainable long-term earnings growth when trading improved. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said the performance of the aerospace business, comprising Ross Catherall and Vickers Precision Components, had been encouraging. Cosworth, which makes high-performance engines, was hit by cuts at its principal customer, Ford, but its racing operations were successful. The marine engineering division encountered sluggish demand and strong competition, but had won valuable orders. The group's medical equipment business, which experienced a record year in 1991, suffered from lower demand in the US and uncertainty in Europe. Sir Colin said he expected an improvement in the second half. Vickers is continuing the development and manufacturing phase of the new Challenger 2 battle tank programme, for which it last year won a Pounds 520m order from the British government. Losses per share were 1.8p, compared with 2.6p last time. Gearing was 33 per cent at June 30, but is likely to rise to between 45 per cent and 50 per cent by the year-end, because of the cash drain from Rolls-Royce Motors. Lex, Page 18; Market, Page 42</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: State to take control at Nordbanken THE SWEDISH government is to take full control of Nordbanken, the country's second largest commercial bank, in a SKr20bn (Dollars 3.38bn) rescue operation. The state's intervention is designed to save Nordbanken from possible collapse due to mounting credit losses and to help the bank's restructuring in preparation for its rapid privatisation. Under the proposed changes Nordbanken will be divided into two separate operations. Its normal commercial banking activities will continue while a newly formed subsidiary, Securum, with an initial SKr60bn balance sheet, will deal with non-performing loans, property administration and other problem areas. The state already owns 77.3 per cent of Nordbanken. Yesterday the bank's other main shareholder - Nobel Industries - said it had accepted the offer of SKr21 a share for its 12.6 per cent of Nordbanken. The total cost of acquiring the outstanding shares is estimated to be around SKr2bn. The government's move stems from the continuing deterioration in Nordbanken's finances. This year alone its credit losses - due to a persistently weak property and finance market - are expected to rise to between SKr6bn and SKr8bn. The bank said as a result it would not be able by the autumn to maintain an adequate capital adequacy ratio despite last October's move by the state to subscribe for and guarantee a SKr5.2bn new share issue. For 1991 Nordbanken made a SKr5.8bn loss. Mr Bjorn Wahlstrom, Nordbanken chairman, said yesterday that the only alternative to state intervention would have been a dramatic contraction and a drastic fall in the valuation of the bank. The bank said the SKr20bn rescue package will cover guarantees, loans, capital injections and other measures needed for the financing of Securum. The Ministry of Finance said its proposal would ensure Nordbanken could grow into a stable bank with a strong capital base and good level of profitability. 'These are the necessary conditions for the sale of Nordbanken to the private sector which the government wants to do as soon possible,' it said. Credit Suisse First Boston, the merchant bank, has been given the task of examining the possibilities of finding a new owner for the bank. Yesterday's announcement brought an angry reaction from Mr Curt Olsson, chairman of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank. Mr Olsson found it 'difficult' to criticise the state for saving Nordbanken from an acute crisis, but the decision he said would lead to a 'serious distortion of competition in Swedish banking'.</p>

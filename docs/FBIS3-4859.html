			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Takeshi Nagano, one of  Japan's leading business executives, Wednesday [2 March]  cautioned against premature optimism over the state of the  Japanese economy.    Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers  Association [Nikkeiren], told a press conference that the  "tankan" business survey by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), published  the previous day, cannot be considered an exact reflection of  reality.    He said the report is "based on figures taken before the  Japan-U.S. summit meeting" February 11, since when U.S.  pressure has been mounting on Japan to cut its huge current  account surplus.    "So it is premature to say the economy has bottomed out.  Last year, signs of recovery were immediately followed by  worsening of the situation. I cannot be pleased with the report  without reserve," Nagano said.    The tankan report indicated that pessimism among businesses  has hit bottom, with the BOJ index for business confidence among  major manufacturers surveyed in February at minus 56, unchanged  from the previous survey taken in November last year.    Nagano also reiterated his proposal for no wage increases in  the coming fiscal year, starting in April.    "Further hikes in wages will encourage hollowing of the  industry. Japan's wages are already the world's highest in  nominal terms," he said.</p>

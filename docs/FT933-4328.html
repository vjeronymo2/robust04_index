			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Brian who? Canada's most famous jutting jaw and baritone voice were conspicuous by their absence yesterday. As politicians launched their campaigns for the October 25 general election, not a squeak came from Brian Mulroney, who stepped down two months ago as the most unpopular PM in recent Canadian history. He signed on last month as a senior partner at Ogilvy Renault, a law firm. His job is to broaden its international links, but no one would be surprised if Mulroney doesn't try to forge a few himself. He was considered a few years ago as a candidate for UN secretary-general, and would probably be interested if a similar job came up. But for all his famed negotiating skill, Mulroney has a black mark against his name on the international stage. He has been widely criticised for one of his final acts as prime minister, which was to recall Don McCutchan, Canada's representative at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. McCutchan was the most consistent critic of the EBRD's high-spending ways. Not surprisingly, Mr McCutchan has landed a less glamorous job than Mulroney. He started yesterday with Ronald Chisholm, a Toronto food importer and exporter.</p>

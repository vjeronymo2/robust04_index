			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Party chairman appeals for unity and resolve A STRONG appeal for the unity and resolution that characterised the Tory party in the 1980s came yesterday from Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. With the prime minister facing growing divisions on Europe and the economy, Sir Norman acknowledged that the conference was about future issues. He said: 'We stand or fall as one party. We have won more elections than any other party in Britain because we are the most united and most determined party in Britain.' In his first conference speech as party chairman, Sir Norman said that the lesson of the Thatcher years was that the Tories' electoral successes had come from their discipline and determination to keep to long-term aims. 'Over the same period Labour have been the most divided and most undisciplined party in Britain. We should not contemplate going down their road - the socialist road of division,' he warned. 'That is why they have lost . . and lost again.' 'The lesson is that we must all stand together, and I do mean all: in our branches, in our associations, in our areas, in our local councils and yes, if I may say so, among our MPs at Westminster too. 'In this hall and across the country there are thousands of people who worked themselves to the bone on the doorsteps and pavements of Britain to get this party elected. We must stay true to them.' Speaking just a couple of hours ahead of yesterday afternoon's debate on Europe, he reminded the conference of the setbacks and hard times in the early 1980s over controversial issues such as trade union reforms and the first privatisations. There was vigorous applause from delegates when his call for party unity explicitly included MPs, a few of whom have irritated some rank and file party members by their open rebellion on the Maastricht treaty. Sir Norman said that the question of Britain's future in Europe was one of the three great issues for the 1990s. He used rhetoric reminiscent of the Euro-sceptics to emphasise the government's commitment to oppose a federal Europe and its goal of 'a Europe of nation states where decisions are taken as close as possible to the people'. His speech also aimed to remind the conference of the debt owed to Mr John Major for the election victory - which Sir Norman described as a 'personal triumph' for the prime minister. The applause was, however, at least as loud for the mention of Lady Thatcher as 'one of the great leaders of our party'.</p>

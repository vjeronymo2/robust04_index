			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] On 29 April the Macedonian-language  Skopje daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA publishes on page 4 a report by  L.K. on the 28 April news conference of the Constitutional Court  of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Jordan  Arsov, chairman of the Constitutional Court, told reporters that  the year 1993 stands out because of the great number of cases  involved and because of the "peculiar" atmosphere in which the  court had to function. Reviewing the court's activities, Arsov  said the court had reviewed 76 laws and 42 regulations, that is,  twice as many as in 1992 and, in fact, the largest number of  cases in the court's 30-year history. Cases involving the  defense of the rights and liberties of individuals and citizens  had grown significantly. There had also been initiatives  contesting the constitutionality of the programs and statutes of  three political parties.    The news conference brought out the fact that the court had  ruled 13 laws unconstitutional; these related to the sale of  socially owned housing, the republic's judicial council, the  public prosecutor, public control over prices, basic rights to  pensions and to disability insurance, expropriation of property,  games of chance, defense, radio broadcasting, protection and  utilization of farmland, the cabinet government, tax on turnover  of goods and services, and the reassignment of common premises  in housing. Because the court questioned the compatibility of  some laws with the Constitution, it ordered an appraisal of  these laws. The most significant laws involved in this ongoing  process concern internal affairs, criminal procedure, energy,  preschool and primary education, preventive medicine, housing  relationships, forests, and the Chamber of Commerce. To uphold  the Constitution, the court also produced 50 intervening  decisions; among these 47 were repealed and seven were annuled.  This represents 42 percent of the total number of cases appealed  to the court during the year. This type of activity constituted  30 percent of the court's cases during 1992. From this increase,  NOVA MAKEDONIJA's reporter says, one can conclude that there  have been significant constitutional and legal infringements.    According to the NOVA MAKEDONIJA reporter, the journalists  used the forum to ask about the court's recent decision that  license plates would have to have Cyrillic, rather than Latin,  letters. The justices refuted the "epithets" made about this  decision by Minister of Interior Frckovski at his news  conference. They emphasized that the decision had been made  unanimously. In the ensuing discussion, the justices explained  some aspects of the court's operation and expressed concern over  the lack of cooperation on the part of some legislators.</p>

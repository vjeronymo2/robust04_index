			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KIRKPATRICK SEEN IN KEY POST AT PARAMOUNT  </P> <P> David Kirkpatrick, a onetime screenwriter who moved into the executive ranks,  appears to be next in line for the co-presidency of Paramount Pictures, a  high-profile post that Sidney Ganis is expected to vacate soon.  </P> <P> Ganis and studio Chairman Frank Mancuso have been negotiating Ganis' exit for  more than a week, according to a source at the studio.  </P> <P> The co-president, who is 50 and has two years remaining under his employment  contract with Paramount, is expected to remain with the studio as a consultant  and an independent producer, according to studio sources.  </P> <P> Ganis didn't return a call seeking comment. Kirkpatrick also declined comment.  A Paramount spokeswoman said: "This is all speculation, and we can't comment on  it."  </P> <P> Rumors of Ganis' departure began circulating in July, when Kirkpatrick left  Walt Disney Co. to join Paramount as executive vice president. Kirkpatrick was  given extensive authority over filmmaking when he joined the studio, and he  quickly pushed Ganis aside in what some Hollywood observers described as a  classic power struggle.  </P> <P> Some industry sources expressed surprise that Paramount would put film  production in the hands of Kirkpatrick, rather than a better-known executive  such as former Paramount President Ned Tanen. "To have David and a bunch of  kids running the studio isn't going to send the right message to Wall Street,"  one top talent agent said of the 38-year-old Kirkpatrick.  </P> <P> Tanen, who is 59, stayed on as a consultant to Paramount after resigning the  presidency but has repeatedly told associates that he isn't interested in  returning to an executive role. He didn't return a call Monday seeking comment  on his plans.  </P> <P> Mancuso, 56, is said to have taken a much stronger hand in script and casting  decisions at Paramount over the past several weeks, and some insiders  speculated Monday that Mancuso would continue to involve himself more directly  in movie decisions under a Kirkpatrick regime.  </P> <P> Ganis, who came to Paramount after working as marketing vice president and  principal aide to filmmaker George Lucas at his Marin County ranch, has been  blamed by some in Hollywood for weakening Paramount's standing in the creative  community during his two-year tenure as co-president. Several agents and  producers have complained that the former marketing chief is indecisive and  slow to act and that his cost-cutting efforts alienated some talent. (Paramount  marketing and distribution chief Barry London is the other co-president.)  </P> <P> Ganis didn't have strong relations with Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, two  of the most successful producers on the Paramount lot, and had argued against  signing their lucrative production deal last year. But he is close to Francis  Ford Coppola, among other filmmakers, and even as the studio's marketing chief  he argued strongly in favor of producing "Tucker" to lure the director into  making "The Godfather, Part III."  </P> <P> Ganis partisans maintain that he was unfairly blamed for Paramount's problems.  They say, for instance, that Paramount's tough business affairs department  repeatedly undermined him. "Sid made many decisions that business affairs  overruled," one defender said.  </P> <P> Ganis is given much of the credit for shepherding the studio's big summer hit  "Ghost" through the studio. So far, "Ghost," the second-biggest hit of the  year, has grossed $148 million. Ganis projects still in the Paramount pipeline  include "Regarding Henry," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Harrison Ford,  and "Dead Again," directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Donald Sutherland.  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick has a reputation as being an aggressive executive and a savvy --  some say savage -- political player. But with filmmakers, he maintains a gentle  touch -- too gentle for Disney's tastes, where his hands-off approach to movie  making drew some criticism from fellow executives.  </P> <P> This is Kirkpatrick's third tour of duty at Paramount. He began as a story  analyst there after graduating from California Institute of Arts in 1974 and  writing a screenplay called "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase," which was  produced by New World in 1976 under the title "Dynamite Woman."  </P> <P> Even as a story analyst in 1979, Kirkpatrick was writing scripts on the side.  "Screenwriting was his first goal," recalled screenwriter Larry Wilson, who  worked with Kirkpatrick at the time.  </P> <P> He left Paramount to work with independent producer Sidney Beckerman at United  Artists, then returned to Paramount in 1982 as executive director of  production. At Paramount, he was the executive in charge of Eddie Murphy's  films -- including "Beverly Hills Cop" -- and dealt routinely with Simpson and  Bruckheimer, particularly on "Top Gun."  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick left Paramount to join Weintraub Entertainment Group's film  division, where he worked under Guy McElwaine, then chairman of the division.  At Weintraub, Kirkpatrick oversaw an ill-starred slate that included "Fresh  Horses" and "My Stepmother Is an Alien."  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick's career moves of late haven't happened quietly. When he left for  Weintraub Entertainment in 1987, Paramount sued him for breach of contract.  (The suit was later settled with a Kirkpatrick payment to the studio.) When he  returned to Paramount this year, Disney sued him, claiming that Kirkpatrick had  broken an agreement by trying to hire away one of its executives and by using  internal information to interfere with a Disney production. Kirkpatrick is  contesting the suit.  </P></p>

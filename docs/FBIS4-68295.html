			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain Ihor Melnychuk, Press Service of the </F> Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: "The Problems of the Armed  Forces -- The Unvarnished Truth Presented at the Meeting of the  Chiefs of the Main Directorates of the Ministry of Defense with  Journalists"]    [Text] Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces and first deputy minister of  defense of Ukraine, opened the meeting by stressing that the  conversation would be frank. Indeed, there has long been a need  for such a meeting of the chiefs of the leading directorates of  the military establishment with the representatives of the  country's mass media. Questions arise every day concerning some  aspect or another of the activity of the Armed Forces.  Unfortunately, lacking reliable information, journalists often  publish reports on the military in newspapers or in radio and  television broadcasts that are not completely accurate.    "And when we hear our work being judged unfairly, this  upsets  us and dampens our enthusiasm," stated Col. Gen. A. Lopata in  his opening remarks. He then added: "We have invited you here so  that we can give candid answers to any questions you may have;  so that you are not forced to guess at things on your own. We  want the people of Ukraine to have the true, unvarnished, but  also undistorted facts about what is happening in our Ukrainian  Army."    Let me begin by saying that the meeting was a success. But,  judge for yourselves.    The first thing that interested the journalists was whether  there were any problems this year with the conscription of  youths into the Armed Forces of Ukraine.    The chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine  admitted that there were some problems:    "But you need to understand what is causing these problems.  The current conscription pool in Ukraine is extremely large.  More than 800,000 youths are eligible to be drafted into our  army. But existing legislation, which provides for granting  deferments from the draft to many categories of young people,  leaves us with only 12 percent of the total figure.  Unfortunately, this is not enough.    "This was what forced us to resort to an unauthorized  measure--to review the decision of the Supreme Council that the  term of service be one and one-half years and move to increase  it to two years. We were compelled to take this step in order to  maintain the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at  the necessary level. That is why those conscripted in the spring  of 1992 are only now being discharged into the reserves."    Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata then reminded those present of the  directive issued by President Yuriy Meshkov of the Republic of  Crimea demanding that the peninsula's youths be conscripted only  into units that are stationed in the autonomous republic. The  president of Ukraine issued a decree abolishing this directive  as one that violates the laws of Ukraine. As a result,  conscription in the Republic of Crimea is now proceeding in  normal fashion and in accordance with Ukrainian laws. Crimeans  will serve on the whole territory of Ukraine.    Maj. Gen. Valeriy Venher, chief of the Main Organizational  and Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine, amplified on the answer of the chief of the  General Staff:    "Currently, the draft is proceeding according to plan. So  far, the plan has not been frustrated in any way. I expect that  we shall fulfill the conscription plan.    "The process of discharging those who have completed their  term of service into the reserves is also under way. By 3 May of  this year, the last soldier drafted in the spring of 1992 will  have been discharged from the Armed Forces."    The journalists addressed their next question to Col. Gen.  Hryhoriy Mikhaylichenko, deputy minister of defense for rear  services and chief of Rear Services of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine:    "As we know, the former Kiev Military District included five  military state farms, which helped to relieve the people of the  problem of feeding the army. How do things stand today with the  army's agricultural enterprises?"    Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko:    "The Armed Forces, like the whole Ukrainian people, have  many  social problems. As things stood on 1 April, the Ministry of  Defense had received from the government only 43 percent of the  funds appropriated in the budget for the maintenance of military  personnel.    "In spite of this, we are making every effort to ensure that  military personnel are fed properly. Thus, officers, warrant  officers, and reenlisted servicemen receive food rations. Term  servicemen are also provided with standard rations. The  military's state farms help to solve these problems in today's  difficult circumstances. There are currently twenty farms that  belong to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Actually, twenty-one,  because a few days ago, a collective farm in the town of Brody  in Lviv Oblast joined our ranks. Its members requested  unanimously to be transferred under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of Defense.    "What percentage of goods do the military's state farms  supply? They provide the army with enough meat for 70 days, milk  for virtually the whole year (345 days), eggs for 122 days (at  four eggs per week for each term serviceman), oil for 173 days,  potatoes and vegetables for 22 days. Obviously, this  significantly reduces the problem of providing the troops with  food products.    "We are currently building an enterprise to process  agricultural production in partnership with a foreign firm. This  enterprise will fully process meat, leather, milk, and grain  crops. This will significantly improve our ability to provision  military personnel."    The chief of Rear Services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  assured the journalists attending the meeting and asked them to  reassure the parents of military personnel, especially term  servicemen, in their reports that no matter how difficult things  may be, there will be no irregularities in the normal feeding,  medical care, and material provisioning of personnel.    Volodymyr Chykalik, the military commentator of VECHIRNIY  KYYIV, passed on to Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko a question that  had been addressed to his newspaper by the personnel of the  missile cruiser Ukrayina, which is undergoing repairs in  Mykolayiv: Why do Ukrainian sailors have to pay the Black Sea  Fleet for their medical treatment?    Hryhoriy Mykolayovych was well informed about this problem:    "This matter will be settled. We will definitely reach an  agreement with the command of the Black Sea Fleet. It is  inconceivable that military personnel should have to pay for  their medical care. By the way, our medical facilities provide  Black Sea Fleet personnel with free medical treatment."    The next question posed by the journalists concerned the  introduction of a new uniform. They wanted to know whether the  deadline for switching to the new uniform, which had been set in  a recent presidential decree, would be kept.    Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko:    "The new military uniform for the Armed Forces of Ukraine  has  been designed and is being introduced. During the first half of  this year, uniforms will be sewn for generals and the officer  corps at military institutes and schools and for top personnel  at the Ministry of Defense, the military districts, and the  different corps. Uniforms for everybody else will be sewn in  1995.    "The necessary cloth has already been issued to the  districts  and they have begun to implement the president's decree. But a  shortage of funds has slowed this process.    "We have taken a number of steps to make the uniforms of  military school cadets more attractive. These uniforms will be  very similar to those worn by officers. In addition, on 1  September, students will be issued camouflage uniforms. Term  servicemen will wear laced army boots instead of high boots  [kyrzovi], jackets of coat-quality cloth instead of greatcoats,  and the uncomfortable parade-dress single-breasted jacket will  be replaced by an elegant, youthful jacket. Funds are a problem,  but we are getting things done.    "The uniforms are the subject of a great deal of talk.  Especially, should there be fur caps or not, and why do generals  need leather coats? It would be interesting to hear the opinion  of the chief of rear services on this subject."    "The leather coats have been introduced as a representative  item. They are not included in the standard issue. The generals  order these coats at their own expense. In my opinion, it is a  good thing for the minister of defense and other generals when  they travel abroad to represent our country in such high-quality  uniforms. This adds to Ukraine's prestige."    Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata noted that very many Ukrainians  have leather clothing and no one criticizes them for this,  whereas there was immediate criticism of the army. He added:    "In the past, every general in the Soviet Army had the right  to buy a full, better-quality field uniform and a better-quality  rain cloak at his own expense. For some reason, no one seemed to  notice this then."    Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko:    "Apropos the fur caps. Such caps were part of traditional  Ukrainian attire and were worn by the Cossacks. Abolishing them  caused concern even outside the military. Many civilians  appealed to the Ministry of Defense to restore the fur caps as  part of the uniform for generals and colonels. There were also  countless requests regarding this from more junior officers.  Like the braid worn by generals, the fur caps serve as kind of  incentive. Young officers inherently yearn to acquire these  symbols of rank. That is precisely why the commission approved  them as part of the new uniform."    From problems pertaining to rear services, the journalists  moved on to purely military issues. Especially those that  concern armaments. Lt. Gen. Lev Hnatenko, chief of the Armaments  Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, held his own in a battle  of sorts.    Lyubov Yanyuk, the newspaper UKRAYINA MOLODA:    "If you please, a few words about the progress of nuclear  disarmament."    "We are adhering to the schedule for dismantling the nuclear  warheads that was agreed upon. Despite the fact that there is  some deviation on the part of Russia, which is not adhering to  the schedule for delivering heat-generating assemblies to  Ukrainian nuclear electric power stations. This issue is  currently being decided at the government level. It will be  settled in the very near future."    Marat Pohoryelov, Ukrainian Radio:    "What is our strategy for our own armaments? What will we do  when the weapons we have become obsolete?"    Lt. Gen. L. Hnatenko:    "I am not revealing any secrets when I tell you that it is  very expensive to manufacture weapons. No country, with the  exception of the former USSR and the U.S., makes its own weapons  from start to finish. The situation in the USSR was such that no  one republic could manufacture weapons independently. In other  words, Ukraine does not have a single assembly plant, although  approximately 25 percent of different components of various  weapons are manufactured here.    "We conducted a study of all types of weapons and assessed  the situation. This served as the basis for working out a state  program of weapons development up to the year 2000 and a  long-term program up to the year 2010.    "Right now we are trying to set up weapons production at a  maximum number of facilities. This question has been partially  resolved. The Ukrainian T-80 tank is being successfully produced  in Kharkiv, Ukrainian shipyards are building military ships; the  best military transport airplane, the AN-70, has been built in  Kiev; radar systems are being developed, as well as a Ukrainian  satellite, which will be launched very soon. But, as everywhere,  there are many problems.    "There is only one solution. In order to maintain the combat  readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we must modernize our  armaments by making use of the facilities of our repair  enterprises. Such projects exist, but their implementation will  depend on the availability of financing.    "So far, we have financed only 24.3 percent of the  scientific-research and research-design projects that need to be  done and and bought only 8.8 percent of the weapons and spare  parts that we require. We are trying to obtain the rest from  extrabudgetary sources--by selling old weaponry and equipment  that has done its job to the national economy. But this does not  bring in enough money to allow us to execute our plan."    The journalists were also interested in how things stand  with  the transfer of officers and warrant officers home from abroad.  Lt. Gen. Hryhoriy Dyachuk, chief of the Main Directorate for  Personnel [Cadres] of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, gave a  detailed answer:    "More than 26,000 officers and warrant officers have already  returned to Ukraine. This process is continuing. Earlier reports  put the figure of servicemen who want to return to Ukraine at  some 140,000. But this figure was inaccurate. According to the  data that I have, only another 10,000 officers and warrant  officers, who submitted requests for transfers, have not yet  returned.    "There is indeed a circumstance that complicates this  process. Under Article 2 of the Law of Ukraine `On Ukrainian  Citizenship,' we can avoid bureaucratic red tape in transferring  personnel who filed a request to serve in the Armed Forces of  Ukraine before 1 October 1992. Later, the Cabinet of Ministers  came to our assistance and extended this deadline to 1 October  1993. And now? The Supreme Council and the president have to  extend this deadline once again."    Unsurprisingly, among the questions that were of interest to  journalists was one concerning the construction of housing for  military personnel. Col. Gen. A. Lopata, the chief of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and first deputy  minister of defense, described how this problem is being solved.    Anatoliy Vasylyovych noted that this is probably the most  difficult problem facing the military. There are close to 80,000  military personnel without housing in our army. A shortage of  funds is making this problem difficult to solve. Earlier, 28,000  apartments were built every year; now only 20 percent of this  number is being built.    Col. Gen. Lopata stressed that 19.98 trillion karbovantsi  are  needed to carry out the housing construction program. The amount  appropriated for the Ministry of Defense is only 1.4 trillion,  or 17.2 percent of sum it needs.    Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko described how the Ministry of  Defense plans to solve this financial problem. He said that this  matter was discussed at a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister  Valeriy Shmarov. In addition, the minister of defense will  report on the state of financing in the Armed Forces and on  providing them with fuel and lubricants at a meeting of the  Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers on 18 April. Also, General  of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy has made a request for  interest-free credit to pay off debts. This credit will be  granted soon.    The journalists were also interested in military education,  its future and its problems. Maj. Gen. Viktor Hudym gave the  attending journalists a relatively detailed report:    "On the whole, the system of military education created in  Ukraine is progressive. It is designed to provide the Armed  Forces with officer cadres, but many mistakes were made when it  was set up.    "Taking into account my own concept of military education, I  believe that we should not have copied the system in existence  in Western countries, including in the United States. The  standard of officer training in the former Soviet Union was  high--a fact that even Western experts acknowledge. All that  needed to be done was to incorporate in it the latest  attainments in the field of science and to assure that the  diplomas were convertible. Instead, the creation of a new  system, the creation of new educational institutions within its  framework and the elimination of existing schools resulted in  the loss of valuable professorial and teaching personnel and the  destruction of the invaluable material and technical base of  many higher educational institutions.    "Decisions were made without proper justification to  dismantle costly permanently installed equipment and to move it  to other locations. Some of this equipment never reached its new  destination. Not all of the equipment that did arrive has been  put into working order.    "Schools that we still need today were closed. Thus, the  only  general military school, which was located in Kiev, was closed.  In Odessa, they began training specialists for the Land Forces  without sufficient preparation. A decision was made to close the  Zhytomyr Higher Radar School of the Air Defense Forces--the only  such school in the former Soviet Union, which trained  specialists for the space forces. But no provision has been made  for training these specialists elsewhere. The Kharkiv Higher  Command Tank School was eliminated. The training of these  specialists has been assigned to the Kiev Tank and Technical  School, which used to train deputy weapons commanders and not  commanders of tank platoons. This school lacks the proper field  training base and many other things that Kharkiv had. Now the  Kharkiv base has been handed over to the National Guard, the  border troops, and others. Meanwhile, we are already feeling an  acute need of commanders of tank subunits.    "In addition, the change to a six-year course of study means  that there will be no officers graduating in some specialties in  1997 and 1998. Particularly, those in specialties that were not  previously trained by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.    "It is necessary to amend certain government decisions,  revoke the corresponding decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, and  solve other problems jointly with the Main Directorate for  Personnel.    "We have no facilities at which to train psychologists,  professors, and instructors. A decision was adopted to establish  the Institute for the umanities in Kiev. In principle, this  institution has already been created. What still needs to be  decided is the question of site and material base.    "The next question that must be resolved immediately is how  to disburden the Odessa and Kiev land forces institutes. The  meeting of the Military College of the Ministry of Defense on 22  April will be devoted to the problems of military education. I  believe that most important issues will be settled at this  meeting."    ...The meeting came to an end, but the journalists still had  many questions in their notebooks. Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata  assured us that we would get answers to these questions in  future briefings. And there will be plenty of them inasmuch as  such meetings are very productive both for the journalists and  for the military.</p>

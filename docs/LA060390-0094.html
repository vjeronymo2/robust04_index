			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSATIONS AGAINST GLENDORA'S MAYOR  </P> <P> We believe a crime has been committed in Glendora but it was not our mayor, Bob  Kuhn, who committed it.  </P> <P> In our opinion, the crime that was committed was the false accusations against  Bob Kuhn by one citizen in Glendora (Times, May 17). Because of the false  accusations of this one citizen, Bob's name and reputation, which he has built  over the last 25 years, was tarnished.  </P> <P> Those of us who know Bob know that he would never do anything to jeopardize his  reputation or his name.  </P> <P> We hope that the person who was responsible for this fiasco realizes how  foolish they look. No wonder they want to remain anonymous.  </P> <P> JUDI and JERRY ROBINSON  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / French unemployment hits 12% French unemployment increased sharply in October, rising to 12 per cent of the workforce from 11.8 per cent at the end of September, higher than most economists expected. The number of unemployed rose by 40,300 to 3.28m, the labour ministry announced yesterday. The figure represents a blow to the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which has committed itself to curbing unemployment. It raised fears that the number of unemployed will continue to rise steadily through the first few months of next year. The statistics for October revealed a significant increase in the rate of youth unemployment. The number of jobless men under the age of 25 rose by 2.9 per cent between the end of September and the end of October, compared with an average increase of 1.2 per cent in the number seeking work. A spokesman for the economy ministry said that the government had taken several steps to limit the rise in joblessness, including an increase in funding for training schemes and apprenticeships and support for more flexible employment patterns. He said that the French economy was showing some encouraging signs, including a strong rise in consumer spending in the third quarter of the year and improved confidence among industrialists this month, according to a survey released on Monday by Insee, the national statistics office. Private sector economists said that the French economy had shown some improvement since the sharp downturn in activity at the end of last year. 'The economy appears to have stabilised,' said Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at Morgan Guaranty in Paris. 'But unemployment is a lagging indicator and is likely to keep rising, if at a slower rate,' he said. Bond prices strengthened slightly and the French franc slipped against the D-Mark as some traders predicted an increase in pressure for interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. But several economists warned against hopes of a rapid reduction in borrowing costs. 'Rate cuts are still decided in Germany,' said Mr O'Brien, referring to the French strategy of following German interest rates lower.</p>

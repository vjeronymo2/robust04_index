This is the priority  target for Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace, which wants to  eventually reach diamond-rich Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul  Provinces.    In the latest fighting, the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-Labor Party, forces lost  one BM-21 rocket launcher and one TMM mobile bridge, suffered  101 soldiers confirmed killed on the ground, 160 soldiers who  surrendered, and 30 soldiers who were captured.

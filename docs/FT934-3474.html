			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (8): Disposals lift turnaround prospects - Case study, relaunched EuroDollar is number five in the world In August, Mr Freddie Aldous finally bought the business he set up 20 years ago. Mr Aldous, EuroDollar's 64-year-old chairman, led an 11-strong management buy-out team, backed by Prudential Venture Managers, which acquired the vehicle rental business from TSB. He had set up the Swan National car-hire business in January 1973 for his employer, UDT Industries, the credit finance company which was acquired by TSB in 1981. Swan National was relaunched in 1989 as EuroDollar, to reflect the company's growing international strategy, and now ranks as the fifth largest vehicle rental company in the world. The sale was the latest in a string of disposals by TSB, reflecting its decision to concentrate on its core retail banking business. In July, TSB sold Swan National Leasing, its vehicle contract hire business, to Forward Trust, the leasing arm of Midland Bank for Pounds 182.5m, and the Swan National car dealerships to Lex Services for Pounds 44m In the case of EuroDollar, Prudential Venture Managers, the arm of the Prudential which invests in unquoted companies, had been introduced to the deal early this year by the corporate finance division of Touche Ross, which was advising EuroDollar's management. 'We were competing against two other groups,' said Mr Martin Clarke, a director of Prudential Venture managers which won the mandate in April after putting forward a proposal under which EuroDollar's management would retain a 40 per cent equity stake in the company. Mr Clarke and the Prudential Venture Managers team spent the period between April and August in protracted negotiations with TSB which was advised by SG Warburg. 'We had a willing vendor, but what they were most concerned to do was to get the deal and the price right,' explains Mr Clarke. The complexity stemmed from the fact that, on paper at least, EuroDollar was not a particularly attractive purchase. In its last half-year to March 31 1993, EuroDollar incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.9m, the result of a deterioration in trading conditions in foreign subsidiaries in Italy and France, part of the EuroDollar network in 27 countries, operating over 40,000 vehicles. However the core EuroDollar UK business, which has 10 per cent of the UK market and is the largest provider of rental cars to the corporate sector in the UK, had continued to trade extremely profitably. Business clients account for more than 70 per cent of its turnover, and it has a fleet of 12,000 cars and 1,000 vans, operated from some 106 branches across Britain. Under the terms of the Pounds 118m buy-out deal, TSB received sale proceeds of Pounds 59.9m, comprising cash of Pounds 22m for the net assets of EuroDollar which amounted to Pounds 20.4m on March 31, and Pounds 37.9m in respect of inter-company debt. The balance of Pounds 58.1m was used to repay existing company's debts. Financing facilities totalling Pounds 192m were negotiated and arranged by Prudential Venture Managers, which holds a 20 per cent equity stake. The other equity investors, sharing a 40 per cent stake, were Charterhouse Development Capital, Electra Private Equity Partners and Morgan Grenfell Development Capital. Both Mr Clarke, of Prudential Venture Managers, and Mr Norman Murray, deputy chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, have joined the EuroDollar board. In addition to the Pounds 61m in equity, which was used to finance the acquisition, provide working capital and discharge the borrowings of the foreign subsidiaries, Lombard North Central, Forward Trust, UDT and Gmac (General Motors Acceptance Corporation) provided Pounds 100m of leasing finance, and the National Westminster group provided Pounds 31m of bridging loan finance, mainly to acquire vehicles from TSB which are being sold and exchanged for leased vehicles enabling the bridging loan to be repaid. As Mr Clarke notes, one particularly striking feature of the deal, which was the biggest management buy-out in the 1993 third quarter, is that the company has been unencumbered with conventional term debt from the outset. Since the buy-out, the company has moved quickly to restructure its overseas operations and has already sold both of its loss-making subsidiaries in France an Italy. The new board is understood to have been particularly keen to sell the Italian business, which it had thought might have to be closed - at considerable expense and perhaps delay. In the event, Mr Clarke says EuroDollar has made a cash contribution to the new owner's rationalisation costs. As a result, EuroDollar's turnaround prospects have been strengthened, and an early market debut, perhaps within 12 to 24 months, seems likely. EuroDollar's price tag could yet end up looking like a bargain.</p>

During the meeting, Secretary Xie Fei primarily briefed his  guests on Guangdong's plan for expanding opening up in 1994. He  said: One of the important tasks facing Guangdong Province in  1994 is to continually expand opening up to the outside world.  In 1993, Guangdong Province absorbed a total of $9.65 billion  in foreign funds, accounting for one third of the total amount  of foreign funds absorbed by the province over the past decade  or so ever since reform and opening up.    Secretary Xie Fei stated: In the years ahead, Guangdong will  try to annually absorb at least $10 billion in foreign funds and  will strive to create favorable conditions as well as a  favorable environment for foreign investors. Secretary Xie Fei  concluded: Guangdong represents a huge investment market. I  sincerely hope that all consul generals who are present here  today will contribute more to our bilateral economic cooperation  in 1994.</p>

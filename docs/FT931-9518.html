			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Cotswolds roll over the Rockies MR BILL Kuhn is due to arrive from Denver, Colorado at Heathrow this morning to pick up the keys to his Cotswold cottage. He has just bought a two-bedroom 16th-century cottage with a guest cottage attached in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, for Pounds 148,000. He says it cost 35 per cent less than last April when it first went on the market. Mr Kuhn, a management consultant, said the high cost of internal flights in the US had influenced his decision to buy in Britain. 'We can get there as cheaply and spend no more money than someone would having a piece of mountain property right here.' 'Air fares from the States to Europe are very favourable. We are paying Dollars 478 (Pounds 337) per person for the round trip. A week ago I went from Denver to Phoenix for Dollars 680 and that is a 1 1/2 -hour plane ride.' He and his wife Sandie had been looking at English properties for about two years. 'Then we came across in November and were amazed at the prices.' Mr Kuhn said friends in Denver had not realised the extent of bargains in the UK because of falling property prices and the exchange rate. 'In Denver a lot of people have a condominium in Vale or Aspen. We would just as soon have a second home in England. We plan to spend about three to four months in the year over there (in the UK) in time.'</p>

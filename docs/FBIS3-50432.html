Wise principles tell us: "When a society is in order, a  single fool cannot alter it." Nevertheless, "when a society is  in chaos, a sole wise man cannot order it." The latter is our  reality. The country is becoming more chaotic every day, and,  in 1994, we cannot and should not continue to think that the  solution to our problems lies exclusively in the hands of the  government or in the head of one of the many political, union,  or guild leaders.    We have to start being responsible and start accepting the  fact that the way out of this chaos has to be reached by each  and every Nicaraguan who lives, dreams, and struggles in this  small country of lakes and volcanoes.    We must nourish our faith, and we must hope for a better  future for the people of Nicaragua. We have to respect one  another and listen to what we are saying, and we need to look  for the positive aspects in each other's words. We have to  foster trust and not see ourselves as enemies, let alone allow  ourselves to treat one another as enemies. We have to make a  real and deliberate effort to achieve reconciliation with deeds  rather than with words. It is true that our country is small,  but it has resources and riches which, if rationally exploited  and justly distributed, will bring wellbeing to all Nicaraguans.    To promote the citizens' trust and faith, the government  must  listen to the demands made by the different sectors in  Nicaragua, and it must comply with the commitments it has made  and still has not kept. The government must be the first to  respect the Constitution and the laws to strengthen the state of  law.    The government must realize that we live in a period of  transition and that it has the duty of advancing joint  decisions, especially those related to economic policies when  they refer to negotiations with international organizations.    UNO [National Opposition Union] politicians and Cosep  [Higher  Council of Private Enterprise] members: We must find a solution.  The boards of the UNO political parties and producers guilds,  such as Cosep, must take into account that we must all find a  way out of the crisis. This requires a great deal of maturity,  flexibility, and understanding. We have to understand that the  search for solutions to the crisis should benefit everyone.    There is a great distance between preaching and practicing  democracy -- a distance as great as the one between heaven and  hell. The challenge confronting all Nicaraguans is that we have  to make tangible the democracy we have been preaching since last  century. To this end, it is imperative that we conduct a true  national dialogue. In turn, the Sandinists today are issuing an  open invitation to a national dialogue, because we are convinced  that this is the only way to find solutions to our problems in  the areas of jobs, housing, health, food, and education, and  that such a dialogue can lead to economic stability and peace.    In the month of January 1994, we call UNO leaders to have  all  their deputies join the National Assembly, which will abide by  the Constitution and will promulgate laws to favor the people,  workers, and producers.    Elections will be held in the north and south Atlantic  autonomous regions in February 1994. The Sandinists have faith  that this event will strengthen our country's democracy. We  have promised to support and promote the candidacies of regional  leaders and hope the Atlantic region residents will decide to  vote in a favorable manner and demand that the elected  candidates be honest and efficient in their administrative  efforts.    The year 1994 is the 15th anniversary of the victory of the  revolution; it is the year of the 60th anniversary of the murder  of Sandino; and it is the year of the special FSLN Congress.    Sandinists must take bold initiatives to strengthen  democracy  within our organization. We are obliged to act with a broad  mandate to add members, affiliates, and followers to the process  of debating the modernization of the FSLN program and bylaws.    Sandinists have the moral commitment to unite and gather  around principles, programs, and bylaws that will make our  organization a democratic and disciplined front committed to the  causes and ideals of Sandino. This demands that we rescue the  zeal of Sandino's small peasant army, of the FSLN guerrilla  detachments, and of the thousands of brothers who gave their  lives for the freedom of our fatherland in combat against the  Somozist dictatorship and in the heroic resistance of the people  against imperialist aggression. This means that we must again  take up the zeal of the teachers, coffee reapers, and thousands  of brothers who have been present in all the tasks that the  fatherland has demanded for its defense.    In this way we will guarantee a renewed and modern FSLN,  which without losing its grass-roots support, will be the hope  of the impoverished majority, as well as be the best alternative  to achieve peace, prosperity, and democracy for all the  Nicaraguans.    Nicaraguan brothers: Receive the FSLN's and its National  Directorate's affectionate salutations and our best wishes that  1994 be the year in which we will all contribute to the  stability of our fatherland.    [Issued] Managua, 31 December 1993</p>

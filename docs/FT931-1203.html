			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (3): From rag-trade to riches - Hard work and long hours make profits for the garment trade THE NewAge Enterprise factory in Dhaka is clean and well-ventilated, making it untypical of the 30 to 50 garment-making premises which open every month in Bangladesh. But its success is typical of a sector so lucrative that some professors at Dhaka university have opened their own factories, a rare instance of academics practising what they preach. Retired generals and civil servants have found second careers in garments. The garments industry runs against the grain of Bangladesh's manufacturing industry. It makes money; it is non-unionised; there is no government interference; and it has a large and growing share of markets in Europe and the US; and, by employing largely women, it has redefined the 'purdah culture' in a conservative Moslem country. Most of the new factories are in back streets, with poor lighting and ventilation making for a long and unrewarding day. These are operated by 'get rich' entrepreneurs attracted by the prospect of having a plant up and running within four months. Typically, an investor can set up a medium-size factory employing about 500 women with just Dollars 200,000 and generate turnover of Dollars 2m within 12 months. There are 1,425 garment factories in Bangladesh, which last year earned Dollars 1.5bn in exports, up by 48 per cent on the previous year. Garments have grown from zero a decade ago to be the largest export earning sector. By quantity, Bangladesh is the seventh biggest garment exporter to the US and the 10th largest exporter to the EC. Its importance to the domestic economy is twofold. It is the only sector earning sizeable foreign exchange. And it employs some 738,000 people, of whom 85 per cent are women. Most women previously worked as housemaids or were unemployed. According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers &amp; Exporters Association, in 40 per cent of households where a wife is working in garments, she is the main income earner. 'We have helped create a new and strong consumer spending group,' says Mohammed Mosharraf Hossain, president of the association. Some 1.5m square metres of property have been redeveloped for use as garment factories, while some 80 per cent of commercial road traffic between Dhaka and Chittagong, the main port, carries goods for the garment trade. Two government policy decisions set the industry on its feet and continue to help significantly: the introduction of back-to-back letters of credit (LCs), and the creation of bonded warehouses. 'With back-to-back LCs we do not have to turn to banks. It means, in effect, that our suppliers finance us through the issue of LCs, while bonded warehouses allow us to import materials free of duty if for export purposes,' says Mr Abu Sayeed Quasem, chairman of NewAge Enterprise. 'We import about 75 per cent of textiles for our garments so these two factors are very important,' he adds. The value added is mostly in the form of buttons, cartons, and thread; 80 per cent of these accessories are now met locally. The next target is to increase the local value-added content by setting up textile plants in Bangladesh to serve garments factories. Some in the garment sector doubt whether local textile companies could meet the high quality standards demanded by western importers of Bangladeshi garments. In addition, the investment required is substantial - at least Dollars 30m to set up a 'composite plant' encompassing garment and textile operations. Even installing finishing and dyeing facilities would require between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m. Bangladesh's appalling industrial relations record is also a further handicap. Labour is cheap, but, when the cost of the endless one-day strikes and hartals (general strikes) is taken into account, local labour loses its comparative advantage. The industry's growth could also be impeded by the failure of the Gatt to conclude the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks. Bangladesh is already restricted by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which allows signatories to protect domestic industries by limiting through bilateral deals the volume of exports from mostly Third World economies. Under any new Gatt regime MFA quotas would be phased out over a 10-year period. A successful outcome to the Gatt talks is vital for a less developed and trade-dependent economy such as Bangladesh.</p>

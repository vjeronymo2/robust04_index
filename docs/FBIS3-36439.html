			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy head of the </F> Russian counterintelligence service, by corrrespondent Yevgeniy  Kiselev, with introductory remarks by Kiselev and Oleg Lobov,  secretary of the Russian Security Council; place and date not  given; from the "Itogi" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] A commission for  appraising the top-ranking officers of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, led by Oleg Lobov, secretary of the  Russian Security Council, started work on 26 January. The  commission's task is to decide which of the leading officers of  the former security ministry will continue to occupy the top  command posts in the new Russian intelligence service. Among  the members of the commission are Yuriy Baturin, the president's  aide on national security issues; Valeriy Rubanov, deputy  chairman of the Security Council, who took an active part in the  previous attempt to reorganize the KGB in 1991; and Sergey  Kovalev, the chairman of the human rights commission under the  Russian president, a prisoner of conscience in the past and a  severe critic of security bodies.    [Lobov] I think that such a composition of the commission  makes it possible to draft adequate suggestions on the  candidates for the top command posts of the counterintelligence  service, to be endorsed by the president. Some 200 to 250  people will be appraised.    [Kiselev] Those are senior officers?    [Lobov] Yes, certainly, those to be appointed by a  presidential order or decree. I think those who are unsure of  their position or who are opposed to reform will leave of their  own accord -- some of them have already left. The people who  stayed are eager to work.    [Kiselev, over video of KGB building in Lubyanka] The  notorious building in Lubyanka Square where we went for a  comprehensive interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy head  of the Russian counterintelligence service, has always been a  symbol of the VChK, OGPU, NKVD, KGB and finally the former  Russian Ministry of Security to the Soviet people. However, we  found out to our surprise that the headquarters of the service  has recently moved to another building, also in this area.    [Stepashin] You see, the heads of the KGB and later of the  Security Ministry have been working in this building since the  late 1980s. As for the building you have mentioned, most of it  is currently occupied by the directorate for the border troops.  Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev [commander of the border troops] and  I have agreed that the central entrance, which is always shown  on TV, the one with the state emblem above it, will have a large  board saying Border Troops of the Russian Federation. So the  people who were so annoyed by this building and this service  should feel gratified.    [Kiselev] So, border troops have departed from the Security  Ministry. Which parts of the former Security Ministry have then  remained within the structure of the federal counterintelligence  service?    [Stepashin] The counterintelligence itself has remained.  Therefore, its three main operational directorates will be  involved purely in counterintelligence work. This will include  practical measures [operativnyye meropriyatiya], economic  counterintelligence, and the protection of important state  installations. In addition to this, our directorate for  combatting terrorism will also be active.    [Kiselev] What about the executive apparatus? Have you  inherited all of it from the outgoing Security Ministry?    [Stepashin] Naturally. What is more, I do not see anything  wrong in it. It stopped being the KGB long ago -- you know how  many changes it has gone through since 1991. Many people left  at that time -- it is another question whether they were the  worst or the best. So, today, the majority of people who have  come to work at the Security Ministry will certainly stay.  People who work here must first and foremost be professionals,  and they must also believe in the unwritten dictum "to serve our  country, our fatherland, and our state" -- these are the words  of the president.    [Kiselev] Yes, there is an opinion that the strength of all  special services is that they are loyal to the existing  authorities on the one hand and indifferent to the political  orientation of that power on the other.    [Stepashin] This is certainly so.    [Kiselev] But are you sure, Sergey Vadimovich, that the  majority of the staff of the federal counterintelligence  service, who worked in the Security Ministry in the past and  before that in the Soviet KGB, is quite neutral politically and  quite indifferent to the political orientation of the country's  leadership?    [Stepashin] As individuals, as citizens -- of course not. It  should not and cannot be like that, especially in such a  politicized country as ours. This is natural and I think normal  -- after all, they are living people. As for carrying out their  professional duties, their military duty if you like -- because  we are all military...    [Kiselev, interrupting] What is your rank, by the way?    [Stepashin] Lieutenant General. As regards that, I think  the answer is yes. Moreover, a number of our employees -- I  will not name them -- including two generals for whom I have  great respect, simply handed in their resignations after the  decree of 21 December saying that they had to leave under the  present circumstances. They acted honestly. We are almost  halving our numbers, but we are not reducing the numbers of the  operational counterintelligence units.    [Kiselev] But as for external surveillance services and  services that may tap telephones if necessary, do they remain?    [Stepashin] Well...    [Kiselev, interrupting] I know this is a painful question.    [Stepashin] Painful, why? This is quite a normal question.  A counterintelligence service without operational and technical  underpinning does not make any sense. So, we are going to keep  all these.    [Kiselev] Are you also going to keep your system of agents,  as well as recruit new agents?    [Stepashin] Most certainly. Agents form the foundation of  the entire work of a special service. It is another matter that  recruiting methods have been changed, are changing considerably  at the moment. To tell you the truth, in the past, blackmail  was sometimes used as a recruitment technique, so that when a  person saw he had no other way out -- he failed to get promotion  at work, could not go abroad, could not obtain a PhD, could not  become an academician -- I am speaking in general terms...  [pauses] Now, today such methods are completely ruled out.    [Kiselev] What about people recruited as agents in the past?  I know the word agent was often avoided then, it was not much  liked and some called them assistants or some other names...    [Stepashin, interrupting] Yes, the secret apparatus...    [Kiselev, interrupting] The secret apparatus, that is right.  And now this argument has been going on for several years. Some  say: let us identify those who collaborated with the KGB in the  past, while others say this should not be done by any means.    [Stepashin] We shall do all we can to prevent this  happening.  First of all, I have already told you that all special services  in the world employ agents -- all of them, regardless of whether  the state is democratic, antidemocratic, communist, and so on.  This is the first point. The second is that we have no right  to break the promises given to those people. We can simply ruin  their lives, and those who demand it should think about this if  they really consider themselves humane people and defenders of  human rights. And the third point is that there are some laws  that have not yet been abolished by anyone and that not only  protect the secret agents but call to account those who attempt  to declassify this secret network. Therefore, I think this  should certainly not be done.    [Kiselev] But coming back to your principal function, the  counterintelligence service: counterintelligence means first of  all, if I understand it correctly, fighting foreign intelligence  services, that is, counteracting intelligence activities of  other states on the territory of Russia. How active is this  work now? It was mentioned at a news conference that foreign  secret services had attempted recruiting some of the most  high-ranking state and government officials and that such  incidents had even been reported personally to the president of  Russia. Could you talk about this in more detail?    [Stepashin] Well, I would not like to talk about this in  more  detail. Such attempts have been made, are being made, and will  continue to be made. And you know, it applies not only to our  state officials but to rank-and-file citizens as well. They  simply are not aware that such recruiting attempts are being  made. This is the first point. Second, we are really seriously  concerned about a leakage of nuclear, military, and other  technologies, which today is quite considerable, and about  attempts to recruit our scientists and experts. We have  information about many incidents of this kind. These are only a  few facts that show that foreign secret services are  intensifying their activities in the Russian Federation.    [Kiselev] What about a situation when, for instance,  reports appear in the press that the Dutch company GMM financed  Zhirinovskiy's electoral campaign? Is it part of the  responsibilities of the federal counterintelligence service to  verify reports of this type?    [Stepashin] If we look at it from the point of view of our  charter and our direct functions, then no. Moreover, you will  recall that when President Yeltsin signed the decree of 21  December [on restructuring the Russian security services], he  said at a news conference before the New Year that he had  abolished political investigations and everything they are based  on. But political investigation in its literal meaning is  activity of special services directed against opposition parties.    [Kiselev] Right. How can you draw a line between gathering  information about organizations that might potentially become  extremist or begin to threaten citizens' safety, the security of  the state and society, on the one hand, and political  investigation on the other?    [Stepashin] This is a very subtle matter. Everything should  be known, but our service will not be involved in active  measures or operations against opposition parties, movements,  and organizations.    [Kiselev] But it will collect information?    [Stepashin] Well, not quite collect information -- or  perhaps  yes, collect information. When this party or organization turns  up here, weapons in hand, and takes over power -- then it will  be too late. We must be aware of this and must prevent this.  For this, protective measures must be taken. We must obtain  information -- including information from the parliament, the  government, and the president. So, I agree with you on this  point. Incidentally, 10 days before the final election results  were published, we conducted our own poll in five regions, and  we predicted Zhirinovskiy's victory with 23 percent, falling  short of the actual result by just 1 percent.    [Kiselev] Did you make this information known to the higher  authorities -- the president and the government?    [Stepashin] I do not know if it reached the president, but  we  did send memos to the leadership with regard to this matter.    [Kiselev] At the moment, there is a lot of talk and surmises  about a new upsurge in the activity of the extreme opposition  and that there allegedly exists an armed underground opposition  movement. They say some people went underground after 3-4  October and that they are armed. How close to reality are these  reports?    [Stepashin] What is real is that unless the promise publicly  given to the people by the prime minister, the government, and  the president to stabilize the political situation, to provide a  normal civilized standard of living for our people is  fulfilled...[pauses] increasing [opposition] activity is  certainly a real fact. As for armed formations and other  attempts to discover an enemy in the army or here, the  information we have -- and I assure you that we do have serious  information -- indicates that such things and processes do not  exist.    [Kiselev] Well, thank you very much, Sergey Vadimirovich, my  list of questions seems to be exhausted.</p>

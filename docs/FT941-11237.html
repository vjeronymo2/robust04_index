			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Kantor hopeful after Tokyo talks Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday ended his special mission in Tokyo, leaving with a promise by the Japanese government to redouble efforts to resolve the deadlocked trade negotiations. In a statement issued on his departure from Tokyo, Mr Kantor predicted that the negotiations on ways of increasing foreign access to Japan's markets would be successfully concluded on February 11, during a summit between Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, and President Bill Clinton. Summing up the fruits of his visit, Mr Kantor said the prime minister, Mr Hosokawa, who met Mr Kantor on Thursday, has directed the government to redouble its efforts on the talks and that Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, would lead the negotiations. Mr Kantor said Japan would send a high level delegation to Washington on Monday to continue trade talks, including the negotiation of 'objective criteria' to measure import penetration of specific sectors. Numerous US-Japanese trade agreements have failed to reduce the massive Japanese trade surplus, which last year hit about Dollars 59bn (Pounds 39.3bn) with the US. This time Washington is insisting that agreements include 'benchmarks' to evaluate progress in achieving openings in insurance, cars and car parts, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Mr Kantor is also demanding that Japan eliminate all tariffs on copper, wood and white spirits. US officials in Washington have been pessimistic about the talks. Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US commerce undersecretary, Thursday said the two sides 'do not seem to have even a common understanding of the problem, let alone consensus on the solutions'. However, Mr Kantor said Tokyo had agreed to negotiate 'qualitative and quantitative' criteria to measure the progress of sectoral agreements in opening markets.</p>

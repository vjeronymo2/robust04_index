"At last, it has learned to offer due resistance to  Armenian offensives," he pointed out.    Sadykhov said that all Armenian attempts to launch an  offensive over the last months "have been successfully repelled."    The state advisor indicated two reasons for Azerbaijan's  military successes for the last month and a half. Firstly, the  Azerbaijani armed forces have stood up on their own feet,  surmounting obstacles, gaining strength, raising combat  readiness, and forming various units.    Secondly, the Azerbaijani army got a second wind after  Geydar  Aliyev's election as president and his appeal to the people last  November. "Then, all people recovered their self-confidence,  many deserters started to return to their units, and the army  became better equipped with hardware," the state advisor said.    As a result, the situation along the front line has  gradually  stabilized. An avalanche-like Armenian offensive was stopped,  and a possibility to start "clearing Azerbaijan's territory from  occupants" appeared. Sadykhov said "we had managed to free  certain parts of the occupied territories."    At the same time, the official admitted that the republican  army's current state could hardly be characterized as "high  combat readiness." He said Azerbaijan desperately lacked  military experts.    Sadykhov added that "last autumn's army draft plan was over-  fulfilled." He pointed out that people started to ask to be  sent to the army, to the front line, after the president's  appeal."</p>

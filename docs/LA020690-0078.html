			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW GERMANY NEED NOT BE IN NATO, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said Monday that a new, united German state would not  have to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but rather need  only maintain "ties" to the alliance.  </P> <P> The shift in U.S. policy is the latest and most significant in a hectic series  of revisions as Administration policy-makers run to keep up with the rapidly  changing European situation. If it becomes reality, the new position on Germany  would substantially reshape the Western alliance.  </P> <P> Currently, under the NATO treaty, West Germany is the location of the bulk of  the alliance's front-line troops. The West Germans themselves contribute a  340,000-member army to NATO's forces.  </P> <P> Until now, U.S. policy toward German unification has been guided by four  principles: self-determination, alliance with NATO, gradual change and  reaffirmation of Germany's eastern borders. Those principles were announced by  Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III after Bush's summit with Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Malta. Now, said a senior White House  official, "Forget about the four points. Events are just moving too fast.  </P> <P> "We're starting to shift to face reality," the official added.  </P> <P> The new reality is that the U.S. government, after resisting for years, now  would be willing to accept German neutrality, at least in the sense of Germany  no longer being part of a formal military alliance, so long as the Germans  remain oriented toward the West in their political and economic system.  </P> <P> "We would prefer Germany to stay in the NATO alliance," the official said, "but  it's going to have to be the decision of a united German government" after a  new single state is formed. Should the new government choose to quit the formal  alliance structure -- an idea that has been advocated by some leading German  politicians -- the United States would accept a looser sort of link.  </P> <P> Neither government officials nor outside experts could say what exactly the  Administration means by saying that Germany would be aligned with the alliance  but not necessarily in it.  </P> <P> "Confusion reigns," William J. Taylor of the Center for Strategic and  International Studies here declared. With events moving so rapidly, he said,  "anybody would be confused right now."  </P> <P> The shift in U.S. policy trickled out to the public in an unusually convoluted  manner Monday. At the daily White House briefing, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater  was asked a question that called on him to restate what had been firm U.S.  policy -- that any future German state would have to remain in NATO.  </P> <P> Instead of the standard answer, Fitzwater demurred. The potential status of  Germany, he said, is "under discussion."  </P> <P> "If you want further definition," he added, "there is none."  </P> <P> At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler was prepared with a  similarly ambiguous statement to read in case reporters asked her about  Germany's future during the department's daily press briefing. No one asked.  </P> <P> "We are pleased that the West German government has spoken about the importance  of maintaining ties to NATO," the statement said. "We agree that these ties  should not involve a threat to the security in Europe but rather maintain  security in Europe."  </P> <P> The statement, officials said, was personally drafted by Baker after he met  Friday with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.  </P> <P> The Administration already accepts a form of neutrality for part of Germany. On  Monday, the State Department, in a prepared statement, announced the United  States now agrees that after reunification, NATO would not extend its area of  operations east into what is now East Germany. Genscher had put forward that  idea last week, but Baker had declined to comment directly on it after his  meeting with the West German official Friday.  </P> <P> Genscher's policy could effectively leave eastern Germany without foreign  troops. Although the Administration has proposed that the United States and the  Soviets be allowed to keep 195,000 troops each in Central Europe, officials and  non-government experts consider it inevitable that the Soviets will choose to  pull their troops out, instead.  </P> <P> With the Soviets likely to withdraw from Poland and Czechoslovakia, where  demands for them to leave are continuing, any Soviet troops left in Germany  would be so vulnerable as to be militarily useless, experts say.  </P> <P> How many troops the United States might leave in Europe continues to be a  subject of considerable debate. The Administration on Monday reaffirmed its  number of 195,000, but Congress and many former defense officials have  suggested a far lower number would be adequate if the current trends in the  Soviet Union continue.  </P> <P> In the past, any suggestion of German neutrality set off major alarm bells in  Washington. Now, however, "the definition of what we mean by security is  changing," said Robert Hunter, who headed the National Security Council's  European division during the Carter Administration. "For the world that seems  to be emerging, if you hadn't invented NATO, you wouldn't need it."  </P> <P> Allied opinion may not be as sanguine. The British government, in particular,  has been strenuous in insisting on continued NATO ties for Germany. On Monday  night, a Foreign Office spokesman in London declined direct comment on the  latest American position.  </P> <P> The European Community in December adopted a policy statement emphasizing that  "existing treaties and commitments have to be honored," the official noted.  "Nothing anyone says anywhere else can change this feeling in Europe."  </P> <P> Staff writers Norman Kempster, in Washington, and Tyler Marshall, in London,  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

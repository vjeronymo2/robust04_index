			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: SLY GUITAR FROM RAITT, COODER, LINDLEY AT BENEFIT  </P> <P> The rare pairing of sly git-tar whizzards Ry Cooder and David Lindley provided  the highlights, caustic comic Bob Goldthwait provided the punch lines and  red-haired bluesrocker Bonnie Raitt provided the headliner at the benefit  concert for the California Environmental Protection Initiative that sold out  the Santa Monica Civic on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Raitt (a pretty fair sly guitarist herself) and her band breezed through a  solid set of old, new, borrowed and blues tunes and the "Bobcat" spewed a blue  brew of today's political and pop-music stew, but it was the near-telepathic,  multi-ethnic, musicological, multi-instrumental, ego-free playing of Cooder and  Lindley that simply shot out the lights. Cajun, gospel, country, blues, cars,  sex, humor, politricks, virtuosity. This one should have been a live album. DON  WALLER  </P></p>

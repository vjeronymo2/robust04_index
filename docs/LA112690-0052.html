			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUADRIPLEGIC FINDS HIS DESIRE TO WORK MAY BE A HINDRANCE  </P> <P> Steven Berry is a man who wants to work.  </P> <P> In a nation with a deeply imbued work ethic, that should be an admirable  aspiration. But in Berry's case, it has proved to be a hindrance.  </P> <P> Berry, 40, is a quadriplegic who must use a wheelchair. With the help of Social  Security Supplemental Security Income benefits, he was able to earn a Ph.D. in  comparative literature from UCLA in 1986. With his degree in hand, he felt he  would soon be able to support himself and went off the SSI rolls.  </P> <P> Instead, he found his field to have few openings, and he has been looking for a  full-time job for four years.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Berry's parents were able to supplement the money he earned as an  occasional consultant for the RAND Corp. to help pay his expenses, which  include a $200-a-month personal attendant. But Berry's father is now retired  and no longer able to provide him with financial support.  </P> <P> So in May, Berry applied for SSI benefits again so that he could continue to  live independently while searching for a full-time job.  </P> <P> Berry, who was considered disabled while he attended school, is still awaiting  a final determination on whether he is now disabled according to government  criteria.  </P> <P> It seems that the consultant work he has performed at RAND may have affected  his eligibility for SSI benefits.  </P> <P> People who work with disabled people say Berry's dilemma is not uncommon.  </P> <P> "It's basically an all-or-nothing proposition for disabled people who are  already working," said Douglas Martin, chairman of the National Council on  Independent Living and a special assistant to UCLA Chancellor Charles Young.  "If he stops working, he can get on all these programs for the rest of his  life."  </P> <P> According to Martin, Berry would have been better off if he had never gone off  SSI.  </P> <P> But in the case of someone such as Berry -- applying for benefits while working  -- he must reduce his income to $500 per month to qualify for benefits, even if  his monthly expenses exceed that amount.  </P> <P> Social Security spokesman Virgil Kocher could not comment specifically on  Berry's case, but he confirmed that the government had a strict definition of  disability. SSI benefits will be granted to a person only if the disability is  so severe that the person cannot work.  </P> <P> In addition, someone who receives benefits cannot possess resources or assets  in excess of $2,000. Any money received from another source is subtracted from  the standard SSI payment of $630 per month. Half of any income earned from work  is subtracted from the entitlement. Last year, Berry earned about $650 from  RAND. This year, he earned $394.  </P> <P> Finding a job at a university or a community college would solve Berry's  problems. But despite being called for numerous interviews, he has not yet  received an offer.  </P> <P> Berry is not optimistic that the Social Security system can make a reasonable  assessment of what he needs to live independently.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that this is indicative of the fact that the Social Security  Administration doesn't have a realistic view of how people should be allowed to  work and earn an income and receive help simultaneously," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Berry is getting frustrated and fears that his attempts to live on  his own will ultimately fail.  </P></p>

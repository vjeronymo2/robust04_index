			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 25 Farvardin [14 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News  Service -- After it became known that he was infected with AIDS,  the second secretary of the Brazilian embassy in Tehran was  expelled from Iran.    A Muslim diplomat in Tehran disclosed: Mr. Paulo Madrus,  chief of the Commerce Section and second secretary of the  Brazilian Embassy, had just arrived at his position in Iran and  was hospitalized as an emergency case at one of Tehran's  hospitals and his blood was tested. The test showed that his  blood was infected with HIV, and this virus transmits AIDS.    It is said that after it was definitely determined he was  infected with AIDS, the Iranian Foreign Ministry asked the  Brazilian Embassy in Tehran to send him back to his country as  soon as possible. His expulsion took place seven months ago  (last year).    In a contact by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I with the Brazilian Embassy,  an informed source in this embassy confirmed that Paulo  Madrus, the chief of the Commerce Section and second  secretary of the Brazilian Embassy in Iran, left Tehran seven  months ago due to illness, but this source did not mention the  nature of the diplomat's illness.    The same source confirmed that since the return of the  aforementioned diplomat to Brazil, Hinaldo Esturani, another  Brazilian diplomat, has taken over as chief of the embassy's  Commerce Section.    In repeated contacts by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I with officials at  the  Foreign Ministry to determine if the report that the  aforementioned diplomat was infected with AIDS and was expelled  from Iran is true or not, they were unwilling to say anything  about it, nor would they give any reason for their silence on  the subject.    The aforementioned Muslim diplomat criticized the Foreign  Ministry's behavior in this regard. He said: Unfortunately, it  is observed that the behavior of Iran's Ministry of Foreign  Affairs towards the foreign diplomats living in Tehran,  especially Western diplomats, is negligent, and this leads to  insolence on the part of many Western diplomats.    It is worth mentioning that last year also KEYHAN-E HAVA'I  disclosed the infection of a Dutch diplomat with AIDS. It was  known before this Dutch diplomat came to Iran that he had AIDS,  but the Dutch Foreign Ministry sent him anyway.    In an answer to KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the Dutch Embassy tried to  deny that the Dutch Foreign Ministry had knowingly sent a  diplomat infected with HIV to Iran, but the Dutch Embassy's  efforts were of no avail in the face of the sharp public opinion  response in Iran.    Based on information obtained from reliable sources, the  Brazilian diplomat was also infected with AIDS before he was  sent to his post in Tehran.    The Muslim diplomat who gave us the report that the  Brazilian  Embassy's commercial attache was infected with the AIDS virus  said he had no information on whether or not the Brazilian  diplomat infected with HIV was sent to Tehran knowingly and with  specific intention by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.    He emphasized that Westerners spread various diseases,  including AIDS, with their careless behavior. He said: As a  Muslim, I expect the Islamic Republic's Foreign Ministry not to  deal passively with Western political leaders and diplomats and  to make them understand the necessity to observe Islamic values.    It is worth mentioning that many Iranian physicians and  specialists in contagious diseases have expressed concern about  the relations between foreign diplomats in Tehran and some  Iranian families. These specialists and physicians believe that  casual relations could lead to the spread of AIDS among  individuals who have close contact with foreign diplomats  infected with this virus, and these kinds of relations could  involuntarily lead to the spread of the HIV infection through  the country. Specialists in contagious diseases thus advise  Iranian families to avoid contact and relations with foreign  diplomats.</p>

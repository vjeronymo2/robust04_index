			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEING RED OVER EYES  </P> <P> After reading "For Asians in U.S., a New Focus On Eye Surgery" (by Irene Chang,  Aug. 22), I was shocked that UCLA is promoting courses on this trivial surgery.  UCLA is a publicly supported institution and I am incensed that my state tax  money is being spent on this training.  </P> <P> The entire plastic surgery industry has gotten out of line. Physicians trained  at taxpayer expense are taking advantage of people's insecurities to fatten  their own wallets. They would do better using their skills to treat real  illnesses instead of encouraging this needless mutilation.  </P> <P> Asians, with or without rounder eyes, will still remain Asians; Italian women  do not look like Swedes and a Swedish nose just looks ridiculous on an Italian.  Not only are some of these women denying their heritage, but they make  themselves look laughable.  </P> <P> Again, they have a willing partner in this procedure: the unethical and  money-hungry physician.  </P> <P> EDY BIRMINGHAM  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

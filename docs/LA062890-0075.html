			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> BOARD OKS RENT INCREASES  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Rent Control Board voted unanimously to allow landlords to  raise rents 6% this year and approved on a 3-2 vote a proposal to set $25 as  the minimum increase.  </P> <P> Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and Commissioner Wayne Bauer voted against  the $25 minimum, saying that it would hurt low-income tenants.  </P> <P> The $25 minimum increase would apply to apartments with rents of $420 a month  or less.  </P> <P> In allowing the 6% increase effective Sept. 1, the board ignored a staff  recommendation to set the annual allowable rent increase at 6.77% with a $35  minimum. The staff had originally recommended a 7.5% increase, but recalculated  its formula to come up with the smaller increase.  </P> <P> Although the 6% increase is the largest allowed since rent control was imposed  in 1979, landlords complained that it was not enough because of rising costs.  </P> <P> Landlords have submitted a petition with more than 11,700 signatures calling  for a ballot measure in November that would allow landlords to raise rents to  market levels whenever an apartment is voluntarily vacated.  </P> <P> At least 7,843 signatures must be verified by the county registrar-recorder for  the measure to be placed on the ballot.  </P></p>

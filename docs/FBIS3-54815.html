That  is Finance Minister Boris Fedorov's New Year's Prediction"]    [Text] The present financial policy is provoking a harsh  reaction from the opposition. That means that a consistent  financial policy has been achieved.    Prices over the past year rose by a factor of nine (they  rose  by a factor of 26 in 1992), and in December the rate of price  rises was for the first time just 12 percent. These results  could have been much better had it not been for the compromises  on the budget, the promises of new appropriations not backed up  by sources of finance, the artificial raising of purchase prices  for grain, and our continuous struggle with the Supreme Soviet,  the Central Bank, and sector lobbies in the government.    The lowering of inflation means easing the problem of the  shortage of circulating capital and the depreciation of savings  and investments. That is why the slump in production last year  was not as great as the opposition predicted. However, 900  percent inflation is still disastrously high and it is simply  ridiculous to say that we have an unduly harsh policy or shock  therapy here. Only incompetent or dishonest people can argue  this way. It is typical that in all sectors without exception  the average wage in 1993 rose faster than inflation.    Back at the beginning of the year we were criticized for the  excessively low and unrealistic ruble exchange rate. But from  June through the end of the year the rate only fell from 1,100  rubles [R] to the dollar to R1,250 to $1; in other words, by  just 10 percent as against an approximately fourfold rise in  prices. Our prices are rapidly approaching the world level,  which marks the end of the era of prosperity for inefficient  production units whose survival was made possible by the vast  price discrepancy. Now there are many who dislike the  strengthening of the ruble even though this is a direct method  of combating the export of our national wealth at knockdown  prices.    The time has come to ask many prestigious directors of giant  enterprises and captains of agriculture: What is your labor  productivity like, why should we support you if your goods are  selling at world prices while you pay people kopeks? I consider  it a violation of human rights when I am forced to buy a  commodity at a price higher than the world price and furthermore  when it does not come up to scratch.    In 1993 we managed to stop the flow of money, subsidies, and  credits to CIS countries despite the fierce resistance of the  Central Bank and a number of members of the government.    In 1993, despite the opposition of the Central Bank and  various sector lobbies, we managed to substantially raise  interest rates and reduce various types of benefits which always  go to the least strong and efficient and are then wasted. What  effect did this have? In the first place the savings of the  population and enterprises are now far better protected against  inflation. Second, the voracious demand for free credits from  the "black holes" in the Russian economy has been greatly  restricted. It is no secret that behind the fine slogans of  support for this sphere or that, what happens is that state  resources are frankly plundered.    I do not know who will be at the helm of Russia's financial  policy in 1994 -- that is up to the president and the premier to  decide -- but I believe that it is necessary to demand  absolutely concrete steps and commitments from those who lay  claim to power. I would consider the following to be the minimum  program for 1994:     -    -  the population's savings: Interest rates higher than the  rate of inflation must be ensured so that savings really do grow  and people are able to accumulate money for long-term purchases.  Until that happens there will be no investments or industrial  development. At the same time it is necessary to pay reasonable  compensation for losses in savings resulting from the  deregulation of January 1992, but this must be done using  noninflationary sources;    -  the population's real incomes must rise by at least 20-30  percent, and the dollar equivalent of the average monthly wage  must rise from $100 to $250: It is necessary to introduce tax  regulators to reduce the discrepancy in earnings between the  richest and the poorest;    -  inflation must be reduced in the very near future to less  than 5 percent a month, which is equivalent to 80 percent  annually. That will make it possible to reduce the general  level of interest rates, stimulate investments, and encourage  enterprises to plan their activity;    -  as the budget deficit falls to 5 percent of GDP or less and  is financed by market loans it will be possible to reduce the  tax burden on commodity producers;    -  if events develop favorably the foreign exchange rate of the  ruble in 1994 will not fall below R2,000-2,500 to the dollar,  which will make our exports more substantial, will facilitate  imports, and will make enterprises think about competitiveness,  productivity, and quality. At the same time all the remaining  restrictions on exports should be completely lifted.       Those are the most basic financial policy demands in 1994.  Will those responsible be bold enough to make these commitments  and then answer for them to the people?    I have studied the opposition's demands and programs closely  and I have come to the conclusion that in the financial sphere  no one is offering anything fundamentally new apart from a  sharp increase in expenditure (social needs, investments,  and so forth). I wholeheartedly support such expenditure.  However, no one is saying anything serious about where  the money for this expenditure is to come from. That means  just one thing -- a further increase in the budget deficit and  consequently a further rise in inflation. And inflation, let me  repeat for the hundredth time, hits real people, enterprises,  and the whole state in the pocket.    On the eve of the new year, 1994, I shall try to predict  what  will happen if there is a change of course. A change of policy  and the rejection of the more than moderate course pursued by us  in 1993 (and accordingly the rejection of the people identified  with that policy because a policy is always pursued by specific  people) will mean the "Ukrainianization" of our economy:     -    -  prices rising annually by a factor of 20;    -  an exchange rate in the region of R10,000 to the dollar (the  rate could be fixed, so that would be the "black market" rate);    -  a further decline in labor productivity;    -  a fall in the population's real money incomes by at least  one-eighth (in 1993 the rise was 10 percent); the average wage  would fall to the dollar equivalent of $50 a month;    -  savings and investments would contract in real terms;    -  the dollarization of the economy would intensify again;    -  certain prices would be fixed and there would be an attempt  to confiscate money, particularly foreign currency, held in  banks;    -  there would be another shortage of many types of goods, the  stores would be empty, and emigration would increase.       I think that instead of the enormous market around the Kiev  station in Moscow, where Ukrainians, hunting for rubles which  have become a genuine foreign currency, are to be found selling  masses of goods, there would be a similar market in Kiev where  you might find Russians trading, hunting for "karbovantsy." I  do not rule out the possibility that our miners would go to  Kazakhstan to earn their living, just as Ukrainians now come to  Rostov to work for half pay. Perhaps our delegation would then  go to Tashkent to ask for credits and Russian enterprises would  try to keep their money salted away in Belarusian banks.    The only possible consolation for our opponents would the  growth of production by 3-5 percent by increasing the production  of tanks and missiles. Admittedly, I do not think that this  will be a source of much new year's joy for Russia's citizens as  we approach 1994.    I do not believe people who change their views, who pursue  one line today and are ready to pursue a different one tomorrow.  I have no faith in the leaders of enterprises who forget about  labor productivity and production efficiency and know only one  way to resolve their problems -- by asking the president or the  premier for money. All that we have is the interests of the  state and our citizens, and they are demanding that rigorous  financial order be instilled in the country and that the reforms  be continued, reforms whose sole aim is the improvement of our  life.    At most 10 percent of the people in the old parliament  supported the reforms; now that figure is at least 30 percent.  That is not so bad for a beginning. The only way to stop things  coming to a standstill is to firmly accelerate the reforms and  move closer to a normal life worthy of the citizens of a great  country. Slowing down the reforms is the road to ruin, the  continuation of the time of troubles, and the betrayal of  Russia's national interests.    Enough of the deception and disappointment. Enough of the  promises. Enough of the people who cling onto their jobs  despite being totally incapable of anything constructive.  Enough of the attempts to cross the hedgehog with the grass  snake -- as is well known, all you get is barbed wire. The  elections were a warning to us.    Pray God that Russia does not turn back from the true path  again, especially as the most difficult steps have already been  taken and we have the strength to go on.</p>

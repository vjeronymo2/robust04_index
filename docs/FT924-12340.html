			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Aspiring to be an engine for change - Lord Moore talks to Bronwen Maddox 'I HAVE carte blanche to do what I want,' says Lord Moore, the former UK cabinet minister who was appointed on Monday as head of the new Energy Saving Trust, one of the main planks in the government's environmental policy. Expectations are high, both of him and of the Trust, an independent limited company which is intended to search out energy-efficiency schemes. Moore is optimistic that he can fulfil them. 'There is no limit to the areas we can examine, and if I find that levers are inadequate, doors are closed, then I'll shout,' he says. Fighting talk - but he will start his chairmanship with at least two controversial issues on his desk. The first is the debacle of the coal mine closures, and the question of whether environmental costs have tipped the balance between coal and gas. Moore is adamant that he does not feel under pressure to enter the fray, although the comments of an independent body dedicated to assessing efficiency might be welcomed. 'I refuse to be drawn into the political debate,' he says, with a sensitivity that comes from an abrupt exit from politics after being tipped briefly as the successor to Lady, then Mrs Thatcher. The sensitivity may be understandable, but then the Trust is on the sidelines of one of the most wide-ranging and controversial energy efficiency issues faced by the country. Instead, the Trust is intended to focus on domestic rather than industrial projects - to search out ways for British Gas and the regional electricity companies to encourage their customers to use less energy in their homes. But even on that remit Moore faces an immediate obstacle. Last week Stephen Littlechild, regulator of the electricity industry, appeared to veto the possibility of regional electricity companies passing on the cost of investments in energy-efficiency to their customers. However, plans for the Trust have always assumed that the cost of almost all its projects - both gas and electricity - would be passed on. At a stroke, Littlechild's statement seems to threaten half the Trust's potential success. 'It is too early to express disappointment. I want to find out what he thinks in detail,' Moore says cautiously. Beyond that immediate obstacle, he also needs to solve the conundrum of why companies should suggest schemes that persuade their customers to use less energy and so could cost them revenue. Moore says he has a solution: 'I believe that corporations have a role in the community and can enhance shareholders' return by being 'good corporations', not just by short-term profits.' That is a much-debated position: although he is a director of Credit Suisse's fund management arm, he may not find his views of corporate governance shared by the mass of utility shareholders, let alone the companies themselves. He feels, however, that he has equipped the Trust with enough independence from the government and the utilities to negotiate these questions. He says that one of his main conditions in accepting the job was that a majority of directors on the Trust's board should be independent of the utilities. He is concerned too that the costs of running the Trust - which with an eventual staff of between 30 and 40 could amount to several million pounds a year - must not be paid entirely by the utilities. 'That would be dangerous,' he says, and he hopes that eventually the Trust can take fee income from initiating projects. He says he wants the Trust to cover businesses other than gas and electricity, possibly including the motor industry. With much of the scope of the Trust in question, will it really have an impact? 'I am not interested if it is just going to be small marginal schemes,' he says. 'What impact we will have as an engine of change I don't know.'</p>

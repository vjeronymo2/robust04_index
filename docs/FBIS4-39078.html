			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 31/5/1994 -- The Moldovan  economy gained a lot by becoming full member of the World Bank  in August 1992. These statements were made during the visit by  the World Bank vice president Welfred Thaiwitz to Moldova.  Moldovan officials pointed out that the World Bank is "a  co-author of the economic transformations in Moldova." Welfred  Thaiwitz was certain of the irreversible character of the  reforms and the effectiveness of Moldovan authorities' efforts  to improve the economy. He pointed out that "the World Bank  will further grant financial support for supporting reforms in  Moldova." World Bank experts assert that there have been some  achievements -- the most important being the stability of the  national currency in relation with the U.S. dollar and the  reduction in inflation. Official statistics indicate a  surprising decrease in inflation to 5 percent in April compared  to 45 percent in January. The last auctions of the Interbank  Currency Exchange indicate the stability of the leu. Winson  Temple, UN permanent representative to Moldova, hastened to  declare that the pace of reform in Moldova exceeds the pace in  Russia and even the Baltic republics. Obviously, Temple stated  that the economic situation in Moldova very difficult,  mentioning that the national income decreased by 50 percent in  the last three years. It is obvious that given such  difficulties, without foreign hard currency injection it would  be impossible to reanimate an economy undergoing recession.  Moldova has been granted credits amounting to $86 million by  the World Bank and it stands to receive more. During his visit  to Chisinau Thaiwitz did not specify a figure for the eventual  loans. However, sources from banks say that another $150  million could be granted. "The World Bank can grant Moldova  significant financial assistance its reforms are successfully  promoted," stated Thaiwitz. He especially insisted on  privatization of state property, thereby making a qualitative  leap in the "structural reform" of the economy. It can be  easily seen that the Chisinau officials to all possible in order  not to lose credibility in the eyes of the international  financial organizations. The statements made by the  decision-makers in the area of economics regarding the  acceleration of the privatization process, realization of  structural reforms in industry, and the assurance that the  international agreements and especially the Memorandum concluded  with the IMF will be respected are significant. Regardless of  government measures and substantial financial support, realities  press hard on the Moldovan economy. Industrial output is  falling. Financial blockage which has engendered general  insolvency has the most pressing effects. Undertaking complete  price liberalization while many salaries go unpaid under can  provoke much dissatisfaction. Even the presidential decree on  increasing the minimum salary to 18 lei seems not to diminish  from the weight of the burden carried by the population, since  the average salary covers only 30 percent of the minimum  consumption budget. On the other hand, the recent price  liberalization and salary raid could lead to a new wave of  inflation that will aggravate the economic situation.</p>

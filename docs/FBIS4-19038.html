			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Leo Delcroix, by </F> unidentified correspondent, following a limited cabinet meeting  on Rwanda, "this morning" -- recorded]    [Text] [Delcroix] We discussed the future of the mission of  the blue helmets. I believe that the situation in Rwanda is  such that it is our duty to reconsider this mission. At this  moment, Foreign Minister Claes is meeting with the UN secretary  general to discuss the issue, because we do not want to make  unilateral decisions. In my opinion, it would be a bit too easy  to make a rash decision spontaneously and without consideration.  That is not what we are going to do. We will first consult  with the United Nations and its secretary general, and then make  the necessary decisions in the next few hours, or days.    [Correspondent] But the Belgians submitted a request to be  relieved of their mandate.    [Delcroix] It was not stated as such. At this moment, this  certainly is not the case and I cannot confirm it, but I believe  that the government will be able to make decisions in the next  few hours, or tomorrow at the latest.</p>

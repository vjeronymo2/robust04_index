			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Walesa has initiative after Sejm votes out Suchocka PRESIDENT Lech Walesa of Poland yesterday began the search for a new government after the country had been plunged into renewed political uncertainty by the surprise one-vote defeat of the coalition headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka. Ms Suchocka, Poland's fifth prime minister since the end of communist rule in 1989, handed her government's resignation to Mr Walesa after losing the no-confidence vote called by the Solidarity trade union group. Her defeat comes as the economy is showing signs of growth. Some ministers leaving an emergency cabinet session after the vote said Mr Walesa had refused to accept the prime minister's resignation. The Polish constitution now passes the initiative to the president. He can ask Ms Suchocka or another politician of his choice to try to form a new government, or can dissolve parliament and call a new election. The constitution also empowers him to form his own presidential government if other options fail. Mr Walesa did not disclose his intentions after the vote but issued a statement saying he would fulfil his constitutional role. Mr Bronislaw Geremek, parliamentary leader of Ms Suchocka's Democratic Union party, said: 'I expect early elections, the date of which will be set by the president.' He has been leading efforts to broaden the base of the coalition. The initial seven-party coalition was formed in July last year. One partner, the small PL peasants' party, dropped out last month. The government never enjoyed a clear majority in the 460-seat Sejm, the lower house of parliament. The coalition could only count on 186 votes and always had to rely on opposition abstentions or the support of the smaller, non-governmental parties. Yesterday, a handful of government supporters, including Mr Zbigniew Dyka, recently sacked as justice minister, failed to vote in parliament, allowing the no-confidence motion to attain half the votes cast, plus one, needed to win. Supporters of the no-confidence vote, including the former communists who had sought a deal which would have allowed them to abstain, numbered 223, against 198 backing the government. There were 24 abstentions. The Solidarity union called the vote in protest at the government's refusal to amend the budget so as to provide higher pay for teachers, nurses and other public servants whose living standards have fallen due to the government's tight fiscal policy. The government is restrained by its agreement with the International Monetary Fund from raising the budget deficit beyond the equivalent of 5.5 per cent of GDP. This restriction must also be obeyed if Poland is to complete negotiations for a 50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 7.8bn) debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors. Polish debt traded on the secondary market in New York fell slightly, to 30 cents in the dollar from 31 cents on Thursday, following the vote yesterday. This indicated market confidence that the event will not adversely affect debt negotiations which are due to resume in Paris on June 8. Poised for recovery, page 9</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Further rise for sterling The pound increased its strength against the German and US currencies yesterday. The move was partly a reflection of a weaker D - Mark, but the latest batch of UK economic data confirmed that recovery was on course, writes Peter John. The data showed that net consumer credit was up Pounds 290m in November, housing starts rose by 11 per cent in the three months to November compared with the previous three, and the trade deficit with the rest of the world almost halved in October to Pounds 578m. The figures were good enough, according to many economists, to dampen the possibility of another cut in base rates and thus preserve yields for overseas holders of sterling. On the other hand, they were not strong enough to increase optimism over the pace of recovery. Sterling rose to a closing high of DM2.5880, up from an early low of DM2.5755 and  1/2 pfennig firmer than Friday's finish. Against the dollar it advanced to Dollars 1.4960 from a previous Dollars 1.4910. The rise was fuelled by significant buying of sterling by US institutional funds, which were encouraged by reports that rate cut prospects were fading. Matched against a trade-weighted index of 16 leading currencies, the pound rose to 82.5 per cent of its value in 1985, up from 82.3 per cent previously. Its new level was the highest since October 1992, shortly after the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism. Just before 'Black Wednesday', the day that subsequently became redubbed by some as 'Golden Wednesday' as it triggered a boom in the UK stock and bond mar-kets, the sterling index stood at 90.9. Ms Francoise Skelley, chart specialist with Credit Suisse, said: 'I would expect sterling to test recent peaks of DM2.59 and also to achieve Dollars 1.50 against the dollar. Dollars 1.51 will be the big challenge but it looks quite comfortable at these levels.' However, Mr Tony Norfield, economist with ABN-Amro Bank, argues that the market's dismissal of an early interest rate cut is misplaced and sterling will become overpriced if it approaches Dollars 1.51. He anticipates the pound falling back to Dollars 1.46 in the spring, especially if the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates. General belief that UK interest rates are not poised to fall from their present 5.5 per cent soon was also reflected in the money markets, where the short sterling contract for March slipped five basis points to 94.70. Government bonds and the London stock market were also weak - both tend to rise in anticipation of lower interest rates. Meanwhile, Bank of England operations were relaxed, although the forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn attracted little interest, with just under Pounds 600m taken up by the close of official dealing. The central bank provided Pounds 500m via Pounds 400m of band one bank bills at 5 3/8 per cent and Pounds 100m of bills for resale to the market on February 1 at 5 13/32 per cent. It also provided a further Pounds 38m at 5 3/8 per cent and Pounds 60m of late unspecified assistance. The dollar suffered from mixed perceptions after disappointing US employment figures prompted heavy selling at the end of last week. Investors were awaiting US production and price data later this week, and although dealers said the prospect of encouraging figures was already priced into the currency, it gained some ground against the Japanese yen, rising to Y112.20 from Y111.80. It finished in New York at Y112.25. The US and Japanese currencies are both expected to attract interest in the run-up to the latest round of bilateral trade talks later this week. The foreign exchange market remained unconvinced by last week's monetary firmness from the German Bundesbank. Many dealers expect the bank's governing council to reduce its key discount and Lombard rates some time in January and have continued to sell the D-Mark and buy sterling. The D-Mark was weak against a number of currencies in early European dealing but recovered towards the close. Dealers took yesterday's Swedish budget proposals in their stride, having gleaned much of the relevant information from a radio interview last week given by Ms Anne Wibble, the finance minister. The statement was as upbeat as expected and the krone moved forward again to end at SKr4.6990 per D-Mark, up from SKr4.7120 previously. The Italian lira was restrained by an impending vote of no confidence hanging over the government and slipped to L983.40 to the D-Mark, down from L977.90. The Belgian franc was also hit by domestic worries, relating to political scandal surrounding a 1988 army purchase of Italian helicopters. It was quoted at BFr20.89 to the D - Mark, down from BFr20.78. Concern over rising inflation drove the Russian rouble to a three-month low of R1,274 to the dollar, from R1,259 last week, with dealers predicting further falls this month. The previous low of R1,299 was on September 23, just after President Boris Yeltsin dissolved the old parliament and called December elections for a new legislature. The Taiwan dollar hit a six-month high against the US dollar in fierce trade, and in spite of central bank intervention which brought the currency down from its intraday peak. It closed at TDollars 26.4710 against the US currency, compared with TDollars 26.5490 previously.</p>

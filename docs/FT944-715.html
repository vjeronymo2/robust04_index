			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Fishermen angered by Spanish deal Fishermen yesterday voiced their anger at the deal agreed by European Union ministers to allow Spanish trawlers increased access to coastal waters around the UK. Mr Geoff Bullus, a Newlyn fisherman and director of the Cornish Fish Producers Association, said: 'We've been totally screwed. How much more bad language can you listen to?' He added: 'The Spanish fleet will destroy whatever stocks of fish are left out there.' Under the deal agreed by ministers on Thursday night, Spain will be allowed access to the Celtic Sea - between south-east Ireland and south-west England  -and will be able to send 40 trawlers to the sensitive Irish Box, the waters around south-west Ireland where many fish have their breeding grounds. Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, abstained on the vote which agreed the compromise deal. He succeeded in excluding Spanish trawlers from the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel but Mr John Sayles, a Shetland fisherman, said: 'This is just a stepping stone, soon they'll be claiming access to the North Sea.' Mr John Ashworth, who runs the Save Britain's Fish campaign, said increased access would lead to cuts in British fishing capacity. 'This won't happen overnight, but sadly, the Brits will have to go in order to make room for the Spanish.' Mr Ashworth is campaigning for Britain to leave the Common Fisheries Policy and claims support from 75 per cent of the nation's fishermen. Mr Bullus said the deal would force the British fleet to ignore quotas and other regulations to survive. Mr Waldegrave said: 'I'm not saying this deal is perfect. I would have liked more. But at the beginning of the week we would have been rather happy to know we were going to get this much.'</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs leave James Crean lower James Crean, the Dublin-based food, household goods and industrial equipment wholesaler, has released its results for 1991. The figures had been delayed so that certain matters relating to the affairs of International Aircraft Services - in which James Crean increased its stake to 38 per cent early in 1991 - could be clarified. This has resulted in the adoption of equity accounting for the company's interest in IAS. James Crean's share of the IAS result for 1991 is a net positive contribution of IPounds 554,000 and for reasons of prudence this has not been taken into the accounts. In spite of a significant increase in group turnover from IPounds 179.7m to IPounds 208.7m, pre-tax profits for the year declined by more than IPounds 1m to IPounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.9m). However, the company said comparisons were distorted by the investments in Valley Fresh Foods in California and Egidius Janssen in Holland in 1990, and by the fact that the results for Valley Fresh had been consolidated in the 1991 accounts. The directors said increases in profits before tax and interest had been achieved in all core areas, except for the electrical business in the UK. The interest charge surged to IPounds 6.04m (IPounds 2.74m) and group net borrowing at the year-end stood at IPounds 57.4m, against IPounds 50.6m. A final dividend of 10.4765p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 18.3415p. The dividend is twice covered by earnings per share of 36.7p (45.1p).</p>

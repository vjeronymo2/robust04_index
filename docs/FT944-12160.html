			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (19): Radical reforms tested - The role of the west continues to be crucial, as ever, to Poland's future / The Polish economy 'THE POLISH ECONOMY: CRISIS, REFORM AND TRANSFORMATION' By Ben Slay Princeton University Press, Pounds 26.5, 229 pages Since the advent to power in late 1989 of its first non-communist government for more than 40 years, Poland has become the testing ground for many of the most radical ideas, proposed by both Polish and western economists, to transform the old and discredited centrally-administered economies. This excellent and highly readable book offers a well-balanced assessment of those reforms. 'Shock therapy' as applied to the Polish patient, has meant massive currency devaluation; abolition of subsidies and of administered price-setting by government; privatisation of state enterprises; and the building of financial and legal institutions to help oil the new marketised order. As Slay concludes, there are many signs of progress in achieving the objectives of marketisation. However, the resistance to change by those who benefited from the old order, and the subsequent election of a left-wing parliament in September 1993 in response to widespread dissatisfaction, suggests that crisis continues to be a theme running through Polish development, whatever the optimism generated by 1989 and its aftermath. It is Slay's rooting of modern Polish history in Poland's complex past and emphasis on the forces of continuity which distinguishes this analysis of a former communist economy from those whose framework is simply one of the transition from 'socialism' to 'capitalism', as though history began in 1948. As Slay shows, there is plenty in Poland's past which has echoes in the present. Continuity therefore becomes central to analysing recent economic history. Slay shows how state control of the country's economy under socialism was nothing new, going back to the strong Russian, Austrian and Prussian state control under the partition, and the state control of banks and sections of industry in the second republic. Attempts to combine elements of 'the market' and state planning under 'socialism' go back to similar strategies in the inter-war period. Poland's ability to cope with the 'shock therapy' of the Balcerowicz Plan of 1990 is partly explained by the limited, but important, reforms made by the old regime during the 1980s. Although politically repressive, the Jaruzelski regime did institute economic reforms which gave enterprises more autonomy, especially in trade with the west, and also partial currency convertibility towards the end of the decade. Allied to an increasingly large dollarised parallel economy which grew throughout the 1980s, these legacies of the old system provided a base for a less constrained private sector after 1989. However important history may be, it is Slay's assessment of the period since 1989 which is going to be of most interest to observers of east and central Europe. On the positive side of the balance there is currency convertibility, price reform, privatisation and macroeconomic stabilisation (which includes both bringing inflation under control and some considerable success in switching to exports to western markets). On the negative side, there is some loss of output, rising unemployment, increasing poverty, and a practically bankrupt, and still largely state-owned, banking system. Even looking at the negatives, the fall in output relies too heavily on official statistics which understate private activity. There is some doubt as to what proportion of the registered unemployed are really without work; data on poverty are heavily dependent on where the poverty line is drawn and what constitutes a minimum basket of goods; and as far as the banking system is concerned, enterprise debts to banks are a phenomenon plaguing most of the post-communist economies and will obviously take time to resolve. The great merit of Slay's book is that he gives us many reasons rooted in events since 1989 to be optimistic about Poland's transformation. But he also gives us many reasons from Poland's recent and distant past to make us pessimistic, too. The role of the west continues to be crucial, as ever, to Poland's future. Having adopted much of the radical strategy urged on it by the US and the European Union, Poland deserves the foreign investment and aid which are essential to see the strategy through. Once again, Poland's future is heavily dependent on foreign capital and foreign powers.</p>

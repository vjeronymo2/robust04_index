Addressing a meeting here on Puglia, Land of Peace Facing  the  East, Fabbri recalled the withdrawal today of Italian soldiers  from Mogadishu and the meager results obtained in Somalia, in  part because a plethora of contingents were sent in that had  never before worked together, he said. For him, the only  organization capable of carrying out a pacification effort and  of implementing United Nations' decisions was NATO, whose role,  he insisted, had certainly not ended with the end of the Warsaw  Pact.    Within the general framework, Italian action must be  developed with regard to the following three scenarios to the  east: Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean area,  and the Middle East.    The minister lauded "the extraordinary commitment" of  Italian  Armed Forces in peacekeeping missions abroad and specifically  mentioned the success of the missions in Mozambique and in  Albania. He also recalled the ten Italian soldiers who died in  the Horn of Africa.</p>

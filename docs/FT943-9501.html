			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Japan interestrate reduction ruled out again Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday ruled out a cut in interest rates in the foreseeable future. 'Our judgment on the economic situation remains unchanged in the light of several positive indicators,' Mr Mieno said in Tokyo. He repeated his oft-stated belief that the economy is headed for recovery, though he expressed caution about the pace of the upturn. The economy has already registered strong growth in the first part of the year; unusually warm summer weather has helped boost consumption in the past few months. That seasonal benefit would be reflected in faster-than-expected growth for the current quarter, Mr Mieno added, but he warned that when this temporary stimulus had passed, the economy would still be beset by potential risks such as a high yen and weak capital spending. The governor's remarks appeared to confirm what many analysts have suspected for some time: that the bank sees the present historically low official discount rate of 1.75 per cent as the bottom of the present cycle, and as the economy recovers, the next likely move in rates will be upwards. The bank has steadfastly resisted pressure at home and abroad to cut interest rates in the wake of the sharp appreciation of the yen in the past few months, arguing that monetary policy was consistent with the needs of the domestic economy. Yesterday, Mr Mieno noted with evident satisfaction the recent slight decline in the Japanese currency's value. But the bank's optimistic assessment of the country's prospects has not been shared by all analysts, including some of the government's own economists. Last month's quarterly assessment by the bank stated confidently that the Japanese economy was 'heading for recovery'. But it came just a week before the publication of a wide-ranging analysis by the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) that pointed only to 'bright economic spots', and avoided stating unequivocally that recovery was under way. The EPA's monthly report for August, to be published tomorrow, is expected to be equally cautious. Some analysts have accused the bank of deliberately adopting a more optimistic tone about recovery prospects specifically to defend its opposition to a cut in borrowing costs. Mr Mieno rejected such allegations, saying it was 'putting the cart before the horse' to suggest that policy dictated economic analysis rather than vice-versa.</p>

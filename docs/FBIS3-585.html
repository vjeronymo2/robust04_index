Kemp] </F>   [Text] Levubu March 9 SAPA -- The South African Government  would take steps to safeguard South African citizens, assets and  interests in Bophuthatswana, President F W de Klerk said on  Wednesday [9 March]. Addressing journalists during a stopover  on his northern Transvaal election tour, he said the  government's attitude was that Bophuthatswana had to be  re-incorporated into South Africa. However, any South African  measures would only focus on safeguarding South African  interests in the troubled homeland.    Mr de Klerk said the best way for President Lucas Mangope's  ruling party to test its support in Bophutshwana was to  participate in the elections. "Our political analysis is that Mr  Mangope's party does not have widespread support and that he  will not do well in the election."    Mr de Klerk said the elections could not be delayed  indefinitely to accommodate parties still outside the process.  He said Parliament would amend the electoral act to allow for  the late submission of candidates' lists by political parties  participating in the election.    He said this was his initiative and he was pleased that both  the Transitional Executive Council and the the Independent  Electoral Commission had supported the proposal. "It creates  logistical space for parties that have registered late to draw  up and submit their candidate list for the elections."    Mr de Klerk said he was also pleased to hear from media  reports that Gen Constand Viljoen, Afrikaner Freedom Front, was  preparing to lodge its candidate list.    Referring to international mediation demanded by the Inkatha  Freedom Party, he said he had not received any detailed proposal  and remained sceptical that mediation would be successful. Mr de  Klerk said the election date could not be altered in any way to  accommodate any mediation attempt.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk encountered an African National  Congress  demonstration for the second time on Wednesday when he visited  the homestead of Venda's youthful king, Dimbanyika Mpephu, the  son of former President Patrick Mpephu. About 100 ANC protesters  chanted slogans and toyi-toyied in the grounds of the royal  homestead while Mr de Klerk met the king indoors.    The demonstrators carried posters stating: "Try and recruit  on your white farms" and "De Klerk is a criminal".    The demonstrators dispersed after Mr de Klerk's motorcade  left for Levubu.</p>

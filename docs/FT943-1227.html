			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (4): Olivetti wins five-year Pounds 11m deal - Case study Huw Medcraft is head of technical services at Maidenhead-based airline reservations giant Galileo. Galileo is a leading player in the highly competitive world of Computerised Reservations Systems (CRS), servicing UK travel agencies. IT is at the heart of Galileo's operations. Including peripheral devices such as printers, Medcraft is responsible for 24,000 high-technology items attached to Galileo's UK network. He has just assigned the role of keeping those machines up and running to a third party, Olivetti, in a five-year Pounds 11m deal. Medcraft explains that his organisation already outsourced a number of services. But IT was different. 'Outsourcing only becomes a big issue when your own staff are performing the task that is going to be contracted out.' With an annual IT spend in the region of Pounds 20m, the IT operation is certainly a significant item on Galileo's balance sheet. But it doesn't make sense to take care of every detail on an in-house basis. 'In an organisation of our size, it's not cost-effective to support all those workstations.' Olivetti's outsourcing task is restricted to engineering support, including software maintenance. Galileo has decided to retain control of the network that binds some 2,400 travel agents to Galileo. If Medcraft is committed to the idea of outsourcing, why not go the whole way? 'We have always seen the network as a source of competitive advantage. It is the ability to deliver airline tickets that is core to our business.' Specifically, Medcraft believes there is nothing to gain and everything to lose by outsourcing this function. 'We wouldn't save money and we could lose control of the strategic elements of our business.' Galileo expects to make real savings on those aspects of its work that have been outsourced. Despite initial charges, such as the termination of property leases, Medcraft reckons the outsourcing contract will produce a saving of Pounds 2m over the five years. The handover date was August 1 this year. But the 52 engineers were told that they were going to a new employer at the beginning of May. 'We want to keep those skills on our side even though the people will be working for Olivetti. We provided a clear opportunity for the staff to talk the deal through with their new employer.' Medcraft believes that keeping staff happy is an integral part of successful outsourcing. And Galileo has kept its grip on its business objectives. 'Outsourcing has not allowed us to relieve ourselves of any obligations. We still deliver the same services, but now our managers can focus on improving the product for the end customer.' And the attraction of outsourcing is mutual. Galileo has just lost Graham Harrison, its commercial director, to outsourcing giant EDS. Harrison has been appointed managing director of the EDS financial services division.</p>

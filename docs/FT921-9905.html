			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese brokers downgraded MOODY'S Investor Service yesterday downgraded the long-term debt rating of Japan's four biggest securities houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi in response to what it sees as rising pressure on the profits of the four companies, writes Steven Butler. The downgrading reflects the US ratings agency's view that the operating environment for the securities industry will become more difficult as regulatory change gathers pace. Moody's said the financial scandals of last year were likely to accelerate the pace of financial deregulation, which could increase competition and reduce profits. In the case of Nomura, Moody's noted, it could be called upon to assist affiliates in the brokerage, venture capital and property business. Daiwa, it said, would have difficulty reducing the recent increase in its fixed cost base in spite of the troubles of the industry. Nikko and Yamaichi faced similar difficulties.</p>

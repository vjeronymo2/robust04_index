			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / BA apologises again to Virgin but clears board of blame BRITISH AIRWAYS last night offered its second, abject apology to Virgin Atlantic for its 'dirty tricks' campaign against the rival airline but cleared its own board of any involvement in the damaging affair. BA announced that it had set up a committee of non-executive directors to introduce a new code of conduct to be implemented throughout the business. Lord King, the chairman, said in a statement: 'I would like again to apologise and to reiterate goodwill towards Richard Branson (Virgin's chairman).' Lord King said he also wanted to apologise 'to all our people, our shareholders and our customers'. But last night's first indications suggested that Mr Branson was not satisfied with BA's latest initiative. Virgin said later it wanted more substantial proposals from BA as the key issue was 'the serious commercial damage caused to our airline'. 'We will be talking to British Airways at their request over the next week and will be looking for more concrete proposals than those that emerged today,' it said in a statement. Ten days ago BA gave an unqualified apology to Virgin in the High Court and paid libel damages of Pounds 610,000. In a badly needed boost to morale, BA was also able to announce last night that it had completed the first phase of a strategic alliance with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. BA has paid an initial Dollars 300m (Pounds 197m) for 19.9 per cent of voting interests in the US airline. The two announcements, aimed at renewing BA's efforts to strike a peace deal with Virgin and to restore its international standing, came after a nine-hour board meeting which began at 7.45am at the airline's Heathrow headquarters. Sir Colin Marshall, the company's chief executive and deputy chairman, conceded that everybody in the company 'has been touched' by the affair. 'The code has already gone out to all managers,' Sir Colin said. He said the board had asked the company's executive management to examine 'specific areas where problems arose and take appropriate action'. Sir Colin said he was 'very anxious' to establish an improved relationship with Virgin. 'We are competitors and will always be competitors, but we need to establish a much better relationship,' he said. BA last night said it had received assurances from each board member that they had not implemented or authorised any 'disreputable business activities' or any other improper action against Virgin. The board considered an 80-page investigation into the 'dirty tricks' campaign requested by non-executive directors and carried out by Linklaters &amp; Paines, BA's solicitors. The campaign included the luring of passengers off Virgin and computer tapping. The document says the covert campaign was confined to a relatively small number of unconnected incidents which involved a 'very small' number of BA staff. It also supports the board's consistent claim that there has never been a wide-ranging conspiracy throughout BA to damage Virgin. Sir Colin emphasised that the directors 'did not know' and were not involved in the 'dirty tricks' campaign. 'You have to recognise the size and spread of the company with 50,000 employees spread over many areas,' he said, adding that regrettable incidents had occurred in other companies without perhaps getting the same prominence as the Virgin affair. Although large US carriers yesterday renewed their lobbying campaign against BA's alliance with USAir, Sir Colin appeared confident the deal would not be blocked by the new US administration. As well as acquiring an initial 19.9 per cent of voting rights in USAir for Dollars 300m, BA has taken options to invest a further Dollars 450m in the US carrier, which would lift its equity interest in USAir to 32.4 per cent. Mr Branson, however, could destabilise BA's partnership with USAir should he decide to file an anti-trust suit against BA in the US courts.

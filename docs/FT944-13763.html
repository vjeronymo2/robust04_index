			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sunset + Vine Sunset + Vine, the television production company, reported a jump in pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 108,000 to Pounds 1.02m for the year to June 30. The company said the accounts had been prepared on a revised basis reflecting changes in the nature of the business from contracted long-term projects to other areas of television. The underlying performance would have produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 932,000 (Pounds 505,000) under the previous accounting policy. During 1994-95 sponsored programming would represent less than 50 per cent of turnover for the first time, it said. Turnover amounted to Pounds 5.96m (Pounds 3.71m) including Pounds 791,000 from acquisitions which also contributed Pounds 167,000 to operating profits of Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 27,000). In May the company acquired Mobile Image, the outside broadcast facilities company, for Pounds 2m. Sunset also announced yesterday the acquisition of Walker-Smith Events Licensing and Sponsorship for a nominal amount. Earnings per share came through at 12.1p (1.3p) and a final dividend of 2.5p (2p) is proposed for a 4p (3.5p) total.</p>

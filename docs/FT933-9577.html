			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Chinese interest in UK flotation THIS week will bring the first listing on the London stock market of a company involving Chinese state ownership, with the quotation tomorrow of Fortune Oil. Fortune is aiming to capitalise on the rapidly rising stream of oil imports into China. The company was created via the acquisition by Blackland Oil, a former London USM company, of Kingsleigh Petroleum of Hong Kong. Kingsleigh's shareholders, which now become investors in Fortune Oil, include such leading Chinese state corporations as China National Electronics Import and Export, China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export, and China North Industries. The new company has been floated in London because the Hong Kong stock market lists no oil and gas companies. Kingsleigh's owners will hold 70 per cent of Fortune's stock, with Blackland holding only 1 per cent. The rest of the new shareholders, expected to number between 500 and 600, will enter through the London placing of Pounds 10m of new shares. About half of the proceeds of the London placing will be used to pay down debt, with the rest available for additional investments, some in Blackland's interests in small oilfields in Lincolnshire. Fortune plans a Dollars 25m off-shore mooring project and also has a contract with the Maoming refinery, which is one of Fortune's shareholders.

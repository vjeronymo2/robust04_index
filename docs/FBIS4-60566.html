			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Ghani Makkawi, leader  of the Yemeni National Grouping, has said unity cannot be  imposed by the force of arms. He noted that reconciliation and  dialogue are the basis for any solution in Yemen.    In an interview published by al-Shariqah AL-KHALIJ today,  Makkawi said the Document of Pledge and Accord remains the ideal  formula to achieve stability in the country.    Makkawi, who was appointed a member of the Presidential  Council in the declared Democratic Republic of Yemen, said  ending the military operations hinges on the will of President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, noting that these operations cannot  achieve a final solution to the situation unless the northern  army turns into an occupation army, which is unacceptable and  out of question.    Makkawi hinted at the possibility of a meeting between  President Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Paris soon. He said:  If agreement is reached to avoid the negative aspects that  accompanied the declaration of unity, then results will be  promising.</p>

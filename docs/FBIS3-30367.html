			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview with TA SR [Slovak news agency],  Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said that there have never  been direct talks on MiG-29 aircraft between the Slovak Army and  Israel. He was responding to the REUTER report in which Foreign  Minister Jozef Moravcik said that Israel is able to refit this  type of aircraft to Western standards and has allegedly already  discussed cooperation.    Imrich Andrejcak said that the talks between Jozef Moravcik  and the Israeli partners were not binding and were probably  misinterpreted. However, the defense minister did not rule out  the possibility that our Army would consider modernizing  MiG-21's and MiG-29's as early as this year.</p>

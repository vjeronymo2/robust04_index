			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Republics take refuge in soap: A Mexican TV saga is enthralling the former Soviet Union WHEREVER the Mexican ambassador goes in the former Soviet Union, the burning question he is asked by presidents, foreign ministers and ordinary people alike has nothing to with diplomacy. They want to know what happens at the end of a soap opera called The Rich Also Cry. An estimated 140m TV viewers from Belarus to Russia's far east have fallen prey to this chronicle of the love and torments of Luis Alberto and Marianna, a handsome upper middle-class couple with lots of money and problems. The 248-part 'telenovella' (there is no word in Russian for soap opera), on the air three times a week, has become a common obsession for republics striving to be independent in every other way. 'They all want to know how it ends but I can't tell them because I haven't seen it,' confides Mr Carlos Tello, ambassador to all the former Soviet republics apart from the Baltics. 'But I tell them that logically it must have a good ending because in Mexican soap operas the bad people have to lose and the good people have to win.' Not since Soviet factories came to a standstill to watch the country's first independent sessions of parliament under President Mikhail Gorbachev has television had the power to stop a great nation in its tracks. At a time when the novelty of glasnost has worn off and people are fed up with politics, the programme offers half an hour of escape to people ground down by economic hardship. 'It's wonderful,' exclaims Ms Olga Kovolyova, a teacher in her 40s. 'For a while I can forget all the troubles of my life in Moscow. The people are beautiful, the houses are grand. They never have to worry about cooking or buying food, and wrongdoing is punished, which never happens in our life.' The sets are prosaic and the acting over the top, but the plot is grippingly simple. Love triumphs, even though men can be blind and evil temporarily gains the upper hand. This week for instance, Marianna has finally found the son she gave away to a lottery ticket seller 18 years ago (this happened when she was in a state of delirium three weeks ago). Now she has to find a way of telling the lottery ticket seller, whose life she has just saved, that she wants her son back. She also has to convince Luis Alberto, who caused her to give away the child by not believing it was his, to drop charges against their son without yet telling him that the boy who broke into their house was the infant she gave away. Despite the embarrassing 1970s style of dress and the simplistic dialogue, it all looks and sounds good to Russians. Even the poor have nice flats. 'This has a comforting effect on viewers. They want things to be such in their own lives,' says Ms Maria Starostina, deputy head of programming at Ostankino, which beams programmes all over the Commonwealth of Independent States. The series is the second or third most watched programme after a game show called Wonderland and the evening news. Both Ostankino and the Mexican embassy have been flooded with thousands of fan letters, including a 24-page poem from Belarus. Is there life after The Rich Also Cry? Perhaps. The Russians are now negotiating to obtain the rights to that other blockbuster, Dallas.</p>

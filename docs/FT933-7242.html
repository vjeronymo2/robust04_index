			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Import rules are no solution (2) Sir, C Fred Bergsten's article presents a plausible case for the limited use of VIEs as a means of expanding trade, especially with Japan. But there are three significant faults in his argument. First, in saying that VIEs enhance trade and should be applauded not condemned by free traders he fails to appreciate that free traders do not support an increase in international trade for its own sake. Rather, what we argue is that it is only possible to identify fully and capture the benefits of wealth-enhancing international trade within a free trade regime. Not all trade is wealth-enhancing; sometimes it is quite the reverse, either because of commercial misjudgment or government interference. The apparent rigour of Mr Bergsten's article is vitiated by the absence of any measure of whether particular VIEs would be wealth-enhancing or not. How would he go about finding out? Second, like many other sensible people who share his view, Mr Bergsten devotes a significant part of his article to pointing out the dangers of VIEs and the limits that must be placed on their use. But he seems oblivious to the possibility that domestic producer lobbies and their trade unionist allies will succeed in capturing any measure designed to manipulate trade. Mr Bergsten admits to unleashing a tiger but expects to control it by relying on the impartial prudence of governments. Is this a sensible risk to invite us to take? And what of its effect in undermining Gatt. Lastly, Mr Bergsten is right to say that the Japanese economy would benefit from the removal of residual protection in Japan. But just because something is good for your neighbour does not mean he will not resist if you seek to force it on him. Increased Japanese assertiveness in declining to co-operate with US trade initiatives is hardly to be wondered at and illustrates the likely ineffectiveness of Mr Bergsten's remedies. Cobden understood this. When Britain was moving over to free trade in the 19th century he argued against seeking even to persuade - let alone force other countries - to reciprocate on the grounds that to do so would only make the whole effort look like a British plot. Better let Britain adopt free trade in her own interests and let others learn from her example. Although not guaranteeing success, that approach is a great deal more likely to be effective than coercion. At a time when the international trading arena is absorbing tremendous change, the very least that the US and Europe owe the rest of the world is the power of such an example.

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Horsham to take energy unit public in Dollars 150m issue Horsham, the Toronto-based holding company controlled by financier Mr Peter Munk, plans to take its wholly-owned Clark USA Oil Refining Unit public with a USDollars 150m offer of 7.5m new common shares at Dollars 20 each. Horsham will retain two-thirds of the Clark shares and may buy 10 per cent of the new issue. The offer is being underwritten by a syndicate led by Kidder Peabody, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and BT Securities. Clark is also offering CDollars 100m (USDollars 72.4m) of unsecured senior notes through a syndicate led by Kidder Peabody, BT Securities, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Proceeds of both offerings will be used to finance part of Clark's acquisition of Chevron's Port Arthur refinery and to retire half of Clark's zero-coupon notes maturing in 2000. Mr Munk holds control of American Barrick Resources, the world's third-largest gold producer, and Trizec, a North American property group, through Horsham.</p>

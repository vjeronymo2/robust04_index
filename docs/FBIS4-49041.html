			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ying Qian (2019 6197)] </F>   [Text] Chicago, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Zou Jiahua, Chinese  State Council vice premier, visited the U.S. AMOCO oil company,  which has enjoyed long-term cooperative relations with China in  Chicago on 29 April, and had a discussion with the person in  charge of the company about the possibility of further expanding  cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.    AMOCO is a big enterprise occupying an important position in  the international oil and natural gas field. It began  cooperation with China in oil exploration and production and  petrochemical industry in the late seventies. It is the first  U.S. company to sign an agreement with China on oil exploration  on land. It also participates in the development of oil fields  in the South China Sea.    AMOCO Chairman (Lawrence Fuller) and others accorded a warm  reception to the visiting Chinese guests at the company's head  office in an 80 story building in the center of Chicago. He  reviewed the company's fruitful cooperation with China in the  past and presented a concept of further participating in China's  energy development. Zou Jiahua expressed his appreciation and  support for AMOCO's policy and plan that attach importance to  long-term cooperation with China.    At a banquet hosted by (Fuller) in honor of Zou Jiahua and  his party in the evening, (Fuller) said he believed Vice Premier  Zou Jiahua's visit will play a role in promoting the company's  friendly cooperation with China as well as the development of  U.S.-Chinese relations.    Addressing the banquet, Zou Jiahua expressed thanks to AMOCO  for its efforts for the unconditional renewal of the  most-favored-nation status by the United States for China and  for its support for the restoration of China's position as a  GATT signatory.    He said economic relations and trade between the two  countries have enjoyed continuous development through the joint  efforts of the Chinese and American peoples, U.S. industrial and  commercial enterprises, and U.S. personages with breadth of  vision. He pointed out that there is a very strong possibility  for Chinese and U.S. economies to supplement each other, and  that economic relations and trade between the two will surely  further enjoy rapid development so long as both sides solve the  problems that crop up on the basis of equality and mutual  benefit.    Prior to the banquet, the China National Petroleum  Corporation and AMOCO signed a "letter of intent on cooperation  in conducting research in coal seam and gas at areas south of  the Eerduosi Pendi [Basin]."    In the morning, Zou Jiahua and his party visited Motorola,  Inc. near Chicago.</p>

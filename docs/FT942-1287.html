			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Solidere at 11% premium Shares in Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn Lebanese company created to develop central Beirut, opened the first day of trading yesterday at Dollars 111, an 11 per cent premium to the issue price, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The secondary market in Solidere stock, which will be the foundation of a revived Beirut bourse, opened under the auspices of the Societe Financiere du Liban, owned by Lebanon's commercial banks. The Solidere price was agreed at a morning fix, under a trading system developed by Andersen Consultants. Around 100 shares were traded as investors tested the market. A second daily price fix will be introduced on Monday and a third soon thereafter. Trading is currently limited to 'B' shares, which were issued in an offer to Arab investors late last year. Trade in 'A' shares, which Solidere exchanged for titles to land in central Beirut, will open only once the final allocation has been decided - a process still undergoing a judicial review.</p>

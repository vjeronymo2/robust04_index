			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> After reading some "negative fallout" regarding the Nov. 7 telecast of  "thirtysomething" featuring two gay men, I wanted to put in my two cents. I  thought it was a wonderful episode. After initially not liking the show, I have  sampled it now and again and have become a regular viewer. The show's story  lines have become less whiny and more to the core/soul of what it is to be  human.  </P> <P> The episode was a brilliant examination of how hard it is in this day and age  to make a commitment among males, females, gays and heterosexuals. The  "cocktails-before-dinner" scene with Melissa's wild imaginings about her new  young beau and the black-and-white dream boxing scene between Melissa's good  and bad self both showed creativity and imagination, two qualities sadly  lacking in television these days.  </P> <P> Debra J.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first special forces battalion of the new  Mozambican army received its stripes at the training center  situated in the Nacala Air Force Base in Nampula Province. The  harsh and weary course lasted for 10 weeks. The battalion  consists of 31 officers, 62 noncommissioned officers, and 252  troops. A total of 116 men was excluded from the course.    The UN Operations in Mozambique says it is looking for an  area where the battalion will be stationed. The battalion is  supposed to be the embryo of the Mozambique Defense Armed  Forces' [FADM] Special Forces. The commander of the Portuguese  training team noted that the battalion requires special weapons  and modern equipment, as well as a sound logistics system. He  said it is important that the battalion is correctly used, and  its responsibilities clearly defined. He added: Mozambique's  armed forces requirements should consider quality first instead  of quantity.    Generals Tobias Dai for the government and Herminio Morais  for the Mozambique National Resistance attended the ceremony.  Aldo Ajello and the Portuguese ambassador to Mozambique were  also present. Dai said the training of FADM is an irreversible  process, noting that the establishment of nonpartisan, career,  and competent armed forces is a fact. He pledged greater  government assistance to the new battalion, while Herminio de  Morais asked the Mozambique Government to provide suitable  logistical conditions for the new army.    In addition to the special forces battalion, the course also  trained Mozambican instructors who will train new recruits in  future courses. They will be assisted by Portuguese instructors.</p>

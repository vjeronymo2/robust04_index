			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Major switches attack to tax as jobless rises MR JOHN MAJOR signalled the start of a fierce Conservative onslaught on Labour's tax plans last night as news of another steep rise in the unemployment total delivered a jolt to the prime minister's election campaign. In what his cabinet colleagues said marked the beginning of an unrelenting effort to 'shred' Mr John Smith's shadow Budget, Mr Major said Labour planned 'the biggest increase in personal tax since the war'. He also joined in his party's attacks on Mr Neil Kinnock, arguing that the 'question of leadership' was central to the election. His speech, at the first large Conservative rally of the campaign in Manchester, came as official figures showed that unemployment rose by a further 40,200 last month to its highest level for 4 1/2 years. The seasonally adjusted jobless total has risen for 22 consecutive months to stand 1.05m higher than at its low-point in the spring of 1990. Mr Kinnock, describing the jobless figures as 'utterly appalling', told a Labour rally in Birmingham that his party's plans for investment, training and reviving confidence offered the only opportunity to 'ignite recovery'. His colleagues said the rise in unemployment would keep the recession at the centre of the election campaign. Their confidence was strengthened by evidence that dole queues lengthened most last month in the main election battlegrounds of the south-east, Greater London, the south-west and West Midlands. Unemployment in the traditional Tory heartland of the south-east outside London has increased by 184 per cent over the past two years. In Greater London, unemployment stands at 10 per cent, having more than doubled since January 1990. As the first week of the election campaign drew to a close there was a grudging acceptance among senior Conservatives that the Labour party had got off to the stronger start. In spite of the volatility of opinion polls, the underlying message appears to be that Mr Smith's alternative Budget and the gloomy economic news on output and employment had left Labour with a slight lead. Only three of the past 12 opinion polls have shown a Conservative lead. The FT's weighted average of the past six polls points to a two-point Labour advantage. The same mood was reflected in the FT Election Share Index of politically sensitive shares, which again swung towards stocks that might gain from a Labour victory. The 'Labour gainers' section of the index rose strongly, to 99.6, less than half a percentage point below the level at which they started the campaign. 'Conservative gainers' dropped again, to 95.5, some 4 1/2 percentage points below their announcement-day level. Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, signalled that his party would play the 'tax card' with a ferocity which would stop Labour in its tracks in the final three weeks of the election campaign. That strategy was reflected in the sharpness of Mr Major's language during a day on the campaign trail. Jostled during a rowdy demonstration in Bolton, he blamed the 'ugly face' of Labour. He told the Manchester rally that Labour was the party of 'envy' and 'spite'. And he said of Labour's plans to abolish the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and increase the top rate of tax: 'No one at any stage in the history of Britain has launched such an onslaught on the security of hard-working middle income families.' Yesterday's economic news was not as bad as 'black Thursday' a month ago, when news of the big jump in January unemployment coincided with a sharp rise in house repossessions and a significant fall in manufacturing investment. But other officials figures released yesterday underlined the severity of the recession. The Central Statistical Office reported that output by the service sector, which accounts for three-fifths of the economy and includes retailing, transport and government services such as education, fell by a record 1.6 per cent last year. Investment by industrial and commercial companies, excluding electricity, fell 16 per cent last year - the highest figure since records began in 1963. Gross trading profits made by industrial and commercial companies, leaving aside oil and electricity, fell more sharply during 1991 than at any time in the previous 17 years.

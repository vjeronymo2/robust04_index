			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Bonds: New Zealand FRN expected New Zealand is expected to raise Dollars 1bn in the Eurobond market today through an offering of five-year floating-rate notes. Morgan Stanley and UBS have been awarded the mandate. The discounted margin on the notes is likely to be set at Libor less  1/8 . Syndicate managers have been waiting for New Zealand to tap the Eurobond market ever since the country's finance minister, Mr Bill Birch, visited leading financial centres at the beginning of the month. Mr Birch's international tour, the aim of which was to highlight New Zealand's economic progress, came hard on the heels of news in late February that Moody's, the international credit rating agency, had placed New Zealand's Aa3 foreign currency debt rating on review for a possible upgrade. Syndicate managers involved in the deal said the proceeds were likely to be used to refinance New Zealand's maturing debt. Mr Birch told reporters in Wellington yesterday that the government had decided not to cut its NZDollars 4.45bn bond tender programme in 1993-94 because it had a large amount of maturing debt to roll over this year. However, Mr Birch added that surplus money raised by the programme would be used to help repay New Zealand's NZDollars 66.7bn foreign debt, which he said was too high. L-Bank, the recently re-named state development agency of Baden-Wurttemberg, is considering launching its first global bond offering later this week. The deal will be lead-managed by Deutsche Bank, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers and will raise DM3bn. The borrower is thought to be leaning towards a five-year maturity. L-Bank officials told investors recently that they planned to raise Dollars 8bn out of a total annual funding programme of around Dollars 10bn through four global bond offerings, denominated equally in dollars and D-Marks. Among yesterday's offerings, Ford Credit Europe took advantage of improving conditions in the German government bond market to launch its first Eurobond offering denominated in D-Marks. The five-year deal raised DM200m and was priced to yield 50 basis points over five-year German government notes. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said the yield spread compared favourably with secondary market spreads on D-Mark Eurobonds issued by other motor companies. For example, Volkswagen's recent five-year deal yielded 35 basis points over German government notes, Merrill said. Ford's bonds remained in syndicate overnight and were expected to appeal mainly to retail investors. Elsewhere, the Republic of Austria was attracted by the aggressive funding levels available in the Eurolira sector and raised L200bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. One syndicate manager familiar with the Eurolira sector estimated that Austria had achieved a funding level of 70 basis points below lira-Libor but he added that the borrower would have had to give up 10 basis points in order to swap the proceeds into dollars. Lead manager Deutsche Bank said the bonds were sold into Germany and the Benelux region and appealed to investors who believed the lira would strengthen once the Italian general election was over.</p>

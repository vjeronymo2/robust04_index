			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Archer case review rejected The government yesterday rejected Labour calls for a Crown Prosecution Service review of the Department of Trade and Industry decision not to prosecute Lord Archer for placing orders to buy Anglia Television shares. Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said there was 'no case' for a review of the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The decision was 'wholly consistent' with advice from an independent QC, taken by Mr Heseltine after he received a report on the deal from DTI inspectors. Mr Hamilton said in a letter to Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary: 'I therefore reject entirely any suggestion that this decision, or indeed the decision to confirm the existence of the investigation, was tainted by partiality.' His letter followed an admission by Lord Archer, the Conservative peer and best-selling novelist, that it was a 'grave error' to have placed orders to buy shares in Anglia, of which his wife is a director, shortly before a takeover bid. Mr Cook said the letter left a number of unanswered questions about the deal, including why Lord Archer did not use his usual broker. He said: 'This is not a controversy that is going to go away quickly. Michael Heseltine, or any other Tory minister, is not a proper person to decide whether a senior Tory politician should face prosecution. 'So long as the decision on that is left to a Tory minister, the suspicion will linger that political considerations played a part.' It emerged yesterday that ministers and officials may be questioned on the affair by the Commons trade and industry committee when parliament reconvenes in the autumn.</p>

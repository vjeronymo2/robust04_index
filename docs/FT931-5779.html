			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The Sheffield way THE 1.5 per cent limit on public sector pay increases announced last autumn is beginning to work. Although the bargaining season proper does not start until April, the government's virtual freeze may stick. The National Health Service unions have rejected 1.5 per cent, but there is no expectation that this will lead to strikes. Teachers have been awarded a similar increase, as have the armed forces. Other public-sector employers, such as British Rail, the post office and the civil service, know the facts of contemporary pay bargaining. More to the point, local authorities are getting the same message. Kent County Council was the first to announce a 1.5 per cent increase for its white-collar workers, starting in April. Some 20,000 Sheffield council employees have voted to accept a 3.25 per cent cut in pay, in exchange for shorter working hours. The alternative was 1,400 redundancies. The driving force in this instance was not so much the government's pay ceiling as the realisation by the Labour-run council that it is obliged to produce a budget that does not breach the limit set by the Department of the Environment. The department's principal objective has been to ease the new council tax into its first year of operation; it has made it clear that it will not hesitate to cap local budgets where necessary. Some private companies are proving less resolute than the government. According to Incomes Data Services, settlement levels fell steadily last year, in response to lower inflation and the persistent recession. Yet more than half of the 110 deals recorded in January were for increases of between 3 and 4 per cent. The trend is towards the lower end of that range. The CBI estimates that in the final quarter of 1992 manufacturing pay awards averaged 2.8 per cent, while service sector increases averaged 3.2 per cent. The variations at the extremes are mildly encouraging. The number of freezes and pay pauses is increasing, and settlements higher than 5 per cent are reported less often. If the steady downwards pressure is maintained, the benefits of devaluation may last. This assumes that the government's freeze is not followed next year by the sequel to all previous pay freezes - a catch-up explosion.</p>

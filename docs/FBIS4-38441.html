			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Russia's Choice parliamentary group  Yegor Gaydar believes that the country cannot afford the Army in  its present form. The Army is chronically financed improperly  and begins to lag behind rivals technically because it is too  big for Russian resources. Gaydar spoke on Saturday at a Moscow  conference of supporters of forming a party on the basis of  Russia's Choice.    Gaydar said Russia inherited from the Soviet Union an army  that is meant for an absolutely different number of conscripts.  "We are trying to adjust the number of conscripts to the number  of our generals instead of doing it the other way round", Gaydar  said.    "We need a well-armed, well-paid, well-fed professional and  respected army, but it should be notably reformed for the  purpose", Gaydar said. According to him, if this problem is not  resolved the problems of raising taxes and curtailing inflation  will never be resolved and the country will continue printing  worthless money.    Meanwhile, Russia's Choice, Gaydar said, does not support  the  proposal to boost the defence budget to 55 billion rubles.  During the coming budget debate in the Duma Gaydar intends to  insist on the submission to parliament of a program of cuts in  armed forces.</p>

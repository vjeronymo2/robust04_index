			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to Andras Agoston, chairman of the  Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], a new  wave of migration may begin, because the Hungarians in Vojvodina  feel that their suffering will not end in the near future.  Judit Laszlo reports.    [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Andras Agoston called it a rumor  that the VMDK will be the socialists' coalition partner. The  Hungarians of Vojvodina wish to ask the English, French, and  Russian leaders of the peace process for advice on the formation  of an internationally legitimate government, without the  intervention of foreign countries in rump Yugoslavia's domestic  issues.    According to Deputy Chairman Janos Vekas, Hungary's help is  also needed in settling the issue. Therefore, the VMDK has  launched an initiative for the parties of the Hungarian  parliament and the political forces of the Hungarians beyond the  borders to issue a joint declaration to the effect that they  wish to realize their national policy interests jointly. In  this declaration, the VMDK demands every form of political  autonomy, said Deputy Chairman Janos Vekas.</p>

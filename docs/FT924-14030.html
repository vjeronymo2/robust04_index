			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Caucasus crisis lures Moscow into old imperial role: If Russia is involved in Abkhazia, it is giving clear signals of a wish to control at least part of the region beyond its border THE AIRPORT at Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, is thronged with soldiers wearing the uniforms of at least four different bands - or no uniform in particular. Further north, in Sukhumi, the capital of the war-torn autonomous region of Abkhazia, soldiers supervising the loading of refugees into aircraft are as hysterical as the fleeing women - fighting among themselves, screaming and pushing at their charges and delaying the whole process with their inefficiency. In this former Soviet republic now descending into impoverished disorder, being the only candidate helped Mr Eduard Shevardnadze achieve a sweeping election victory at the weekend: indeed, no-one stood against him because no-one thought they could - or wanted to - beat him. The former Soviet foreign minister won three times more votes than needed to become the leader of the Transcaucasian state. In an estimated 80 per cent turnout, voters defied appeals for a boycott by supporters of the ousted president Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia and gave Mr Shevardnadze more than 90 per cent of the vote. Mr Shevardnadze says his mandate now is to bring peace, prosperity and democracy to his 5m-strong country. His first task, however, is to wage more active war on the forces of the Abkhazians and their allies, which have succeeded over the past three weeks in pushing Georgian troops out of much of Abkhazia, save for the encircled units in the capital of Sukhumi. The Abkhazian separatists, lead by Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, wants to attach Abkhazia to Russia - citing a fear of Georgian oppression. In 1989, it was demonstrations for Abkhazian independence from Georgia and for attachment to Russia (though Abkhazians make up less than 20 per cent of the population of Abkhazia, the Georgians more than 40 per cent) which sparked off demonstrations in Tbilisi for Georgian independence from Russia. Now, the Abkhazians are supported by the Confederation of Caucasian Mountain People - a mainly Moslem, pan-Caucasian organisation which is violently against the Shevardnadze regime and yearns for a Caucasian state. In Sukhumi, among the few Abkhazians left is a former minister of the republic's government who has seen his fellow Abkhazians driven out of the city after Georgian troops entered it at the beginning of last month and who recounts tales of theft and beatings. Indeed, during an interview in his flat, three Georgian soldiers burst in, guns at the ready, having been alerted by neighbours of the presence of the foreign press in the 'Abkhazians' house'. After an uncomfortable few minutes an officer arrived and took the men away. Out on the 'frontline' along the river Gumista a few miles from Sukhumi, the two sides, only 200 yards apart, trade light arms fire from behind walls and dugouts. Mr Khaindrava said at the weekend: 'We expect an attack at any time, but we are ready.' The most serious charge is the involvement of Russian soldiers. The allegation is that Russian units, with civilian volunteers from the Russian north Caucasian republics just over the Georgian/Russian border, form the backbone of the Abkhazian forces - especially when they took the town of Gagra earlier this month. The Russian units are alleged to be controlled by General Georgi Kondratyev, the Russian deputy defence minister, and General Pavel Sigutkin, commander of the big Russian air base at Gudauta, in Abkhazia - where war material is unloaded and used on the Abkhazian side. In the sophisticated version of this charge - used by Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Khaindrava - Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is being led by the nose by 'reactionary circles' in Russia. There is no proof of the involvement, and it is denied by the Russian defence ministry: however, the volunteers from the Caucasian states enter Abkhazia freely, and the Abkhazians are well armed. Russia was also accused by Ukraine last night of sending nine warships to the area off Sukhumi. A Ukrainian navy spokesman said some 2,500 seamen were aboard the ships, which included a large cruiser, two minesweepers and at least one vessel for seaborne troops. If the conflict is not stopped, it will consume Georgeia - inevitably reviving the conflict in the South Ossetian region to the north, where peace between the Georgians and Ossetians is kept by Russian soldiers. If the Russians really are intervening - albeit without direct authority from the president - they are giving clear signals that they wish to control at least part of the Caucasus outside Russia. Meanwhile, the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh has recently escalated as more powerful Azerbaijan seeks to reverse Armenian gains made in the spring. Russia, though urged by Armenia (a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States) to assist it, has sought to keep a balance: Mr Yeltsin yesterday signed a treaty of co-operation and security with Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the Azeri president. Mr Shevardnadze said yesterday he was ready to meet Mr Yeltsin in or near Sukhumi today. However, a spokesman for Mr Yeltsin in Moscow said a delay in the planned talks was necessary to work out 'new elements' in the process. The three Caucasian states are not the only legacies of the Soviet imperium, but they are the most complex and violent. As the CIS further weakens, and as Russia defines its national interest more in classic terms of regional power bargaining and pressure than in efforts to create a co-operative commonwealth, so its meddling in these historically swirling waters must increase.</p>

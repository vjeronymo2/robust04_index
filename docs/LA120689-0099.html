			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Detroit Papers Increase Prices: The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press  will increase their single-copy price to 25 cents from 15 cents and 20 cents  respectively on Saturday. The increases had been anticipated since the  beginning of a partial merger of the papers Nov. 27. Advertisers also will  begin paying more soon because of the joint operating agreement, under which  all non-editorial functions of the papers were merged under the Detroit  Newspaper Agency. The combined Sunday edition of the newspaper will go from 75  cents a copy to $1 effective Sunday.  </P></p>

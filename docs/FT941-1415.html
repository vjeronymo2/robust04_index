			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Anger at Scottish council's Elf loan Orkney Islands Council has agreed to make an interest-free loan of Pounds 15m to help the oil company Elf Enterprise win new business in the North Sea for its Flotta oil terminal on Orkney. The loan, believed to be unprecedented, sparked anger in Orkney yesterday. The money will go toward funding a project to bring gas condensate and natural gas liquids from the Britannia field. Chevron and Conoco, which will operate the field, have yet to decide how and where to transport its output. The Pounds 15m will come from Orkney Council's harbour equalisation fund, set up in the 1970s to accumulate revenues from the Flotta terminal and prolong its life. The fund stands at about Pounds 60m. The Flotta terminal receives oil from Elf Enterprise's Piper and Claymore fields, as well as some smaller fields. Although it is handling between 310,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil a day, the flow is expected to decline early in the next decade. The fund was set up to help keep the terminal running after the flow of oil has fallen to an uneconomic level. Chevron and Conoco expect the Britannia field to come into production by the end of 1998. They have the choice of piping the condensate either to Flotta or to Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire. An alternative is to order a concrete instead of a steel production platform. This would enable the condensate to be stored under the plaform and shipped out in tankers, a solution unlikely to involve Flotta. Orkney Council said the loan would be spent on building a spur pipeline from Brittannia to the Flotta pipeline. The loan, which it said was being made at Elf Enterprise's request, is guaranteed by a consortium of banks and is dependent on the success of the move to bring Britannia's output to Flotta. Mr Iain Macdonald, a council member, said other councillors had agreed to the loan after minimal consultation. 'We were railroaded,' he said. Elf Enterprise indicated that both it and the council had an interest in prolonging the life of the terminal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/21/94 --  Commenting on the results of negotiations in Moscow, Acting  Chairman of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Supreme  Council Karen Baburyan said that "Azerbaijan is trying to fail  (the implementation) of Russian and other projects, clearly  understanding that stationing of disengagement troops in the  conflict zone would be a serious obstacle for restarting  military operations against Mountainous Karabakh. Nevertheless,  all conditions necessary for stopping the war are present today,  and peace completely depends on the will of the Azeri  Government. Karabakh will do its best to reach stability in the  region."    The RMK military observers believe Baku is trying to build  an  image that Russia is unable to create peace in Transcaucasia.  Therefore, the declaration of Russian Deputy Defense Minister  Georgiy Kondratyev about Russia having to stop the mediation  efforts, if Azerbaijan doesn't sign the agreement, is quite  understandable.</p>

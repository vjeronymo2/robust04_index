			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Provident Financial ahead 54% to Pounds 62.5m Provident Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.5m for 1993, a 54 per cent increase over the previous year's restated Pounds 40.7m. Earnings per share rose by 47 per cent to 31.43p and a recommended 46 per cent rise in the final dividend to 11.25p makes a 16p (11.4p) total. Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said profitability had benefited from the steps taken over the last couple of years to rationalise the group's operations by reorganising the continuing businesses and disposing of underperforming subsidiaries. Borrowings fell from Pounds 228m at the start of 1993 to Pounds 187m at the year-end, reflecting partly the receipt of Pounds 30m from the sale of Bradford-based Peoples Bank and the business of Peoples Motor Finance. The group has reduced its offices to 267 (360) and cut the number of its employees from 4,100 to 3,500. Its self-employed sales force who act as agents in the home collecting credit operation, the main business, has also dropped in size slightly. It offers unsecured loans, mostly to tenants on council estates, on which it charges high rates of interest to compensate for collection costs and risk. Pre-tax profits for the home collected credit division increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 58.1m. Bad debt charges were broadly the same as in 1992, after two years in which they increased. However, because credit issued and collected rose by 7 per cent the charges fell as a proportion of total credit. The group is 'hoping, but not expecting', that charges for bad debts might go down in 1994. The insurance division doubled its pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.8m. The main growth in the underwriting business came from Halifax Insurance, which increased its policyholder numbers to 618,000 (400,000) at the year-end Mr van Kuffeler said motor premiums levelled off in the last quarter of 1993, after nine months of strong growth. He did not expect similarly strong growth in 1994. Halifax Insurance also benefited from a payment from Halifax building society for purchasing its trademarks, and is now being renamed Provident Insurance. A Pounds 2m restructuring provision was made to cover the setting up of a pilot telephone sales operation as part of Colonnade Insurance brokers, where trading profits rose from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 900,000. The company has lost customers to direct writers, and the group is rationalising its activities. About 20 of its 120 branches are expected to close during the year. Provident's shares closed 10p lower at 499p.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt slips back after hitting all time high Early gains on most senior bourses had disappeared by mid-afternoon yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose to a new all-time high on short covering, the DAX index hitting an intraday 2,187.28, and lost the better part of its gains thereafter. The index closed 11.62 higher at 2,172.75 and shed most of that gain in the post bourse, where the Ibis-indicated close was 2,163.82. Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the market began to look uncomfortable at lunchtime when the DAX future, usually quoted at a premium to the cash market, was actually quoted at a discount for a while. 'Many insurance companies had hedged their portfolios by selling futures rather than the cash market,' said Mr Wiecking, 'and then had to buy the futures back.' Turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM9.4bn. Metallgesellschaft fell another DM30, or 9.3 per cent to DM293 on its recent, poor results and liquidity problems associated with oil market contracts. AEG fell another DM6 to DM169 after an earlier run-up on restructuring hopes. Thyssen, strong late last week, put on DM5 to DM264.50 on a report that the group would consider pulling out of the steel business entirely, in order to protect the 60 per cent of its workforce in other areas; among the other risers, the chemicals, precious metals and pharmaceuticals group, Degussa, climbed DM10 to DM463 ahead of its preliminary results for 1993. PARIS had a morning in positive territory, but ended with the CAC-40 index 1.82 lower at 2,196.31 after the EC Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said in the afternoon that some details of the GATT talks would have to be worked out after the December 15 deadline. Turnover rose from FFr3.34bn to FFr3.9bn. Eurotunnel jumped by 6.3 per cent, rising FFr2.65 to FFr44.75 in heavy volume of 5.8m shares following the handover of the tunnel, said brokers, and acceptance by Transmarche Link of the principle of being paid in Eurotunnel shares. The defence and electronics group, Thomson-CSF, was up FFr4.70 at FFr159.70. Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, fell FFr2.60 to FFr417.80. The chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, Rhone-Poulenc, fell FFr2.60 to FFr149.50 on an earnings downgrade by Goldman Sachs. After hours, its merger with Institut Merieux was postponed as the latter estimated the cost to profits, this year and next, of withdrawing albumin products. ZURICH stayed on the upgrade and set a new high, the SMI index adding 15.7 to 2,876.9 on the outlook for interest rates and corporate profits. Alusuisse, a recent laggard, rose SFr11 to a year's high of SFr587 on strong demand from US funds which are turning their attention to cyclicals from banks and pharmaceuticals. A rise in aluminium prices was attributed to reports that Russia was considering a 10 per cent cut in production to reduce the current glut which has depressed world markets. Swiss Reinsurance added SFr10 to SFr770 on the view that the shares had more upward potential once the current rights issue had been digested by the market. AMSTERDAM drifted lower amid light futures-related selling, although the undertone remained firm. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.1 to 139.9. Royal Dutch added 90 cents to Fl 196.70 on reports that the government would lift a 10-year ban on offshore gas and oil drilling in the environmentally sensitive Wadden Sea at a news conference after the market closed. The area contains 100bn-200bn cubic metres of natural gas and an unknown quantity of oil. Unilever shed Fl 2.60 to Fl 219.20: the recent high share price has prompted Goldman Sachs to remove it from its recommended list. Van Ommeren picked up Fl 1.50 to Fl 49.10 and Pakhoed Fl 1.10 to Fl 42.60: both fell sharply on Friday when the government announced it was moving its strategic oil reserves from Rotterdam Port to German salt caves. MILAN resumed its advance, although shares were unable to maintain their best levels amid some late profit-taking ahead of tomorrow's end of the December account. The Comit index added 5.34 to 588.45. Renewed enthusiasm for privatisation candidates helped the market along. Sip added L65 or 1.9 per cent to L3,410 and Stet rose L105 or 2.7 per cent to L4,020. Credito Italiano slid L30 to L2,350 on profit-taking after its strong gains last week when its share offer was heavily oversubscribed. Fiat added L111 to L4,276 as interest in the company's rights spread out to the ordinary shares. Rights not taken up from the recent issue are being traded on the market this week. DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index picked up 15.70 to 1,838.63, the market driven by strong foreign demand for Smurfit. The paper and packaging group, a laggard early in the year, added another 7p to IPounds 2.95: it has risen from a low of IPounds 2.20 at the end of October in line with an improving paper sector on Wall Street. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index added 7.2 at 1,357.8, helped by a SKr12 rise in Ericsson 'B' to SKr332 as foreign selling pressure eased.

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Nuclear graveyard claims denied The Ministry of Defence yesterday denied Labour claims that it plans to turn the Rosyth naval dockyard into a 'graveyard' for decommissioned nuclear-powered submarines. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said that leaked government documents showed that seven obsolete nuclear submarines were to be dumped at the yard. Mr Brown, whose Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth, said that safety regulations were to be relaxed, leaving the area without proper protection. He said that plans to move the navy office responsible for nuclear safety to Faslane, on the Clyde, and to base tugs used for moving submarines at Devonport were 'completely unacceptable'. He added: 'We will not allow the Rosyth area to be frozen by nuclear dumping or becoming a nuclear graveyard. The government proposals cannot be allowed to go ahead.' The MoD said that no decision had been made to lay up nuclear powered submarines at Rosyth, and denied that the relocation of the navy office would affect safety. It added: 'Laid-up nuclear-powered submarines present no hazard to the general public or the dockyard workforce. There is thus absolutely no reason why they should have any bearing at all on redevelopment possibilities at Rosyth.' There was no difficulty associated with the stationing of tugs at Devonport because movements of nuclear submarines at Rosyth would be very infrequent and planned well in advance. Seven nuclear-powered boats are laid up, four at Rosyth and three at Devonport. A further four are expected to be decommissioned by the end of the century. The radioactive spent fuel and nuclear cores are removed from decommissioned boats and the hulls are sealed while the level of radioactivity in the reactor compartments declines. The Rosyth naval base, which is next to the dockyard, was downgraded to a support establishment under cost-cutting plans announced last month by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. The cuts will have a substantial impact on the local economy. The civilian workforce will fall from 1,300 to 600 and the number of service personnel will be cut from 1,800 to 300.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Prices cut in battle for electricity sales More than 7,000 large consumers of electricity are to buy from a supplier other than their regional power company for the first time next month, taking advantage of the opening of their market to competition. Many more among the 45,000 power users able to shop around for supplies from April 1 have signed deals with local distributors that will give them significant price reductions. Eligible users include industrial concerns, supermarkets, large schools and hospitals. Some distributors - including Manweb, in the north-west of England and in north Wales, and Midlands Electricity - say they have offered consumers outside their regions price cuts of up to 20 per cent. Most reductions fall within 4 per cent and 10 per cent. Some consumers enjoying lower tariffs have received no immediate financial benefit. The reductions stem from the second stage of the liberalisation of the electricity market, which will allow users of between 100kW and 1MW at their period of peak consumption to pick from any licensed supplier. Until April 1 they have had to buy from their regional distributor. Only consumers of more than 1MW had a choice of supplier. By 1998, all consumers, including householders, will be able to select their supplier. To take advantage of the deregulated system from April 1, eligible consumers should already have signed contracts with a supplier, which should have registered the arrangement with the electricity pool, through which power is traded. Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said the organisation knew of 7,300 deals involving a customer and a supplier other than their regional distributor. 'We expect that figure to grow perhaps by about double,' she said. Consumers can still sign deals. The pool requires 20 working days' notice before agreements come into effect. Most regional power companies say consumers with lower demand, perhaps 100kW to 300kW, are less interested in shopping around. Some users in that category complain of difficulty in persuading power companies to make acceptable offers. Powerline, the supply subsidiary of Midlands Electricity, says it has targeted smaller companies and, partly as a result, has won 1,000 sites outside its area. MEB, Northern, Eastern Electricity, East Midlands Electricity, and generators PowerGen and National Power are said to be among the most active in the market.</p>

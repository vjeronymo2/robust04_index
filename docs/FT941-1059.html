			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Skiing: Head for the hills in a helicopter - Affordable flights offer fresh views of the dramatic Dolomites High in the mighty Dolomites, Danilo aimed the helicopter at a yawning cavity in the rockface of Sassolungo, the 10,433ft peak which towers above Val Gardena. Below us was a narrow, fearsome-looking snow-filled gulley, known to locals as the Jaws of Death. At any moment I expected Danilo to climb steeply but instead he kept going, squeezing the helicopter through the gap. Before we had caught our breath we were swooping low over another snow-filled eyrie - and another couloir where only intrepid skiers dare to tread. We continued to weave our way through the impossibly sheer giant walls and pinnacles of the rest of the Gruppo Sella range, swooping up the steep gully we were ourselves about to ski: the Val di Mesdi. The unusual shape of the Dolomites - gigantic, often vertical slabs of granite - produces a dramatic contrast in the ski terrain. The off-piste chutes and gullies are challenging, some seriously so. They are also pretty inaccessible. If, like the majority of skiers you ski round the Dolomites, rather than down them, the pistes are, by and large, fairly gentle. In good weather, the Sella Ronda tour, a day-long circuit from resort to resort of 20 miles or so, depending on your route, is a delight. Little mountain villages and towns such as Colfosco, Corvara, Canazei, and Arabba drift past you all day as you ski from button lift to chair and gondola to cable car (there are more than 200 lifts to choose from), pausing at one of scores of mountain restaurants and huts for lunch or refresh-ment. What makes the tour so enjoyable are the ever-changing mountain vistas. The towering massifs create an almost prehistoric arena. Yet skiers on this whistle-stop tour between the Sella, Pordoi, Campolongo and Gardena passes probably give little thought to what might lurk above them in the craggy heights. Those who like their runs a little tougher hike up on skins to finds out. Now you can do it the easy way: hitch a ride on a helicopter. The Val di Mesdi run is certainly not as challenging as the Jaws of Death but still daunting for the average recreational skier. It starts at 9,280ft on the rim of a craggy inverted archway near the summit of Sas Pordoi, another of the towering peaks in the Gruppo Sella, which dominate the Selva skyline. Technically the run is no more serious than Verbier's Mont Fort or the Swiss Wall at Avoriaz. What makes it challenging psychologically is its comparative narrowness and the colossal impact of the sheer walls of dolomite which enclose you in their mighty embrace. Fear grabs in the few seconds before you take the plunge, and then you are lost in the exhilaration, wonder and sweet shock of the descent. One turn at a time you thread your way down, a tiny speck of humanity in an impossibly huge landscape. The scenery was so overwhelming that at one stage. Amin, our Bladon Lines minder, lay on the snow and gazed trance-like into the sky. From where I was perched hundreds of feet above I thought he had fallen. 'Are you OK?' I yelled. My words came back at me in a giant echo, punctuated by the sounds of small stones falling from the battlements somewhere in the heavens above us. When we finally reached Colfosco, we had descended well over 4,000 vertical feet for a mere L90,000 (Pounds 35) each. Heliskiing - at least a single drop - need no longer be expensive. Previously, if you wanted to try this hitherto elitist sport, you had to sign up for a week, or at the very least a day, of flights. In Italy's Dolomites, more and more small outfits are offering single drops at realistic prices. An inexpensive helicopter ride means that skiers whose only concern used to be whether to ski the Sella Ronda in a clockwise or an anti-clockwise direction can now get a breathtaking new perspective on the mountains they know so well from below. They do not have to ski the Jaws of Death or even the Val di Mesdi - or even ski at all. They can just stay in the helicopter and gaze down at the circuit from the air. A single helicopter lift can have all the joy of a single glass of champagne: while the rest of the bottle would be wonderful, the first glass is the one that really hits the spot.

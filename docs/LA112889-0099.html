			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTE OVER OPERA DOOMS PLAN FOR REUNION OF KOREAN FAMILIES;  </P> <P> SOUTH KOREA: CANCELLATION DEALS ANOTHER SETBACK TO THE POLICY OF PRESIDENT ROH  TAE WOO.  </P> <P> A plan for a reunion of Koreans separated by war and partition was rejected  Monday.  </P> <P> At a meeting in Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, the North Koreans  insisted that Communist artists be permitted to put on four performances of a  propaganda opera at the reunion planned for Dec. 8-11. All four performances  were to be shown on South Korean television. South Korea's chief Red Cross  representative, Song Yong Dae, rejected the demand. He said the opera, "Flower  Maiden," glorifies revolution and "would hamper rapprochement between the South  and North."  </P> <P> The opera describes North Korean President Kim Il Sung's struggle against  Japanese colonial rule, which lasted for 35 years until the end of World War II  in 1945 and the partition of Korea.  </P> <P> The two sides agreed last Tuesday that performances by entertainers taking part  in the reunion would be televised in both countries. But when North Korea  demanded that it be allowed to stage "Flower Maiden," Song condemned it for  putting propaganda above the reunion of Koreans who in most cases have not seen  or communicated with each other since the 1951-53 Korean War.  </P> <P> Only once before, in 1985, was a reunion of separated relatives permitted, and  only 100 people were involved, 50 from the North and 50 from the South.  </P> <P> Monday's stalemate was considered particularly disappointing because all other  details had been worked out. The North was to send 250 people to Seoul, and the  South was to send 300 to Pyongyang.  </P> <P> In addition to dashing hopes for the reunion, the falling-out doomed an  agreement for talks on regular visits back and forth across the heavily  fortified zone that separates the two countries. These talks were scheduled to  get under way Dec. 15 in Pyongyang.  </P> <P> The collapse served to underscore the continuing failure of South Korean  President Roh Tae Woo to achieve the ultimate goal of his so-called  nordpolitik, or northern diplomacy. Nordpolitik is aimed at improving relations  with Communist governments so as to persuade North Korea to accept a peaceful  interchange with the south. Ironically, the policy has proved a spectacular  success nearly everywhere else.  </P> <P> Only last week, Roh celebrated the greatest triumph of the process by visiting  Hungary, becoming the first South Korean president ever to set foot in a  socialist country. Earlier this year, Hungary and Poland established full  diplomatic relations with South Korea, the first Communist states to do so.  </P> <P> Since Roh first enunciated the policy, in the presidential election campaign of  1987, South Korea's relations and trade with the Soviet Union, China and  several East European countries have expanded dramatically.  </P></p>

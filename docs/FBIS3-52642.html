			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan] </F>   [Text] Peshawar, London--The clashes in the Afghan capital  intensified yesterday and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's  forces continued their attempts to take control of President  Borhanoddin Rabbani's headquarters. Hezb-e Eslami, led by  Hekmatyar, distributed statements in the name of the "Supreme  Coordination Council of the Islamic Jihad," which demanded  "revolution against the current regime."    Sources close to Hekmatyar told AL-HAYAH that the  "Coordination Council" is an opposition political front that  includes, besides the Uzbek militias (led by General `Abdol  Rashid Dostam), the Hezb-e Eslami, the Shi'ite Hezb-e Wahdat  (supported by Tehran) led by `Abdol `Ali Mazari, and the Islamic  National Front led by Sibghatollah Mojaddedi, in addition to  other field commanders.    This [front] forms what appears to be a coup attempt  against President Rabbani's regime, especially since the Hezb-e  Eslami has disclosed its alliances and the parties supporting it  under the banner of the opposition front.    Foreign correspondents in Kabul reported the opposition  forces (particularly the Hezb-e Eslami and the militias) pounded  Kabul with hundreds of rockets and continued attacks on the  government buildings in an attempt to capture them. It was  reported that the clashes caused more than 80 dead and 800  wounded.    Until late last night, President Rabbani's forces, led by  former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, still defended most  of the government buildings. The correspondents reported from  those near the president that he is in the Presidential Palace  in southwestern Kabul. The Hezb-e Eslami announced that its  forces had come within 200 km of the palace. [sentence as  published]    An opposition statement described the events in Kabul as  "a comprehensive popular revolution in which all the jihad's  parties and sides and the field commanders and the armed forces  were participating in all parts of the capital." The statement  said that these forces "were indignant at Rabbani's and Mas'ud's  policies, which are contrary to Islam." The opposition added in  its statement that "these forces formed a council to coordinate  the Islamic revolution in Afghanistan and agreed on the  necessity of eliminating President Rabbani without any  reservations. This was announced through the news media during a  call for the commanders of the mojahedin factions to meet  quickly and agree on forming an interim government. If Rabbani  refuses, we call on the Afghan people to support this movement."    Mohammad Sadiq Tashkari, the Afghan president's adviser,  told AL-HAYAH that the president's forces "have been able to  deal with the attackers in Kabul and send them back to their  positions in Bala Hesar and Tappeh-ye Maranjan." Tashkari  disclosed that government aircraft yesterday bombed Bala Hesar  and Chehar Asiab (Hekmatyar's headquarters) south of Kabul.  Tashkari charged the prime minister with firing rockets at the  capital.    AP reported that the Uzbek militias continued to tighten  their control over the Kabul airport, which was being fiercely  defended by Rabbani's supporters.    Hezb-e Eslami and Jam'iat-e Eslami sources that AL-HAYAH  spoke to reported that the two sides "have been able to bring  more forces into Kabul, increasing the deterioration and  bloodiness of the situation. Uzbek militia sources said they  were able to capture the Jam'iat-e Eslami positions in the  northern city of Mazar-e Sharif in cooperation with other  mojahedin factions. Nasim Mehdi, one of Dostam's aides,  yesterday told reporters that his forces had been able to do  that with the cooperation of all of the mojahedin parties, with  the exclusion of the fighters of the Ettehad-e Eslami, led by  `Abd-Rabb Rasul Sayyaf. Mehdi disclosed that the commander of  the Jam'iat-e Eslami, Mowlawi `AIm, had joined the allied  (opposition) forces.    The official spokesman for the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad  told journalists that President Rabbani's forces had been able  to capture the Mazar-e Sharif airport, but Pakistani diplomatic  sources resident in Mazar-e Sharif told Islamabad by radio that  Dostam's militias control the airport and are in possession of  the city.    Gen. Homayun Fowzi, the Uzbek militias' representative in  Kabul, said that they want a change in the politicial system in  Kabul to be a change that is acceptable to all of the  minorities. Fowzi added, "A single district cannot control  Afghanistan," indicating the district of Panjshir, Mas'ud's  headquarters (the real commander of Rabbani's forces).    Afghan sources expect fighting to flare up today if  weather conditions improve, since the Uzbek militias were not  able to use their aircraft in the battles. The same sources told  AL-HAYAH that if the weather improves, the militias, the  militias will resort to air raids on the Presidential Palace.</p>

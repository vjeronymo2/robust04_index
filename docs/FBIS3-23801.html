A contract was concluded between the  "MOST" association for business cooperation with foreign  countries and the Polivinilatsetat Plant on 28 May 1993. It was  based on the "General Agreement on Joint Production-Commercial  and Investment Activity," concluded between the Russian  Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Russian  Federation Committee on the Chemical and Petrochemical Industry,  and the Government of the Republic of Armenia.    The need to create a petroleum processing production unit in  Armenia is conditioned by its acute demand for heating and motor  fuel, as well as by the possibility of partially supplying the  republic's chemical complex with needed chemicals. Liquefied  gas, gasoline fraction, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, and fuel  oil (mazut) will be obtained, as well as pentane-hexane (the  basic raw material for the production of acetic acid), which  will make it possible for Nairit to produce acetic acid, which  is used at the Polivinilatsetat Plant in the production of vinyl  acetate. The utilization of crude oil with a low sulphur content  from Western Siberia is envisaged in the initial stage, the  movement of which over the Novosibirsk-Batumi-Yerevan route is  simpler and more economical than the products of its processing,  since crude oil, unlike mazut, does not freeze under low  temperature conditions and is far smaller in volume than the  volume of the components obtained after processing.    A group of specialists invited by the "MOST" association for  familiarization with the state of affairs on the spot was  dispatched to the Polivinilatsetat Plant for the purpose of  creating the petroleum processing complex. The conducting of  research work and the execution of orders for the manufacture of  the equipment required is also called for. At the request of the  association the basic equipment manufacturing plants have  already started to work on the requisite equipment. The  association has given advanced payments for the preliminary  stages of operations to certain plants for the manufacture of  the necessary equipment and has also come to an agreement with a  number of CIS petroleum processing plants about giving the  Polivinilatsetat Plant new equipment. Part of it was ready for  shipment to Armenia already in the beginning of November. A good  deal has been done in the last six months, it seems, in the  direction of resolving this question which is vitally important  for Armenia.    However, we are forced to note that up to this day, despite  the numerous appeals and telegrams on the part of the "MOST"  association, the Armenian side has not paid for the work  performed. We have tried to get an explanation concerning this  from the director of the Polivinilatsetat Plant and to  familiarize ourselves with the situation on the spot. Director  M. Davtyan has kindly given us detailed information on the  course of the conduct of operations. Thus, the organization of  petroleum processing at the Polivinilatsetat Plant is very  beneficial as regards the saving of funds, since there are  unutilized fixed capital and engineering service lines on the  plant's territory, the plant has skilled engineering-technical  personnel and workers and, what is the main thing, the heating  fuel will be used by the nearby Yerevan Heat and Electric Power  Station and the acetic acid raw material by Nairit which is  located in the vicinity.    Taking all this into consideration, the specialists have  concluded that all costs related to the organization of this  production unit would be recovered in four months and  construction work would be confined to 12 months all told. As  far as the course of the operations is concerned, the director  noted with regret that already over several months directives  concerning the apportionment of 800 million to the "MOST"  organization's account from the 1.2 billion rubles in credits  granted to the Polivinilatsetat Plant have passed from the prime  minister to various state ministers, the ministries of  economics, industry, and finance and to the State Bank, to no  effect however.    Familiarity with the documents and directives leaves no room  for doubt that all these officials well realize the urgency of  the question and, it seems, are interested in its prompt  solution. However, the fact is that the question has not been  resolved in months. This loss of time will cost dearly and,  undoubtedly, will affect the future of our republic, which is in  a desperate energy situation. The Russian Federation has warned  that installation of equipment in the already prepared sections  of the plant before the coming of cold weather will be imperiled  because of non-payment for the operations of the preceding stage  by the Armenian side. The dragging-out of technological  operations in 1993 not only will lead to an appreciable increase  in the cost of the project but the time periods for the testing  and operation of the plant also will have to be postponed to the  beginning of the winter of 1994-95.</p>

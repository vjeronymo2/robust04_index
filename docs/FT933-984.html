			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / How To Spend It: What the best-dressed walls are wearing - Lucia van der Post previews Decorex, the biggest and brightest interior decorating show that at last is open to one and all IT HAS ALWAYS been a mystery to me that one of the UK's finest interior decorating exhibitions, Decorex, has traditionally been closed to its ultimate customers - the public. Rather as the glittery fashion shows are only accessible to those with impeccable credentials (in other words, those in the trade) so Decorex, where the latest in swags and chintzes, kitchens and designer bibelots is laid out before us, has always been open only to those in the interior decorating trade. This year, however, sense has at last been seen. Now those who long to attend what really is the best and easiest way of seeing a whole range of interior trends can for the first time do so. Decorex is on at Syon Park, Isleworth, west London and though it opens to the trade today on the evening of Tuesday September 28 there will be a private view and champagne reception (sponsored by Perrier-Jouet) for anyone who feels it is worth the Pounds 20 ticket. All proceeds will go to Shaftesbury Homes, a children's charity that helps disabled and disadvantaged children from inner city areas. Tickets can be reserved by telephoning Shaftesbury Homes on 071-720 8709. What, though, I hear you ask, will be on view? Previewing an exhibition that has not yet happened is, as I have learned to my cost, a tricky business but if last year's show is anything to go by then the standard of taste, flair and exhibitors will be very high. Here you should find the perfect opportunity to see which way the decorative winds are blowing, to catch up on the small and new companies that are doing original, idiosyncratic work, and to compare fabrics, colours, styles. Decorex is also a good chance to find out what exactly an interior decorator can do for you. Traditionally the British have been wary of buying-in the skills of interior decorators - whether from a sense of latent puritanism or a shortage of cash, it is hard to say - but interior decorating in this country has for too long been thought to have a faint whiff of transatlantic excess. However, anybody who has ever tried it will have found to their cost that putting a house in order requires much, much more than a gentle dabbling in pretty paints and fabrics. It is usually very hard work. For every minute spent sifting through swatches of fabric, something like 50 has probably to be spent chasing up suppliers and sorting out the duller but infinitely more important practicalities: plumbing, heating, lighting and ventilation. Interior decorators can take all this off your hands - for a fee, of course, and herein lies the rub. When prosaic matters such as cost are mentioned interior decorators as a breed seem to have a wonderful way of looking fey and conveying, just ever so haughtily, a distinct reluctance to discuss such unaesthetic matters. This is where the IDDA (the interior decorators and designers association) can come in handy. It will have a manned stand at the show where advice will be dispensed - everything from how charges should be fixed to how to choose an interior designers and just what exactly he (or she) could do for you. Those who cannot get to the exhibition can write to IDDA, Crest House, 102-104 Church Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 8PY, enclosing a 9in by 4in sae for a free informative leaflet on 'why you should use an interior designer'. So what seem to be the current trends for the coming year? Two companies with a reputation for finely-tuned design antennae (Jane Churchill and Designers' Guild) have drawn on Britain's links with Colonial India for their new collections and each, independently, has arrived at the same name: 'Indian Summer.' This, you should note, is the India of the Raj and the Maharajahs, of silks and satins, of brilliant ochres and terracottas, sapphire blues and iridescent golds - not the peasant India of the rough-hewn tables and the simple block-printed cottons or Madras checks. The Jane Churchill Collection, photographed above right and on view at Decorex, features a whole collection of Indian-inspired fabrics - from the spectacular mix of pictorial designs on the sofa, reminiscent of the school of Indian miniature paintings and called Indian Summer, to the Khalasa check at the window, a heavy cotton linen blend in a choice of colours. Prices range from Pounds 18.50 to Pounds 29.50 per metre. Indian Summer sells for Pounds 23.50. To go with the fabrics and the mood there is a collection of wooden and decorative accessories - from wooden pots and ceramic urns to carved chests, candlesticks, rugs and baskets. The collection is on sale now in all Jane Churchill shops. Designers' Guild is not exhibiting at Decorex, but its Indian Summer collection, too, is already in its Chelsea shop (271-277 Kings' Road, London SW3). Photographed below left is a selection of its blue and white bedlinen (fine Egyptian cotton sheets with a blue spotted border, blue and white checked pillowcases and duvet cover and an appliqued bedcover) and some of its richly-coloured checked fabrics. The collection includes prints, woven silks, velvets and wallpapers, all clearly inspired by the art, textiles, architecture and history of India. Prices range from Pounds 15 per metre to Pounds 52 for the cotton velvets. Finally, if you feel that all this sumptuously coloured fabric needs something special to set it off, consider Byron &amp; Byron, a company specialising in what it calls 'curtainalia' which has developed a wonderfully decorative range of finishes for wooden curtain poles (photographed top left). Using the Victorian technique of decoupage, in which cut-out shapes and illustrations are veneered on to furnishings and furniture, it has grafted a selection of paper finishes on to the poles. The result is colourful, original and indubitably different. Prices range from Pounds 114 to Pounds 350 a set, depending upon design and measurements. Byron &amp; Byron has a small showroom at 4 Hanover Yard, off Noel Road, London N1 8BE (tel: 071-704 9290). Also available from John Lewis.</p>

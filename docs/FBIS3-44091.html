			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the National Party] </F>   [Text]  <H3>  National Party Accuses a Devious SACP of  Concealing the Truth </H3>   The constitutional clause which determines that once members  have been elected to Parliament under the banner of one party,  they have to resign if they leave the party or switch parties  means in practise that the ANC [African National Congress] and  the SACP [South African Communist Party] will not be able to go  their separate ways after the election.    The SACP and the ANC are now locked together as a single  entity for the full duration of the next term of parliament.  ANC denials that the SACP is playing an important role in the  ANC and will continue to do so, do not take this reality into  account.    According to National Party information, the following  people  amongst the first 50 on the candidates list, have been members  of the SACP until recently:    Joe Slovo; John Nkadimeng; Essop Pahad; Jay Naidoo; Raymond  Suttner; Ahmed Kathrada; Tito Mboweni; Ronnie Kasrils; Thenjiwe  Mthintso; Sydney Mufamadi; Blade Nzimande; Thozamile Botha; Aziz  Pahad; Steve Tshwete; Penuell Maduna; Jeff Hadebe; Billy Nair;  Dullah Omar; Philip Dexter; Moses Mayekiso; Alfed Nzo; Chris  Dlamini; Alec Erin; Gertrude Shope; Gill Marcus; Mohammed Valli  Moosa; Peter Mokaba    Apart from these names there are six more possibilities.    The SACP is now desparately attempting to conceal the facts.  For example the statement that Mr Ahmed Kathrada's membership  has expired years ago is simply not true. On 7 January - just  over two weeks ago - Mr Essop Pahad SACP NEC [National Executive  Committee] member stated openly (CITIZEN 7 January 1994) that Mr  Kathrada is still a member of the SACP. It is quite clear that  the ANC is now embarking on a strategy to conceal the full  extent of their influence in the ANC and on the ANC's candidates  list.</p>

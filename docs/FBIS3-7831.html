			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of the Republic's spokesman reports  that President Sali Berisha harshly condemned the decision and  considered criminal and barbarous the final act of the Serbian  Government against the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the  Republic of Kosova. This is an unprecedented escalation in the  history of present civilization and in the fight against  science, culture, and truth.    With this the Serbian regime testifies once more to its  determination to fanatically implement the criminal memorandum  of the Academy of Sciences which, drafted on principles of  anticivilization and barbarism, sets forth the notions of ethnic  cleansing and the erasure of thinking in other nations.    The Serbian circles can close a building, but they can by no  means suffocate the thinking and scientific truth of the  Albanian world. The act is as antiscientific and illegitimate  as it is barbarous.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Frolova: "Prices Will Be Re-evaluated"] </F>   [Text] The Anti-Monopoly Committee of the RF [Russian  Federation] has begun a check on the tariffs of the Ministry of  Communications and other "natural monopolies."    At the last meeting of the Chamber for Information Disputes  under the president of the RF, the second issue to come up had  to do with delivery of newspapers and journals. A representative  of the federal administration of postal communications stated  that the postoffice as before intends to cover all its losses  through an increase in prices for delivery of print media  publications. Staff members of the anti-monopoly committee of  the RF considered this a violation of the rights of consumers.  The subscription price substantially exceeds the initial amount  established by the editorial boards.    As the chief specialist for the state committee for  anti-monopoly policy and support for new economic structures  Aleksandr Kartashev explained to a correspondent of MOSKOVSKIYE  NOVOSTI, the arbitrariness of postal prices can be stopped in  two ways: by competition or by the state. For now, the postal  department does not intend to share its authority with respect  to subscriptions with any one. Consequently, almost every three  months new tariffs are established, the basis of which it is  impossible to check. This is because oblast postoffices have  been removed from the control of financial and taxation organs  and are answerable to no one except their own superiors. The  situation can currently be changed only by the emergence of  competition in the market of the distributors of print media  publications. But the chief monopolist will be transformed into  an ordinary participant in this market only after "delivery"  enters the list of licensed services.    A check of the tariffs of the ministry of communications is  being conducted by assignment of the government. The  anti-monopoly committee intends to find out "whether the postal  workers are not running ahead of inflation." In the first  instance, specialists are analyzing prices for telephone calls,  delivery of periodical publications, and other communications  services. The results of the findings of this economic expertise  will be announced at one of the next meetings of the  government's commission for operational questions.    According to preliminary data, even in the absence of  obvious  violations in the actions of the ministry, the experts of the  anti-monopoly committee intend to raise the question of a more  precise specification of the organizational-legal structure of  the postal department. And they also intend to press the  question of whether post offices should be transformed into  subordinate enterprises, which will compete on an equal footing  with private firms in the delivery of print media publications.  Only after this will delivery prices cease to rise.</p>

At a special meeting in Qiryat Arba', the council made  several practical decisions in order to prevent any evacuation.    Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that  the CJSJSG implied that it would settle several houses in  Hebron's Jewish quarter. Council members stressed that the  settlers would not resort to physical violence against the  security forces or harm them in any way.</p>

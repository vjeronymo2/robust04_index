			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dismal volume reflects market uncertainties - Market Report A nervous and thinly traded session in UK equities yesterday saw share prices close firmly behind early gains in the Dow Industrial Average and in US bonds. The prospect of the elections this week to the European Parliament provided an extra note of uncertainty in markets still concerned over inflation prospects on both sides of the Atlantic. At midsession the market was ahead by more than 18 points on the Footsie scale but equities later lost heart when UK government bonds gave back an initial advance. A closing rally, which left the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,009.4, up 11.6 on the day, owed much to a slow improvement in Federal bonds and to the reading of plus 13 points on the Dow Average at the London close. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index ended 14.1 ahead at 3,571.4. But a more revealing image of the trading session was given by the Seaq volume of only 436.4m shares, nearly 40 per cent down from Friday's figure and one of the lowest genuine daily totals for the year. Shares opened nervously as investors waited to see if US Federal bonds would hold the gains scored at the close of trading in New York on Friday. When European bonds, including UK gilts, moved higher, the London stock market responded, but with some caution. Sentiment was encouraged by reports that a New York newspaper had quoted reassuring comments from several Federal Reserve governors on last week's US unemployment data. There was little market response to the announcement of a sharp fall in new UK consumer credit in April, a move which could be seen as favourable for inflation but discouraging for economic recovery prospects. London continued to edge forward until just before the time for New York to open, when initial uncertainty in Federal bonds was quickly reflected across European fixed interest markets. A later rally in Federal securities came late in the London trading day. With both the economic calendar and the company reporting list somewhat light this week, individual features were thin on the ground. Unilever shares fell on reports of an attack on its latest detergent product by a rival manufacturer. The general caution ahead of this week's European elections lay particularly heavy across the London stock market because of fears that Mr John Major's ruling Conservative government may come under further pressure in Westminster and in the public opinion polls. There was further demand yesterday for the utility shares, which have attracted investors looking for stocks which often combine good current yields and the hope of further dividend rises. The market's dividend optimism was encouraged yesterday by a sharply higher payout from BAA, which owns and manages Britain's major airports, and reported buoyant air passenger traffic. Dividend increases have provided support for the market, against the background of other uncertainties. There were also sharp rises among the banks and financial stocks but trading volumes across the market indicated that genuine investment interest was on hold for the time being. Fund managers, having seen the Footsie succeed in recovering the 3,000 mark, appeared to be waiting for convincing evidence that this level can be held before putting further funds into the London market.</p>

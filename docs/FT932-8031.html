			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: GTE sells telecoms lines to utilities group for Dollars 1bn GTE, the largest local US telephone company, yesterday announced plans to sell approximately 500,000 access lines in a total of nine states, to Citizens Utilities, a diversified utilities group based in Connecticut, for Dollars 1.1bn in cash.

It also includes a portion of GTE's interests in California (less than 1 per cent of the access lines there), Idaho (about 14 per cent) and Oregon (less than 2 per cent). It is subject to various regulatory approvals, and the transaction is unlikely to be fully completed until 1994. GTE shares closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 35 1/8 yesterday, while Citizens Utilities 'B' shares were unchanged at Dollars 36. Citizens, which like GTE is based in Stamford, supplies electric, gas, water, and telecommunications services to customers in 13 states. Telecoms have accounted for about one-third of the group's revenues to date, and the utility currently operates all-digital local-exchange carriers in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. 'Two-and-a-half years ago, we told Citizens' shareholders that we planned to double the size of the company by 1996,' said Mr Leonard Tow, Citizens' chairman. 'This transaction goes a long way to meeting that goal.'</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Friendship flourished because of Gonzalez's loyalty, says Kohl For Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez, their meeting over the past two days in the faded splendour of Schwerin, the former capital of the grand dukes of Mecklenburg in east Germany, had clear symbolic significance, writes Quentin Peel from Schwerin. It was the first time the German chancellor had held top-level talks with a fellow government leader in east Germany. But it was more than that. The extraordinarily good personal relationship between the two, the Spanish Socialist and the German Christian Democrat, has flourished precisely because Mr Gonzalez was the only west European leader who unhesitatingly supported the German unification. For the German chancellor, where his colleagues stood on the question of unification has become a touchstone for personal relations. It is increasingly clear that the failure of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the former Netherlands premier, to back the unification process four years ago, is the most important single reason why Mr Kohl is not supporting him to become the next president of the European commission in Brussels. Mr Kohl spelt out his appreciation of Mr Gonzalez' loyalty in glowing terms again yesterday. He pointed out how few those world leaders were, back in 1989 and 1990, who had been so positive. In private, he names only four: Mr George Bush, the former US president; Mr Brian Mulroney, the former Canadian premier; Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader; and Mr Gonzalez. One significant exception is President Francois Mitterrand of France, who was clearly dubious about unification until late in the process. But the Franco-German relationship is too important to allow that to cause more than a shadow between the two. The outright opposition of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who was publicly cool and privately vitriolic about unification, has caused far more lasting bitterness. Mr Kohl mentioned Mrs Thatcher's opposition yesterday, to underline his appreciation of his Spanish colleague. 'Some women colleagues have written it in their memoirs,' he said. 'If you read what Mrs Thatcher says, you can see she thinks it was all a terrible mistake. So you can see how important it was that Felipe Gonzalez supported the process. 'You belong to those who, in many critical talks, explained again and again that German unity was not a thing for the Germans alone, but was a good thing for the Europeans, and for the free world,' he told the Spanish premier yesterday.</p>

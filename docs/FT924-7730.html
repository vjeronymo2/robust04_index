			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: YRM share price dives 11p on dividend warning THE SHARE price of architects YRM fell from 40p to 29p yesterday after the company warned that it planned to cut its interim dividend following a loss during the six months to the end of October. The group said that it expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 500,000 for the half year to October 31. As a result, it expected to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p per share, against 1.65p last time when the group announced profits of Pounds 534,000. The company yesterday blamed redundancy costs and fierce competition in a much reduced construction market for its latest set-back. It said that redundancy costs of about Pounds 280,000 would result in savings which would benefit the group in the second half. YRM added that markets had continued to be very difficult and that it would decide the level of the final dividend in the light of the results for the full year. The continuing slide in architects' workloads is worrying for the rest of the construction industry, such as contractors and building material suppliers which win contracts much later in the building cycle. YRM has already cut is final dividend once, from 3.35p to 2.35p, making a total of 4p (5p) for the year to April 30 1992 when pre-tax profits fell by 31 per cent to Pounds 1.37m.</p>

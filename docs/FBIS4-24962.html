			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 June (XINHUA) -- Customs personnel are  forbidden: to demand reimbursement from recipients of their  services for all kinds of personal expenses incurred; to use  their powers of office to provide preferential terms or  convenience beyond policy regulations for their spouses,  children, relatives, or friends to do business or import or  export commodities; and to serve as paid intermediaries. These  are the new demands on all customs personnel in the revised  "Customs Regulations on Maintaining a Clean and Honest  Government" recently promulgated by the General Administration  of Customs.    Customs first enacted and promulgated the "Customs  Regulations on Maintaining a Clean and Honest Government" in  1990. In the course of implementing these regulations, it was  discovered that dishonest acts occurred mostly during contact  between customs personnel and recipients of their services.  Based on this, Customs enacted and promulgated in 1991 the  "Regulations Governing Specific Problems During Contact Between  Customs Personnel and Recipients of Their Services." These two  regulations played an important role in regulating customs  personnel's conduct, rectifying malpractice in customs  departments, and promoting the construction of clean and honest  customs administration. In light of the development of the  situation and the characteristics of customs departments,  Customs again amended the two regulations to make them more  oriented toward current problems and more practicable.    While retaining most of the original contents, the revised  regulations also incorporate the requirements for maintaining  honest and clean government reiterated and practiced in customs  departments over the past year. They include: Customs are  forbidden, without exception, to engage in service trades, with  the exception of logistics and science and technology services;  to demand, for any reason, assistance from recipients of their  services; to take part in highly expensive entertainment  sponsored in their honor by recipients of their services; and to  intercede for someone else or interfere in law enforcement  during customs investigations.</p>

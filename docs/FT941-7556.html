			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Gambling on a gut-feeling - Why spending substantial amounts on advertising is not always easy to justify Peperami is a bit of an animal, but it has not always been that way. It started as a rather sad salami stick with sluggish sales; by 1989 the savory snack had almost died completely, when it was withdrawn in its old formulation because of a salmonella scare. Then, last year, advertising agency Still Price Lintas produced a Pounds 2m advertising campaign for Peperami's manufacturer, Unilever subsidiary Van den Bergh Foods. An animated Peperami popped up on UK TV screens, together with the catchphrase: 'It's a bit of an animal.' Which bit was not specified, but the character got the attention of audiences, particularly the young males at which the manufacturers were aiming the product. The advertisements were followed by a 35 per cent cent increase in the volume of sales, and in 1993 the retail value of the brand reached Pounds 22.5m in the UK. A second set of ads, featuring the same animated salami on legs, is due to start in just over a week. Justifying the expense of a second advertising campaign will hardly have been difficult for Simon Turner, Van den Bergh's marketing director. He estimates that the first campaign accounted for at least a 25 per cent increase in sales; the other 10 per cent would have come from changes in distribution and the way the product was displayed. But for other marketers, who are only too aware of the way finance directors tend to lop budgets during a recession, it is not always so straightforward to develop a convincing case for spending money on advertising. Evaluating its effectiveness is not always easy and there are still clients, as well as agencies, who rely on instinct and a prayer. Says Janet Hull, director of advertising effectiveness at the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising: 'All of us know cases where gut-feel has ruled.' The IPA is planning an education campaign intended to increase the agencies' and clients' sophistication in this area. Hull emphasises that it is vital to establish what is being measured from the outset. For example, the advertising of a new product would be expected to lead to a sharp increase in trial by consumers; for a well-established brand, the aim might be to bring it up to date or broaden its reach; for a mature brand, success might be limited to slowing the rate of decline. An illustration of how advertising can add value to a new product is provided by the campaign surrounding the launch of the Volkswagen Golf Mark II in 1984. The usual cycle of car launches is that a new model - unless it is truly innovative - has an advantage in the market for, at most, about three years and is then superseded by another maker's new model. Volkswagen's aim with the Golf Mark II was to use advertising to extend this initial advantage beyond the three-year mark. It had to do this without the bonus of the new car being particularly innovative - indeed, the motoring press expressed disappointment that the new model was so conservative. Following two highly-acclaimed ads by agency BMP DDB Needham, which ran in eight bursts on television between 1985 and 1989, market share did, indeed, carry on increasing for six years, dipping in the seventh because of supply problems. The ads, explains BMP DDB Needham, were centred on the driver of the car, rather than the car itself, 'breaking the product-focused rules of the market'. According to VW, an advertising outlay of Pounds 10.9m during 1985-89 produced extra sales of nearly 37,000 cars and additional gross profit of about Pounds 30m. Research confirms that these extra sales did not result from lower prices, lack of competition or improved distribution. The case for the part advertising had to play in the sustained sales of the car was set out in 1992 in a prize-winning submission for the biennial advertising effectiveness awards, which are run by the IPA, though largely judged by representatives of industry. The closing date for this year's awards is June 1 - Van den Bergh and Still Price Lintas plan to enter Peperami. The overall winner of the 1992 awards was another campaign by BMP DDB Needham, this time for the National Diary Council which was trying to slow down the sharp decline in demand for doorstep deliveries of milk. The success of the campaign demonstrated the potential effectiveness of advertising when a mature market finds itself under pressure. In 1980, nearly 90 per cent of households had milk delivered; just 10 years later, social and demographic changes, but most of all, fierce price competition from supermarkets, forced the figure down to 69 per cent. Milk deliveries were losing 1m customers a year and it was estimated that, if the trend continued, there would be nothing left of the market within 12 years. The advertising agency rejected the idea of trying to recruit new customers and concentrated instead on those who were on the brink of cancelling deliveries. The beginning of the slippery slope towards cancellation was found to be the point when consumers started to buy some of their milk, perhaps at the weekend, from the supermarket. These consumers were targeted with TV ads which focused on the convenience of having milk delivered, rather than carting it home. From January 1990 to April 1991, the milkman's share of the market declined at an average of 0.43 per cent share points per months; from May to December 1991, which coincided with the advertising campaign, there was a decline of just 0.01 percentage points. It was established that no other factors were behind the stabilisation in sales. The judges of the effectiveness awards concluded: 'Whatever the future for home delivery, the advertising monies spent to date by the industry have been paid back handsomely.' As Hull points out, marketing directors armed with this proof - only possible to provide when measures of effectiveness are built in to a campaign - will be the best-equipped to fend off the finance director when times are tough.</p>

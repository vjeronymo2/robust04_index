The military leadership and a  parliamentary delegation met on Thursday for three hours to  analyze the project observers have called "neither-nor," which  stands for neither Army Chief Raoul Cedras, nor deposed  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    The military has not yet commented publicly on the plan,  which is supported by the U.S. State Department, while some  legislators expressed reservations following the meeting local  radio stations termed "tumultuous. It is too early to tell what  the military will say. We hope they can understand that this is  the best solution," Duly Brutus, one of the members of the  congressional delegation, stated. A legislator said the military  has reacted "with anger and indignation," and has questioned  "the parliamentarians' authority to make decisions involving the  military without first consulting the military." Aristide,  overthrown in September of 1991 in a coup d'etat led by Cedras,  does not support the legislators' plan either.    Point five of the initiative stipulates Army Chief Gen.  Raoul  Cedras' retirement, and Point six, the appointment of a new  chief of police. Although Point 11 refers to the return of the  president, the initiative's supporters say this is a way of  indefinitely prolonging his exile because first, the sanctions  would be lifted and no date for his return has been set. "The  transition to democracy involved concessions from all the  parties," Marc Bazin, second de facto prime minister, declared.</p>

Recalling his brilliant achievements,  which have gone down in history, officers and men of the whole  Army, like the people of all the nationalities in China, are  filled with great admiration for this great man of history.    Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist, a great proletarian  revolutionary, strategist, and theorist as well as a great  patriot and national hero of modern Chinese history. He  achieved indelible historical feats in the founding and  developing of our party and the People's Army, victory in the  cause of liberation of the people of all the nationalities of  China, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the  development of the socialist cause in our country, to allow the  Chinese nation to plant its feet firmly in the forest of the  world of nations. The Chinese communists, with Comrade Mao  Zedong as their chief representative, made theoretical  generalizations on a series of experiences of long-term Chinese  revolutionary practice with originality based on the basic  tenets of Marxist and shaped into Mao Zedong Thought--scientific  guiding ideas suitable to conditions in China. At the same  time, Comrade Mao Zedong was a great proletarian strategist. In  half a century, he led our party, people and Army in founding  our great military cause that will shine through the ages.    The characteristic of the Chinese revolution was armed  revolution against armed counterrevolution, the central task of  the revolution was the seizure of political power with armed  force, the major form of struggle was armed struggle, and the  chief form of organization was the People's Army. The entirety  of the theory and practice of our party during the whole period  of the new democratic revolution was unfolded by centering  around the core of revolutionary war. Inside our party, Comrade  Mao Zedong was the first to see the importance and pressing  nature of armed struggle, the first to indicate the road of  establishing revolutionary bases, encircling the cities with the  rural areas, as well as seizing political power with armed  force, and he personally initiated the People's Army under the  absolute leadership of the party with fresh-and-blood ties with  the people. In the surging waves of Chinese revolutionary wars,  Comrade Mao Zedong became our Army's wise commander-in-chief,  formed strategic plans at headquarters, determined victories on  the vast battlefields across China, and directed one campaign  after another full of power and grandeur. From the struggle at  Jinggangshan to the Long March, from the consolidation and  development of the Northern Shaanxi Revolutionary Base Area to  vanquishing the invasion by Japanese imperialism, from the War  of Liberation and the decisive battle against 8 million  Kuomintang troops to contending with a most powerful enemy on  the Korean battleground, all these reflected his superb art of  command marked by great proficiency. The duration of his  command during the revolutionary wars, their scope, the  complexity of situation, the splendor of the victories, and the  far-reaching effects were all rare in the all-time history of  war of all countries. Comrade Mao Zedong was the glory of the  People's Army as well as the pride of the Chinese nation.    Comrade Mao Zedong was a great man, a famous military  commander, as well as an outstanding military theorist. He  combined the basic tenets of Marxist-Leninism with the specific  practice of the Chinese revolutionary war and army building,  scientifically summarized the Chinese revolutionary war and the  precious experiences of our army building, critically absorbed  the rational essences of all sorts of military theories from all  eras and from all lands, concentrated the wisdom of the whole  party and whole Army, and founded Mao Zedong military thinking.  Mao Zedong military thinking on the building of a revolutionary  army, people's war, and strategies and tactics characterized by  flexibility and a scientific concept of war and methodology  based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism have  enriched and developed Marxist-Leninist military doctrine with a  series of original theories that were shaped into a scientific  system characterized by extensive and profound knowledge, and  this became a brilliant, important part of Mao Zedong Thought.  Especially in the arena of building a people's army, Comrade Mao  Zedong systematically formed a revolutionary army with its main  factor being peasants, and the question on how should the army  be built into a new-type people's army which is proletarian in  nature and has strict discipline, while maintaining close ties  with the people. He stipulated that serving the people heart  and soul should be the sole purpose of the People's Army;  determined the principle of the party commanding the gun, but  not otherwise; formulated the Three Main Rules of Discipline and  the Eight Points for Attention; stressed the implementation of  democracy in the three main fields, namely political, economic  and military democracy at the company level; implemented the  principle of unity between officers and men, unity between the  Army and the people, and disintegrating enemy forces; and set  out and summarized a whole range of principles and methods of  political work for the Army. The correctness of all these  theories and principles in building a new-type people's army had  been fully proved in the long-term practice of the Chinese  revolution and the building of the People's Army. By drawing a  lesson from China being bullied by various powers during its  modern and contemporary history, which resulted from  impoverishment and being weak, Comrade Mao Zedong set out, in  the wake of the PRC's founding, the guiding thinking of  strengthening defense and building a powerful modern  revolutionary armed force, and he made the important decision on  developing modern defense science and technology through self-  reliance, thus effectively insuring China's independence and  peaceful socialist construction.    Mao Zedong's military thinking took deep root in the fertile  soil of the practice of Chinese revolutionary war and the  building of our Army. It originated from military practice,  while it was tested and developed in giving guidance to military  practice. The half-century of progress in our Army's struggles  give evidence to the fact that Mao Zedong military thinking has  correctly answered and resolved a series of important issues on  why we must carry out a revolutionary war, whom we should rely  on in fighting a revolutionary war, and how we can win that  war, while profoundly revealing the basic law that governs  China's revolutionary war and building of the People's Army, and  that this has scientific quality and progressiveness beyond a  doubt. With the changing of the times, great progress has been  made in science, technology, weaponry, and equipment, and many  characteristics different from the past have surfaced in modern  warfare along with great changes in the means, tactics, and ways  of war. Nevertheless, the basic law of war has not changed, nor  has the nature of our Army as a people's army; Mao Zedong's  basic principles on building a people's army, the concept of  people's war, and strategies and principles, especially his  military dialectics, continue to have universal guiding  significance, and this is a mighty ideological weapon for making  preparations for future wars against aggression.    Mao Zedong Thought is an ever-developing theoretical system.  It was none other than Comrade Deng Xiaoping who became an  outstanding representative and brilliant model in pushing Mao  Zedong Thought to a new realm and new heights. As an important  member of our party's first-generation collective leadership,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping participated in the founding of Mao Zedong  Thought; furthermore, as the core of the party's  second-generation collective leadership, he has led the Chinese  people in the great practice of reform, opening up, and  modernization, concentrated the wisdom of the whole party,  enriched and developed Mao Zedong Thought, initiated the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and realized  the second historical leap of Marxist basic tenets combining  with China's concrete practice. In the application and  development of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, his outstanding  political wisdom, and Marxist spirit of blazing new trails have  been given full play. As the chief architect of China's reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  has personally planned for and led our Army in building a  revolutionary, regular, and modern army. He has adhered to and  inherited the most fundamental essence of Mao Zedong's military  thinking, set out our Army's purpose of serving the people heart  and soul, and brought forward our Army's glorious traditions and  "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" to always maintain our  army's political color. At the same time, with extremely great  political boldness and theoretical courage, he set out the  guiding idea for army building and the need for implementing  strategic change through profoundly analyzing the world  strategic situation today, the characteristics of modern  warfare, China's national conditions, and the Army's actual  conditions. He indicated that our Army building must take  modernization as the center, strengthen quality building, and  take the road of picked troops with Chinese characteristics,  while building our Army into a powerful, modern, regular,  revolutionary army. He stressed the need to augment scientific  research and improve weaponry and equipment, as well as elevate  education and training to a strategic position, work hard to  improve cadres' ability in commanding modern warfare, and bring  up qualified people who are able to fight a war and pursue  socialist construction, namely training people for both military  and civilian jobs in a big way. He stressed the need to  complete and perfect rules and regulations, be strict with  discipline, and adhere to strictly running the Army and the need  to augment logistics building to meet the demand of the new  situation and the needs of modern warfare. He has called for  exerting efforts to make cadres more revolutionary, younger in  average, better educated and more professionalized; to augment  and improve ideological and political work; continuously push  the building of spiritual civilization in the army; bring up  soldiers with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a better  educational background, and a high sense of discipline; and so  forth. All this has shaped into Deng Xiaoping's thinking on  army building for the new period sharply marked with the  characteristics of the times. This thinking has answered and  resolved, with originality, a series of basic issues in theory  and practice about our army building during the new period, and  is the fundamental grounds and guiding thinking for our army  building and reform. Without Mao Zedong military thinking, there  would not have been the growth of the People's Army and the  victorious development of the people's revolutionary wars.  Likewise, without Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building  during the new period, there would not have been the great  accomplishments of our army reform and building today. To  firmly arm the whole Army with Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army  building during the new period is basic insurance for  victoriously advancing along the road of building a modern army  with Chinese characteristics.    Carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the  future,  the third-generation collective leadership of the Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has held aloft  the banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and has  continuously pushed forward China's great cause of reform,  opening up, and modernization. The Central Military Commission  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as chairman has formulated military  strategic principles for our Army during the new period based on  Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new period  and has set out the general requirement of "being politically  eligible, skillful in military affairs, strict with discipline,  and effective with logistics," and has drawn up a series of  important decision on augmenting the building of a more  revolutionary, modern and regular Army. The whole Army, from  the top down, has brought forward our party's fine traditions in  a big way, united as one, worked hard, and continuously made new  progress in military affairs, political work, and logistics and  defense scientific research in the course of reform.    The century from the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong has been  one  of earth-shaking changes which have taken place in China and the  world. The most significant commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong  is to inherit and develop Mao Zedong military thinking and forge  ahead along the broad path of building a modern army with  Chinese characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It  is necessary for us to consciously meet the requirements set out  by the Central Committee and Central Military Commission with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, work hard to arm our thinking  with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, continuously enhance our resolution in  "adhering to the party basic line without wavering for a hundred  years," and enthusiastically support various reforms with  building the socialist market economic structure as the goal.  It is imperative to firmly implement our Army's military  strategic principles for the new period, continuously augment  the Army's quality building, and improve the Army's combat  effectiveness in a comprehensive way to provide reliable  security insurance for reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization. It is necessary to augment the Army's political  and ideological building in a big way and take the lead in  building socialist spiritual civilization in the whole society.  Comrades of the whole Army, let us closely unite around the  Central Committee and Central Military Commission with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as the core, go all out in doing substantial work,  exert great efforts to make the country strong, and work hard  together with the people of the whole country in building and  defending a prosperous, powerful, democratic, and civilized  socialist country while advancing toward the 21st century full  of confidence!</p>

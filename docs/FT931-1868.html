			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Shuttle's German mission set back THE launch of a US space shuttle on a Spacelab science mission chartered and paid for by Germany was aborted by ground computers three seconds before take-off yesterday. Two of the three main engines had ignited fully and white smoke and vapour engulfed the pad as usual when power was shut down. It was only the third engine shutdown in 12 years of shuttle flying. Nasa officials said a valve in the third engine had apparently failed to close, causing pressure to build up in a line that drains moisture and other waste from the engine. Mr Jurgen Beck, a board member of the German space agency, said the aborted launch was 'extremely irritating'. Germany is hoping to play a significant role in European operations aboard a future US space station. The German agency is spending Dollars 560m (Pounds 394m) on the mission and is under political pressure to get it off the ground. The seven-strong crew included two German physicists. Researchers had been waiting five years for this Spacelab mission, the second to be sponsored by Germany. It has been dogged by problems, however, having been first planned in September 1988, but postponed because of the Challenger disaster two years earlier. It had been supposed to lift off on February 25, but has been postponed several times for technical reasons. The launch director, Mr Bob Sieck, said it would take three weeks to remove Columbia's engine valves for analysis and carry out other inspections. Officials said it was too soon to say how the delay would affect this year's shuttle flight schedule or whether Discovery's atmospheric research mission planned for early April would go ahead as planned. Mr Matthias Wissmann, the new German research minister, said last week that the mission would be the last example of Germany's national participation in the 'prestige' area of manned space travel. In future, the space programme should be based on wider and cheaper international co-operation.</p>

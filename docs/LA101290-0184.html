			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOND PRICES PULL DOW UP 32.92 POINTS  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks closed sharply higher today, buoyed by rising bond prices,  lower oil prices and bargain-hunting by investors.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.92 points to end the week at 2,398.02,  cutting its loss for the week to 112.62 points.  </P> <P> The rally reversed a three-day trend in which the 30-share average fell more  than 150 points.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a heavy 187.94 million shares,  against 180.06 million Thursday. Leading issues outgained losers by 3 to 2.  </P> <P> Investors were encouraged by Treasury bond prices that rose by more than a  point with yields falling to around 8.97%, and by oil prices that dipped below  $40 a barrel.  </P> <P> Despite the technical rally, brokers said the economic and financial news  offered little evidence of lasting relief from the recession worries that have  plagued the market for several months.  </P> <P> Bond prices rose in early trading today amid further negative reports on the  nation's economy and unconfirmed reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein  said he may pull out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which plunged $9, was up $4.43 per  $1,000 in face value at midday. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, fell  to 8.97% from 9.06% late Thursday.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that the wholesale price index of finished goods  jumped 1.6% in September, propelled by surging energy prices.  </P> <P> Negative news had been widely anticipated from the index, which provides a  measure of inflationary pressures in the distribution pipelines of the economy.  Still, brokers said, the figure served as a damper on whatever hopes existed  for a relaxation of the Federal Reserve's credit policy any time soon.  </P> <P> Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.1% in September  but cautioned that the sales were artificially inflated by the soaring cost of  gasoline.  </P> <P> Analysts said the inflation outbreak, coupled with a relatively positive report  on retail sales, deepens the dilemma facing the Federal Reserve. The central  bank has been under pressure to lower interest rates to spur the economy.  </P> <P> Any indication the Fed might ease rates tends to spur the bond market, since  lower interest rates translate to higher prices for fixed-income securities.  </P></p>

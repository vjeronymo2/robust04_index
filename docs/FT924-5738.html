			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Express share offer price fixed at 165p NATIONAL Express, Britain's biggest scheduled coach service operator, yesterday priced its share placing and offer for sale that will take the company to the stock market with a capitalisation of Pounds 59.4m. Some 27.8m shares are being sold at 165p each, raising Pounds 45.9m. Of this, Pounds 25.6m is new money being raised by the company and the remaining Pounds 20.3m represents stock being sold by existing shareholders, mainly the company's venture capital backers. National Express, once part of the state-owned National Bus Company, was privatised through a management buy-out in 1988. It changed hands again for just Pounds 10m last year when Mr Ray McEnhill and Mr Adam Mills, now chief executive and finance director respectively, took control through a management buy-in. The increase in the value is based on a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.2m in 1991 to a forecast pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.5m for the 53 weeks to January 2 1993. The offer price represents 10 times forecast earnings per share. The notional dividend for the year would have been 7.12p, yielding 5.75 per cent. All the shares to be sold are being placed with institutional and other investors, but a quarter of them will be made available to the public through an offer for sale. Mini-prospectuses are being handed out to passengers and the company's advisers say that more than 7,500 people have dialled a help-line to ask for information. Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, is sponsor to the issue and Smith New Court is broker. The offer closes at 10am on December 1, with dealings expected to begin on December 10. COMMENT A share in National Express could prove a one-way ticket to a not particularly inviting destination. Coach travel's share of the long-distance passenger transport market is already small, and the combination of rising car ownership and worsening road traffic congestion will do little to slow its further decline. National Express could notionally buck the trend by expanding within the coach travel market, but that may not be easy with the Office of Fair Trading breathing down its neck; and with the OFT promising a visit in any case next year, even making much more money out of existing operations could have its hazards. Profits have an air of fragility about them, representing as they do the difference between what the company can wring out of its low budget passengers and what it must pay the contractors who run some of its coach services. In the longer term, meanwhile, the privatisation of British Rail, presented by the company as an opportunity, could just as easily become a threat if it fulfils the government's ambitions of introducing entrepreneurialism to the railways. That said, a healthy subscription to the offer seems likely if enough National Express passengers mistake the company's share offer for a privatisation, and the unambitious pricing makes sufficient concessions to the downside to hold out the prospect of a modestly successful debut.</p>

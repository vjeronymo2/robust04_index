An increase of 30 percent was also reported in terms of bank  loans in 1993, much higher than the 11.2 billion Macao patacas  (about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the previous year.    According to an official with the bank, last year's bank  loans were mainly used in industrial production and foreign  trade, adding that the sharp increase in this regard had  resulted from the huge demand of capital in Macao in the past  year.

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais shake-up CREDIT Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank, is restructuring its senior management by appointing Mr Michel Renault in the newly created post of joint director general. Mr Renault heads Credit Lyonnais's domestic retail banking interests. He will continue to be responsible for this area as joint director general, but will also assume responsibility for the rest of its commercial banking operations. The improved performance of Credit Lyonnais's domestic banking business was one of the few bright spots in the group's 1991 results when net profits fell to FFr3.16bn (Dollars 637m) from FFr3.71bn in 1990 after it was forced to double its client risk provisions to FFr9.5bn because of loan losses.</p>

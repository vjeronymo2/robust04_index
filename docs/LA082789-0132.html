			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PALOMAR COLLEGE IS UNFAZED, UPBEAT ABOUT COMPETITOR  </P> <P> You might expect Palomar Community College to be looking nervously over its  shoulder these days, not sure what effect the opening of a state university in  San Marcos will have on it.  </P> <P> Palomar College, after all, has been the granddaddy of public higher education  in North County, albeit primarily for college-level freshmen and sophomores.  </P> <P> But now that Cal State San Marcos is moving from paper to reality and is  building a new campus just a couple of miles away, might Palomar be relegated  to some lesser position, rejuvenating the old stigma of being a "junior  college," a "high school with ashtrays"?  </P> <P> Will North County's graduating high school seniors look to the new university  with a gleam in their eyes? Sure, Palomar has been the convenient way station  for lower-division students who looked to finish their studies elsewhere in the  pursuit of a four-year degree. But now that there's the university opening in  town, why not go directly to Cal State San Marcos for the entire scholastic  stint?  </P> <P> Yet, Palomar College sees no need to retrench. Here's a college where  enrollment this fall -- classes start Monday -- is expected to exceed 24,000.  Here's a college that has satellite centers from Camp Pendleton to Borrego  Springs to Rancho Penasquitos, and is negotiating to open its largest satellite  center yet, in a one-time catalogue showroom fewer than 10 miles away in  Escondido, to better accommodate its exploding enrollment.  </P> <P> Here's a college that, like some discount department store selling everything  from toys to tires to televisions, offers a one-day session titled "Fabulous  Freebies and Bargains in America's Finest City," a 13-week course on  early-American rug hooking and a semester-long class on electron microscopy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full-Service Program  </P> <P> Palomar's curriculum mirrors the mission statement for California's system of  community colleges: Offer something for everyone, inexpensively.  </P> <P> By law, community colleges have to admit into their classrooms anyone who is 18  years old. There are no entrance exams, no Scholastic Aptitude Tests. You don't  even need a high school diploma.  </P> <P> Community colleges are part of California's three-tiered system for public  higher education. The University of California system has the strictest  enrollment standards and offers doctorates as the pinnacle of academic  achievement. The CSU campuses are the second tier, with more lenient  </P> <P> qualifications for enrollment and offering bachelor's and master's degrees.  Then there are the community colleges, which accept anyone and offer only  certificates (for vocational trades) and associate in arts degrees for those  who have completed the equivalent of lower-division college work.  </P> <P> For that reason, community colleges have a rap in some circles for catering to  students who wouldn't cut the mustard at a four-year college and who saw the  community college as a chance to learn, at least, how to work on an automotive  engine or handle a wood lathe to get a job.  </P> <P> Maybe so. But then, figure this. A statistical survey by the CSU chancellor's  office shows that Palomar College students who transferred to a state  university earned a grade-point average of 2.74 out of a possible 4.0 in their  junior year at the university. By comparison, students who enrolled as freshmen  at the state universities had an overall grade-point average of 2.63 at the end  of their junior year.  </P> <P> The statistics suggest that Palomar does a better job of preparing students for  upper-division work than do the state universities themselves.  </P> <P> Couple that fact with the cost of going to a community college, and Palomar's  staff and faculty think they have an appeal that can't be beat. A full-time  student at a community college will pay $100 in fees for two semesters. The  same student will pay $976 in fees to attend San Diego State University, and  $1,767 to attend UC San Diego.  </P> <P> "There are still a lot of parents out there -- yuppies who maybe are UC- or  Stanford-educated -- who don't think Palomar is the place for their children,"  said Cynthia Poole, who heads Palomar's counseling office. "But when we go out  to the high schools in the spring and talk to seniors and their parents, a lot  of them are overjoyed by what they hear about Palomar -- the cost, and our  achievements."  </P> <P> That basic spiel is for graduating seniors to spend their first two years of  college at Palomar, pay only $200 in fees, take the same core curriculum,  general education courses that would be offered to lower-division students at a  four-year college -- courses whose units are transferable to the university --  and then decide where to go for upper-division work. By that time, the student  will be able to better select a university to fit his interests.  </P> <P> "A student might start off at San Diego State for his first two years, pay the  fees, and then decide he wants to go into forestry -- something that's not  offered at San Diego State. He'll have to transfer anyway," Poole said.  </P> <P> If the Palomar graduate wants to transfer to UCSD, he's got an inside track.  Under an agreement between UCSD and Palomar, lower-division students who end up  with at least a 2.4 grade-point average (roughly a C+) in a prescribed set of  university-quality courses are guaranteed admission as juniors to UCSD.  </P> <P> Bill Stacy, president of Cal State San Marcos, said a similar arrangement will  be offered between the new university and Palomar, so the two campuses will be  seen as cousins, not competitors.  </P> <P> "I've already got a lot of respect for Palomar," said Stacy, a one-time speech  instructor who came from Southeast Missouri State University to be president of  Cal State San Marcos two months ago.  </P> <P> "I can remember being a debate coach and going to a competition at Pepperdine.  Palomar was there, too, and they really beat up on some schools from the Big  Ten. They've been darned good in intercollegiate debate, even against full,  four-year universities."  </P> <P> Palomar has received national notice, too, for its renowned nursing education  program, Stacy said.  </P> <P> "You don't have to be a Cal State campus to be the best at what you do," he  said.  </P> <P> Stacy and his Palomar counterpart, George Boggs, said they expect in the years  ahead to share students who will attend both schools concurrently, depending on  how their class and work schedules mesh.  </P> <P> "We're going to see students attend both places, rather than exclusively one or  the other," said Boggs, as noteworthy for his soft-spoken ways as he is for his  cowboy boots.  </P> <P> "We've got some work to do, to figure what courses we'll provide to feed into  their majors," he said. "But I also expect they'll be sending students over  here for courses that will be preparatory to their majors -- classes that maybe  we can offer at more convenient times, with good instructors and at reasonable  fees."  </P> <P> Boggs conceded that he was concerned, when Cal State San Marcos was on the  drawing boards, that the new university would drain students who otherwise  would attend Palomar. For that reason, Boggs was one of those who recommended  -- and state officials agreed -- that Cal State San Marcos not enroll freshmen  and sophomores until 1995.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apprehension Relaxed  </P> <P> But Boggs has since rethought his position, reflecting on his days as an  instructor and administrator at Butte Community College, not far from Cal State  Chico.  </P> <P> "We found that Chico brought a lot of students into the region and that, once  there, a lot of those students enrolled at Butte as well. There's a certain  synergism that we expect to experience here, as well."  </P> <P> For its part, Palomar is continuing to grow rapidly, despite a slump in  enrollment in the early 1980s, experienced throughout California's 106  community colleges, brought on in part by an expiration of GI Bill benefits and  the institution of fees, however modest.  </P> <P> At Palomar, enrollment dipped from 20,000 to 15,000. By the end of the coming  school year, Palomar might eclipse 25,000 students, Boggs said.  </P> <P> The average student at Palomar is 30 years old; there are more women than men  on campus. Only about 16% of the students come directly to Palomar from high  school; conversely, about 6% of the students are 65 or older -- drawn by such  courses as "Be Alive as Long as You Live."  </P> <P> Most students are returning to school after several years' absence from a  classroom. Many are retired military personnel; many are women leaving the home  front for the first time because they need to enter the work force. Others are  simply in pursuit of personal enrichment.  </P> <P> As many students take night courses as day courses. Two-thirds of the students  attend part time; the typical student who gets his A.A. degree from Palomar has  taken 5 1/2 years to finish work that could be accomplished full-time in two  years.  </P> <P> Nearly 10% of Palomar's students already have bachelor's degrees and have  returned to Palomar to further their education in different areas, or for  specialized work. Last year, counselor Poole said, three students with doctoral  degrees returned to Palomar so they could get their A.A. degrees, which, in  their professions, meant pay bonuses because it was yet another academic degree  to add to their scholastic pedigree.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 58 Degrees Available  </P> <P> All told, Palomar offers 58 A.A. degrees, in subjects from accounting to  welding technology. But campus boosters say Palomar's contribution to the  community goes beyond the campus setting, which is filled to the brim and  which, on weekday mid-mornings, finds every available classroom occupied.  </P> <P> A full 30% of Palomar's students don't even go to the campus; they attend  courses at the seven satellite centers, including 3,000 students who attend  Palomar classes in the evening at Mt. Carmel High School in Rancho Penasquitos.  One student recently earned her A.A. degree from Palomar without ever stepping  foot on the main campus in San Marcos until graduation day.  </P> <P> "We have a 2,500-square-mile service area," said Bill Flynn, dean of community  education. "A lot of people can't get to us, so we try to get to them."  </P> <P> Like other community colleges, Palomar is able to quickly put together  special-interest courses to meet specific requests. When someone complained  about trouble in mastering his home video camera, Palomar put together a  special, one-day course on the subject, taught by the college's television  production instructor.  </P> <P> "We might get a call from a local industry saying they want a specific course  for their management staff in, say, business communications," Flynn said. "So  we'll tailor-make the package to meet the needs of that company, find an  appropriate instructor, and offer it to them when they want it, where they want  it and cost it out so it's competitive to the private marketplace. It may not  be a college credit course, but it meets their specific needs."  </P> <P> It was that kind of logic that led Palomar to offer, for instance, three  separate three-session courses on how to master the tricky computer  word-processing software "WordPerfect."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than Just Campus Life  </P> <P> Palomar's resources go beyond the classroom. Consider:  </P> <P> * Its 44,000-square-foot, three-story library, housing a collection of nearly  120,000 books and more than 900 periodicals and papers, making it the largest  research library in North County. The library is open to the public, and about  4,000 non-student residents hold library cards.  </P> <P> * Its 47-acre hiking-trail system, featuring an 8-acre landscaped arboretum  with more than 500 types of trees, shrubs, flowers and grasses. A separate  cactus garden is nearby.  </P> <P> * Its acclaimed Boehm Art Gallery, where the works of younger contemporary  artists have won critical exposure that has landed them more prominent showings  elsewhere.  </P> <P> * Its planetarium, which offers free public shows and lectures on Wednesday  nights, and is available for special shows and elementary school field trips so  children can view a re-creation of the night sky projected onto its domed  ceiling.  </P> <P> * A Buckminster Fuller-inspired geodesic dome, built in 1958, which houses  3,000 people for unbroken views of concerts, speakers, graduation ceremonies  and basketball games.  </P> <P> * A 400-seat performing arts theater and discussion, in conjunction with the  city of San Marcos, which has $700,000 burning a hole in its pocket -- for a  community amphitheater in a hillside bowl on the campus' back side.  </P> <P> "For years, Palomar College was out on its own, doing as it pleased, ignoring  the city and itself ignored by the city," said San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau.  "The college seemed to complicate all our problems, especially with traffic."  </P> <P> "But things have turned around in the past few years -- maybe the coming of the  new university had something to do with that," Thibadeau said. "The  amphitheater is an example of that. We've been looking for a site for years,  but, quite frankly, we never looked to the college for help, and they never  offered. But now they've come to us with a proposal: They'll offer the space,  and we would pay to develop, maintain and operate it. There's a new spirit of  cooperation between the two of us."  </P> <P> Boggs, who joined Palomar in 1985, is also credited with smoothing what had  been a rocky relationship between the faculty and staff with the former  administration. Boggs, a chemist by background, said his first marching orders  from college trustees were to "heal wounds" between the administration and the  college's employees, brought on by growing distrust between the two in earlier  years.  </P> <P> Today, Palomar's faculty still is not represented by a collective bargaining  unit, preferring instead to delegate faculty members to meet with the president  in negotiations.  </P> <P> If Boggs has been embroiled in any controversy, it may well have been his  decision to give coaches a stipend for their work, over and above the pay they  receive as instructors, even though some of their instructional time is  reassigned to coaching duties.  </P> <P> A faculty and staff task force formed by Boggs recommended to him that the  coaches not receive an additional stipend, but he nonetheless recommended the  stipend to the college's trustees, and they agreed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problems at a Minimum  </P> <P> "There's some concern on campus that George might have violated the  collegiality that has worked pretty well since he came here," said one longtime  faculty member. "But still, in my meetings with other community college faculty  members around the state, it sounds like we've got the fewest problems of any  in terms of working with our administration."  </P> <P> Boggs deflects the criticism that he is less open to faculty and staff  participation than he once was.  </P> <P> "Collegiality means the administration and the board have an obligation to take  seriously the recommendations of our task forces and committees," he said. "But  that doesn't necessarily mean you don't still disagree."  </P> <P> Overall, it appears that morale on campus is healthy, especially among the  faculty, if not the students who will begin the daily scramble for parking  spaces Monday.  </P> <P> "We're here because we want to teach, and we're allowed to teach," said Pat  Schwerdtfeger, president of the faculty senate and an instructor of speech and  religious studies.  </P> <P> "The faculty at (San Diego) State and UCSD generally have larger classes. Many  of them are taught by graduate assistants, and the professors are often  focusing on research and on getting published," he said.  </P> <P> "But here, I can teach. I've got 25 to 30 students in a class, and I can  actually get to know them personally. They've got my full attention. It's fun  for them, and it's fun for me."  </P></p>

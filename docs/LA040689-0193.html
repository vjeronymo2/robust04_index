			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UEBERROTH GROUP AGREES TO BUY EASTERN, SHARE IT WITH EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> A group led by former baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth has agreed to  buy Eastern Airlines in a $464-million deal that would give the strike-crippled  carrier's employees a major share of the company, the parties announced today.  </P> <P> The deal, subject to approval by Eastern creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy  Court, followed lengthy negotiations with Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. and  was greeted with cheers by union members locked in a bitter struggle with  Eastern management.  </P> <P> The purchase was also conditioned on Eastern reaching new work agreements with  its striking unions by April 10.  </P> <P> Under the deal accepted by Texas Air, Ueberroth and Thomas Talbot, a former  airline executive from California, would own 30% of the airline. Eastern's  unions would get another 30% of the company in exchange for wage and work-rule  concessions.  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Ardshiel Inc., a smaller New York firm, will  place securities for the remaining 40% of the company.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said if the unions  agreed to the deal, the nation's seventh-largest airline could resume flying 24  hours later. He also said the airline intended to file a bankruptcy  reorganization plan that would pay creditors 100%.  </P> <P> Lorenzo will remain in charge of Eastern until the deal is approved, but  Ueberroth will participate in formulating the reorganization plan.  </P> <P> Lorenzo said the purchase includes about $200 million in cash and the rest in  securities.  </P> <P> Miami-based Eastern has been virtually paralyzed since March 4 by a machinists  union strike that has drawn the support of pilots and flight attendants.  Eastern filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in U.S.  bankruptcy court in New York on March 9 as its cash dried up.  </P> <P> "To sum it up, it's a mammoth challenge. I'm convinced that there is a spirit  amongst the people in the company that I can help bring together to help this  airline," Ueberroth said.  </P> <P> Texas Air would get $200 million in cash, Eastern notes worth about $185  million, plus Eastern assets valued at about $79 million, including Eastern's  Miami-London and New York-Montreal routes, plus eight landing slots and one  gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport.  </P> <P> About 500 striking machinists jammed their local union hall in Miami, chanting  and cheering "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Lorenzo's got to go" and "Take me out to the  ballgame" as they heard news of the sale.  </P></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / US consumer prices up 0.3% US consumer prices in July rose by a subdued 0.3 per cent, the same increase as in the previous month, according to a Labour Department report out yesterday. As with the wholesale price index published on Thursday, higher energy and coffee prices were the main components in the rise. The core rate in July - excluding food and energy - went up by just 0.2 per cent, lower than the 0.3 per cent recorded in each of the two previous months. The CPI now has risen at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent so far this year, suggesting no undue inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, the markets still expect the Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates next week, probably by 0.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</p>

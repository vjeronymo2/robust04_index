			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Management 'shambles' admitted at health authority MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS in the West Midlands Regional Health Authority resulted in at least Pounds 10m-worth of expenditure for which little or no value was received, a report to the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. MPs on the committee have been examining aspects of the authority's administration since a district auditor's report last year concluded that a consultancy exercise designed to save Pounds 50m had cost up to Pounds 4m. Sir Duncan Nichol, National Health Service chief executive, yesterday admitted that the overall situation revealed by the auditor had been a 'shambles'. He accepted that his NHS management executive should have become aware of the West Midlands problems sooner than it did. Following the consultancy investigation, the district auditor carried out further inquiries and concludes in a report that the authority was suffering from 'general management problems'. The report finds that the authority's board failed to exert sufficient control. A decision by the board to set up a separate regionally managed services division to oversee peripheral activities, says the report, was valid. But the board's subsequent action in leaving the division's director to operate without effective direction and control was an 'unacceptable abrogation of responsibility'. The then regional general manager had failed to report significant developments to the board or control the actions of senior officers. 'Many of the RHA's management controls did not work. The arrangements set up to monitor internal activities failed to identify problems and did not facilitate prompt action when it was needed.' Numerous developments had depended on business plans that were 'uniformly speculative and unrealistic'. Neither the board nor senior officers reappraised plans in the light of changing circumstances. The report says financial control at the health authority had fallen below the standards generally expected of a public body.</p>

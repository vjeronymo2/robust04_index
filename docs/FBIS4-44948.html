			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 15 Ordibehesht [5 May] KEYHAN News Service  -- Hafez Ahmad Bakhsh, general secretary of the Pakistan Corps  of the Companions, threatened that if the project to lay the  Iranian gas pipeline across Pakistan to India is carried out,  this corps' agents will vigorously fight it.    He gave a press conference in Pakistan's Sind Province in  which he accused Iran of interfering in Pakistan's domestic  affairs. He said: Ever since Pakistan's new government first  came to power, Iran has continuously interfered in our country's  domestic affairs.    The general secretary of the Corps of the Companions, which  receives financial and political support from Saudi Arabia, said  that the existence of Iran's cultural houses in Pakistan's  cities is a danger to Pakistan's security. He said: The Corps of  the Companions has expressed concern about the existence of  Iran's cultural houses in eight of Pakistan's cities and it  demands that the constant entry of Iranian delegations into  Pakistan be stopped.    He expressed sharp opposition to the project to lay Iran's  gas pipeline across Pakistan to India, calling it interference  in Pakistan's domestic affairs. He warned that the Corps of the  Companions will not permit one inch of this pipeline to cross  Pakistani soil.    Hafez Ahmad protested the move by the Islamabad government  to  expel Arab terrorists residing in Pakistan. He called them Arab  mojahedin and said: The current government of Pakistan has  called the Arab mojahedin living in Pakistan terrorists and has  ordered their expulsion, yet they fought to protect Pakistan's  territorial integrity. The Islamabad government has recently  arrested several Arabs living in Pakistan for the crime of  creating fear and terror and for engaging in terrorist acts, and  intends to expel them from Pakistan.    The general secretary of the Corps of the Companions warned  the Islamabad government not to expel the Arab terrorists and  said: If the Arab mojahedin are treated in an inappropriate and  unethical way, the Corps of the Companions will vigorously fight  this action.    The Corps of the Companions is one of the Pakistani groups  that have caused many factional and religious clashes in this  country. This corps, which is maintained by Saudi Arabia, is  openly hostile to the Shiites of Pakistan, and one of its  permanent programs is to mount armed attacks against Shiite  religious and ideological gatherings and to kill and maim  innocent people.</p>

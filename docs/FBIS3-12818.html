He and President Husni  Mubarak will hold urgent consultations and comprehensively  evaluate the peace process and the developments in the wake of  the Hebron massacre.    This was stated by Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id  Kamal, who told MENA in an exclusive statement that late last  night he conveyed to Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa a message from  President 'Arafat on some obstacles the Israelis and Americans  are still raising to a UN Security Council resolution condemning  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and approving the deployment of  international observers in the West Bank and Gaza.    The Palestinian ambassador said the United States rejects  any  mention of Arab Jerusalem in any Security Council resolution on  the pretext that Jerusalem will be discussed in the final stage  of the negotiations.    Kamal noted that this problem can be overcome by calling for  dismantling the settlements and protecting the Palestinians in  all the territories occupied in 1967, which implicitly means  Arab Jerusalem.    He said 'Arafat's message to the Egyptian leadership is part  of the constant, ongoing coordination and consultations between  Egypt and the PLO, especially within the framework of Egypt's  current efforts to issue a Security Council resolution  condemning the Hebron massacre.    The Palestinian ambassador to Egypt said while in Cairo  'Arafat will also receive a report from Dr. Nabil Sha'th on his  talks in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and a number of his advisers, especially Dennis  Ross, the general coordinator of the Middle East peace talks.    Kamal called on the United States to adopt an effective  position on forcing Israel to disarm the settlers, not only in  Gaza and Jericho, but also throughout the West Bank, too.    He explained that the issue of an international presence or  forces in Gaza and Jericho is not new, as it was mentioned in  the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached in  Oslo and signed in Washington on 13 September. Full details of  that declaration had been worked out by Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators before the al-Ibrahimi massacre, he said.    He stressed that the Palestinians now want the settlers to  be  disarmed effectively and expeditiously.    Kamal called on the United States to take effective measures  to recognize the PLO, as it promised to do during a meeting in  Washington in October between PLO Political Department Chief  Faruq Qaddumi and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>

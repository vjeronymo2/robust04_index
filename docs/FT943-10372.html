			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television John Major's recent cabinet re-shuffle was a pathetic non event when compared with Harold Macmillan's Night of the Long Knives in August 1962 when he summarily sacked a third of his cabinet. Timewatch (BBC 2 at 8pm) examines this cathartic event, mixing rare archive footage and interviews with some of the ministers involved. Michael Cockerell's documentary airs the idea that Macmillan was launching a pre-emptive strike to thwart a plot to overthrow him. Just how big a disaster The Living Soap (BBC 2 at midnight) has turned out to be is indicated by this late slot for the final two episodes. The idea of filming a group of Manchester students as they shared a house, and their lives, came up against some unmanageable egos. The problem was that none of the participants could be other than extroverts who saw taking part in the project as the first step towards a career in the media. Richard Littlejohn - Live and Uncut (ITV at 10.30) is determined to make this as controversial as his tabloid newspaper column and his radio programme.</p>

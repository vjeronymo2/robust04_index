			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN COMPOSER STANDS IN FOR MOZART  </P> <P> An Austrian group has chosen a Japanese composer's arrangement of a requiem  left unfinished by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to mark the 200th anniversary of the  composer's death, it was announced today.  </P> <P> The International Stiftung Mozarteum, an organization devoted to Mozart  research, chose Shigeaki Saegusa's "Symphonic Concerto for Violin, Viola, Cello  and Orchestra."  </P> <P> It is to be performed Dec. 5, 1991, the anniversary date.  </P> <P> Saegusa's composition is a completed version of Mozart's unfinished "Requiem  Mass." For unknown reasons, Mozart was unable to complete the piece he was  commissioned to write in the summer of 1791.  </P> <P> One of his students, Franz Xavier Sussmayr, completed a version of the work  after Mozart died later that year.  </P> <P> But, Saegusa said, "Sussmayr's version was written in a style too 'romantic' to  suit Mozart's composition. . . . The Stiftung Mozarteum asked me to write my  own version."  </P> <P> "I tried to return to his state of mind," said Saegusa, one of Japan's foremost  composers of classical music.  </P> <P> He said his composition will be recorded in May and released next August.  </P></p>

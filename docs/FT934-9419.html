			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: A little help from their friends - Venezuela is using foreign investment to develop the nation's petroleum industry Venezuela has announced a Dollars 45.8bn investment programme for its petroleum industry over the next 10 years that stresses a substantial increase in crude oil production capacity and the upgrading of oil refineries to produce higher-quality products. The plan, which was announced by Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of national oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), assigns a key role to foreign investment in Venezuela's oil and gas sectors for the first time since the country nationalised all private oil companies in 1976. Of the Dollars 48.5bn in projected capital spending, PDVSA plans to invest Dollars 29.1bn or 60 per cent of the total directly, while private companies  -mainly foreign investors - are expected to supply the remainder of about Dollars 19.4bn. Groups such as Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon, Conoco, Mitsubishi and Total are already planning large joint-venture projects with PDVSA in natural gas and heavy oil. And the Venezuelan oil company is actively seeking new partners for a variety of other projects in oil exploration and production, refining, petrochemicals and coal. PDVSA ranks as one of the world's biggest oil companies; at the 1992 year-end it had 63.3bn barrels of crude oil reserves, the largest outside the Middle East. One of the main thrusts of the company's investment programme is to develop crude oil production potential of 4m barrels per day (b/d) by 2002, up 1.1m b/d from the current capacity of approximately 2.9m b/d. New exploration work will be carried out in traditional oil production zones and other areas, and PDVSA's goal is to raise proved reserves of crude oil to 65bn barrels over the next decade, up 3 per cent from the current level. International investors are becoming involved in PDVSA's plans through operating agreements, production sharing and strategic associations. Under operating agreements, private companies invest to develop production of crude oil and natural gas in so-called 'marginal fields', or areas with relatively small volumes of production that PDVSA does not wish to operate directly. Investors do not own the oil and gas they produce but are compensated according to production volume. The first operating agreements were signed in 1992, and earlier this year British Petroleum agreed to invest around Dollars 60m over the next three years in a marginal oil field under a 20-year operating agreement. Using a BP study, PDVSA has also identified sectors in eastern Venezuela with strong prospects for large discoveries of light and medium-weight crudes, which Venezuela needs to balance out its existing reserves, now dominated by heavy crudes. Next year, PDVSA plans to look for international partners who will assume all the risks to develop these zones. If commercial quantities of oil are discovered, PDVSA will share future production with the foreign partner. Last August, PDVSA received congressional approval to move ahead with two multi-billion dollar projects to produce and upgrade heavy oil. Conoco, Total, Itochu and Marubeni are the international partners. The investors plan to produce heavy and extra-heavy crude from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt (a large reserve of heavy oil), and use delayed coking to convert it into lighter-weight, higher-value crude for export. In addition, PDVSA, Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi are developing a Dollars 5.6bn project to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export. In refining, PDVSA will complete upgrading projects at three of its home refineries and raise crude processing capacity at these plants and Curacao - where it leases a former Shell refinery from the government - from the current level of 1.1m b/d to 1.2m b/d by 2002. That increase will be quite small in volume terms but the company is investing heavily to upgrade and modernise the refineries so that they can turn out high-quality, increased-value, refined products, meeting tougher environmental standards in the US and other markets. PDVSA, which already owns, either wholly or jointly, large oil refining operations in the US and Europe, plans to expand its overseas network through the acquisition of new refining capacity. The company would not comment on its acquisition plans, but executives said future marketing efforts would focus on Latin America and Asia, as well as on expanding market share in the Caribbean. In developing their 10-year programme, PDVSA planners are assuming 2 per cent annual growth in world energy demand during 1992-2002, with projected demand for hydrocarbons reaching 76m b/d by 2002, up from consumption of 66m b/d in 1990. They also assume that potential demand for Venezuelan crude oil on international markets will rise to about 3.6m b/d in 2002, and to 4.5m b/d in 2010. Home demand for refined oil products is expected to grow at 2 per cent a year. Venezuela's crude oil production last year averaged 2.33m b/d, while exports of crude and refined products averaged 2.1m b/d, with crude accounting for 1.43m b/d of the total. A large share of the country's crude oil exports is processed at PDVSA refineries in the US and Europe.</p>

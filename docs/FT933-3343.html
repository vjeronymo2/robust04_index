			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Decks cleared ahead of Italian global deal ISSUANCE in the international bond market yesterday was mainly restricted to top-quality borrowers as the decks were cleared for the Republic of Italy's global offering. The dollar-denominated issue, which could be launched early tomorrow for pricing on Thursday, is widely expected to raise Dollars 5bn. This would break the current record of Dollars 3bn for a global bond offering. Italy is thought to be considering a two-tranche structure for its first global offering, one with a maturity of 10 years and the other with a maturity of 30 years. The yield spreads being discussed in the market are 60-65 basis points for the 10-year tranche, and 80-85 basis points for the 30-year tranche. Bankers said initial reaction from east Asian investors to the Italian roadshow had been muted, but that it had strengthened in recent days. They also reported that Italian treasury officials were encouraged by response from the US. This is the first opportunity for US domestic investors to buy dollar bonds issued by Italy. The extent of their interest will determine the issue's size. Borrowers are queueing up to tap the Euromarket once Italy's offering is out of the way. KfW, the triple-A rated German government agency for redevelopment, is understood to be preparing a 10-year offering to raise between DM1bn and DM1.5bn. The offering, via Commerzbank and CSFB, is expected to be priced to yield 15 basis points over underlying German government bonds. This is roughly the same spread at which KfW raised DM1.5bn through a 10-year deal last March. The Japanese Development Bank is thought to be looking at the sterling sector for its planned Eurobond offering. The market has been waiting for JDB to raise the equivalent of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m in the Euroyen sector. However, the sterling sector currently offers a swap into yen which would enable JDB to narrowly beat its funding target. JDB last launched a sterling Eurobond issue in 1988. Among yesterday's issues, Kellogg, the US breakfast cereals group, capitalised on its triple-A rating and its rarity value to achieve a spread of just nine basis points over Canadian Treasuries for its CDollars 265m, five-year Eurobond offering. Lead manager Lehman Brothers said Kellogg had only launched five Eurobond issues of more than Dollars 100m in the last 10 years. The proceeds of the issue were thought to have been swapped into dollars. Demand for the Council of Europe's eight-year Ecu150m Eurobond issue was such that the bonds rose as high as 100 3/8 in the afternoon from their par re-offer price. There has been a severe shortage of new issues in this sector. Joint lead manager UBS said European retail investors were particularly keen buyers of the bonds. Investors looking for high-yielding paper in the French franc sector were attracted to the five-year FFr750m Eurobond issue launched by Pemex, the Mexican state oil company. The bonds were priced to yield 212 1/2 basis points over underlying French government bonds. They were not freed to trade by late afternoon. Pemex, which raised FFr500m last year, is the only Latin American borrower so far to have tapped this sector of the Euromarket.</p>

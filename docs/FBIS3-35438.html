			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Tehran, 26 Dey [16 Jan] (KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News  Service) -- In a speech to a group of members of the Editorial  Board of KEYHAN newspaper, the supervisor of the KEYHAN  Institute emphasized: The newspapers must deal with the problems  afflicting society and the people and they must carry the  message of Islam and the nation.    In his first appearance before a gathering of KEYHAN's  reporters, Hoseyn Shari'atmadari, the vice-regent's  representative and supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute, discussed  the heavy mission of the press in presenting culture and ideas.  He added: Today writers are seen as the standard-bearers in the  clash between media and cultures. In this arena, nothing is  accomplished by media with no message.    The vice-regent's representative in the KEYHAN Institute  gave  his view concerning criticism in the press as follows: As the  leader of the revolution said, the Islamic government is like a  battle front, where no one aims his rifle at himself. This is  true, but this does not mean that if someone sees someone else  sleeping in this trenches he will not startle him awake, or that  you do not remind a trench builder when he neglects to make  earthworks. Criticism must be constructive, and the language of  friends differs from the language of enemies.    Elsewhere in his talk, Shari'atmadari said: The late Imam  (peace be upon him) said concerning the press that both what is  written and what is not written must be evaluated. The press  must bear the message of Islam and the nation and it must be  used for their growth and advancement.    During this meeting Mehdi Nasiri, manager of the newspaper  KEYHAN, discussed the criticism that is made of this newspaper.  He said: In the last few years some of the Western media as well  as publications printed outside the country affiliated with the  counterrevolutionary minigroups have been hostile towards  KEYHAN, but this opposition has no result other than to  strengthen our belief that we are right.    Nasiri added: Some domestic forces are also counted among  KEYHAN's critics. We never consider ourselves free of mistakes  and without need of criticism or reminders, and we even act on  the basis of much of the criticism, but if people sometimes want  KEYHAN to change its line and to retreat from its basic  positions, I say that we have chosen this path consciously and  with much consultation and consideration of interests, and we  will continue it.</p>

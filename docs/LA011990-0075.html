			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEVEN HOSPITALIZED AS PLAYERS, FANS, BAND ENGAGE IN BRAWL  </P> <P> A 15-minute, gymnasium-wide brawl during Thursday night's basketball game  between North Carolina Central and North Carolina A&amp;T resulted in at least  seven people being hospitalized.  </P> <P> At the height of the fracas, about 300 fans were on the court, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said fighting, including the throwing of chairs, spread throughout  the gymnasium.  </P> <P> The incident began with 8:04 left in the second half when Derrick Leak, a  forward for visiting N.C. Central, was fouled by center Jimmy Humphries. The  two players shoved each other and the situation quickly escalated into a brawl.  </P> <P> At least one spectator, an unidentified member of the N.C. A&amp;T pep band,  was removed from the court on a stretcher, officials said. "Even people from  the A&amp;T pep band were fighting," N.C. Central sports information director  Wallace Dooley said by phone. "They were hitting people with their  instruments."  </P> <P> Orby Moss, N.C. A&amp;T athletic director, pleaded in vain over the public  address system for spectators to remain in their seats. The fighting continued,  and Moss suspended the game with Division I N.C. A&amp;T leading, 39-38,  against the defending NCAA Division II national champions.  </P> <P> Neither team reported injuries.  </P> <P> "It was very, very scary," N.C. A&amp;T Coach Don Corbett said. "We could have  had a full scale riot in there. I truly didn't see what happened. I saw a  push."  </P> <P> Dooley said a teleconference between school officials would be held today to  discuss when -- or if -- the game would be played. "It was a hotly contested  game between two rivals and it's a shame that the game couldn't be decided  (Thursday night)," N.C. Central Coach Mike Bernard said. "It's a shame their  fans didn't get the opportunity to see the whole ballgame."  </P></p>

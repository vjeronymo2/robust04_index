			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Salomon suffers wave of staff departures SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house which was caught rigging US treasury bond auctions last summer, has suffered a wave of staff defections from its London equity operations. The annual meetings of the worldwide senior management of Salomon Brothers, which started in New York last week, will this week discuss staff compensation, following worries about how to stem staff losses. Departures include Mr Nick Bedford, head of equity sales; Mr Chris Mitchinson, head of equity research and strategy; Mr Ian Hannam, head of international equities syndication; and Mr Rainer Frey, also from equities syndication. Salomon has also lost two European equity traders, a senior Eastern European expert who worked on the firm's international equity offering for Fotex, and the head of its Paris office. Mr Jim Massey, head of Salomon Brothers' international business said: 'We have lost a few people in London whom we did not want to lose.' He added that the shake-up in the equities business 'wasn't a major restructuring . . . we had some weak links, and these have been expunged'. Mr Massey 'categorically denied' that Salomon Brothers is cutting back its international equity business. A spokesman for Salomon Brothers said 'everyone who goes will be replaced, there will be no net loss' although the firm admitted that several of the jobs remain vacant.</p>

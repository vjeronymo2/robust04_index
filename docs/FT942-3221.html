			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (16): Tiger leaps into video-on-demand business - Canada is aiming for a new national 'information delivery infrastructure' The quest for diversification faced by many of the world's largest telecommunications organisations is well under way in Canada - where the roles of governments, as well as the existing near-monopoly of a few large telecommunications and cable television providers are changing. On the cable television front, some of the country's leading cable television providers (the largest of which has diversified into the provision of long-distance telephone services) were given a boost last week by the announcement from the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) that it would grant approval for seven new English language and two new French language speciality television channels for marketing next year. The move follows months of hearings by the CRTC of some 48 applications for the provision of services - and the announcement by the country's leading telephone companies that they wanted to get into the entertainment business via the planned 'information highway'. A survey which was conducted by one of the country's leading polling organisations - the Toronto-based Decima Research - over the time period when the hearings were under way - found that 72 per cent of the respondents believed that Canada's competitiveness in the next five to 10 years would depend on the country's ability to provide a 'sophisticated information delivery infrastructure'. Respondents to the Decima poll were reported to have seen key roles for federal and provincial governments, industry, and academia in developing information infrastructure. The poll also apparently showed the need for co-operation among those four big groups with findings that 92 per cent of respondents believed technological changes now taking place would fundamentally alter the way people did business in the future. Furthermore, 74 per cent felt Canadian society would see more changes in the next two years than in the last 10; 60 per cent believed technology had improved the quality of life for the average Canadian. The poll also showed that 85 per cent agreed that most businesses and governments had not yet fully realised the economic potential of the information highway. It is perhaps with these results in mind that in April the Stentor group (a consortium of the country's largest telephone companies) revealed plans for a broadband information highway that, it estimated, would require some CDollars 10bn of new investment and would create 12,000 jobs. The group predicted that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of Canadian businesses and homes would have access to these new services by the year 2005 under what it called the 'Beacon Initiative'. The plan calls for the establishment of high-tech wonders - such as 'virtual' courtrooms, virtual classrooms, remote diagnoses by doctors and 'video-on-demand' movies. Stentor appears willing to put its money where its mouth is in making this investment, however, with announced plans to spend some CDollars 500m on network enhancements, the creation of a new company to supply multimedia software to the establishment of a venture capital fund to assist small companies that want to create produces for use on the 'highway'. Rogers Communications, the country's largest cable television provider, is fighting back and recently announced plans for consumer trials of a new home video delivery technology developed in the US by Microsoft, the computer software giant, and TCI, the US cable television firm. The Microsoft/TCI venture (which has been code-named 'Tiger') marks the first of many much-publicised moves into the fast-growing 'video on demand' business. Microsoft says that it will provide a fully scalable media file-server solution that can be used from desktop computers right up to the citywide deployment of cable television images. Computer companies Compaq and Intel have also demonstrated the first continuous-media server hardware based on this Tiger technology. The idea behind it is that it should provide a lower-cost way of delivering video-on-demand by using standard personal components and asynchronous mode transfer (ATM) switches as part of the delivery mechanism - bringing down the cost of entry into this pioneering market. Microsoft says that it will allow thousands of users to gain 'split- second' access to thousands of media files (such as movies, music videos or TV shows) and allow laserdisc quality control of them - including the ability to pause, reverse, fast-forward and jump ahead to specific parts of the media file being currently played. Mr Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's senior vice president, advanced technology, says he hopes this move will start to dispel the notion that only very high-end, expensive systems can be used to deliver video-on-demand. 'Some people assume that video-on-demand is a hardware problem for massively parallel machines, but it's really a software issue,' he says. 'Once you have the right software, you can implement it in many ways - on personal 'Tigers' for individual or workgroup use, corporate 'Tigers' for small or mid-sized private networks or city 'Tigers' for large-scale, metropolitan service areas.' Tiger is based on Microsoft's existing Windows NT Advanced Server software and will be tested in Seattle by employees of both Microsoft and US cable television giant TCI as part of a pilot project this year - with more widescale testing in Canada, Seattle and Denver in 1995. The data from these tests will partly determine the eventual release date for any products based on Tiger. Microsoft is betting that Tiger will appeal strongly to cable television, telephone, utility and private network companies and will be used to deliver services such as telecommuting, video messaging, information navigation, corporate multimedia servers, television post-production work, shopping kiosk production and business transaction processing.</p>

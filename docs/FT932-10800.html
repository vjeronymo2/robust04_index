			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Brussels threat on energy THE EC competition commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, wants to take six countries to the European Court for maintaining monopolies on the import and export of gas and electricity. He told a conference on competition policy yesterday that such a move would give all member states a 'clear warning that things will change' in the energy sector, where Commission liberalisation plans have made little headway. Mr Van Miert alleges that Denmark and France have retained monopolies on the export and import of gas to other EC countries, while Spain, France, Italy, Ireland and the Netherlands have monopolies in electricity transit, contrary to treaty rules. The infringement was so obvious he did not see how the court could fail to back the Commission's hard line. The EC has adopted directives to free up the transit of electricity and gas across EC borders. Proposals to open up the energy sector to greater competition are stalled as many states oppose 'third party access' to the networks.</p>

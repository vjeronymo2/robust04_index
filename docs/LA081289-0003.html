			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHIITE BOMBER'S DREAM WAS TO KILL AUTHOR RUSHDIE  </P> <P> The Shiite Muslim suicide bomber who wounded five Israeli soldiers in south  Lebanon said in a videotape released Friday his dream had been to kill British  author Salman Rushdie.  </P> <P> "I wish I had executed the death sentence of the hypocrite agent Salman  Rushdie, fulfilling the edict of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but God  graced me with the operation against Israel," said Sheik Assad Birro in his  videotaped final testament.  </P> <P> Khomeini died in June four months after ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie for  blaspheming Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses." Several pro-Iranian  groups in Lebanon said they would carry out the command.  </P> <P> Birro, who died in the attack, urged "all strugglers" to find out where Rushdie  was and kill him. The author has been hiding since Khomeini's edict, which  caused outrage in the West and led to the breaking of diplomatic ties between  Britain and Iran.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Truck With Explosives  </P> <P> The videotape was distributed by Hezbollah (Party of God), which claimed  responsibility for Wednesday's attack in which Birro drove a truck rigged with  explosives into an Israeli army convoy patrolling a buffer zone in southern  Lebanon.  </P> <P> Hezbollah said the attack was to avenge Israel's abduction of a prominent  pro-Iranian cleric, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, from his home in southern Lebanon  on July 28.  </P></p>

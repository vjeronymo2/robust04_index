			<p>CSO     [Text] A new type of artificial fatty droplet, or liposome,  has been developed that can be used in a controlled manner to  fuse with the membranes of living cells.    The liposome was developed as a way to extract useful  products made by cells in a new type of bioreactor being  developed in Japan called the micro-cell reactor. But it also  appears to be a promising vehicle for delivery of drugs to  target cells in the body. The work was carried out by the Agency  of Industrial Science and Technology's National Institute of  Bioscience and Human-Technology.    The liposome readily fuses with fatty membranes because it  incorporates the same protein that the influenza virus uses to  breach the cell membrane and infect cells. Cholesterol and  another compound are mixed. This viral protein is then affixed  around the periphery, producing a protein-studded liposome less  than a micron in diameter.    When these liposomes and red blood cells are mixed in a  neutral solution, nothing happens. But when the acidity is  raised a little, as many as 80 percent of the liposomes fuse  with the red blood cells. This experiment shows that it is  possible to control fusion events between the liposomes and  cells.    The micro-cell reactor differs from conventional bioreactors  in that all processes, from the introduction of raw materials  and energy, to the final stage of production when it is time to  extract useful substances, takes place inside living cells. The  process is designed to boost productivity. The national  institute developed the liposome as part of its effort to  develop an exocyte system to extract useful products from the  reactor.</p>

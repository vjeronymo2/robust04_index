			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / CIS army chief says key issues unresolved THE HEAD of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday said that basic issues of finance, division of arms and agreement on the draft for the coming year had remained unresolved between the CIS governments after the summit meeting at Kiev last week. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said that the budget for the armed forces - except for the independent forces now being created in Ukraine and Moldova - was now being met entirely by Russia, which had put up Rbs50bn for the first quarter of the year. He said that Russia would have again to agree a budget for the second quarter soon, since there had been no agreement from other republics on contributions to the budget. This would mean, he said, that Russia would take over command of 'certain units', which he did not specify. He said the formation of a separate Russian army under a Russian defence ministry, announced last week and under the direct authority of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, would not mean two commanders at the head of the armed forces. A peacekeeping force of 'observers' is to be formed to intervene in areas of conflict, such as Nagorno-Karabakh and in the Trans Dnestr region in Moldova. This would exist outside of the CIS armed forces, and be formed from units from various republics, he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOSQUE ISSUE  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley is right in his reaction to the City Council's rejection of domes  and minarets for a proposed mosque in Granada Hills as "an affront to religious  freedom." What Bradley fails to mention is that it is also an affront to  architectural freedom.  </P> <P> Historically, Angelenos have been blessed with the most bizarre and  free-wheeling of architecture: the Chinese Theater, Clifton's Cafeteria, the  facade of which was a tropical waterfall, the Egyptian Theater in the image of  a Pharaoh's tomb, and the Firestone Tire Co. building that paid structural  homage to the ancient Assyrians.  </P> <P> These buildings and others like them were a delight to visit and part of our  architectural heritage.  </P> <P> If such structural adventures as the new Disney building facade with its seven  dwarfs are right, what makes domes and minarets wrong, regardless of religious  intent?  </P> <P> ED KYSAR  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

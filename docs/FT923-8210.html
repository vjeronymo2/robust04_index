			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Australian sell-off after hopes of rate cut dashed DEALERS reported heavy selling of Australian government bonds yesterday after Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, dashed hopes of a cut in interest rates. The bond market had expected to see an easing in rates fairly soon, possibly timed to follow the Budget on August 18. However, Mr Dawkins said in a radio interview: 'As far as we are concerned, there have been very considerable falls in interest rates already. And the consequences of those reductions are flowing through into the economy now.' He added that given the prevailing domestic and international circumstances he saw no need for 'any further easings in monetary policy'. The yield on the 10 1/2 per cent September 1995 bond rose from 6.60 per cent to 6.88 per cent and dealers reported heavy selling of bonds in Australia and overseas. Traders warned that Mr Dawkins' comments were probably aimed at supporting the Australian dollar, which has weakened from USDollars 0.74 last week to below USDollars 0.72, its lowest level since February 1988. GOOD news on inflation and a reasonably successful afternoon auction of 10-year securities failed to give US Treasury prices a lift yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 107 27/32 , yielding 7.338 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 3/32 at 100 5/32 to yield 4.149 per cent. Trading activity was extremely quiet. The day's main economic news was the release of the producer prices index for July, which was up 0.1 per cent on the month. Although the auction subsequently went off well - the notes were awarded at an average yield of 6.49 per cent - the result was slightly below expectations, and prices retreated further during the afternoon. RUMOURS that Moody's, the international rating agency, is about to downgrade Italy's credit rating, helped to push down Italian government bond prices yesterday. The May 2002 bond fell from 93.86 to a low of 93.50 before closing at 93.58, and dealers reported determined selling by European investors. Elsewhere in the European government bond markets, German government debt drifted lower as the Bundesbank's decision to drain liquidity from the money market yesterday sparked fears of a possible rise in German interest rates. At its latest one-month securities repurchase allocation, the Bundesbank drained DM2.4bn of liquidity from the money market, a larger-than-expected withdrawal of funds. 'The market is sensing a hike in the Lombard rate,' said one dealer. The fall in the other European markets also helped to depress bund prices, and the Liffe bund futures contract fell from 87.28 at the opening to end at 87.16. STERLING's weakness in the foreign exchange markets helped to push UK government bonds lower, with prices falling across the yield curve. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 115 to 114 19/32 to yield 9.5 per cent while the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 declined from 103 9/16 to 103 3/8 . JAPANESE government bond prices ended firmer as the weak state of the Tokyo stock market continued to kindle hopes of lower interest rates. The Nikkei stock index ended down 48.77 points at 14,773.79 yesterday, still below the psychologically important 15,000 level. The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield of 4.955 per cent and traded up to yield 4.915 per cent. In the futures market, volumes in the December contract surpassed that in the September contract, making it the new lead contract.</p>

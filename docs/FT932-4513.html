			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Ex-MGN treasurer arrested and charged MR MICHAEL STONEY, the former treasurer of Mirror Group Newspapers, was yesterday arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud and false accounting over his role in the Maxwell affair. His arrest brings to six the number of defendants being prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office as a result of its investigation into the collapse of the business empire of Robert Maxwell. The conspiracy to defraud charge alleges that Mr Stoney conspired with Mr Maxwell and his son Kevin to defraud MGN by obtaining a Pounds 50m revolving credit facility from the Bankers Trust Company in the name of MGN, but then used the proceeds for other purposes. The offence is alleged to have taken place between August 1 and December 2 1991. Two false accounting charges allege that between October 21 and December 2 1991 he falsified the general ledger of MGN by omitting, or concurring in the omitting of, the receipt of the Pounds 50m on October 21 1991. The charges also allege that he falsified MGN's group financial report by omitting, or concurring in the omitting of, the liability of MGN to Bankers Trust Company in respect of the Pounds 50m facility. After his appearance before City of London magistrates Mr Stoney - who had been charged 'by appointment' at Snow Hill police station in the City - issued a statement through his solicitor saying he 'strenuously denied' all the charges. Mr Stoney was remanded on conditional bail with a single surety of Pounds 50,000 and ordered to surrender his passport. He was allowed to take a one-month family holiday in Miami. The cases against all six defendants are scheduled to be transferred to the Crown Court on July 19. The other five men charged over the affair are Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a financial adviser to the late publisher, Mr Robert Bunn, the former finance director of Maxwell Communication Corporation, and Mr Albert Fuller, the former MCC treasurer.</p>

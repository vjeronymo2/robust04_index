			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia share offer details unveiled Sweden is to offer domestic investors a maximum of 47.5m shares in next month's sale of up to 82.2m shares in Pharmacia, one of Europe's top 10 pharmaceuticals groups. The balance of the issue will go to international institutions, taking foreign ownership in the group above 15 per cent from its current 6 per cent. The figures were revealed yesterday when the prospectus for Sweden's largest privatisation was published. The state plans to sell up to 47.4 per cent of the votes in Pharmacia, but will retain 10.1 per cent to ensure ownership stability. The issue is expected to bring in around SKr10bn (Dollars 1.3bn), based on the company's SKr125 share price. The government wants to make Pharmacia a 'people's share'. It aims to ensure that each private Swedish investor gets at least 50 shares at a SKr10-per-share discount to the institutional price. The issue size has been set at 72m shares - 40m for the public and 32m for institutions - but it will rise to 82.2m if the demand is there. The offer is also subject to a clawback arrangement, meaning institutions could end up with only 24.5m shares. The state intends to offer 10m shares in the US, 9.5m in the UK, 7.5m in the Nordic region and 5m in continental Europe, although final allocations will depend on demand and pricing. The institutional price, to be set through a book-building process, will be published on June 17. Volvo, the Swedish vehicle group, holds a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia which it intends to sell in 1996.</p>

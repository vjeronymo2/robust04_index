Chiang, minister of  economic affairs of the Republic of China [ROC], Monday [28  March] called on the Vietnamese Government to allow Taiwan banks  access to Vietnam.    During a meeting with ranking officials of the central bank  of Vietnam, Chiang said establishment of Taiwan bank operations  in Vietnam is essential "to helping Taiwan investors stay and  expand and consequently contribute to the economic growth of the  Southeast Asian country."    After accepting applications from nine foreign banks,  including one from Taiwan, the Vietnamese Government froze all  other applications.    Chiang asked the Vietnamese officials to give special  consideration to an application from another Taiwan bank -- the  Medium Business Bank of Taipei -- to set up an affiliate in  their country as Taiwan is the top foreign investor here.    Meanwhile, a draft cooperation agreement was signed during a  ceremony Sunday for the development of a sugar refining plant in  Vietnam. The agreement brings together the state-run First  Vietnam Sugar Co., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and three other Taiwan  food processing companies.    The joint venture operation, to be named Vietnam-Taiwan  Sugar  Corp. (VTSC), will be the biggest single investment project ever  from Taiwan.    The VTSC investment, with a price tag of U.S.$66 million and  a projected annual production of 90,000 metric tons of crude  sugar, is awaiting approval from the Legislative Yuan, Chiang  said.    Chiang, during a meeting with Vo Tran Chi, ruling party  secretary-general of Ho Chi Minh City, pointed out that  increasing land prices in Vietnam, fueled by a new land law,  have led to difficulties for foreign investors, specially those  from Taiwan.    The greatest effect will be on a Taiwan industrial  processing  zone which was developed in Hanoi before the land law went into  effect. Under the land law, investors who use the land must pay  compensation for crops which would have been produced on the  land for the next 50 years.    "The investment plan may be put on hold if the problems  surrounding land acquisition are not resolved," said Fang  Jeng-hui, manager of the processing zone.    The new land law has already scared away many potential  Taiwan investors who planned to move their operations to  Vietnam, Fang said.    Up to January, the Vietnamese Government had approved 113  applications by Taiwan investors for investments worth over  U.S.$1.53 billion, making Taiwan the top forign investor here.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL IMPORTS HIT 8 MILLION BARRELS A DAY IN JANUARY  </P> <P> U.S. oil imports soared to more than 8 million barrels a day in January for the  first time since 1980 as demand rose sharply and domestic production continued  to dwindle, an industry trade group said today.  </P> <P> The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil producers and  refiners, said U.S. oil production fell to 7.9 million barrels a day, a 3.4%  drop from January, 1988.  </P> <P> Production in Alaska, which had offset declines in other parts of the United  States in recent years, slipped for the second straight month with no major new  oil fields tapped, the Washington, D.C.-based group said in its monthly report.  </P> <P> Imports of oil surged to an average of 8.2 million barrels a day, an increase  of 20.6% over the January, 1988, level of 6.8 million barrels. It was the first  month that imports averaged more than 8 million barrels since 1980, the API  said.  </P> <P> The rise in imports and drop in domestic production has raised concerns about  national security and other issues regarding U.S. dependence on foreign oil and  many, mostly smaller, producers have called for some form of protective  legislation.  </P> <P> Major oil companies, meanwhile, have been directing more of their exploration  and production dollars overseas where they say oil is cheaper and easier to  find.  </P></p>

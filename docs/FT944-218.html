			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RJB ends 48 years of nationalised coal The age of the nationalised coal industry came to an end early this morning, almost 48 years to the day after the government first took control of Britain's collieries. At one minute past midnight, RJB Mining became the owner of by far the largest part of British Coal: its 15 operational English mines. The deal will make Mr Richard Budge, RJB's chief executive who has been criticised for the assumptions used to back his company's bid price, some Pounds 50,000 richer. His contract allows for this bonus to be paid on completion of the deal, as well as further profit performance payments of up to 100 per cent of his basic Pounds 290,000. RJB's shareholders approved the takeover at an uneventful and sparsely attended EGM in London yesterday. Investors have already put up Pounds 400m towards the Pounds 815m purchase price; the balance will be funded with debt. Mr Budge said he had no plans for substantial changes to the mines or to the employment conditions of the 7,100 miners he was taking on. Previous management had already got the business 'down to the operational levels it should be at', he said. Furthermore, the enlarged company would be able to cut 5 per cent from British Coal's operating costs almost immediately. British Coal's Scottish assets were transferred yesterday to Mining (Scotland) for Pounds 49m. Celtic Energy, which is purchasing the Welsh mines, is expected to conclude the transfer today, leaving British Coal with only non-mining assets to unwind. The deals end a five-year journey to privatisation. The National Coal Board was set up on January 1 1947 to own and operate Britain's mines as an early part of the incoming Labour Party's programme to nationalise basic industries. It was a Conservative government under Mrs Margaret Thatcher which decided in 1989 to reverse the process. Memories of the bitter miners' strike of 1984 - and public sympathy for the mining communities - were still vivid when the government announced the wholesale closure of 31 of its 50 pits in advance of privatisation. The justification was that demand had dropped substantially and and productivity improved, leaving little other option. Public outcry forced a compromise with the immediate closure of just 10 mines. In the end British Coal closed 34 pits, some of which have since been reopened by private operators, including Mr Budge. Sixteen operating pits are being transferred to private ownership today.</p>

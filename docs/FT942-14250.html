			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Spirited performances - James Buxton examines five companies which are leading Scotland's export drive The two biggest companies in the Scotch whisky industry, United Distillers and Allied Distillers, have won awards for export achievement. United Distillers is the whisky and gin subsidiary of Guinness and is the giant of the whisky industry, accounting for 38 per cent of the industry's exports in 1992. It was born in 1986 from the takeover of Distillers by Guinness, which had earlier absorbed Bell's. Allied Distillers is part of the Hiram Walker group, the wines and spirits arm of Allied-Lyons. It began operating in its present form in 1988. Its export sales in 1992 accounted for 7.8 per cent of the industry's total exports. As any expert on the whisky industry will tell you, it is the malt whisky distilleries which have the cachet and the romance, but the grain distilleries which produce the large volumes: the vast majority of whisky is a blend of grain whisky with dashes of a number of malts. Allied has 14 malt distilleries, 12 of them in the Highlands and two on the island of Isla; it also has two grain distilleries, the Strathclyde and Dumbarton distilleries. The company has annual turnover of more than Pounds 320m. In the past three years Allied's exports increased by Pounds 50m to Pounds 270m, a rise of 18 per cent, constituting its claim to the award. 'Our most successful brands are Ballantine's, Teacher's Highland Cream, Long John and our Isla single malt Laphroaig,' says Mr Paul Hick, Allied's marketing director. Ballantine's Finest is the leading brand in western Europe, particularly in Spain where sales have increased by an average of 20 per cent a year and where the brand now claims a quarter of the whisky market. According to Allied, Ballantine's Finest is the third largest brand worldwide with export sales of nearly 5m cases a year. Teacher's, a well known brand in the UK, is also a leading brand in Commonwealth countries, especially Australia and Canada. It is also expanding in Germany where it is the third best selling brand (with Ballantine's the leading brand). Whatever people thought of the Guinness takeover of Distillers few doubt that it was a positive development for the industry. Guinness shook up the individual companies that comprised Distillers, rationalised distilling, bottling and distribution, and centralised marketing and export operations. Mr Alan Gray, the noted whisky analyst who is now with the Edinburgh stockbrokers Sutherland and Partners, pointed out in his 1993 Scotch whisky review that United Distillers controls more than 25 per cent of Scotland's malt whisky distilling capacity, 31 per cent of its grain distilling capacity and had 38 per cent of the export market for blended Scotch whisky. United Distillers plays a big role in Scottish life through its chairman Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden (who chaired Guinness itself after Ernest Saunders was ousted in 1986). It has 27 malt distilleries and two grain distilleries, Cameron Bridge in Fife and Port Dundas in Glasgow. United Distillers won the Queen's export award for its export performance over the past six years, during which its sales outside the UK grew by 10 per cent a year. Over that period United Distillers sold Pounds 4bn worth of whisky and gin. United Distillers produces Johnnie Walker, the world's leading whisky brand which alone sold more than 12m cases in 1993, accounting for one in every five bottles of whisky exported from Scotland. The company's other popular whisky brands include Bell's, Dewar's and White Horse. It also makes Gordon's and Tanqueray gin, with Gordon's alone representing around 50 per cent of all gin exports. Broken down by country, the Guinness subsidiary has seen big increases over the past six years in its sales to countries such as Spain (17 per cent), Germany (20 per cent) and Turkey (25 per cent), with particularly fast growth coming from the small Paraguay market (30 per cent). In Italy, United Distillers' brands saw their sales grow by eight per a year and in Japan, where whisky producers are still fighting discriminatory tariffs, by 6 per cent.</p>

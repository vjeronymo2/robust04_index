			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Bank of Crete defendant dies GREECE'S former deputy prime minister, Mr Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, a defendant in the Bank of Crete embezzlement trial, died in hospital yesterday, eight days after suffering a stroke while questioning a witness, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Mr Koutsogiorgas, who was 69, was accused of accepting a Dollars 2m bribe from the bank's owner in 1988 in return for introducing legislation on bank secrecy. The trial, adjourned after Mr Koutsogiorgas collapsed in the courtroom, can now continue. But without his testimony, it appears increasingly unlikely that Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former prime minister, could be convicted.</p>

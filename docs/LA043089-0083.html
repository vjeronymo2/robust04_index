			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> Before Ken Kuniyuki, a straight-A junior at Torrance High, got to the question  that knocked him out of contention for first place in the first California  Citizen Bee, he had correctly defined the term "stagflation."  </P> <P> "I said that stagflation is a unique economic condition in which a recession  and inflation are combined," the 16-year-old said.  </P> <P> Kuniyuki's coach, Torrance High government teacher Pat Wright, was in the  audience. "He knew it right off and I was so amazed," Wright said.  </P> <P> In the Citizen Bee, a national competition encompassing American history,  geography, economics, politics, culture and current events, Kuniyuki placed  third in the state finals Saturday.  </P> <P> Kuniyuki, whose favorite subjects are social studies and mathematics, stumbled  on a question about President George Bush's gun-control policy.  </P> <P> "I said he put a ban on automatic guns," Kuniyuki said.  </P> <P> Judges ruled his answer incorrect.  </P> <P> "I forgot to say it was a ban on imports," he said. "I presumed that they knew  that I didn't mean all guns, but you can't second-guess the judges. I learned  that."  </P> <P> Despite the gaffe, Kuniyuki garnered a third-place prize of $750 and a spot in  the national finals in Washington on June 17.  </P> <P> "I'm really excited," Kuniyuki said. "I wasn't expecting to win third place.  And going to Washington -- it will be my first time there, so I am even more  excited."  </P> <P> The other California entrants are Stephanus Philip, a Moorpark junior who  placed first, and Margaret Kuo of San Clemente High, who placed second.  </P> <P> Kuniyuki is a member of the Torrance High Service Club, the Science Club, the  Chess Club, the Debate Club and the academic decathlon team.  </P> <P> He is also a student of the 19th Century German philosopher Arthur  Schopenhauer, whose writings he analyzed in a term paper for an honors English  class.  </P> <P> "I like the way that he emphasized compassion in relationships," said Kuniyuki.  On the other hand, he said, Schopenhauer "was extremely pessimistic. Maybe he  was too pessimistic."  </P> <P> Kuniyuki, who typed hundreds of facts into his Apple IIe computer to study for  the state round of the Citizen Bee competition, said he has begun preparing for  the final round.  </P> <P> And he isn't taking anything for granted. "I've already made some notes for  myself," he said. George Stein  </P></p>

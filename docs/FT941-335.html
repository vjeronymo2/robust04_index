			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank rises 24% and increases dividend Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest commercial bank, yesterday said it would raise its dividend DM1.50 to DM16.50 following a 24 per cent rise in 1993 net profits to DM1.403bn (Dollars 816m). Comprehensive annual results will be announced on Thursday, the bank said, adding that yesterday's figures were released after the bank's supervisory board approved the 1993 results. The results at Deutsche are in line with expectations that German banks would report sharply improved figures, contrasting with worse results throughout German industry. Net profit was up from DM1.134bn, bolstered by record results from the bank's Luxembourg operations where pre-tax profits jumped 44.4 per cent to DM636m from DM440m. Deutsche, the largest operator in Luxembourg, increased its number of customers by 28 per cent last year, helped by fears about the effect of a 30 per cent withholding tax introduced in Germany early last year. A 194 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Morgan Grenfell, the wholly-owned UK-based investment bank, earned Deutsche Bank a Pounds 100m (Dollars 150.3m) dividend. The dividend increase will cost the bank DM778m and the outstanding DM625m will be credited to reserves, the bank said. Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, one of two big Bavarian regional banks, is the only one of the big five German commercial banks to have reported so far, announcing a 33 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to DM1.04bn. Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, just behind Deutsche on the commercial banks league, will report in April. Frankfurter Hypothekenbank yesterday raised its dividend DM1.5 to DM16 after reporting net profits up 4 per cent to DM85.5m, followed by Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank which also increased its annual dividend DM1.5 to DM14.50.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Personal View: An example for the rest of Africa South Africa's elections were a reminder to those with jaded political palates how much the vote means when it has been denied for so long. Now comes the hard part - the fulfilment of the masses' expectations that the election of a government of their choice will in a very short time transform into reality their demands for decent housing, better schooling and more jobs. Not that their leaders were extravagant in their pre-election promises, although enthusiastic local activists over-egged the pudding. Among the national leaders, there is a sober appreciation of the tremendous tasks that they will face. I doubt whether this has gone home to the electors in the excitement of living through a truly revolutionary era. In truth, although a beginning can and must be made quickly, a levelling up process will take several years. As many as one-quarter of black people are living in miserable lean-to huts and shanty towns with flimsy housing materials, and with a lack of water, proper sanitation and electricity. The ANC believes that extra social expenditure can be financed by the faster rate of economic growth that they expect now sanctions have been lifted - and in fact the economy has already begun to expand. Another favourable factor is that the country's small international debt should permit additional borrowing, and it will have renewed access to IMF drawings and to World Bank loans. There are signs that many of the 200 to 300 overseas companies which ran down their operations as a result of sanctions are considering returning. The economy of South Africa is altogether larger and stronger than any of its neighbours. It manufactures nearly as much as the whole of sub-Saharan Africa put together and exports twice as much as all the rest. By comparison with its neighbours, it is an industrial giant in every respect. But when viewed against the industrialised west, its deficiencies are glaringly apparent. Sanctions had a bigger impact than was admitted. New investment declined seriously during the 1980s and, if it is to increase to the level at which it can sustain a fast rate of growth, the present low levels of domestic savings need to improve and a favourable climate needs to be established to encourage overseas capital to return. Both big parties in the new government favour lower tariffs and less protection with a reduction of subsidies to domestic industry. And both recognise the need to recover South Africa's international position in price and quality, despite the lack of skilled technical, managerial and professional manpower. But the incoming government must strive to formulate economic policies that will give confidence both at home and overseas, while at the same time transform the social landscape, finding work for the near 50 per cent unemployed, and deliver those basic services which the African people expect. Without economic success, the social improvements will not bear fruit. But without social reform, a democratic society would collapse, and the boldest multi-racial venture ever undertaken in Africa could dissolve in disorder or worse. It will be as difficult a task as any government has undertaken. The world cannot turn its back on South Africa at this crucial moment. Additional resources are needed to enable it to transform itself and to assist its re-integration with the rest of the continent. Whilst it is imperative that South Africa's revolution should succeed for the sake of its own people, an additional bonus will be the enormous impact it would have on sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. It is already a magnet for Africans in other African countries. A few of its continental neighbours have recently embarked on far-reaching reforms and show signs of progress. But that is not the general picture. Some are in turmoil: agriculture stagnates; many are unable to break free from the burden of foreign debt; there is corruption and an absence of sound government, indifferent and sometimes no education, grossly high military expenditure, ethnic tension; and so on. The example of a successful South Africa would galvanise other sub-Saharan countries. What energies might be unlocked if South Africa could hold out a vision of a future in which neighbours could integrate their resources and skills as a means of realising the potential of Africa's rich diverse resources and bringing hope to poverty-stricken millions? What better international role for a newly democratic, multi-racial country emerged from decades of isolation than to assist friends and neighbours weaker than itself to rejoin the mainstream of the international community? South Africa's revolution must not fail. The author was British prime minister from 1976 to 1979</p>

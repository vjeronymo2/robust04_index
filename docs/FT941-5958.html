			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / S Times sends trade ban letter to Malaysia Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, which carried an article said to have provoked the Malaysian government into curbing trade with British companies, has sent a message to Kuala Lumpur that could help thaw relations. Mr Neil has sent the Malaysian government a copy of a letter signed by him, which appears in today's Times, stating that his newspaper has 'no vendetta against Malaysia or its prime minister', Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Meanwhile, Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, confirmed that she had opposed government funding for the Pergau Dam project. She denied, however, that Britain's aid-and-trade policy was a breeding ground for financial corruption as alleged in a report by Professor John Toye, an adviser to the Overseas Development Agency, which was circulated to the Commons foreign affairs committee. Her evidence before the committee came as Lord Younger, former defence secretary, said he alone had taken the decision to link an offer of aid to arms sales. Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, was reported earlier this week as saying that the trade ban would not be lifted until The Sunday Times apologised for alleging that Dr Mahathir took a bribe. Mr Neil states in his letter: 'I regret . . . if subsequent misreporting of a Sunday Times story has led the Malaysian prime minister to believe he has been accused by us of a charge we did not make.' He adds: 'In the light of this clarification, I hope he will conclude that there are no grounds for a ban on British companies doing business with his government.' A copy of the letter has been sent to the Malaysian High Commissioner in London with a request that it be immediately dispatched to his government in Kuala Lumpur. Sources close to the Malaysian government described the letter as a 'step in the right direction', which while not enough to end the trade ban might help restore relations. They suggested the letter may not be unconnected with Mr Rupert Murdoch's media ambitions in Malaysia. Mr Murdoch's News International owns the Sunday Times.

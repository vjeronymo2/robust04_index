			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Head of steam for German rail reform: State support is set to rise unless the system is given a thorough overhaul It is the stuff of politicians' nightmares. At a time when German public finances are already stretched to the limit to pay for unification, a government commission has concluded that unless the country's railways are restructured, the total burden of state support until the end of the decade will exceed DM400bn (Pounds 139.30bn). The message was stark, but music to the ears of Mr Heinz Durr, who became head of the west German rail system (Bundesbahn) a year ago. He has argued forcefully that the unwieldy and expensive public authority needs to be transformed into a modern, flexible corporation that could make money rather than lose it. Mr Durr wants the government to write off Germany's entire DM45bn rail debt within three years and give the system a fresh financial start. This year, the railways are expected to record a combined loss of some DM11bn, much of it in interest payments; the Bundesbahn's share of the loss will be more than DM7bn. Today, the Bundesbahn owes twice its DM20bn turnover. By 2000, if the commission's proposals are not acted on, total east and west German rail debt could be DM220bn. Together with accumulated losses, the state could be left with a DM400bn price tag. If, on the other hand, the railways are prodded into greater efficiency, that DM400bn could be cut by up to DM80bn, the Bundesbahn estimates. The commission mentions potential savings of well over DM100bn. The government is determined to save what it can from the public purse by a radical overhaul of the rail network. While the Bundesbahn is efficient, punctual and comfortable compared with services in other European countries, it is hobbled by a high degree of political involvement at national and regional level. For instance, it needs transport and finance ministry approval for all investments over DM5m and is subject to intense pressure from local politicians to operate uneconomic lines. This has created a management with little commercial freedom or entrepreneurial drive. 'We've got to free the management of the railways from these political burdens,' says Mr Peter Reinhardt, head of the rail department at the transport ministry. 'The financial development of both east and west railways is frightening. We have to find a breakthrough.' Government frustration at years of resistance to reform by the railways has finally led to a groundbreaking series of proposals. The central plank of the restructuring involves the setting up of a shareholding company, Deutsche Eisenbahn (German Railways) AG, which could operate without political oversight as an independent concern. Initially, the AG would comprise the Bundesbahn alone, but Mr Durr, who took over as head of the Reichsbahn last September, wants to bring in the creaking, investment-starved east German system after it has been modernised and slimmed down. As an AG the railways' accounts would be much more transparent - loss-making routes kept open for social purposes in outlaying areas could not be financially camouflaged - and the government would be able to decide whether to continue making payments for such individual routes. At the moment, payments for 'social' routes are subsumed in general subsidies to the network and the commercial viability of the routes is unclear. Under the commission's proposals the government would still own the rail system, but a revamped management board would be responsible for day-to-day operations. Unlike at present, there would not be an advisory board - consisting mainly of local and regional political appointees - which influences policy. The removal of this bureaucratic management tier would make the system more efficient, it is hoped, and thus more attractive to private investors. They could, for instance, operate their own freight services on state-owned track, or help to finance capital spending. The need for wholesale corporate restructuring has not arisen solely because of German unity. The Bundesbahn's mounting deficit, its loss of freight business to the roads, and the resulting congestion on the motorways have long worried the government. But unification has brought a new urgency, mainly because of the extra financial challenge - it will cost DM50bn to bring the Reichsbahn up to Bundesbahn standards. Because the railways commission's 60-page report offers a solution to this financial headache, the government's initial reception has been favourable. But setting up an AG would need a change in the country's constitution, so the matter looks set to become a many's opposition Social Democrats, some of whom could see the changes as anticipating privatisation, would have to accept the proposals for there to be the requisite two-thirds majority in parliament. So far, they have not made their final judgment. As the political manoeuvring gets under way, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made clear he wants the railways made more efficient. 'The government wants rail to play a bigger role in transport policy,' says Mr Durr, previously chief executive of AEG, the electrical subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. 'It's also what the citizens of this country want. The trouble is that most people go by car.' The roads also have the lion's share of freight business, about 50 per cent in west Germany. Over the past 30 years, rail's share of freight business has fallen from 44 per cent to 25 per cent. The task now is to reverse this trend or at least to keep it steady. Mr Gunter Krause, the transport minister, has said rail should aim to win up to 30 per cent of all freight traffic by the end of the decade. As a leading government supporter of the planned reforms, he hopes, along with Mr Durr, that the political hurdles can be cleared soon. But Mr Durr wants to go further than setting up an AG, and to introduce sweeping labour market changes. This might bring him into conflict with the Social Democrats and the unions, which want to protect the jobs and benefits of railway employees. Mr Durr is keen to introduce a more flexible staff policy into the Bundesbahn by doing away with the special status of many employees. As Beamte (public servants), they have jobs for life and special pension benefits, but are forbidden to strike. What frustrates Mr Durr is that their status inhibits many of his proposals  -for example, staff tend to be promoted more on the basis of seniority rather than on ability. There are 140,000 Beamte among the 230,000 Bundesbahn employees, including train drivers, guards, and ticket-sellers. Their promotion routes and pay scales have to accord with nationally agreed conditions throughout the German public sector, making it hard to attract managers from private industry. Mr Durr does not want the Reichsbahn's 200,000 employees, now being reduced by about 10,000 a year, to become Beamte. The fact that the east German system has nearly the same number of employees as west Germany's, which has almost twice as much track, shows the magnitude of the task of integration and matching productivity levels. In 1989, the last year of the old East German government, only 300m East Marks were invested in the Reichsbahn, nowhere near enough to maintain it. This year, the figure will be at least DM5bn. New east-west links are being built and existing ones modernised. 'Some stretches are practically all building sites,' Mr Durr says. Re-equipping the Reichsbahn is only part of the picture, though. Finding the right managers is just as important, and by no means easy. All the top managers of the Reichsbahn have been changed and the boards of east and west German railways now meet together. There are joint planning and investment policies and a growing exchange of personnel. For Mr Durr, transforming Germany's railways is the challenge of the century - 'though I hope it doesn't take a century to achieve'. But it will take more than money to fulfil the vision of a united German rail concern which operates with a minimum of bureaucratic fat and a maximum of entrepreneurial drive. It will also take a strong political will.</p>

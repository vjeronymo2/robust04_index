"Please tell the Army that we are not Zapatists and to give  us a warning before they bomb the area because we are very  scared," a group of Chamulas Indians living in the Zontehuitz  and Tenejapa area, where military actions have concentrated  during the past 48 hours, told journalists.    Although there is no evidence of injuries among the civilian  population, rockets fired from "Pilatus" planes and shooting  from tanks and armored vehicles have made that wooded  mountainous region a veritable inferno for its inhabitants.    According to the Defense Ministry, the area was bombed  during  the pursuit of 400 EZLN guerrillas who were planning to sabotage  a microwave tower on Huitepec Hill, a strategic communications  point in southeastern Mexico. The bombing began at dusk on 9  December and grew more intensity on the morning of 10 December.  According to the same source, the rebels managed to damage  three airplanes and two helicopters.    Witnesses said that at least four airplanes, three  helicopters, 12 tanks, combat vehicles and artillery-equipped  jeeps participated in the actions, as well as an undetermined  number of troops, who were transported to the area in 10 trucks.    Just as it happened with the settlers in the southeastern  mountains -- where the communities of Corralito and San Antonio  Banos, which were also bombed for three days, are situated --  the inhabitants of Zontehuitz and Tenejapa told journalists  they have not seen any guerrillas in that region.    According to nongovernmental organizations in San Cristobal,  the bombings during the first days of the week against areas  near Corralito, San Antonio Banos, and San Isidro Ocotal,  southeast of the city, caused more than 2,000 Chamulas Indians  to flee.    These organizations, grouped in an alliance called "Chiltac"  -- which in the Tzotzil language means "companero" -- said that  the majority of Indians sought refuge in the same hills so they  would be near their homes. Only a few have moved to San  Cristobal for safety.    San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he has no information  on the situation in the conflict area because land and telephone  communications have been cut off. "I have been unable to  communicate with my pastors or representatives," he said.    On Thursday the Army placed a viselike grip on the  guerrilla's territory in what seemed like the beginning of a  vast offensive to "clean up" the region following the retreat of  rebel forces into the mountains.    Armored personnel carriers and troops on alert are denying  access to the area, which is a triangle covering several hundred  square kilometers with points at San Cristobal de las Casas,  Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas.    During this apparent offensive, the army recovered control  in  the majority of the towns previously occupied by the rebels such  as Huixtan, Oxchuc, and Altamirano without pressure from the  military.    There is no independent information about the fate of the  civilian population within the triangle of operations, although  the military command allowed the government's National Human  Rights Commission to send a representative into Ocosingo  yesterday.    The commission president, Jorge Madrazo, who has been in San  Cristobal since last Wednesday, asked local and military  authorities to provide shelters for the refugees immediately.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 26 (XINHUA) -- A Hong Kong-based  Chinese official hit back at the British Government for its  white paper on the Sino-British talks released on Thursday [24  February] by revealing part of the Chinese version about the  negotiations.    Answering questions raised by local reporters after  attending  a seminar here on Friday night, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director  of the XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch, disclosed a letter  agreed between China and Britain on the Sino-British talks,  which was excluded in the white paper.    The letter was handed over to British Ambassador to Beijing  Robin McLaren by the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu  on April 7 in reply to a March 30 British request for reopening  talks with China. The letter contains the following five points:    -- It is China's consistent position to resolve Sino-British  differences through negotiations. China has made great efforts  to this purpose and the British side should be sincere about the  talks.    -- The Sino-British talks must be held on the basis of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence  with the Basic Law and the observation of agreements and  understandings already reached between the two countries.    -- The talks are matters between the Chinese and British  Governments and should be conducted with only one Chinese and  one British official present at the talks. Other officials  should attend as advisers or experts.    -- If the British side tables the political reform bill to  the Legislative Council for discussions before the two sides  reach agreements, it will show once again that the British has  no sincerity about the talks and it means the termination of the  talks.    The letter also suggested the version of a news release to  announce the talks.    The British side had agreed with these points and it was on  the basis of the five-point document that China and Britain  opened the talks on April 22, 1993, Zhang said.    "Why was the document excluded in the white paper? Has the  British side abided by the understandings set in the document?"  Zhang asked.    By concealing such contents about the Sino-British talks,  Zhang said, the British side is trying to mislead the public  opinion and shift its responsibility for undermining the talks  on China. "China will surely respond to the British move at a  proper time," Zhang added.</p>

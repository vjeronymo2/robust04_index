			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed by GGD/GOL: "Baranja Serbs Take Heavy </F> Weapons out of Storage Depots"]    [Text] Brussels, 17 Apr (BELGA) -- According to military  spokesman Freddy van de Weghe speaking in Brussels on Sunday,  Serbian troops in Baranja, a region in eastern Croatia that has  been occupied by the Serbs for over two years and where a  battalion of 520 Belgian UN troops is stationed, have removed  their heavy weapons from storage depots, in spite of a previous  agreement.    At the beginning of this month, the Serbs had stored their  heavy weapons in six depots, following the cease-fire agreed  between Croats and Serbs from the self-proclaimed Serbian  republic of Krajina. Van de Weghe said that they have already  withdrawn "a considerable number" of those weapons.    This hardening of the Serbian attitude is, according to the  military spokesman, a result of recent NATO air strikes on  Serbian positions around Gorazde. Van de Weghe stressed that  the situation in Baranja was "calm" and that there was  "absolutely no reason" to fear for the safety of the Belgian UN  troops on the ground.    The military spokesman added that "reassuring reports" had  been received concerning the 30 Belgian UN troops being held by  the Serbs in the Raslovac barracks near Sarajevo. Van de Weghe  said that these soldiers "do not feel they are hostages or are  being threatened." Most of these soldiers are from the 11th  Battalion of engineers from Burcht that has been based in  Sarajevo since the beginning of March.</p>

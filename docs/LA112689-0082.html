			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLEARER SKIES FORECAST FOR LATER TODAY  </P> <P> Just when it appeared that Orange County residents might have to stock up on  suntan lotion for a long winter at the beach, the skies darkened Saturday and  dampened the region with scattered showers.  </P> <P> More of the same was expected this morning, followed by clearing skies and  brisk temperatures.  </P> <P> Traces of rain were reported at most weather-monitoring stations throughout the  county, and residents in cities from Newport Beach to Dana Point and Santa Ana  said rain fell on and off during the afternoon.  </P> <P> Meager though it may have been, the rain came as a welcome relief to many  Orange County residents eager to see even the smallest hint of a change in the  seasons. The showers arrived just days after a lengthy bout of summer-like  weather, when Santa Ana winds from the desert sent temperatures across the  Southland soaring into the 80s.  </P> <P> Scattered showers are expected to continue through the morning and then give  way to patchy clouds and cooler temperatures tonight, said Bill Hibbert, a  meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times Orange  County Edition.  </P> <P> Hibbert said a 50% chance of showers is forecast, with at most a quarter-inch  of rain expected this morning in Orange County. But winds during the afternoon  should "clear everything right down the coast just like a squeegee," he said.  </P> <P> As winds drive the clouds out, lower temperatures should creep into the county  tonight, with the mercury expected to drop into the upper 40s across the  county, he said.  </P> <P> "It'll begin to be more like a November instead of what it's been the past  couple weeks," Hibbert said.  </P> <P> Temperatures on Monday are expected to rise into the upper 60s to lower 70s.  </P> <P> The sweater weather conditions may not last long. Hibbert said Santa Ana winds  might start up again later in the week.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Teheran, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Britain has installed  sophisticated devices in the grounds of its embassy in Teheran  to eavesdrop on sensitive Iranian departments including  intelligence and foreign ministries, the weekly magazine KAYHAN  HAVAI [name as received] reported.    The weekly, which is coming off here Wednesday [21 June],  said that the devices have been brought into Iran in "diplomatic  pouches" over the past few months.    The shipment of the listening devices had been decided upon  months before the British intelligence service planted bugging  devices in the Iranian Embassy in London, it added.    The official report said that the devices have enabled the  British intelligence service to listen in on sensitive Iranian  departments including ministries. The main targets are the  intelligence, foreign and interior ministries.    A group of Iranian students studying electronics in British  Universities were quoted by the weekly magazine as saying that  the British Telecommunications had confirmed the shipment but  had not elaborated.    The students have called on the Iranian Government to take  adequate legal measures and order the British to remove the  devices from their embassy.    With regard to the recent exposure of bugging devices  planted  by British intelligence in the Iranian Embassy in London, the  students criticized the Iranian Government for failing to employ  Iranians to repair damage to the embassy building.    The weekly quoted the students as saying that "British  workers had helped British intelligence to plant the bugging  devices while repairing the embassy."    The recent hostile actions between the two sides have  undermined the already fragile relations between Teheran and  London. The political row between the two countries has led to  the expulsion of one diplomat from each side.</p>

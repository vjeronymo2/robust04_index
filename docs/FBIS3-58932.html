			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Patten Should Stay"] </F>   [Text] The current visit to London of Mr Chris Patten,  Governor of Hong Kong, comes at a watershed. Within the next  month or so, the colony's Legislative Council [Legco] will vote  upon his proposals for the first phase of electoral reform,  extending democracy. It is probable, though by no means  certain, that these proposals will pass, and that later in the  year more controversial aspects of the package will be  considered.    Since the Chinese government has made plain its  irreconcilable opposition to Mr Patten and his plans, relations  with Beijing are likely to remain deadlocked, and even perhaps  to worsen if the Governor's proposals are implemented. Some  prominent British businessmen, both in Hong Kong and London,  have expressed great concern about this prospect. Since the  Chinese will have the power and, some believe, the will to  unscramble anything Britain decrees between now and 1997 they  argue that the belated Patten reforms are futile. They are even  more alarmed by the prospect that the Chinese will respond by  squeezing British business out of the huge opportunities opening  up in China.    These are serious issues, and they have caused much heated  private discussion in Westminster and Whitehall. The  controversy over Hong Kong coincides with a low point in the  Tories' fortunes at home. Minister after minister has lamented  privately that Chris Patten, among the ablest of Tory thinkers  and strategists, is absent from the bridge in the Government's  hour of need. Once Legco has voted upon the Patten reform  package, goes an argument heard at the most senior levels, will  there be a real job left for the Governor to do? Could not the  Prime Minister kill two large flying objects with one stone, by  appointing a new governor who might be better able to build  bridges with Beijing, and bringing home Mr Patten to bolster the  Government? It has been suggested that he could become the  principal behind-the-scenes strategist and fireman, or, more  ambitiously, could be elevated to the House of Lords and given  one of the great offices of state.    It is understood that Mr Patten himself has now acted  decisively to kill all speculation on this front. First, he  dismisses the suggestion that his job in Hong Kong will be  completed once Legco has dealt one way or another with his  reform package. A long and increasingly sensitive period lies  ahead, and he feels a strong personal commitment to seeing his  job through. Second, he sees no plausible scenario for his own  return to British domestic politics this side of a General  Election. The House of Lords holds no charms for him, and the  British public would be unlikely to be impressed by the dramatic  return of Lord Patten to the political battlefield, when it  would be so obvious that this was because voters would refuse to  reinvent Chris Patten MP at any by-election.    We believe that Mr Patten's calculations are correct and  honourable on all three counts: the interests of Hong Kong, of  himself, and of the Government. We have been critical in the  past of the manner in which he embarked upon his democratic  initiative. The Chinese regime in Beijing is indeed despotic,  geriatric, and thus unstable. But it remains highly debatable  whether Mr Patten's approach was the one most likely to serve  the long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong. Today,  however, that phase is history. We are where we are. Legco  will make its own decision about the feasibility and  desirability of Mr Patten's plans. Whichever way this goes,  Hong Kong will need a committed governor with visible political  authority to safeguard the stability af the colony in the run-up  to 1997. Even leaving aside the major difficulty of identifying  a credible replacement for Mr Patten, the mere fact of his  departure would be bound to heighten fears and uncertainties in  Hong Kong, and could even incite the old men in Beijing to act  more ruthlessly. We share the view that there is, anyway, no  convincing route by which Mr Patten, much as he is missed, can  re-enter British politics in the next three years.    He deserves all credit if he is willing to see his Hong Kong  assignment through. The removal of any uncertainty on that  score should be welcomed both in the colony and at Westminster.</p>

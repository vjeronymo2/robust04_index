			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Fees cause most auditor changes FEE levels were the most common reason why companies considered changing auditors, two academics told the British Accounting Association conference yesterday. Dissatisfaction with the quality of the audit and changes in the company's own management were the next most important reasons, Vivien Beattie and Stella Fearnley of the University of Southampton said. Their analysis, based on responses from 210 companies, comes at a time when more businesses are putting audits out to tender attempting to cut costs. In selecting new auditors, companies ranked technical competence most important, followed by value for money of the audit service and the quality of working relationship with audit partners. The conference was also told, by Jean Shaoul of the University of Manchester and Pam Edwards from the Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, that the profession had done little to examine the lessons from corporate scandals in the past 30 years. Based on an analysis of the 250 accounting 'causes celebres' between 1962 and 1992, such as corporate collapses, frauds and takeovers, they concluded that few of the issues at stake had been reflected in the agenda of the Accounting Standards Committee, the former standards-setting body. While the collapses since 1973 have been dominated by topics such as poor record-keeping, stewardship of assets and fraud, the committee was absorbed by more arcane issues such as current cost accounting. In another presentation, Mr Iain Fleming of the University of Paisley said advertisements placed in newspapers by companies to highlight their financial results presented a distorted figure of their true performance. He argued that the newspaper advertisements tried to portray to unsophisticated customers and potential customers that the company was financially sound. He said they used selected accounting figures and quotations to portray their results in more a favourable light than that shown by the full annual report.</p>

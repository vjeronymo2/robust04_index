In 1993, decisive steps were taken in the effort to reform  China's economic systems, particularly in displaying the role of  the market, with substantial progress being recorded in many  areas. For instance, since last May, more that 90 percent of  the country's counties and cities have opened their grain and  oil market prices and abolished the food grain rationing system  which had been in place for more than four decades.  Simultaneously, price controls were lifted on iron and steel  and a certain amount of coal subject to the government's unified  allocation plan. In addition, the price of some crude oil was  readjusted. As a result, the proportion of prices fixed by the  state accounted for only 5 percent of the total retail sales  volume of commodities, 10 percent of the total sales volume of  farm produce, and 15 percent of the total sales volume of  industrial capital goods. The gross industrial output value of  the state mandatory plan dropped to around 5 percent.    In line with the basic framework of the socialist market  economic structure adopted during the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held  last November, China will advance reforms in a comprehensive  manner and strive to make breakthroughs in some key areas during  1994. Priority will be placed on establishing a modern  enterprise system; a unified, open, competitive and orderly  market system; a macroeconomic control system; a rational social  distribution system; and a multilayered social security system.  <H5>  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System </H5>   Required tasks include:    -- Continuing to implement the Law Concerning Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People and the Regulations on  Changing the Management Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises  Owned by the Whole People so as to transform enterprises into  genuine economic entities which engage in independent management  and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses;    -- Defining property rights relationships, strengthening the  supervision and management of the property of state-owned  enterprises, promoting the pilot project for the establishment  of standard shareholding companies, experimenting with the  corporate system in enterprises with appropriate conditions by  introducing into them such forms of operation and organization  as exclusively Chinese or foreign funded companies, limited  liability companies and joint stock companies, and restructuring  existing companies in line with standard requirements;    -- Reforming and improving the leading body, and  organizational and management systems of enterprises;    -- Continuing to improve the organizational structure of  enterprises, developing large enterprise groups, optimizing the  organizational structure of enterprises by implementing the  Bankruptcy Law and using methods such as contract management,  leasing and auctions, and encouraging small enterprises to  introduce share holding system or set up partnership enterprises;    -- Adopting concrete measures to reduce the excessive tax  load and social burden on enterprises in combination with the  reform of fiscal, taxation, monetary and social security  systems. The state will choose 100 enterprises to conduct  different types of experiments in line with their specific  conditions and characteristics;    -- Encouraging various localities to explore effective  enterprise management mechanisms on the precondition of  preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets.  <H3>  Forming a Unified, Open, Competitive and Orderly Market  System </H3>   The aim is to give play to the market's basic role in the  allocation of resources. The main tasks in this area include:    -- Developing production factors markets, including  monetary,  labor force, real estate, technology and information markets.    -- Reforming the price management system and promoting the  establishment of market price formation mechanisms.    -- Improving the commodity circulation system, continuing to  develop wholesale markets, and conducting experiments with the  establishment of a few commodity futures markets.    -- Promoting modern means of circulation.    -- Actively developing intermediate organizations, such as  accounting, auditing and legal offices notarial and arbitration  organizations, organizations for measurement and quality  inspection and licensing, information and consultant  organizations, and credit rating organizations. At the same  time, emphasis will be placed on giving full play to the active  roles of chambers of commerce and various other associations.    -- Continuing to tighten legislation and strengthen  construction of the legal system related to the market.  <H5>  Reform of the Monetary System </H5>   Ideas for the reform in this area include:    -- Strengthening the role of the People's Bank of China as  the central bank responsible for implementing monetary policies  independently under the leadership of the State Council,  regulating and controlling the money supply and supervising and  maintaining financial order by implementing economic measures  such as a reserve ratio on deposits, the lending rates of the  central bank and open market operations.    -- Organizing a monetary policy committee.    -- Separating policy-related businesses from commercial  operations, organizing the National Development Bank and Import  and Export Credit Bank, reorganizing the Agricultural Bank of  China, transforming existing specialized banks into commercial  banks, and organizing rural and urban cooperative banks;    -- Adopting modern bank management methods.  <H5>  Reform of Fiscal and Taxation Systems </H5>   The reform effort calls for standardizing the fiscal and tax  management systems, and emphasizing the active roles of fiscal  and taxation policies for regulating overall demand and supply,  readjusting social economic structures and social distribution.  Principal measures to be introduced include:    -- Replacing the current local fiscal contract  responsibility  system with the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational  division of power between central and local authorities, and  defining the categories of taxes as central, local and shared.    -- Increasing the percentage of fiscal income in relation to  the gross national product and the percentage of the central  fiscal in come in the nation's total fiscal income.    -- Introducing a double budget system, establishing a  government public budget and a budget for management of state  assets. Fiscal deficits of central authorities will no longer  be met by bank overdrafts.    -- Reforming the taxation system by promoting a turnover tax  system based on a value-added tax, reducing the excessively high  income tax rate (55 percent) imposed on state-owned enterprises,  and discontinuing construction funds for key energy and  communications projects, as well as nonbudgeted regulation funds.    -- Unifying and standardizing enterprise income tax and  personal income tax, and rationalizing the distribution  relationship between the state and state-owned enterprises on  the basis of a reduced income tax rate for state-owned  enterprises.  <H5>  Reform of the Planning System </H5>   The guiding thought for this reform is to base state  planning  on the market, with emphasis on the improvement of guidance  plans. Efforts will include:    -- Establishing a new national economic accounting system  and  macroeconomic monitoring and warning systems.    -- Effectively using the coordinative role of macroeconomic  policies and economic levers, with the stress on drafting medium  and long-term plans.  <H5>  Reform of the Investment System </H5>   The main tasks of reform will be to define the main body of  investment and its scope of responsibilities in terms of  investment in different sectors, gradually establishing risk  liability for corporate investments and bank credits,  establishing respective investment spheres for the government  and enterprises, developing the regulatory role of the market to  investment and financing, and establishing incentive and control  mechanisms. Major tasks include:    -- Encouraging investment and financing activities by  applying the state's industrial policies, financial bonds,  interest rates, exchange rates and other economic levers, and  developing the roles of the National Development Bank and other  policy-related banks.    -- Widely using fund-raising methods such as the holding and  acquisition of shares and the issuance of financial bonds.    -- Replacing the existing system of administrative  examination and approval of construction projects with a system  of project registration, introducing different forms of  investment for general commercial competitive projects,  infrastructure projects, key state construction projects and  public welfare projects, and displaying the role of the market  by increasing the use of economic levers and measures.  <H5>  Reform of the Foreign Trade System </H5>   The goal of expediting the reform of the foreign trade  system  is to accelerate the pace of opening to the outside world, bring  China's domestic economy into line with the international  economy, and enhance China's competitive capacity on the  international market. The basic requirements for the reform are  to unify policies, liberalize management, encourage equal  competition, allow enterprises to assume responsibilities for  their own profits and losses, integrate industry with trade and  promote an agency system.    The main measures to be adopted include:    -- Transforming the management mechanisms of enterprises  (chiefly those involved in foreign trade), reforming existing  enterprises in line with the modern enterprise system, and  energetically developing transnational industrialized  comprehensive trading conglomerates.    -- Improving the state's management of foreign trade by  adopting measures such as exchange rates, tariffs and credit,  abolishing mandatory planning for import and export commodities,  and standardizing the distribution of the import and export  quotas for commodities through bidding and auction.    -- Lowering the general level of tariffs and constantly  optimizing the structure of tariffs.    -- Actively promoting the strategies of gaining a greater  share of the market with quality products and developing plural  markets.    -- Constantly improving and perfecting a unified foreign  economic legislation system, reforming the foreign exchange  control system, establishing a market based floating exchange  rate control system, and gradually converting the Renminbi into  a convertible currency.    In addition, a rational system of income distribution to  individuals and a multi-layered social security system will be  established according to the principles of placing priority on  efficiency while taking fairness into account. Simultaneously,  a large amount of meticulous work must be done to reform the  scientific, technological and educational systems, and to  strengthen legislation and the legal system to ensure their  compatibility with a socialist market economy.</p>

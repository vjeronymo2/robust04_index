			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Sanyo finance unit absorbed by property managers SANYO Securities, the second-tier Japanese broker, announced yesterday that one of its largest shareholders, Nitto Tochi Tatemono, will absorb Sanyo Finance Company, a financially-troubled affiliate. Nitto Tochi, a property management company run by the founders of the securities house, will take over the financial company, which was hurt by its Y25bn exposure to Yuho Chemical, a bankrupt chemicals and property company. After the failure of Yuho in late 1990, Japan's Ministry of Finance asked leading brokers to report on the activities of their financial affiliates. Later, the ministry warned the brokers to ensure that these affiliates were prudent in their lending. It is expected that Nitto Tochi will establish a new financial company after absorbing Sanyo Finance, which had a change of management last year, but has since been hampered by the weakness of Japan's stock and property markets.</p>

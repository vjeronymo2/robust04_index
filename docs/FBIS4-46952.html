Smirnov, president of the  Russian Federation Chamber of Trade and Industry, and A.  Kruglov, chairman of the Russian Federation State Customs  Committee, signed an agreement on cooperation between the  chamber and the committee in the area of facilitating the  development of foreign economic activities. It was decided to  exchange information, hold joint events, and train cadres. A  joint consultative council will be set to deal with issues of  mutual interest, including matters of dispute.    One of the most important tasks of both organizations is  preparing for the Russian Federation to join international  agreements on the so-called ATA [authorization for temporary  admission] coupon books (documents accompanying cargo during its  temporary stay on the country's territory--for instance,  exposition exhibits).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] His highness the amir of Kuwait, God safeguard  him, today received Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the envoy of  'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist  Party. Al-'Attas briefed his highness about the fighting and the  development of the conflict in Yemen, and the reactions to this  crisis at the Arab and regional level.    His highness, God safeguard him, was keen to express  Kuwait's  firm and principled stance, which calls for tackling problems  according to the logic of national interest and by brotherly  dialogue without the use of violence. Resorting to violence and  the use of arms increases disputes and complicates problems. It  would also deepen wounds, waste energy and result in destruction.    In this context, His highness the amir, God safeguard him,  expressed his concern that the Yemeni conflict could have a bad  effect on the Arab situation. This is a matter that worries all  leaders and officials, especially as the Arab nation needs to  close ranks and reunite to regain its dignity and influence.    At the end of the meeting his highness the amir affirmed  that  Kuwait will support all honest and beneficial efforts to stop  the bloodshed and restore understanding and reconciliation  between the two parts of Yemen.

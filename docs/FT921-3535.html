			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Choice in regional radio may be widened THE Radio Authority is considering launching regional commercial radio stations to offer specialist services such as jazz or 'easy listening' formats. London has 11 commercial radio services, including Jazz FM and Melody Radio, but the authority, the regulator for commercial radio, believes other cities are too small to sustain such a choice in addition to conventional radio stations. Its solution, to be outlined in a consultative document next month, is that the new thematic stations could serve regions rather than individual cities. The document will also set out the proposed ground rules for re-franchising the existing commercial radio stations. Later this year the authority will begin re-licensing nearly 130 radio services. It is expected to split AM and FM channels to allow more groups into commercial radio.</p>

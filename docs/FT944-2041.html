			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Finance Week): Business BUSINESS Labour trounced the Conservatives in the Dudley West by-election, its candidate winning a 20,694 majority. The Conservatives lost their fourth seat of the present parliament after an astonishing 29 per cent swing - the biggest from the Tories to Labour since 1935. National Lottery organiser Camelot found itself embroiled in controversy as shadow home secretary Jack Straw accused it of laying 'a trail of clues about the identity' of last weekend's Pounds 17,880,003 jackpot winner, who had said he wished to remain anonymous. He is a married factory worker from the north of England with three children. The Office of Fair Trading is to seek a new code of practice for the sale of extended warranties on electrical products. A group of Labour party supporters in the City of London has set up a limited company to raise at least Pounds 100,000 for political advertising at the next British general election. Roger Warren Evans, a former executive at Bovis and J. Sainsbury, said the company hoped to raise funds from business people who were keen to see a change of government but were unwilling to contribute directly to Labour. Fears that UK interest rates may have to rise further were fuelled by signs that recent rapid economic growth is creating new inflationary pressures. MARKETS UK equities hit their lowest levels since July on Monday. The FT-SE 100 index ended 33.9 lower at 2,943.4, making a fall of 2.3 per cent over the preceding two sessions. The index then recovered to move back through 3,000 in spite of the collapse of merger discussions between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley (see Companies below). Political developments weakened both the lira and the French franc during the week. Worries about the Berlusconi government falling lay behind the lira slipping to a record low against the D-Mark. Jacques Delors' decision not to stand for the French presidency next year contributed to the franc falling to a 12-month low against the D-Mark. Erik Jarve, sacked president of the Oslo bourse, was found drowned in a fjord south of the Norwegian capital only hours after his dismissal in connection with alleged financial irregularities. Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday surged to their highest levels for five and a quarter years. COMPANIES Trafalgar's proposed hostile bid for Northern Electric undermined received financial wisdom that the regional electricity companies were safe from hostile predators. Recs' share prices rose on the back of speculation that other similar hostile bids could soon be made. The government said it would retain its 'golden' shares in the recs until March 31 1995. This makes it unlikely that conglomerate Trafalgar House would be able to complete a potential takeover of Northern Electric before that date. John Roberts, chief executive of Manweb, said the electricity distributor had no plans to merge with other regional companies. Asda, Britain's fourth-biggest grocery retailer, outstripped profit forecasts with a pre-tax increase of 47 per cent to Pounds 108.7m for the 28 weeks to November 12. British Gas is to withdraw all consumer advice and complaints services from its high street showrooms next month as part of the transformation of its network into a purely retail operation.

Chief executive David Simon unveiled the targets to analysts and institutional shareholders. A radical change in the ownership of Sabena, the Belgian national carrier, is on the cards as Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, confirmed it is in discussions with the Belgian government. ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and construction products group, is to swap its Scunthorpe rod mill business for British Steel's fully-diluted 35.2 per cent stake in ASW. The deal is part of a package that marks a further rationalisation in the European steel industry and gives ASW its first steel plants in continental Europe. Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard, has produced record revenues and trading profits despite the newspaper price-cutting wars. M&amp;G Group, the independent unit trust company that stresses the importance of high dividends, lifted its total pay-out for the year by 20 per cent to 30p a share, matching the rise in earnings. Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg called off talks aimed at creating a dominant global investment bank because of resistance from Warburg's fund management arm, Mercury Asset Management, to the merger proposals. The merger talks broke down after the board of MAM, which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg, demanded a premium offer for its minority shareholders as well as operational independence from Morgan Stanley. Murray Johnstone has announced plans to launch one of the new breed of venture capital trusts, details of which were outlined in the last Budget. The volume of beer sales at Greene King has risen for the first time in three years. The group reported a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Euro Disney said that from April it would cut the entrance price to its loss-making theme park outside Paris, adding that visitor numbers had risen this year. Its shares rose on the Paris bourse. The benefit of last year's flotation was seen in the fourfold increase in profits at Allders, the department store and duty-free retail group floated last year. Maurice Saatchi's future as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group he founded, hangs in the balance following an explosive row between the company and leading shareholders over a proposed Pounds 5m option package for Saatchi. A board meeting yesterday was due to decide his fate. ICI is preparing to scrap the in-house manager for its Pounds 4.6bn pension scheme and has asked leading investment fund managers to make presentations to manage the funds externally. Greenalls, the diverse group with pub, off-licence, hotel and drinks distribution interests, has lifted annual pre-tax profits by 10 per cent, helped by the first full-year contribution from the Devenish pub chain. Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, postponed the flotation of its Swedish subsidiary, Ammeberg Mining, because it could not achieve the hoped-for price. Albright &amp; Wilson, one of the oldest names in UK chemicals, is returning to the London stock market with a flotation aimed at raising at least Pounds 600m. The company lost its independence in 1978 when it was taken over by Tenneco of the US. Tiphook, the transport leasing group, announced it had reached a Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.3m) settlement of a lawsuit being brought by some of the group's US bondholders. The agreement will go before a US federal court within the next two weeks for approval.</p>

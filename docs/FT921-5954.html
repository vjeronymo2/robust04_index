			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Singapore cuts growth forecast Singapore yesterday scaled down its forecast for economic growth and announced a package of tax incentives to stimulate business, particularly in financial services, Joyce Quek reports. Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, said in his annual budget that economic growth should be between 4 and 6 per cent in 1992 rather than the previous estimate of 5 to 7 per cent, because of less buoyant external demand. In 1991, growth slowed to 6.7 per cent from 8.3 per cent in 1990.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Vlad: "Ukraine's Already Receiving </F> Ultimatums"]    [Text] The board of the State Committee for Oil and Gas,  which held a meeting in Kiev last week, in a sense recalled a  mirror reflecting our economy from within. Disheveled, with its  pockets turned inside out.    This time the economy was speaking through the voice of  Valentin Kolomiyev, acting chairman of the Ukrgaz Production  Association. Consider for example the following: Last year the  production association purchased gas in Russia valued at 2  trillion Russian rubles, but it paid for 466 billion, including  166 billion on Russian technical credit. In the meantime every  kopeck of the R1.2 billion obtained for transit handling of gas  across Ukrainian territory was used to reduce the price of  natural gas in the domestic market. Up until May inclusively, as  an example, Ukrgaz purchased a thousand cubic meters at a cost  of 15,600 in the karbovanets equivalent, while selling it to  consumers at 6,810 karbovantsy. It was in this way that the debt  was multiplied and the prices of products of chemical,  metallurgical and other sectors of the national economy, which  are already becoming noncompetitive in the foreign market, were  regulated. First one prime minister and then another told us  that there was nothing to fear; still, the socioeconomic  situation is being monitored, though industry is not striking.    It became clear as early as at the beginning of this year  that a strike is not necessary for a work stoppage to occur.  Price inflation has become the cause of financial paralysis.    But we are reassured once again: There is nothing to fear,  such a financial crisis can be seen in other states of the  former Union as well. You're trying to pull the wool over our  eyes, folks, because there's nothing in common between these two  cases. It was revealed at this same meeting of the board of the  State Committee for Oil and Gas that an ultimatum was in fact  sent to acting Prime Minister Ye. Zvyagilskiy in a telegram from  Turkmenistan. It threatened cessation of natural gas deliveries  to Ukraine as of 21 February if it continues to evade payment of  its debts for last year and this year. Last year's debt is not  less than $500 million U.S., while this year's debt consists of  penalties for late payments, as per the signed contract.    In the words of V. Kolomiyev, in January his department  should have paid $284 million for gas. But where was he to get  the money? The $18.4 million obtained through the stock exchange  and tender committee were only enough to pay the penalties for 1  month. In other words Ukraine is reaping its harvest from the  fields of currency regulation: What you sow is what you reap.  And the wretchedness of the currency harvest, which is something  we need for foreign economic activity, distinguishes our  financial crisis from the others.    A hastily created government commission took on the task of  leading the industry out of its crisis of payments, while Yefim  Leonidovich Zvyagilskiy was tasked to settle things with  Turkmenistan. This by the way will not have any effect on the  cost of gas this year. If it does grow more expensive, it will  do so only insignificantly. And the Ukrgaz Production  Association probably shouldn't count on the enterprises  immediately fulfilling government decree No 23 on settling  natural gas accounts in hard currency and Russian rubles. It  seems as if the Ministry of the Economy feels that cheap gas  means an inexpensive life, but it has no idea of what a cheap  policy can bring.    By the way, Turkmenistan's ultimatum carried the threat that  a contract with Ukraine for 28 billion cubic meters would be  broken. Ukraine naturally isn't pleased. And as it became known,  it sat down at the negotiating table with Turkmenistan, offering  to pay its debt off with wheat. But it is now understood even by  people who aren't economists that there will never be enough  wheat to pay off the debts. What we need to do is improve the  system of currency regulation, and the loan and financial  policy. It appears that the National Bank, which offered to  employ market distribution of credit resources and hard currency  this week, was the first to realize this. And it promised  creditors a new weapon with which to fight debtors--the  promissory note.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source has issued a statement in which it  said a number of unionist officers and soldiers in units under  the command of the rebel secessionist elements in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] are continuing to join the ranks of the  army of unity and constitutional legitimacy. Yesterday, all the  personnel of the 1st Artillery Brigade in the Yarim region and  the Khurafi camp that includes the personnel of the special  guards of al-Bid and the personnel of the military police  battalion joined their brothers in the units of the Armed  Forces, which are protecting unity and democracy, after they  discovered the hellish plan of the secessionist clique that  wants to disrupt the homeland.    The military source pointed out in its statement that our  Air  Force defenses confronted all the treacherous, hostile air raids  on the capital, Sanaa, and the cities of Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah,  and Ma'rib--raids that targeted vital and strategic  installations in these cities in order to terrorize peaceful  citizens.    The source also clarified that Colonel Jawad Muthanna,  commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade, and the brigade's staff were  arrested yesterday after they sparked sedition in the city of  Sanaa.</p>

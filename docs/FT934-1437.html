			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: Three cheers for the good guys - Serious Money The press spends so much time criticising the financial services industry that it is nice, for once, to be able to give an unreserved welcome to a change in business practice. Two building societies, the National &amp; Provincial and the Leeds, committed themselves this week to transfer all savers in obsolete accounts into up-to-date accounts, paying higher rates of interest. The transfer will occur automatically and should be completed by March (at N&amp;P) and May (at the Leeds). The naive might have assumed that this practice would be commonplace; after all, building societies are supposed to be owned by their members. But when the subject comes up, most societies tend to mutter darkly about the costs involved. There are two elements to these costs. The first is the administratively burdensome business of writing to all depositors to tell them when new accounts are opened, and of writing to holders of obsolete accounts to persuade them to transfer. National &amp; Provincial has been through this process already. In 1991, it established a 'Bee Guided' initiative with a freephone line giving advice and information; it also wrote to every saver. The certainly results were impressive. When the initiative started, an amazing 64 per cent of N &amp; P savers had obsolete accounts; by December 1993, the number had fallen to 25 per cent. The second element of the cost is the extra interest which must be paid to those who switch accounts. This is a hefty bill. According to N&amp;P, some Pounds 20bn is invested in obsolete accounts, saving banks and building societies around Pounds 800m a year in interest. N&amp;P says it has around Pounds 380m in such accounts, spread across 600,000 savers; at the Leeds, 1m customers have Pounds 450m in out-of-date accounts. And some of these accounts are very long-standing indeed; the Whitehaven Old Series, for example, pre-dates the second world war and pays 0.5 per cent a year gross to its 13 savers. All the account-holders who are transferred will be better off, either by receiving a higher interest rate or better terms and conditions. Savers can keep special features of old accounts, such as the ability to pay standing orders. The Leeds says savers can even keep their old passbooks, if they wish. These changes will be expensive for the two societies involved: Leeds said it would cost Pounds 4.5m in the year to end-September 1994 and Pounds 6m in the following year; N&amp;P said it would cost up to Pounds 5m a year in extra interest. So, what about these costs? The first thing to note is that this change is providing a benefit to some (but not all) of a society's members, which seems to be the point of running a building society in the first place. Furthermore, cost does not deter societies from expensive, generic advertising campaigns which are of dubious benefit to their members. It is possible to argue that, by attracting new savers through advertising, the society might benefit from economies of scale; but it is by no means true that the size and efficiency of societies are correlated directly. What is much more likely is that a larger society means larger salaries for the executives involved. One could also argue that, without public name awareness, societies might so dwindle in size that the safety of depositors' money could be affected. But other factors - such as poor judgment of loan risk - are likely to be far more important. The low rates on obsolete accounts are, of course, used by the societies to subsidise the rates paid to other depositors. So, it could be argued that, if all societies followed the lead of N&amp;P and the Leeds, savings rates would have to be cut for the mainstream accounts. Why, after all, should those savers who do keep track of their money be penalised in order to reward those who cannot be bothered? It is certainly true that many of the obsolete accounts will involve small sums (800,000 of those at the Leeds have less than Pounds 10 deposited). People probably have moved house and forgotten about the old account; or they have died and their relatives are unware that it exists. Nevertheless, some of the account-holders will be the elderly or disabled who may not be able to make regular trips to their branches to keep up to date with account changes. They may depend heavily on the interest they earn from their savings. Furthermore, building societies have such a good public image that some people may honestly believe that 'those nice folk at the society' would not allow them to be disadvantaged. Such savers deserve to be protected and one can only applaud 'those nice folk' at the N&amp;P and the Leeds for taking the right action. If other societies follow suit, and savings rates do fall marginally across the industry, at least savers have the option of switching their funds into National Savings or unit trusts. They should even consider the obscure-sounding (but lucrative) world of zero coupon shares, which offer yields of 7-8 per cent, tax-free, for those people who do not use up their annual capital gains tax allowance.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Mandela, Buthelezi agree to meet LONG-AWAITED talks between South Africa's two rival black leaders, Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, appeared likely to go ahead soon after Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the two had agreed to meet at his residence in Cape Town. He said he hoped to announce a date for the meeting later this week. If the talks go ahead - plans for similar meetings have fallen through in the past  -it would be the first time the two men had met for negotiations in more than two years. The African National Congress is understood to have agreed last month that Mr Mandela, their leader, should meet Chief Buthelezi in an attempt to strike a deal with him on a post-apartheid constitution. Agreement between the ANC and Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party on the key issue of devolution of power to regions would remove one of the most important obstacles to multi-party agreement on a new constitution. The ANC has made substantial concessions recently, agreeing that regional governments should have powers entrenched in the constitution which could not be amended by the central government without substantial support from deputies elected to a national house of assembly based on regions. No deal has yet been struck on the powers to be devolved to regional level, with the ANC proposing far less devolution than Inkatha. But Inkatha officials said they believed the ANC position would eventually form the basis for a deal between the two sides.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 244 states that EPA shall use California administration and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures unless EPA determines that doing so will not meet the criteria for a waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of preemption under section 209. EPA believes that the application of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California procedures would meet the criteria for a section 209 waiver. However, in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter dated February 17, 1994, CARB requested that EPA waive preemption under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 209 for certain proposed amendments to California certification test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. EPA is currently analyzing this waiver request to determine whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these test procedure amendments meet the criteria for a waiver under section 209.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, EPA must determine if the California enforcement procedures, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended, are consistent with section 202(a) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until it has completed its analysis of the waiver request, EPA cannot present a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that the amended California regulation, and thus California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration and enforcement, do not meet the criteria for a waiver under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 209. Given that section 244 directs EPA to adopt California's procedures unless it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes such a determination, EPA believes that it is required to adopt today  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's administration and enforcement procedures. EPA believes this adoption is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the plain language of section 244. If EPA later determines that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California enforcement procedures do not meet the section 209 waiver criteria, it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to amend its regulation regarding enforcement of CFVs according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California procedures currently require certification testing of gasoline vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either on California reformulated gasoline or on the current federal gasoline test fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called ``indolene.'' EPA believes that adopting this requirement as a part of adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California administration and enforcement procedures will allow manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify vehicles both for California as well as the other 49 states. In most cases, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that vehicle designs likely to be certified on California reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the CFV standards will be capable of being certified to those standards on indolene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well with no technological changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is possible that some manufacturers may wish to certify vehicles on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline formulation different from either California reformulated gasoline or indolene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a manufacturer may wish to certify and market a CFV engine family for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use by fleet operators only in areas where federal reformulated gasoline requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply, but where California reformulated gasoline is unavailable or expensive. A CFV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine family certified only on California reformulated gasoline would not be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attractive option to fleet operators in areas covered by federal reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements because the vehicles in that family will not have been demonstrated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the CFV standards on federal reformulated gasoline. If certifying that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family to the CFV standards on indolene would require additional emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development effort over the California-fuel version, but certifying on a federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated fuel would not, the manufacturer might prefer to certify on a fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of federal reformulated gasoline. Thus, such a manufacturer might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to market a line of CFVs which could use the local fuel (reformulated gasoline)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of only marketing California-fuel versions. In this kind of situation, then,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing manufacturers the option of certifying to the CFV standards on other gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations might provide fleets covered by the CFF program with an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle choice, one which may help them comply in a cost-effective manner with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that they operate their CFVs in covered areas only on fuels on which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles comply with the CFV standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the California procedures adopted here do not appear to permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification on gasoline different from California reformulated gasoline or indolene,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is considering whether it has the authority to propose and promulgate a provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would permit manufacturers to request certification on a different gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation. Particularly if interest is shown in such a provision on the part of fleets,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle manufacturers, fuel producers, states, or other interested parties, EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue a proposed rule to permit certification on any gasoline formulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the NMOG standard, CAA sections 241(3) and 241(4) provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions for NMOG and base gasoline to be used in determining reactivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments for alternative fuels. Section 241(4) further provides that EPA is to modify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these definitions and the method used for determining reactivity adjustment factors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform to the definitions and method used by CARB, provided CARB's definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions. CARB's definition of NMOG, contained in the ``definitions'' section of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEV program regulations, is identical to the CAA definition. The CAA section 241(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications for ``base gasoline'' for the most part fall within the specification ranges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for CARB's ``baseline'', i.e., ``conventional'', gasoline used by CARB in establishing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RAF for methanol-fueled vehicles. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Thus, EPA concludes that CARB's regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``conventional gasoline'' is at least as protective as the CAA definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base gasoline for determining RAFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1988 and Subsequent Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-duty Vehicles, Appendix VIII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure that the administration and enforcement of the CFV exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards is undertaken in conformance with section 244, EPA incorporates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by reference CARB's test procedures and other regulatory provisions regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration and enforcement. (The California Regulatory Requirements Applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Clean Fuel Fleet and California Pilot Programs, April 1, 1994, have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 88.104&hyph;94(k)(2).) Any vehicle certified by CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in California to the same CFV exhaust emission standards promulgated today will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to satisfy the requirements for certification to the federal CFV exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards although the vehicle must meet all other Title II requirements as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify as a CFV. For federal standards which are not currently identical to CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements (e.g., cold CO emissions, evaporative emissions, THC, NMHC), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing federal administration and enforcement provisions, including the applicable test procedures, will apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

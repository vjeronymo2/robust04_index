			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Optimism in commerce falls sharply THE LATEST survey of business confidence in the UK, published yesterday by Dun and Bradstreet International, the business information company, shows the sharpest decline in expectations for profits, sales and new orders in commerce since the spring of 1990. The report, the first national survey of business confidence since the government was forced to suspend sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16, reflects deepening gloom in most sectors of the economy. In two areas, retailing and construction, the outlook seems particularly bleak. According to the survey, retailers anticipate declining sales volumes in spite of an aggressive price-cutting strategy, while most building firms are forecasting static order books at best. The overall survey of business confidence - in which 1,900 managing directors throughout the UK were interviewed - discloses a marked decline in optimism over sales volumes. Six out of 10 companies expect no upturn in sales in the final quarter of this year, while 39 per cent actually expect sales to decrease. Dun and Bradstreet's optimism index, a method of calculating business confidence, shows that the current quarter-to-quarter decline is the steepest since the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first of 1990. The bleak outlook for sales is matched by a severe decline in expectation of profits. Only 21 per cent of companies predicted improved profits in the next three months. For the first time for more than a year, Dun and Bradstreet has found that more businesses are expecting profits to decrease rather than to increase in the ensuing three months. Analysing its survey by sectors, Dun and Bradstreet found that retailers remained among the most pessimistic - with 46 per cent saying they expected sales to fall in the final quarter of this year. According to the report, suppliers to the retail sector will suffer greatly and will find orders very thin on the ground. There was deepening gloom in the construction sector, where 61 per cent of companies expect further declines in sales in the next quarter and 67 per cent predict reduced profits. The most bullish sector appeared to be manufacturing - being the only one apart from services where managers were willing to raise stock levels in anticipation of increased sales. One of the few bright spots in the survey was the outlook for exports. There was a smaller fall in the optimism over exports than in the optimism over retail sales. According to Dun and Bradstreet: 'The most confident exporter sectors are services and durable manufacturers who will be hoping to reap the benefits of the floating pound.' Nevertheless, the fall in export optimism was the largest for two years. Confidence in an export-led recovery does not appear as strong as might have been expected after sterling's devaluation. Chemists and drugstores are proving far more resilient to the recession than most other retailers, according to a report from Verdict, the retail consultants. The study found that the sector was underpinned by shoppers who were continuing to buy essential health and personal-care products. Sales in the sector rose 8 per cent to Pounds 8.3bn last year, outstripping the 5.5 per cent increase in total retail sales. However, slowing inflation has limited sales increases in the chemists and drugstores sector to about 5 per cent in the current year. Verdict says that, in spite of diversification, traditional pharmacists are still highly dependent on prescriptions, which account for 46 per cent of their sales. Chemists and Drugstores.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy by </F> special correspondent Estela Valdes in Punta del Este, Uruguay;  date not given]    [Text] [Valdes] What do you think of the resignation of  [Colorado Party Chairman] Blas N. Riquelme?    [Wasmosy] Well, it is a political problem. It was resolved  by the Colorado Party Executive Board. I think the problem was  resolved at that level.    [Valdes] Do you feel strengthened now?    [Wasmosy] I have always felt strong. I have never felt weak.    But I have not always had the support of the Colorado Party  Executive Board.    Well, but you know very well that I was elected president of  the Republic even without his support.    [Valdes] Will there be changes in your cabinet?    [Wasmosy] Negative.    [Valdes] Will Eugenio Sanabria Cantero remain as head of the  National Navigation and Ports Administration?    [Wasmosy] Yes, of course, provided that his current  functions  do not prevent him from acting as head of the Colorado Party  Executive Board, which is what I think our country needs.    [Valdes] Will there be a change at the Interior Ministry?    [Wasmosy] No. Absolutely not.    [Valdes] If Sanabria Cantero's political activities prevent  him from performing his role normally, will he be changed?    [Wasmosy] You are speculating. I am not saying that.    [Valdes] But according to your remarks...    [Wasmosy] No. I said that I think that he will be able to  remain in his post and at the same time be the chairman of the  party board. Why not?    [Valdes] Are you satisfied with his being chairman of the  party board?    [Wasmosy] I respect the party statutes. When the president  resigns, the vice president takes over.    [Valdes] There are speculations that you will reportedly  hold  a meeting with Argana in Punta del Este.    [Wasmosy] They are speculations.    [Valdes] Is there anything to them?    [Wasmosy] Absolutely not. Is he here? I have never met him.    [Valdes] It is said that you did see him at the Centenario  Club, and that you turned around so as not to greet him on the  day of voting at the club.    [Wasmosy] I swear that I did not see him.    [Valdes] It is said that the party problem was just a  smokescreen to conceal the utility rates increase.    [Wasmosy] That is absolutely false.    [Valdes] It is appropriate to mention that the Paraguayan  president arrived yesterday in Punta del Este, where he will  stay until tomorrow. In the afternoon he held a meeting with  his counterparts Luis Alberto Lacalle (of Uruguay) and Carlos  Saul Menem (of Argentina) at the farm of businessman Samuel  Lieberman in Maldonado.</p>

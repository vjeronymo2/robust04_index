			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi by Agnes Gorissen </F> and Philippe Regnier; place and date not given: "On Political  and Economic Challenges Facing Algerian Government"]    [Text] [LE SOIR] In February, Algeria entered the  transitional period intended to permit, in three years time, a  return to the electoral process. But this transition is at  present handicapped by two factors: One is the refusal of  several parties (the National Liberation Front, the Socialist  Forces Front, the Rally for Culture and Democracy) to  participate in the transitional institutions, the other is the  Islamist phenomenon.    [Sifi] The dialogue already brings together political  parties, including moderate islamist parties, key figures, and  representatives of social, trade union or cultural groups which  are clearly representative. We will begin with all these  parties and keep the door open; the seats reserved for the other  parties (22 seats out of the 200 in the National Transitional  Council -- editor's note) remain available, they can join us at  any stage. The process of dialogue, with those who respect the  Constitution and laws and who reject terrorism, is not easy, and  it takes time.    [LE SOIR] Time, while the violence by armed Islamic groups  continues, particularly against civilians: doctors,  journalists, professors. Why these targets and not just  government representatives?    [Sifi] You have to try and read these terrorist acts. They  are seeking to upset the country's social and economic life, and  they no doubt believed that through these acts they could act  upon the population, bring them to the brink, and cause them to  create even greater problems. It has not achieved this result,  quite the contrary.    [LE SOIR] Is there any possibility of solving the present  crisis without entering into dialogue with the Islamic fringe?    [Sifi] Certainly. What counts most in Algeria is the  population. If it finds a response to its aspirations, housing,  employment, I fail to see why this will not work.    [LE SOIR] If the Islamists agreed to dialogue, what  concessions are the authorities prepared to make?    [Sifi] The authorities have no concessions to make. Anyone  who talks of power-sharing is going against democracy. It is up  to the population to decide who it is going to entrust with  power. In any event our government is a transitional one, it is  not intended to stay in place.    [LE SOIR] But to move away from a security policy and toward  a more social policy, you must succeed in "managing" the problem  of the "hard-line" Islamists and the armed groups.    [Sifi] I do not know where these people are. There are armed  gangs who recruit young people with nothing else to do, but the  rest of the population rejects such a situation. We must now  stop this violence, the government must reinforce the  antiterrorist measures. And all democratic states must ensure  that their country does not become a rear or transit base for  terrorists.    [LE SOIR] In this respect, what are your relations with  Germany and the United States, which have allowed in Rabah Kebir  and Anwar Haddam respectively?    [Sifi] A country has sovereign rights at home, but there are  always limits that it must respect. Steps are taken to ask our  partners to be vigilant, because things can happen without their  knowledge. And this applies even more so when things are known.    [LE SOIR] The WASHINGTON POST recently reported on direct  contacts between the CIA and the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front],  which apparently gave assurances to the United States in return  for a certain support.    [Sifi] I have not received any precise information on the  official positions except for that from the U.S. President who  denounced terrorism. But it seems that Bill Clinton expressed  the desire to see a broader government base in Algeria, which is  ultimately what everyone wants. It is an approval of the  Algerian approach. There had been very low level contacts with  the people from the FIS. For information purposes perhaps.    [LE SOIR] In certain circles, in Algeria and abroad, the  authorities are also given some "bad marks," for human rights in  particular: excessive repression, death squads.    [Sifi] That is a tactic to destabilize the country. The  security services have received firm instructions not to fall  into the trap of repression, even at the risk of delaying their  operations or of losing men. And every measure has been taken  to severely punish any excesses.    [LE SOIR] Caught in a cycle of terrorism-repression, Algeria  sometimes gives the impression of economic inertia. What are  your priorities?    [Sifi] Our priorities lie in four areas. First of all,  accommodation: We must make it possible to build as much  housing as possible, in the framework of the development of a  market economy. Because to date, housing programs along with all  our other activities, have been in the hands of a corrupt  administration. You have to wait from eight to 10 years for a  home! We need 1.2 million houses if each one is occupied by  seven people, which is much higher than the standards approved  by the World Health Organization.    [LE SOIR] And other priorities?    [Sifi] The development of small- and medium-sized companies  and agriculture, an area in which we are lagging far behind. We  depend on the outside world: We import foodstuffs worth $2  billion every year despite our considerable resources. Then  there are hydrocarbons, in which we are currently investing.  They will allow us to double our gas exports by 1998 or 1999  and to maintain our present level of oil production.    [LE SOIR] Will that undermine Islamism?    [Sifi] Yes. All these investments meet the needs of the  population, with improved management of the health, education,  and water distribution sectors. Improvements in these areas  will allow us to relieve the burden so far borne by the  population. If it did not suffer at the hands of terrorism, it  would be from crime, delinquency, or drugs. Terrorism has the  same roots as the other evils.    [LE SOIR] You are making your first visit to Brussels and  Paris since your election. What are you going to discuss with  the European authorities?    [Sifi] We are going to see how we can speed up the  adaptation  of the accord which has bound us to the European Union since  1976. We hope the Union will delegate experts to start  discussions within "reasonable" deadlines. This adaptation must  take into account political and economic change in Algeria.    [LE SOIR] And on the subject of the debt?    [Sifi] After the accord concluded at the Club de Paris to  reschedule the debt, we have until 31 December to conclude  bilateral agreements with Belgium and 16 other countries.</p>

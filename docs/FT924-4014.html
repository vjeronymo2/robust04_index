			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major scorns 'glib' talk of bombing Serbs THE PRIME MINISTER defended the government's caution over the Bosnian crisis yesterday, warning that 'glib' talk about bombing Serbian forces failed to consider the risks to British troops involved in humanitarian aid on the ground. But Mr John Major went on to confirm that international discussions are under way over how to bolster enforcement of the 'no-fly zone' over Bosnia-Hercegovina, among other possible military responses. Officials pointed out, however, that any escalation of military activity, such as bombing Serbian airports, would have to be approved by the United Nations and would require a further Security Council resolution. Amid clear indications that urgent discussions are in progress behind the scenes, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, used broadcast interviews to caution restraint. Ministers are keen to point out that military engagement by UN forces might be counter-productive by swiftly embroiling forces engaged in humanitarian aid and shutting down carefully nurtured supply routes. The Bosnian question was raised at yesterday's cabinet and continued at a subsequent meeting of the cabinet's overseas policy and defence sub-committee. With pressure growing from some MPs on his own back benches for tougher action against the Serbs, Mr John Major was at pains to emphasise the dangers of becoming embroiled in the civil war. At question time, he reminded those seeking a heavier commitment such as engaging ground forces in would mean committing troops 'to a very long and very bloody fight' with the certainty of serious casualties. 'It is all too easy to be heroic with the lives of other people,' he said. Mr Major also added: 'If further action is need to enforce that no-fly zone, that is something we would consider with our allies and partners in the United Nations.' Alongside mounting public concern at the plight of the Bosnian Muslims, there is also Foreign Office anxiety that the conflict may spread to the region of Kosovo and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Downing Street pointed out that the crisis will be discussed by EC foreign ministers on Monday, again at the 'conclave' on Tuesday and at the Edinburgh summit - before the international conference in Geneva on December 16.</p>

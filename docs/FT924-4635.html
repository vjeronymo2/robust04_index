			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firmer dollar contributes to rise on Continent A FIRMER dollar contributed to the rise on most continental bourses yesterday, though other factors were also at work, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw its biggest one-day rise in the DAX index for nearly two weeks, although most analysts thought that the rally had little to do with fundamentals. The index closed 21.39 ahead at 1,544.34 after a gain in the FAZ at midsession of 6.64 to 606.05. Turnover rose to DM4.9bn from Friday's DM3.8bn. In the absence of major corporate news (10-month results are due from the banks later this week) investors were pleased by the moderate 5 per cent pay claim sought by the civil service union. This indicates a much more realistic mood among unions, although warning strikes in the insurance sector have been threatened for Thursday as the DAG union pursues a separate claim. Expectations of disappointing third-quarter GNP figures for west Germany, due for release on Thursday, appear to have been discounted by the market. Forecasts are for a 0.5 per cent fall in GNP from the same period last year. Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Daimler all stood out, with high volume noted in the first two. Deutsche Bank rose DM9.40 to DM676, Siemens advanced DM6.60 to DM602 and Daimler gained DM13.70 to DM546. Asko was another of the day's big risers, up DM41 to DM573 following last week's news that the cartel office had approved its merger with the Metro group. PARIS rose further on continued hopes of an early cut in interest rates. The CAC-40 index ended up 21.71 or 1.2 per cent at 1,771.37. Trading was quiet until the last hour of the session when it was enlivened by the expiry of November stock index futures, which boosted turnover to FFr2.8bn. Interest-rate sensitive stocks were in demand, as CCF rose FFr10 to FFr210 and Suez added FFr8 to FFr249. Suez was also supported by hopes of an early accord with UAP on the future of Victoire and Colonia. Euro Disney failed to participate in the firmer trend, losing FFr1.30 or 2 per cent to FFr62.70 on reports of a downgrade from a US broker. Mr Richard Simon, analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, later said he expected the theme park to make a pre-tax loss of FFr750m in fiscal 1993, compared with his previous forecast of a loss of FFr250m. MILAN fell further and volume dried up as investors retreated to the sidelines to wait for further developments on privatisation. Currency concerns also weighed on the market as the lira eased against the mark. The Comit index fell 4.24 to 438.34 in turnover estimated at L145bn after L170.4bn. Some financial stocks bucked the trend, as Credito Italiano rose L13 to L2,683 while Fondiaria gained L1,350 or 4.7 per cent to L29,950 on continued speculation about its future. Declines hit industrial blue chips, as Fiat fell L173 or 4 per cent to L4,187 and Olivetti slid L54 or 2.7 per cent to L1,925. The speculative fizz evaporated in the food group, Sme, down L66 to L5,579 and the retailer, Rinascente, L120 lower at L6,780. Ciga, the hotel group, fell L52 or 4.2 per cent to L1,188 following an unfavourable report in a UK Sunday news-paper. AMSTERDAM welcomed the news of a proposed merger between KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep which will create Europe's second largest paper group, although details of terms were sketchy. An analysts meeting was under way as the market closed. The CBS General Tendency index finished up 0.5 at 103.7 with KNP Fl 1.60 better at Fl 28.90, Buhrmann -Tetterode up 70 cents at Fl 29.20 and VRG Group rising 30 cents to Fl 23.20. Ahold, up Fl 2.60 at Fl 83.60, pleased the market with a 6 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings although a weaker dollar depressed growth. Some 50 per cent of the group's sales come from its US supermarket division. ZURICH was encouraged by the firmer dollar although sentiment remained cautious ahead of Sunday's referendum on whether to join the EEA. The SMI index gained 16.6 to 1,931.2. Industrials and insurers led the rally with Roche certificates adding SFr30 to SFr3,900 and BBC Brown Boveri bearers up SFr80 to SFr3,430. Among insurers, Zurich registered shares put on SFr60 to SFr1,800 and Swiss Re bearers improved SFr70 to SFr2,350. STOCKHOLM extended last week's gains, aided by the stronger dollar. The Affarsvarlden general index put on 16.2 to 901.4 in turnover of SKr922m. Ericsson B shares featured with a rise of SKr2 to SKr179 while Astra B shares advanced SKr12 to SKr724. OSLO rose after the central bank cut its overnight lending rate to 17 per cent from 25 per cent. The all-share index rose 5.20 to 358.94 in turnover of NKr214m. MADRID drifted lower in the absence of fresh news, and the general index closed 1.43 down at 213.86. ISTANBUL eased on profit-taking following strong rises last week. The 75-share index lost 56.82 at 3,786.24 in turnover of TL227.5bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 30                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1051.62    1053.95     1055.57    1056.39 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1125.16    1127.12     1127.99    1128.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1056.97    1058.22     1058.49    1057.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1130.75    1131.88     1130.71    1132.14  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Nov 27    Nov 26    Nov 25    Nov 24    Nov 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1049.92   1048.05   1042.55   1038.83   1038.38 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1122.37   1118.56   1111.41   1110.69   1110.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1059.04 ; 200 - 1133.29 Low/day: 100 - 1051.59  200 - 1124.34  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Major aims to appease party rebels: Stance on federal EC stressed MR JOHN MAJOR will this week seek to limit a rebellion by Conservative MPs against the Maastricht Treaty by signalling strong opposition to any further moves to enhance the authority of the European Commission. As leaders of the rebel MPs predicted that between 20 and 30 on the government side would vote against legislation to implement the Maastricht accord, ministers said Mr Major would emphasise that he remained opposed to a federal structure for the community. The rebels acknowledge that although the government has an overall majority of only 21, there is no prospect of blocking the legislation. In spite of the threat of a rebellion by up to 60 of its own MPs, the Labour leadership has decided to abstain on the substantive vote. The Euro-sceptics are promising a series of 'wrecking amendments' - possibly including a call for a referendum - designed to attract opposition support when the bill is debated again, clause by clause, next month. The prime minister, who takes over the presidency of the community at the beginning of July, will emphasise instead the priority attached to completing the single market and speeding up negotiations to widen the membership of the community. The Conservative rebels, buoyed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher's scathing attack last week on federalist ambitions in the community, will argue that the Maastricht agreement represents a significant step on the road to a United States of Europe. They will also claim that recent proposals by Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, for another overhaul of the EC's institutions have undercut Mr Major's assertion that his negotiating stance allowed Britain to sidestep the pressures for federalism. Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British member of the commission, sought to counter that argument by insisting yesterday that a suggestion that the commission be given greater executive authority had won little if any support across the community. Mr Major will insist at the start of the two-day Maastricht debate on Wednesday that Britain has achieved its ambition of remaining at the heart of Europe while resisting the centralising instincts of its partners. Conservative party managers meanwhile have warned more than 60 new Conservative MPs that a vote against the government might wreck their chances of promotion.</p>

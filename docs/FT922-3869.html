			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK may back limit on Brussels to settle treaty row THE government plans to explore with its European Community partners the possibility of limiting the Commission's powers to intervene in national affairs in the hope of breaking the deadlock over the Maastricht Treaty. The aim would be to make an addition to the treaty with a form of words to tighten up the application of 'subsidiarity' - the principle that decisions should only be taken at Community level if they cannot be taken by national or local governments. In Brussels, however, a senior Commission official cast doubt on the move, warning that any tampering with the treaty could directly affect plans for speedy ratification. He accepted, however, that the UK, which takes over the EC presidency next month, had 'got to be seen to be doing something'. A spokesman for the current Portuguese presidency of the EC also ruled out as 'quite impossible' any changes to the treaty. But he added that the Lisbon summit of EC heads of government on June 26 and 27 may address the issue: 'I think they will use the conclusions of the summit to restate the commitment of the Community to subsidiarity.' The British proposal is for an explanatory codicil to be attached to the treaty before ratification. UK officials stressed there was no question of renegotiating the main treaty text. But it was acknowledged that the plan was fraught with complexities, leaving it unclear whether it would be sufficient to resolve the current impasse. Earlier in the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, confirmed his opposition to any renegotiation of the treaty, warning that such a move would put the EC 'back in the maelstrom'. Facing demands from all sides to renegotiate, modify or abandon the treaty - including one from Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary - Mr Hurd said this would merely revive calls for further centralisation of the EC that the government had successfully resisted. Under pressure from his own backbench MPs, Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, warned that the opposition would vote against any attempt to retable legislation ratifying the treaty without clarification of the way ahead. Downing Street confirmed later that the Maastricht bill, shelved last week, would be withheld until the autumn. EC foreign ministers agreed in Oslo on Thursday to press on with ratification of the unamended treaty. The Danish government concurred with this strategy as its partners argued that any renegotiation risked the complete unravelling of the European Union project. Mr John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl also endorsed the full speed ahead strategy when they met in Bonn on Friday.

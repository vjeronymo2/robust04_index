			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Insider Trading Charged in Pillsbury Deal: The Securities and Exchange  Commission sued a Minneapolis lawyer, alleging that he traded on inside  information on Grand Metropolitan PLC's takeover of Pillsbury Co. and made  about $4.36 million in illegal profits.  </P> <P> The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota. It named James  O'Hagan, 53, a lawyer who formerly worked for the firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney,  which helped represent Grand Metropolitan in the takeover battle. After  bitterly resisting the takeover bid, Pillsbury agreed to be bought by the  British food and drink conglomerate in December, 1988, for $5.7 billion.  </P></p>

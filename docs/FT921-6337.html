			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Tokyo rejects China's claim over islands JAPAN HAS strongly condemned a formal claim by China to a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea that Beijing now says could be defended with force. In a rare public criticism of Beijing by a Japanese leader, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said yesterday that a new Chinese law asserting control over the Senkaku islands is in breach of an understanding reached between the two countries. China refers to the five uninhabitated islands and three reefs as the Diaoyutai group, and has complained that a beacon built on one island by a right-wing Japanese group violates Beijing's 'ancient' authority over the group. The two countries generally maintain an uneasy silence over the ownership of the islands in line with a pronouncement by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount Chinese leader, that the issue should be settled by 'future generations.' But Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan protested in late 1990 when the Japanese government recognised that the beacon was legitimate, and sent coast guard vessels to turn away a Taiwanese boat wanting to moor on the islands, which are about 200km east of Taiwan and 300km west of Okinawa. Mr Miyazawa said yesterday the dispute was 'closed,' implying that Japanese sovereignty has already been asserted. Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the Chinese claim was 'unacceptable.' The new legislation, apparently introduced at the urging of the People's Liberation Army, provides for China to evict 'trespassers' and asserts Chinese control over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, which are contested by Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. On Wednesday, the Japanese embassy in Beijing protested to the Chinese government, while China's ambassador to Tokyo was yesterday called to the Foreign Ministry to hear a formal complaint from the Japanese government. Neither country wants to be drawn into more than exchanges of protests over the islands, but they remain a potential source of conflict in the region. Tokyo officials expressed dismay that the controversy comes as the two governments are preparing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the normalisation of their relations.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 12--The Indian Union Muslim League  [IUML] leader, Mr Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, resigned from the party  today, a day after announcing his decision to launch a new  secular outfit next week, reports PTI.    In a statement here, Mr Sait, who is a member of Parliament,  alleged that the ideals and objectives of the IUML were being  forsaken for "petty gains."    Mr Sait said he was deeply grieved that neither the party  leadership in Kerala nor its national leadership had exhibited  any inclination to change its policy of clinging to power in a  most "humiliating manner," totally sacrificing the interests of  the community.    He criticized the IUML leadership for refusing to pull out  of  the Congress(I)-led United Democratic Front Government in  Kerala, alleging that they were "blindly supporting" the  Congress(I) line however "disgraceful and detrimental" it might  be.    Stating that he was resigning with a "heavy heart," Mr Sait  said the recent support extended by the party's leadership in  Kerala to the single-point reference to the Supreme Court under  Article 143 of the Constitution on the Ayodhya issue had damaged  the feelings of all Muslims and secular forces beyond repair.    He pointed out he had resolved to launch a new party after  extensive consultations with various Muslim organizations, both  political and non-political, including past and present leaders  of the IUML.    Mr Sait said he had convened an all-India political  convention to be attended by over 500 delegates here on April 23  to decide on the name, structure and flag of the new party which  would be "well-knit, well coordinated, broadbased and secular."</p>

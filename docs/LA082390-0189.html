			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: CAR'S PROBLEM DOES NOT COMPUTE  </P> <P> Question: I own a 1988 Pontiac Grand Prix that stalls when the car idles a long  time in gridlock freeway traffic. I've talked to my dealer and he says nothing  mechanically is wrong with the car. The computer shuts off the engine  automatically when the catalytic converter reaches a high temperature. If the  computer turns off the engine, why does it allow me to restart it immediately?  The converter must still be at the same temperature. -- J.H.  </P> <P> Answer: The dealer was completely misinformed about the computer shutting down  the engine if the catalytic converter reaches a high temperature.  </P> <P> More likely, the dealer was concocting an explanation for something he does not  understand. You have a potentially difficult to solve Catch-22 type engine  problem.  </P> <P> Modern automobiles, including General Motors cars, have built-in diagnostics  systems, in which a central computer detects when certain parts malfunction and  can notify the driver through a check engine light on the dashboard.  </P> <P> But what happens when the computer malfunctions? Your GM computer may not know  it is sick and it thinks it is doing you a favor by shutting down your car on  the freeway.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the built-in diagnostics systems offered by car manufacturers so  far have not been able to diagnose a faulty computer. It is even difficult for  mechanics to check a computer, especially if the problem is intermittent.  </P> <P> You need to find an enlightened dealer who is smart enough to call GM's  technical service organization. One bit of caution: You should exercise to  absolutely refuse to pay for a new computer on a trial-and-error basis. It  could cost hundreds of dollars and it may not fix the problem.  </P> <P> Q: A neighbor who has about six cars parked next to my bedroom window starts  the cars at very odd hours. Two of them are Mercedes-Benzes with diesel  engines. He warms them up anywhere from 10 minutes to a half hour and even revs  them up. He claims it will put too much stress on the engines if he does not  warm them up. How long is it necessary to warm up a car?  </P> <P>  -- B.M.K.  </P> <P> A: Not only is your neighbor inconsiderate, but he is probably doing more  damage than good to his cars by long warm-ups.  </P> <P> Most automobile manufacturers recommend very short warm-ups during summertime  temperatures. That means that you can begin driving, though gently, as soon as  the engine is running smoothly.  </P> <P> Toyota, for example, specifically cautions against lengthy warm-up idling and  against any other long engine idling. General Motors cautions its owners that  long idling poses a health risk from the possibile carbon monoxide poisoning.  </P> <P> Engine oil begins to flow almost immediately after you start an engine. Within  a minute, oil pressure should be stabilized. There is little or no benefit to  waiting until the engine has reached operating temperature before starting out.  </P> <P> In very cold subfreezing weather, a slightly longer warm-up is a good idea. But  once the engine has idled for a few minutes, it should be safe to begin  driving.  </P> <P> The practice of revving a cold engine is potentially very harmful to an engine.  By racing the engine at high speed, your neighbor is subjecting the engine to a  maximum of wear and stress.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canadian banks ahead sharply in third period Canada's two biggest banks posted sharply higher third quarter earnings, driven by strong lending activity, rising fee income, tight expense control and lower loan losses. Royal Bank of Canada's net profit for the July quarter was CDollars 294m (USDollars 213m), or 80 cents a share, an increase of 32 per cent on the CDollars 223m, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Return on assets was up at 0.70 per cent, against 0.62 per cent and on equity rose to 16.5 per cent from 11.7 per cent. Nine-month profit was CDollars 867m, or CDollars 2.36, an advance of 20 per cent from CDollars 720m, or CDollars 1.93. Return on assets was 0.70 per cent compared with 0.69 per cent and on equity 16.9 per cent against 13.4 per cent. Non-performing loans dropped 24 per cent to CDollars 1.8bn at July 31 while the loan-loss provision for fiscal 1994 is CDollars 820m against CDollars 1.75bn in fiscal 1993. The trust and investment-brokerage units improved. At July 31 assets totalled CDollars 172bn, up 2 per cent year-on-year. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said third-quarter net profit was CDollars 223m, or 87 cents, ahead 17 per cent from a year earlier. Return on assets was 0.58 per cent, against 0.55 per cent, and on equity 11.5 per cent, up from 10.5 per cent. Nine-months earnings were CDollars 654m, or CDollars 2.59, an increase of 21 per cent from CDollars 539m, or CDollars 2.24. Total revenues rose 11 per cent with strong business and consumer lending, while investments and brokerage activities were ahead. Net interest income was up 4 per cent and other income ahead 11 per cent. Non-performing loans continued to decline, to CDollars 1.7bn at July 31, while fiscal 1994 loan provision was unchanged at CDollars 880m. Total assets reached CDollars 152.5bn, up 9 per cent year-on-year. Boise Cascade, the US forest products group, is going ahead this month with an initial public offering of Rainy River Forest Products, a Canadian subsidiary holding all the newsprint assets. Rainy River, with two mills in Canada and one in the US, will have annual sales of more than USDollars 350m and rank among North America's top 10 producers of newsprint and groundwood papers. Boise Cascade expects to raise CDollars 420m by selling units of Rainy River, comprising common shares and convertible debentures. Boise Cascade will also raise USDollars 110m with an institutional issue of secured notes.</p>

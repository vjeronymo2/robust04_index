			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lynx chief ousted by institutions MR STEPHEN Hinchcliffe, chairman of James Wilkes, the engineering group on the receiving end of a hostile bid from Petrocon, was yesterday ousted from the board of Lynx Holdings in an institutional coup. A majority of institutional shareholders are thought to have grown dissatisfied with the lack of progress since Mr Hinchcliffe refinanced the leisure and computer services company two years ago and had threatened to requisition an extraordinary general meeting to change the board. Mr Andrew Hartley and Mr Chris Harrison, both also executive directors of Wilkes, have also resigned from the board of Lynx. Mr Hinchcliffe is replaced as chairman of Lynx by Mr Roger Pinnington, chairman of Telfos Holdings. In November the share prices of Lynx and Wilkes fell on news that Mr Hinchcliffe had been arrested. He was not charged. West Midlands Commercial Fraud Squad said Mr Hinchcliffe was arrested as part of an investigation into WB Industries, a West Bromwich engineering company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan will hold  bilateral tariff reduction negotiations under the framework of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with the  Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand beginning April 25, the  Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) announced Thursday [14 April].    BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu will represent Taiwan  at the talks, to take place in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok  respectively.    The Philippines has requested Taiwan to slash import duties  on 61 items, while Thailand has asked for lower tariffs on 33  items, and Malaysia 24 items, Lin said. The tariff-cut requests  focus on agricultural and fishery products, textiles, machinery  equipment, and small cars, he added.    The forthcoming tariff negotiations will be the first such  talks between Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries. Taiwan has  held similar talks with Australia, Chile, Hungary, New Zealand,  South Africa, Turkey, and the United States.    Meanwhile, similar talks between Taiwan and Japan will be  held April 27-28 in Tokyo. BOFT Director-General Huang Yen-chao  will lead the Taiwan delegation to the Tokyo talks.    Bilateral tariff reduction talks with GATT contracting  parties are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth accession to  the Geneva-based world trade regulating body.    Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September  1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

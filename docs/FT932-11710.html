			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tax saving move gives boost to RMC shares THE SHARE price of RMC jumped by 5 per cent yesterday after the company announced that it was reorganising its German operations giving it substantial tax advantages. Readymix Berlin, its 63.6 per cent controlled eastern German operations which previously has been classed as an associate, is to be merged with Readymix AG, its larger western German subsidiary. The move, which will involve no cash cost to RMC, will allow the group to take much better advantage of accelerated tax depreciation incentives introduced to encourage capital investment in the former East German republic. It will, however, increase group debt by Pounds 150m, raising gearing from 31 per cent to 45 per cent. RMC said that Readymix Berlin would have generated insufficient profits for the group to take full benefit of the tax relief. This could now be set against earnings of the merged company, including profits from western German operations. RMC's share price rose 34p to 675p following the announcement. Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said the group would achieve an immediate cash benefit of DM40m (Pounds 16.2m) which would not have to be paid against this year's tax bill. Depreciation and accumulated tax losses amounting to DM100m would be available for relief against corporation tax on 1993 profits. This meant that big payments on account which would have been made this year will not now be necessary, said Mr Jenkins. He said that the group in the next two to three years proposed to invest DM500m in its eastern German operations. This investment would be eligible for tax relief provided it was spent before December 31, 1995. Mr Jenkins said earnings per share would improve as a result. See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos </F> by Mehmet Ali Birand in Athens for the "32d Day" program; date  not given -- recorded, in French fading into Turkish translation]    [Text] [Birand] What is your opinion concerning the  future of Turkish-Greek relations?    [Pangalos] I have to say at first that Greece is not  administering a hostile policy against Turkey and especially not  against the Turkish people. We are only issuing criticisms  concerning the human rights issue. I have to note that our  critical statements do not outdo similar statements made by  several of my European colleagues, the international press, or  the Turkish media.    [Birand] You insist on having human rights respected in  Turkey while the human rights of Turks in Western Thrace are  being violated. This creates a very important concern for  Ankara.    [Pangalos] The rights of Muslims in Western Thrace are even  greater than what is granted to them by international agreements.    [Birand] What strikes us as most disturbing and worth noting  is that, after a few quiet years, a drastic change occurred in  Greek policy after you joined the government. A hostile policy  toward Turkey began, nonexistent during the government headed by  Konstandinos Mitsotakis.    [Pangalos] The government of Mr. Mitsotakis was a  right-winged government and did not give too much importance to  the human rights issue. We are a left-winged government and we  use the same criteria for both Turkey and Greece when judging  human rights issues. I would like to note that also in Greece  all is not well.    [Birand] The Cyprus issue is the major concern of the  Papandreou government and they definitely want to reach a  solution during their term. For this reason the first thing  they did when coming to power was to include south Cyprus into  the Greek defense system. According to the agreement signed by  Greece and south Cyprus, Greece took the responsibility of  south Cyprus' air and naval defense. This agreement was  negatively received by the Turkish government in Ankara. Apart  from this, Greece started drilling oil around the Thasos island  which created suspicions regarding the intentions of the  Papandreou regime since the area drilled was close to the  international water agreement region -- still under discussion  -- although inside the borders of Greece.    [Pangalos] You have 40,000 soldiers in Cyprus as well as  heavy tanks and your planes are continually flying over the  Turkish side. In spite of all this, the small measures we take  disturb you. The fact that you are alluding to a Greek threat,  although our planes are unable to reach Cyprus, only shows that  Turkey has adverse intentions.    [Birand] Turkey and the Turkish people believe that the  Greeks and the Greek Cypriots are not interested in solving the  Cyprus issue.    [Pangalos] Why should we not want to reach a solution  regarding the Cyprus issue?    [Birand] We think that it is easier for Greece to put down  Turkey in the international arena.    [Pangalos] We have lost the war in 1974. We have a very big  military force and we are proud of it. Yet Turkey has to make a  choice, either it will be a country that values conquests -- as  in the past -- or it will be a country that values its  development and relations with other European countries. These  two values cannot coexist. Turkey has to decide which way to  choose, either it will be a military power or it will give  importance to development. Nobody can sweep the issue of Cyprus  under the carpet. The problem exists and a solution has to be  reached.    [Birand] Your notion of a solution is to give the Turkish  Cypriots the rights granted to a minority population and  consequently close the issue. Your approach does not include  recognizing the equal rights of the Turkish Cypriots.    [Pangalos] What is the meaning of political equality? Is  political equality giving 50 percent of the political power to  10 percent of the Cyprus population and the remaining 50 percent  of the political power to 80 percent of the Cyprus' population?  Is this distribution democratic? This is not called democracy  but it is called Turkish oligarchy. How will you react if 18  percent of the Turkish population has half of the assembly  seats? This is impossible.    [Birand] The problem is obvious. If we go back to the  Aegean, we see that we are faced with a situation that was  nonexistent during the Mitsotakis period. You started oil  exploring around Thasos island.    [Pangalos] Listen, I do not want to go into details with you  about something that is being done within our territorial  waters. Even the fact that you ask me this question, the fact  that your press and politicians are discussing this issue, shows  that you have not yet become part of the international world.    [Birand] That is how the crisis of 1987 erupted.    [Pangalos] We did not start it. Look, even this discussion  is ridiculous. All this should be settled in line with  international rules. If there is a settlement, fine. If there  is not, then the question must be taken to the International  Court of Justice in the Hague and settled there.    [Birand] Another development which disturbs Turkey is  Greece's positive attitude toward the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan]. While the PKK is being banned in several European  countries, Athens is signaling that it will grant extensive  freedoms to that organization. PKK militants can demonstrate in  Athens and be active as political refugees. Greek  parliamentarians frequently show their solidarity with the PKK.  This situation greatly disturbs Turkey. Turkey describes  Athens' attitude toward this most sensitive issue as a show of  hostility.    [Pangalos] The PKK does not base itself in Greece. We do  not allow any political activity against Turkey. There are  certain Kurds here. They have the status of political refugees  as recognized by the United Nations. These people stage  demonstrations. They have the right. Everybody has the right  to demonstrate in the city. If they create incidents, they are  arrested. It happened recently. Some of them hurled stones.  They were caught, prosecuted and punished.    [Birand] Is the PKK a terrorist organization or not?    [Pangalos] Listen, there is a people living in southeastern  Turkey. They want their identities to be recognized. If you  can resolve this, the problem of terrorism will automatically be  resolved. If, after that, persons emerge trying to use  terrorist methods, they will be isolated in the community.    [Birand] It is not that simple. They resort to extreme  violence. Everybody knows that. While this happens, we turn to  Athens and we see that the PKK is there.    [Pangalos] No, the PKK has no official bureau here. You  cannot find the PKK here. They cannot carry out any activities.  There are Kurds here. Their representatives talk to the press  on behalf of the Kurds, not on behalf of the PKK. Do not forget  that we are not a police state. We cannot drag Kurds from the  street, torture them, and interrogate them to find out if they  are PKK members or not.    [Birand] Another point that disturbs Turkey is the fact that  Greece places obstacles in the relations between Turkey and the  European Union [EU]. Under the pretext of the Cyprus problem,  Greece tries very hard to prevent the EU from extending even a  cent to Turkey. In fact, Greece has turned into a clear cut  policy its determination not to have the 12 EU countries open  the door for Turkey. The key to that door is claimed to be  Cyprus.    [Pangalos] Yes, we have a political condition. Maybe it was  we who proposed it, but the 12 accepted it, and it became a EU  resolution. Now, it is impossible for the other countries to  say that Turkey has been in Cyprus for a long time, that it does  not want to withdraw, and that it should be allowed to stay.  These other countries cannot come and tell us to lift our veto.  That cannot happen now.</p>

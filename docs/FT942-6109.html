			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Two Warburg directors paid Pounds 1m-plus: Late starter shows rapid growth in off-balance sheet derivatives contracts Two directors of SG Warburg, the UK-based investment bank, received more than Pounds 1m in salary and bonuses last year, as emoluments to the bank's directors nearly doubled to Pounds 10.7m, it was disclosed yesterday. Warburg revealed in its annual report for the year to March that one director received Pounds 1.2m and another Pounds 1.5m. In each case, more than Pounds 600,000 came under a long-term performance-related bonus scheme. Sir David Scholey, chairman, received Pounds 758,000 compared with Pounds 411,000 in 1992-93. Some 11 Warburg directors were paid more than the top amount of Pounds 510,000-Pounds 515,000 received by a director in the previous year. The bank also disclosed a rapid growth in its off-balance sheet financial derivatives contracts. It held exchange rate, interest rate and equity contracts with a notional value of Pounds 61.6bn at the year-end, compared with Pounds 23.9bn. However, the total replacement value of the contracts - the amount which it would have to provide if the other parties to all its derivatives contracts defaulted - grew only slightly to Pounds 597.4m, against Pounds 586m. The figures, disclosed for the first time under the EC Bank Accounts directive, showed rapid growth in equity derivatives contracts, an area which it strengthened last year with the acquisition of the Chicago firm KC-CO Investments. Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, said last week when the results were released, that it had entered derivatives 'rather late in the day' and its activities in the area were still 'relatively small'. Mr Philip Gibbs, an investment banking analyst for BZW, said that the figures did not indicate much about the shape of Warburg's derivatives activities, but growth in derivatives was encouraging because it was a profitable business. Warburg also disclosed a fall in the proportion of pre-tax profits coming from the UK: Pounds 196.1m, or 66 per cent, of the Pounds 297m total compared with 83 per cent of Pounds 148.2m the previous year. But Warburg added that more than 60 per cent of revenues came from outside the UK last year. The proportion of profits coming from the Asia Pacific rose to 13.9 per cent, compared with 3.7 per cent.

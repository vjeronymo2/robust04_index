			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE YEAR LATER, SO MANY ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE SEIZURE OF LINCOLN S&amp;L;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: EMPLOYEES AND BONDHOLDERS ARE AMONG THOSE STILL ENTANGLED IN THE DRAMA  OF A FINANCIAL COLLAPSE.  </P> <P> "Trish," a dapper Charles H. Keating Jr. shouted out to a former employee he  recognized recently at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.  </P> <P> A startled Patricia Johnson, the one-time aide whom he had unceremoniously  fired a year earlier, looked up and saw her former boss. She shook hands with  him, but not a word was spoken, not a smile flashed on either face.  </P> <P> With the greeting made, she turned and walked away.  </P> <P> The chance meeting nearly a year after the collapse of Keating's American  Continental Corp. and its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan unit brought a rush of  memories to Johnson. She liked Keating, she said, but the thrift's seizure last  April 14 has made her life hell.  </P> <P> It is a hell shared by other former employees, by Keating himself and his  remaining aides, by thrift regulators and former regulators and, perhaps most  strikingly, by thousands of small investors who lost more than $200 million  related to the collapse.  </P> <P> Irvine-based Lincoln, which lost $1 billion last year, is expected to become  one of the most expensive thrift failures in history, costing taxpayers more  than $2 billion.  </P> <P> Keating, chairman of American Continental, used his Phoenix home-building  company to buy Lincoln in early 1984 for $51 million. The S&amp;L grew to a  $5.4-billion enterprise, with much of its deposits invested in real estate  developments and in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.  </P> <P> The collapse of Keating's empire has hurt a wide range of people.  </P> <P> Nearly 22,000 small investors, who bought what many believed were federally  insured American Continental bonds sold in Lincoln branches, have filed 17  lawsuits in state and federal courts against Keating, his aides and the lawyers  and accountants who advised him. The investors now hold worthless paper.  </P> <P> The political careers of five U.S. senators, including Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.), are in jeopardy because they helped Lincoln while they were getting  more than $1.3 million in campaign contributions and donations to pet projects  from Keating and some 75 family members, associates and employees. The bulk of  the money, nearly $900,000, went to Cranston and three nonpartisan voter  registration groups he supported.  </P> <P> While former American Continental and Lincoln employees have found it tough  getting work, some of those who sold bonds at Lincoln branches are still  working there and must face the anguish of the elderly bondholders who come in  daily. Some Lincoln borrowers also were dragged down, forced into bankruptcy  from a combination of debt, canceled deals with Lincoln and Arizona's depressed  real estate market.  </P> <P> Keating himself has become the lightning rod for criticism of all the ills in  the thrift industry. Last fall, regulators filed a $1.1-billion civil  racketeering action against him and his top aides. He also could eventually  face criminal charges from pending state and federal probes.  </P> <P> The stories of some people whose lives were touched by the Lincoln scandal give  a glimpse of the past year in turmoil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Publicist  </P> <P> Patricia Johnson was Arizona's "Outstanding Young Democrat" in 1985 and, she  thought, her liberal bent was the antithesis of Keating and his politics. She  surprised herself in accepting Keating's offer of a job to handle American  Continental's public relations.  </P> <P> "Charlie was personable, charming, passionate about his company," she said, in  explaining why she joined his firm. She said he was "well-centered  politically," even though he often is mischaracterized as a conservative.  </P> <P> Last April, a few days before American Continental's bankruptcy, Keating told  her he had to let her go -- no vacation or severance pay, though others had  received generous parachutes. Her dismissal, she thought then, was dictated by  regulators. It wasn't, she learned later.  </P> <P> "A little panic set in," Johnson said. "How was I going to pay for groceries? I  had just spent $400 over the weekend on flowers, plants, grass seed, fertilizer  for the repossessed house I had bought. I wondered if I could take the flowers  and grass back."  </P> <P> Carrying a letter of recommendation that she wrote and Keating signed, she  started an immediate job hunt. A well-known figure locally, Johnson found that  doors normally open to her were now closed.  </P> <P> When she did get in, she didn't get far. One banker ripped up the Keating  letter in front of her and advised her not to show it to other prospective  employers, she said.  </P> <P> "I don't mind being rejected for professional reasons, but not to have an  opportunity to interview because of my association with American Continental,  that hurt," she said.  </P> <P> She started her own business as a consultant, but the accounts she could get  were infrequent ones. "I felt like I had so much knowledge to offer and no work  to use it on," she said.  </P> <P> Eventually, Johnson went on unemployment. She borrowed money on her credit card  and from her family. Her parents bought her groceries often. But mini-disasters  hit regularly: She broke arm and leg bones in a bike accident, the roof on her  home caved in after a rainstorm and her car broke down on the way to a job  interview.  </P> <P> All the while, her stint at American Continental haunted her. Last fall,  Securities and Exchange Commission documents revealed that Keating and his  aides blamed her for an erroneous press release in March, 1989, about the  pending sale of Lincoln. But she had proof of her innocence -- Keating's own  handwritten instructions on a draft of the press release.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, shortly after her bank account hit zero, Johnson, 36, started a  new job with the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest. Still, she  said, it will take "quite a while" to pay off her debts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Developer  </P> <P> Ernest C. Garcia finds it hard to keep quiet. He usually is open and glib. The  Phoenix real estate developer likes to tell reporters what's on his mind.  </P> <P> But the whiz-kid entrepreneur -- he became a multimillionaire before he was 30  -- has largely avoided discussing his entanglements with Lincoln. He invoked  his 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination last month when  subpoenaed to testify about those dealings before the House Banking Committee.  </P> <P> "In my wildest imagination, I never dreamed I would plead the 5th to anything,"  Garcia, 32, said last week. "When is this nightmare going to end?"  </P> <P> It appears no time soon. The Midas-touch businessman, who could seemingly do no  wrong, is now fighting off creditors. He put his firm, E. C. Garcia &amp; Co.,  into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last week.  </P> <P> Starting out as a stockbroker, Garcia founded his own firm in 1982. But he  switched to the booming Arizona real estate market and quickly made a fortune.  </P> <P> He sold 80% of his firm in 1986 to an Arizona utility but a year later decided  he wanted it back. He turned to Keating to get a $20-million loan to buy the  stock. The deal came with strings attached.  </P> <P> Regulators contend that those strings -- purchases of raw land and securities  owned by Lincoln -- made Garcia a puppet of Keating. In essence, Garcia was a  straw borrower and a straw purchaser used by Keating to pump up Lincoln  earnings, they claim in a pending federal lawsuit.  </P> <P> Garcia, who has cooperated with the alphabet soup of federal investigators,  including the FBI and the SEC, said he was nobody's dupe.  </P> <P> "Everything we did made perfect business sense," he said. "Nobody tried to hide  any deal from anybody."  </P> <P> Still, two weeks ago bondholders added his company to their pending lawsuits  against Keating and others. Garcia said the unknown liability from that  litigation, along with heavy debts incurred in his deals with Lincoln, forced  him to turn to bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> "In spite of all this, I'm as enthusiastic as ever and extremely confident in  our abilities to succeed again," Garcia said. "But I won't look back at any  time in the future and laugh about this. It's been brutal."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Loyalist  </P> <P> Danby Housel, 29, has worked for American Continental and Lincoln in Phoenix  for 4 1/2 years. She has no plans to work anywhere else. The secretary said she  will stick with Keating and American Continental through the coming battles  with lawyers and regulators.  </P> <P> Starting out in the company's tax department, she fit the Keating employee look  and demeanor -- young, well-scrubbed, good-looking, willing to work long hours.  She liked the "very positive, very fast-paced" operation. "We always felt like  a major part of the community in Phoenix," she said. "And there was such a  camaraderie here."  </P> <P> Though working mainly for Lincoln last year, she was handling a job for  American Continental when the company filed for bankruptcy and regulators  seized the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> "It was a big shock. Everybody was totally bewildered," Housel said. "American  Continental was big, then everything was wiped away. It took months to sink  in."  </P> <P> Though regulators offered her a job at Lincoln, she quit to work at a law firm.  Two months later, she rejoined American Continental because she liked the  company and was familiar with the work. She also returned, she said, because "I  wanted to put my two cents in with the fight."  </P> <P> She remains fervently loyal to Keating.  </P> <P> "Some of my friends thought Keating was the biggest crook of all time. Others  thought he was getting the short end of the stick," Housel said. "There have  been a few battles (with friends). So we either call a truce or decide to stop  seeing each other."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Lawyer  </P> <P> Michael Manning does not consider himself an easy mark. But when federal  regulators went looking for someone to investigate wrongdoing at Lincoln and  American Continental, they said the choice of who could pursue such a complex  case was easy.  </P> <P> Last April 10, Manning, a Kansas City lawyer based in Washington, had just  completed five years of work on the massive brokered deposit fraud perpetrated  on 153 financial institutions by Mario Renda of New York. Manning was planning  a vacation when an FDIC lawyer called to ask him to take charge of the Lincoln  investigation after the planned seizure later that week.  </P> <P> Figuring he would go to Phoenix for a few days and then oversee the case from  his Washington office where he was managing partner, Manning agreed. He hasn't  left Phoenix yet, and he no longer plans to.  </P> <P> His firm has opened an office in Phoenix, and he has moved his family into  town. The change has been a tough adjustment on his wife and three children.  His second child, a 4-year-old daughter, complains that she "wants to go back  to her own country," Manning said. His wife was not thrilled with the notion of  moving to Phoenix but now likes it, he said.  </P> <P> "In Washington, I would come home at 10:30 at night and be asked to go to the  store, and I'd be standing in a long line at the check-out counter," he said.  "Here, I could come home at 8, go out to pick up some groceries and have the  store to myself."  </P> <P> In poring through Lincoln records, Manning, 40, said he saw many of the same  kinds of transactions -- such as loans to straw borrowers who had no intention  of repaying the debts -- that he saw in the Renda and other fraud cases.  </P> <P> He and other lawyers in his firm worked nonstop through most of the summer to  put together a 167-page, $1.1-billion civil lawsuit accusing Keating and others  of racketeering, bank fraud and other wrongdoing. The case was filed in  September in U.S. District Court in Phoenix.  </P> <P> "Certainly, this is a large and complex case," he said. "And the allegations  don't center on a single bank fraud technique, as they usually do in other  cases."  </P> <P> Manning will likely amend the suit soon to add more defendants and more  allegations. Trial is tentatively set for the summer of 1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Bondholder  </P> <P> Clifford H. Hammer became one of California's suddenly wealthy when he and his  wife, Thelma, sold their Palos Verdes Estates home a little over two years ago  and put a down payment on a smaller residence in Carlsbad.  </P> <P> A retiree from Southern California Edison Co., Hammer figured they could live  comfortably on his pension and the $260,000 equity from the sale of their home.  They even began to travel around the country, something they had always  promised themselves they would do.  </P> <P> Now, at 73 and recovering from a recent back operation, Hammer has gone back to  work. And it's not by choice.  </P> <P> Like thousands of other Lincoln depositors who had been persuaded by thrift  tellers and American Continental salespeople, Hammer put all of his savings  into the parent company's debt securities.  </P> <P> He received $2,600 a month, and retirement was grand. At least until last  April, when the company filed for bankruptcy. Now the Hammers hold worthless  paper.  </P> <P> "My wife came down with shingles last May," he said. "It was caused by nerves,  worrying about our loss. She was in the hospital about three days, and she  still has it to some extent."  </P> <P> Hammer said his back hurt, but he "had to go back into real estate" last May,  something he had dabbled in part time before he retired 11 years ago.  </P> <P> "There was no other way to get out of it," he said. "We've got a house payment  and an insurance payment, and we were going into the red."  </P> <P> But his back grew worse and he could hardly walk. So he underwent surgery three  weeks ago to remove calcium deposits on his spine. Though he hasn't made a sale  this year, he plans to return to work in four weeks. The alternative, he said,  is to sell his retirement house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Kingfish  </P> <P> Charles H. Keating Jr. publicly has been painted as the villain, the man in the  black hat who allegedly masterminded a scam that led to the collapse of  Lincoln. Thousands of bondholders believe it; government regulators believe it;  some former employees believe it.  </P> <P> But Keating, the 67-year-old chairman of American Continental, sees himself as  a victim, not a villain.  </P> <P> "History is replete with good people ruined by governments," he said with  characteristic defiance.  </P> <P> And Keating puts on an upbeat face. He refuses to let his long battles with  regulators get him down. He believes completely that he will be vindicated. And  he expects to get some Lincoln assets back so he can rebuild his company and  pay off bondholders.  </P> <P> "I'm not despondent or despairing," Keating said. "It's a challenge, like the  rest of life, that we intend to meet. It's not easy, but I'm not going to let  it get me down."  </P> <P> Keating anticipated the takeover of Lincoln last April 14. He braced for it,  saying he already had "spent four years in living hell with regulators" in  constant battle over Lincoln's operations.  </P> <P> Always quick with rhetoric to blast regulators, Keating said his wife and  children are strong people who are coping well because they know what  regulators have done. "They understand vermin when they see it," he said.  </P> <P> Keating said his net worth is zero. His Paradise Valley, Ariz., home is  "mortgaged for way more than it's worth," but his creditors have given him  until this summer to start making payments.  </P> <P> A practicing lawyer before he got involved in finance and real estate in Ohio  in the early 1970s, Keating said he is going back to the law. He plans to open  an office in Phoenix next month with some of his family members and longtime  American Continental associates.  </P> <P> "I expect to practice in federal courts around the nation," he said. "I've got  an office set up to practice business law, particularly for cases related to  government affairs. I'll represent those who are similarly harassed by the  government. I think it will do quite well."  </P></p>

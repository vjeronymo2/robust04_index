			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (13): Essential part of economy - Tourism ON A Saturday in mid-July, the streets of Tenby in south Pembrokeshire, one of the Britain's more charming seaside towns, are bustling with people. The colour-washed regency houses on the clifftops look spruce and, on the beaches below, the sands are speckled with holidaymakers enjoying the afternoon sun. Some are even swimming. In the evening, the Mews bistro, serving 'home-cured sushi-style Teifi salmon,' is packed with customers. Yet there is no lack of 'vacancy' signs in the guest houses, and the apparent well-being disguises high local unemployment. Tenby is a small town, of only 5,000 permanent residents, but, with its neighbour Saundersfoot, has the largest concentration of hotel and guest house rooms in Wales after Llandudno on the north coast. The importance of tourism to Tenby in particular, and Wales in general, is shown by the fact that, despite the recession, which has restrained the number of holidaymakers, those employed in the Welsh industry rose from 72,000 in 1989 to over 79,000 in 1991, more than 8 per cent of the total workforce. But the issue now is: what type of tourism is wanted, given that the 'bucket and spade' brigade, as at Tenby, is the most easily lured by foreign sun? Last year's national garden festival at Ebbw Vale attracted about 1m visitors from outside Wales, and in the future large numbers may be drawn to urban destinations such as Cardiff Bay. But for many visitors - the 'heritage and hikes' variety - much of the appeal of Wales will remain its uncrowded coast and countryside. Tourism is of especial value to these rural areas, where inward industrial investment is hard to win. In Pembrokeshire there is the added need to replace jobs lost by the rundown of military bases. In Haverfordwest, the old county town, with a population of 12,000, half a dozen shops are closed in the high street alone. Work opportunities are scarce: the Job Centre's window has seven vacancies, five for part-time jobs such as cleaners at Pounds 3 an hour. With the splendour of the Pembrokeshire national park and its coastal path, the potential to increase tourism is great. Travellers from England can reach Haverfordwest in two hours from the Severn bridge, with dual carriageway and motorway most of the way. They can even come by rail. But the prime need, as elsewhere in Wales, is to have more visitors throughout the year, rather than crowding into the peak season, and those who spend more, which in particular means ones from abroad. Wales has fared badly in attracting overseas visitors. There were 620,000 in 1991, only 3.7 per cent of the UK total. In contrast, Scotland had 9.5 per cent, although many would argue that Wales offers as much in terms of scenery and history. Its distinctive culture and language is epitomised by the national Eisteddfod at Builth Wells, Powys. For the first time, the Wales Tourist Board has been allowed this year to market itself overseas separately from the British Tourist Authority  - something Scotland has been able to do since 1984. In the US, from where more visitors to Wales come than from any other country, the WTB has appointed 1,200 agents. This month, promotional videos have been shown on British Airways long-haul flights. 'We have to develop an image for Wales and make potential visitors a more saleable proposition: not just 'Come to Wales - full-stop' but Come to Wales. . . for a reason, such as 'Come and stay in a national park,' or 'Come and stay in a historic castle town,'' says Mr Paul Loveluck, the WTB's chief executive. This is in line with the board's new five-year strategy, launched earlier this summer. The strategy report wants Wales to attract more independent and business visitors, people taking second and short-break holidays and, especially, overseas visitors. It believes that the number of the latter can increase by 7 per cent a year, a much higher rate than for British visitors. The report recognises that the non-Welsh can have a poor perception of Wales as a holiday destination - 'We have a very good image with existing regular visitors, who are very loyal,' says Mr Loveluck. 'But the image is not good with people who have not been or who came many years ago. They may have found that there were not satisfactory facilities, or sometimes the welcome was indifferent.' One scheme to counter this is a staff training course called Welcome Host. 'It's frustrating,' says Mr Loveluck, 'that there can be an automatic assumption that someone on a factory line is more highly skilled and has more status than a waiter.' But the status of tourism is changing: 'Four years ago we had no university department in Wales concerned with tourism,' says Mr Loveluck. 'We now have three chairs.' Although Wales has only a handful of top-class hotels, the standard of cooking and variety of menu have improved. Wales musters 37 pages in the Good Food Guide, compared with 24 pages 10 years ago. There are now such finds as Jemima's near Haverfordwest, a tiny restaurant where one can have elderflower spritzers, home made bread and homegrown vegetables with local fish such as pollack. In Solva, a village tucked into a Pembrokeshire coastal cleft, the restaurants have modish names - The Old Pharmacy and Le Papillon Rouge. Pubs have become friendlier: 'Children welcome' is a common sign. Restaurants are one type of business that can apply for project aid from the WTB, and aid is the catalyst for well-managed tourist development. Between 1987 and 1991, no less than Pounds 25m of European regional development fund money has been allocated to tourism projects in Dyfed (which includes Pembrokeshire), Gwynedd and Powys alone. There are WTB schemes for improving self-catering enterprises (two-thirds of all bed capacity in Wales), upgrading hotels and guest houses, and for encouraging farm holidays and activity centres. Since 1988, the board has channelled Pounds 18.7m in financial assistance to 1,256 projects, which it calculates stimulated an overall investment of Pounds 143m. In one project, the Pembrokeshire national park authority, in partnership with other bodies, has worked on a Pounds 1m scheme to restore Tenby's historic frontages. A recent initiative has been the West Wales Task Force, launched last year by the Welsh Office to alleviate the impact on employment of the rundown of RAF Brawdy and the naval base at Trecwn near Fishguard. So far, the task force has helped 76 projects since it started, with Pounds 1.42m of grant. Its biggest single grant is Pounds 118,000 towards the upgrading to 'de luxe' standard of the Atlantic Hotel on Tenby's esplanade. Last year, a grant by the Countryside Council for Wales helped the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to buy Ramsey island, off St David's Head. The RSPB restricts landings to 40 people a day to minimise disturbance to the cloughs, guillemots, kittiwakes, and the largest colony of Atlantic grey seals in southern Britain. There is a moral there for Wales as a whole: tourism is an essential part of its economy, but it must not be at the expense of the environment which is its greatest asset.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Astec recovery gathers pace ASTEC (BSR), the Hong Kong-based but London-listed electronic components and power conversion products group which is 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson of the US, yesterday confirmed its turnround by returning to profitability for the full year. The Pounds 7.8m pre-tax profit for 1992 compared with a Pounds 4.8m loss in 1991 and was struck after lower net interest payments of Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 3.41m) and a Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 2.2m) exceptional charge resulting from the decision to close the cellular telephone business and scale down UK manufacturing operations. Rationalisation and restructuring costs of Pounds 5.82m in 1992 were offset by the Pounds 5.5m profit on the sale of three non-core businesses - printed circuit boards, travel services and the text/measurement operation - for a total of Pounds 13.5m including Pounds 11m cash. Turnover slipped from Pounds 273m to Pounds 251m reflecting the disposals and closures, but on a comparable basis sales increased to Pounds 230m (Pounds 225m). Earnings per share of 2.15p compared to losses of 1.61p in 1991. Despite the improvement the dividend is again omitted. Operating profits jumped to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 800,000) reflecting aggressive cost cutting which lifted gross margins from 20.9 per cent to 23.6 per cent. The core power conversion business increased its sales by 4.8 per cent to Pounds 182.5m (Pounds 174.1m), outpacing the 2.1 per cent growth in the worldwide market and positioning Astec as the market leader. Operating profits in the power conversion business increased from Pounds 3.39m to Pounds 9.15m. The electronic components division returned to profitability reporting a Pounds 465,000 operating surplus (Pounds 2.61m loss) on sales which fell from Pounds 98.9m to Pounds 68.4m reflecting the disposals.</p>

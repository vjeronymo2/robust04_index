			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: Ageing into Variety - Antony Thorncroft finds alternative comedian Paul Merton distancing himself from his television past It is just like the good old days at the Palladium for the next week or so. There is a comedian topping the bill, telling jokes, performing sketches, getting involved in slapstick. The fact that the jokes (Man: 'Got a copy of Psychic News? Shopkeeper: 'You tell me'.) have the patina of history; the sketches (the blindfolded Great Mystero just cannot conjure up a right answer for his feed) are of Victorian vintage; and the slapstick (two men compete for the favours of a third wearing a skimpy bikini) had them roaring at the Coliseum - in Rome - add to the warm glow of communal memory. The only thing slightly disturbing is that this is Paul Merton's show, Merton the cynical, deadpan, alternative comedian. Although Paul Merton rose to TV fame through stand-up routines in comedy clubs, he has always been too laddish to be your typically PC-alternative ranter. His audience is the lower middle class and it was out in force on Monday, willing their boy on. He got there in the end, but it was a tough battle. Only in a protracted skit on Aladdin, with Merton somehow playing Buttons, did the Palladium come to life. (Buttons 'I haven't got any friends'. Audience; 'aaah'. Buttons - aggressively - 'Don't you patronise me'). Merton shares the stage with Lee Simpson and Richard Vranch. Perhaps it is inevitable that the young Turks of comedy eventually age into variety stars, but there is something dispiriting about watching Merton do monologues about his school days, and Simpson and Vranch perform sketches honed in the music halls. What saves it, and makes for a mildly amusing evening, is Merton's aggrieved innocence, put over with a professional precision and clarity. Many of the one liners have his special mark on them - 'I disturbed a burglar last night. I told him there was no God' - and when he does occasionally let rip on the ad libs his famed stream-of-consciousness ravings show signs of genius. Paul Merton seems to be distancing himself from his television past - his sparring partner on Have I Got News for You, Angus Deayton, bears the brunt of a running joke (he is portrayed as a suspended suit), and Merton even has a go at improvisation: 'if you can't be bothered to learn the words why do it at all.' But this very English, very traditional, evening hardly stretches his talent.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Life Sciences pays Pounds 33.5m for Finnish group LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments manufacturer, is expanding its international business by acquiring Labsystems, a Helsinki-based instruments group, for FM285m (Pounds 33.5m). The purchase will be partly funded by the placing of 9.37m shares at 129p to raise about Pounds 12m after costs. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, said: 'The acquisition of Labsystems is another step forward in our strategy of building an international scientific equipment business.' Labsystems, which employs 780 people, is a leading manufacturer of branded scientific equipment and consumable products for the clinical, research and industrial laboratory markets. Its products and main geographic markets are seen as complementing those of Life Sciences. In particular it has a strong customer presence in Europe while Life Sciences' main customer strength is in North America. Last year it reported trading profits of FM34.8m on sales of FM362.7m using average exchange rates. Pre-tax profits, after charging interest on borrowings, the bulk of which will not be assumed by Life Systems, totalled FM10.4m. Based on year-end exchange rates, which reflect a significant depreciation in the markka late last year, the company reported trading profits of FM39m and had net assets of FM250m. Labsystems is quoted on the Finnish OTC market. Saastopankkien Keskus-Osake-Pankki, the parent company of a Finnish-based banking group, owns 97 per cent of the shares which carry 99 per cent of the voting rights. Life Sciences will satisfy the total consideration by assuming FM64m of Labsystems' borrowings, making a cash payment of about FM119m and by way of the placing which is designed to raise the equivalent of FM102m and will be undertaken by Robert Fleming. The cash consideration will be provided under a bank facility arrangement and following the acquisition Life Sciences' gearing is expected to be about 60 per cent. In March the group reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992 to Pounds 20.6m. Directors said yesterday that 1993 had started satisfactorily with orders, sales and profits for the first quarter ahead of last year.</p>

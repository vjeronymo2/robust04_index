Gracheva: "Innovative Activity of Russian </F> Industrial Enterprises in 1992-1993 (According to the Results of  a Survey of 120 Industrial Enterprises in Russia's European  Part)"--material prepared by the "Russian Economic Barometer"  bulletin]    [Text] The dynamics and specific characteristics of  innovative activity are important indicators necessary for the  study of transitional processes. Such an activity forms the  basis for structural shifts and long-term economic growth.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1. Innovative Activity of Russian Enterprises (share of enterprises ca-|  |rrying out innovations in 1992-1993 in % of the total number of surveyed ent-|  |erprises)                                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |Innovative Quota                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Entire industry*                      |64                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Manufacturing industry                |66                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sector I (consumer goods)             |58                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sector II (investment goods)          |71                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sector III (intermediate goods)       |75                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*It includes the fuel industry, electric power engineering, and the manufact-|  |uring industry.                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The innovative activity of Russian industrial enterprises on  the basis of the results of 1993, both as compared with their  activity in 1990-1992 and with their own expectations expressed  at the beginning of 1993, was obviously stirred up (two previous  innovative tests were performed by the "Russian Economic  Barometer" in November 1992 and in February 1993). Almost  one-half of the respondents, which at the beginning of 1993 did  not intend to carry out innovations, by the end of the year  changed their intentions. At the same time, out of those that at  the beginning of 1993 intended to carry out innovations only  one-twelfth of the respondents abandoned their plans. On the  average, the increase in the innovative quota (that is, the  innovators' share in the total number of surveyed enterprises),  as compared with 1990-1992, made up 9 percent points and, as  compared with the expectations for 1993, 16 percent points. The  shift occurred mainly owing to the activation of enterprises of  sector III and, in part, of enterprises of sector I. At the same  time, the innovative activity of sector II remained at the  previous level. As the experience of other countries conducting  innovative surveys (for example, East Germany) shows, a sharp  increase in innovative activity is a characteristic sign of a  transitional economy. Although in our case (Russia) further  research is still needed to confirm the correctness of such a  conclusion.    The distribution of innovations carried out in 1992-1993  into  two main types--PRODUCT-INNOVATIONS (innovations or significant  improvements in produced products) and PROCESS-INNOVATIONS  (innovations or significant improvements in production  processes)--on the basis of the results of the fall survey looks  as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2. Types of Innovations (in % of the total number of enterprises carry-|  |ing our innovations in 1992-1993)                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Primarily Product-Innova-|Primarily Process-Innova-|  |                         |tions                    |tions                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Entire industry          |65                       |35                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Manufacturing industry   |68                       |32                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sector I                 |76                       |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sector II                |76                       |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sector III               |52                       |48                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      As compared with the two previous surveys, a marked shift  toward product-innovations can be noted in sector I of the  manufacturing industry and, to a lesser degree, in sector III.  In sector II the ratio of the two types of innovations did not  change. On the whole, an intensified introduction of innovations  or improvements in products of sectors producing consumer and  intermediate goods was the basic motive force in the stirring up  of the innovative activity of the Russian industry in 1993.    The hierarchy of goals pursued during the implementation of  various types of innovations looks as follows:    Table 3. Goals of Product-Innovations (distribution of answers of enterprises  carrying out innovations in 1992-1993 in %)*   Goals            Entire       Manufacturing     Sector I   Sector     Sector                   Industry     Industry                     II         III   1.               36           36                30         43         36  Modification  of already  produced  products   2.

Reduction in the     13          14               33        0         12  load on the  environment     *Respondents could indicate all the goals important from their point of view.      According to these parameters of innovative activity,  Russian  industrial enterprises have demonstrated quite a marked  unanimity. Both in industry as a whole and in individual sectors  enterprises carry out product-innovations primarily in order to  change over to the output of new products, remaining within  their basic sector. The output of substitutes for previously  produced goods is second in importance and the output of  products exceeding the scope of the basic sector, that is,  diversification, is third. The diversification rating in sector  II, which is higher as compared with other sectors, is  noteworthy. Probably, this is connected with the development of  the conversion of machine building defense enterprises.    The introduction of labor-, materials-, and energy-saving  technologies is the main priority during the implementation of  process-innovations for the entire industry and for its  individual sectors. An increase in production flexibility is in  the second place, an improvement in working conditions, in the  third place, and a reduction in the load on the environment, in  the last place.    If the comparison of Russia and Germany in the hierarchy of  goals in the implementation of innovations is continued, it can  be noted that in the goals of product-innovations there is an  approximate correspondence among them, whereas in  process-innovations there is a marked difference. In Germany  (both in western and in eastern lands) an increase in production  flexibility, not a reduction in costs, is the most important  goal. In Russia, however, this trend is only in the second place.    What causes such a difference? In our opinion, the fact that  the Russian industry is characterized by serious technological  backwardness, primarily in sectors producing consumer goods. As  a result, the labor-, materials-, and power-intensiveness of  production is much higher here than in developed countries. As  domestic prices of raw and basic materials and energy carriers  approach world prices, the noncompetitiveness of Russian goods  is manifested ever more sharply. Increasing the "degree of  contemporaneity" of applied technologies and bringing them up to  the level already existing in developed countries are the most  urgent problems in this situation. Thus, Russian enterprises  primarily see to it that the opportunities provided for modern  technologies for the economy of the scale in the mass production  of standard products be utilized fully. For companies in  countries with a developed market economy all this is an already  traversed stage. An increase in efficiency through the diversity  of products and selection of the optimum variation of the scale  in the small-series production of differentiated products is the  main imperative here. That is why they see the basic goal of  their process-innovations in the introduction of flexible module  technologies capable of a quick reorientation toward meeting the  demand placed by the present-day, highly segmented market.    The structure of output from the standpoint of the "life  cycle" of goods, that is, proportions among products in various  phases of this cycle (entry into the market, growth, stagnation,  and reduction), is an important characteristic of the efficiency  of innovations.    Table 5. Structure of Output According to Phases of the "Life Cycle" (the  entire sample in % of the real production volume)   Phases         Entire       Manufacturing     Sector I   Sector     Sector                 Industry     Industry                     II         III   I--of entry    25           25                28         24         19  into the  market (new  products,  the  production  of which was  begun in  1992-1993)   II--of         13           13                14         15         9  growth  (products  produced  prior to  1992, the  output of  which grew  in 1993)   III--of        38           38                39         45         28  stagnation  (products  produced  prior to  1992, the  output of  which was  stable in  1993)   IV--of         24           24                19         16         44  reduction  (products  produced  prior to  1992, the  output of  which  dropped in  1993)   Total          100          100               100        100        100      In order to ensure a long-term survival on the market,  enterprises must form the structure of their products so that  they can reach two main goals.    First, to promptly replace obsolete goods, which must be  modified or removed from production in the very near future.  From this point of view the difference between the shares of  output in phases I and IV is important. This difference should  be positive--the bigger it is, the better.    Second, it is necessary to ensure a stable income for the  financing of the activity of an enterprise as a whole and of  innovative activity in particular. From this point of view the  sum of shares of output in phases II and III, that is, output  which has already gained recognition on the market, is  important. As the experience of German companies shows, the  share of such output should be no less than two-thirds.    In most Russian enterprises the first indicator (the balance  between phases I and IV) is at a minimally favorable level. It  makes up +1 percent point in the entire industry and the  manufacturing industry, +9 percent points in sector I, and +8  percent points in sector II. Sector III, where the balance is  very unfavorable, that is, -25 percent points, constitutes an  exception.    The second indicator is at an acceptable level only in  sector  II (60 percent). In the other sectors (53 percent in I and 37  percent in III) and throughout the industry (51 percent) it is  too low. This means that in the current transitional situation  in Russian enterprises the share of the least promising,  obsolete goods (in phase IV--the reduction phase) is dangerously  high and they are forced to maintain, as a minimum, such a high  share of goods in phase I (entry into the market). Goods  entering the market can be the most promising. At the same time,  however, their production is connected with the greatest risk  (since their profitability has not been demonstrated  definitively) and with considerable capital investments in  production and the marketing system.    The length of the "cycle of birth" of product-innovations,  that is, of the period elapsing from the appearance of the idea  of the output of a new or improved product until the beginning  of its series output, is another important indicator  characterizing the intensity of innovative activity in industry.    Table 6.  Length of the  "Cycle of  Birth" of a  Product (in %  of the total  number of  surveyed  enterprises)                    Entire       Manufacturing     Sector I   Sector     Sector                   Industry     Industry                     II         III   Less than 1      44           45                64         28         41  year   From 1 to 3      42           42                36         48         44  years   From 3 to 5      10           8                 -          21         4  years   5 years and      4            5                 -          3          11  longer   Average length   22           21                13         26         25  of the cycle  (months)      According to survey data, the "cycle of birth" in the  Russian  industry is quite short--from 13 months in sectors producing  consumer goods to 26 months in sectors producing investment  goods. By comparison, in Germany's western lands, on the  average, in the manufacturing industry it is 27 months (similar  data on Germany's eastern lands are not available).    Such high efficiency of Russian enterprises in bringing new  or improved products to the market can be attributed to the fact  that in the current situation in their innovative activity they  adhere primarily to an imitative, overtaking strategy,  introducing goods that have already attained success on the  world market. Such goods represent innovations for Russia alone  and demand from enterprises mainly expenditures on experimental  and design research and development. However, in developed  countries an attacking, offensive strategy is the predominant  direction in the innovative activity of industrial companies. It  requires substantial expenditures on scientific research--on  applied, as well as basic, research. For example, almost  one-half of the innovations carried out by West German companies  involve patent registration. There are no similar data on the  degree of the patent protection of product-innovations in  Russian enterprises. However, data on the degree of  participation of professional scientific research organizations  in innovations carried out by enterprises can serve as an  indirect confirmation of the weak radical nature of innovations.    Table 7.  Sources of  Research and  Development  Serving as  the Basis for  Innovations  (in % of the  total number  of  enterprises  carrying out  innovations  in 1992-1993)                    Entire       Manufacturing     Sector I   Sector     Sector                  Industry     Industry                     II         III   Enterprises     93           93                100        90         88  themselves   Scientific      7            7                 -          10         12  research  firms   including   state           3            3                 -          5          4   private         4            4                 -          5          8      The virtually complete confinement of Russian enterprises to  their own research and development is due not only to the acute  shortage of financial resources (about which most respondents  complain). Russia's industry faces the need, primarily, "to  digest" what is already known: To bring the parameters and  design of its products closer to the standards of developed  countries, to master goods elementary for the Western market,  but absent on the Russian market, and to reorient the production  of traditional goods to new raw and basic materials (this  concerns especially products of the consumer sector). During  this period the decline in the interest of enterprises in  radical, offensive innovations is quite natural. It is only a  pity that the collapse of Russian science can come before  enterprises make the demand for basic and applied scientific  research. This circumstance should be created by state bodies.  Weaknesses have the habit of accumulating more rapidly than  advantages. Therefore, shortcomings of the imitative strategy  can have a serious effect on the future competitiveness of the  Russian industry.    The shortage of financial resources, which holds back the  implementation of innovations, is aggravated by the emerging  distancing of Russian banks from industry (distancing, we will  note, also quite natural under conditions of our inflationary  transitional economy). This is expressed in the fact that  commercial banks primarily credit intermediate trade, not  industrial, enterprises and are extremely reluctant to give  long-term credit for industrial investment projects, in  particular those connected with innovations.

Enterprises   48          46               56        28        52  that did not  try to receive  any innovation  credit   The sum of numbers in individual columns in lines 1.1 and 1.2 is bigger  than that of the numbers in corresponding columns in line 1 and the sum  of numbers in individual columns in lines 2.1 and 2.2 is bigger than that  of the numbers in corresponding columns in line 2, since some enterprises  noted the receipt or nonreceipt of both types of credit.      As can be seen from Table 8, during the solution of the  problem concerning the financing of innovations almost one-half  of Russian enterprises did not even try to receive a bank loan  and out of those that applied for bank services only a little  more than one-fourth attained success. Naturally, the demand for  goal-oriented state credits--at favorable rates--was higher than  for commercial credits at market interest rates. Accordingly,  enterprises, usually, were denied the first type of credit--the  ratio between those that received and did not receive a loan  among those that applied for state credit averaged 1:4 (from  1:11 in sector I to 1:1.5 in sector II) and among those that  applied for commercial credit, 1:2 (from 1:3 in sector I to 1:1  in sector II). Enterprises of sectors producing investment goods  were the main recipients of innovation credits (they accounted  for more than one-half of those that received loans of both  types), while enterprises of sectors producing intermediate and  consumer goods in the process of the financing of innovations  were "displaced" to a considerable extent from the credit  market, which is narrow as it is, and were forced to rely mainly  on themselves.</p>

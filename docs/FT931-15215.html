			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Heseltine clashes over French link A ROW over the practicality of scrapping arrangements which enable France to supply up to 6 per cent of electricity sold in England and Wales has broken out between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee. In a letter to Mr Caborn, a Labour MP, dated December 29, the trade and industry secretary played down the prospect of any such move, saying it 'may in the end offer no solutions'. Mr Heseltine said he had received legal advice that 'legislative measures to prevent trade in electricity from France to England would constitute a breach of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome'. He added: 'That being so, the measures could result in successful infraction proceedings against the government and in claims for damages by one or more injured party' for example, Electricite de France, the French state-owned utility, or electricity suppliers in the UK. Mr Heseltine said: 'As you will realise, this would be a serious matter and not one the government would wish to provoke.' He was 'still considering the overall question of whether it would be desirable for changes to be made to the existing arrangements as they affect trade in electricity across the interconnector'. In his response, dated January 6, Mr Caborn said evidence received by the cross-party committee did not correspond to the legal advice Mr Heseltine had received and that 'the legal situation appears less clear-cut than your letter suggests'. He said: 'Removing the non-leviable status of French electricity would presumably be a matter for the UK, and would not come under the heading of 'restricting trade between Member States of the European Community'.' He added: 'Freedom to trade between member states must be reciprocal . . . as we understand it, there is no opportunity for UK generators to export to France or through France to other countries.'</p>

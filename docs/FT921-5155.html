			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Manila strikes deal with Westinghouse THE Philippine government and Westinghouse Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday reached an out-of-court settlement of a long-running suit alleging that the company bribed the late President Ferdinand Marcos to build a power station. The settlement, which also includes Burns &amp; Roe, a US consultant to Westinghouse, came the day before the case was due to be heard by a jury in a federal court in the state of New Jersey. A month ago Westinghouse failed in a federal court appeal to get the bribery and corruption charges against it dropped. Both sides yesterday claimed to be satisfied with the complex settlement to the deal, which involves Westinghouse giving Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.8m) in concessions to the Philippines government and the government giving Westinghouse Dollars 400m to upgrade the plant at the centre of the dispute. The case involves a contract to build a 620MW power station on the Philippines' Bataan peninsula, which was completed in 1986 but never used. The government and its National Power Corporation filed suit in the US in 1988 claiming the contract was won as a result of Dollars 17m in bribes paid to former President Marcos. Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, the Philippines has hired Westinghouse to rehabilitate the plant and operate it for 30 years. The company will get an annual fee of Dollars 40m and the Philippines government will provide Dollars 400m for the upgrade, to be borrowed from the US Export-Import bank. Westinghouse will net some Dollars 300m after providing the Philippines with around Dollars 100m in cash and discounts. Mr David Boies, lead counsel for Westinghouse, said it was a 'win win situation. The Philippines is getting a good plant and electricity and Westinghouse is getting the opportunity to see it operate'. Some technical parts of the case were also being heard by the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva which issued a preliminary finding in December that there was no evidence bribes were paid to win the contract.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Observer: Munk's new habit US interior secretary Bruce Babbitt should know better than to shoot his mouth off in front of American Barrick's Peter Munk - a Canadian entrepreneur acquiring a reputation as someone who sues foreign governments and wins. Babbitt was mighty rude about him last week. It all started after Munk's lawyers forced Babbitt's department to hand over the deeds to Nevada's Goldstrike mine, which sits on America's largest gold deposit. Babbitt described it as the 'biggest gold heist since the days of Butch Cassidy' and had a mock cheque for Dollars 10bn made out to the company and signed by the American people. Munk admits that the 1872 mining law, which enabled his firm to mine gold without paying government royalties, is outdated. But he played by the rule book and when Babbitt tried to block him, Munk took him to court and won. Describing the deal as a 'Dollars 10bn rip-off' is 'emotional nonsense', says Munk. Even if his firm earns Dollars 10bn in revenues over the next 20 years, Babbitt forgets that Dollars 6bn will be paid to Munk's US workforce, and another Dollars 1bn has gone on equipment. And then there will be the taxes on any profits. A big fan of the legal process, Munk spent 15 years chasing the Egyptian government for Dollars 17.5m after it let him down on a long forgotten hotel project. But even he is unlikely to sue for defamation. He's got what he wanted. Moreover, Lloyd Cutler, who helped win his case, then answered the call to become White House special counsel and is thus busy with President Clinton's much more complicated legal affairs.</p>

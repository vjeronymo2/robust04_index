			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Extension of loan regulation urged: OFT backs move on credit to small businesses LENDING to small businesses by banks and other financial services companies should be licensed under the Consumer Credit Act, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. The aim was to ensure that such lending was done fairly. Sir Bryan said there was a case for extending to small incorporated businesses the level of statutory protection for loans of up to Pounds 15,000 now given to individual borrowers under the 1974 act. However, Sir Bryan rejected proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry to impose further restrictions on credit marketing and said he believed regulation under the 1974 act should be simplified. Disclosing the initial results of an OFT review, Sir Bryan said he favoured amendments to non-statutory rules to ensure that consumers were protected from unscrupulous traders. He said the Banking Code of Practice, which is being reviewed by a committee of the British Bankers' Association, should include a 'best advice' provision to ensure that customers were advised correctly on the choice between deposit accounts and insurance-based products. The code should also require banks and building societies to give fair advice when counselling customers on choosing a repayment mortgage or an endowment mortgage on which the organisation stood to gain an insurance commission. Sir Bryan, speaking to a Building Societies Association conference in Brighton, said most of the government's proposals made in December 1990 to extend restrictions on credit marketing should 'not be taken forward'. There was 'significant scope for deregulation' by simplifying provisions of the act, he said. This would then enhance the credit licensing system as a tool to ensure high standards. Sir Bryan said after his speech that he believed there was little logic in loans of up to Pounds 15,000 to unincorporated small businesses being subject to the act while similar loans to incorporated companies were not regulated. He believed many such businesses would benefit from the act because they were relatively unsophisticated. 'Many of them are just a man or a woman running a shop who were not expert in the ways of credit,' he said. The act restricts the terms under which personal loans and overdrafts can be advertised. It also requires lenders to provide information on the annual percentage charge (APR) for loans. Sir Bryan faced criticism from the head of the largest independent financial adviser in the country over his recent report suggesting that the non-disclosure of commissions attached to life insurance products restricts competition. Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, told the conference that proposals for independent financial advisers could 'lead to the virtual disappearance' of such advice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit  Bulgaria, something that I have wanted to do for a long time,  said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah Alatas upon his  arrival. During his meetings in Sofia he will mainly discuss  issues connected with developing economic contacts, because no  controversial problems exist in political relations between  Bulgaria and Indonesia.</p>

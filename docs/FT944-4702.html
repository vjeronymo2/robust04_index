			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / RJB plans offer close to price at suspension RJB Mining, the coal company making a controversial bid for British Coal's English assets, is telling institutional investors it is likely to offer equity to finance the deal at a price only marginally below the level at which existing shares were suspended. Institutional investors have been told to expect the Pounds 400m of shares being sold to be offered at around 340p each. This compares with the 348p suspension price of shares in the existing RJB business. The narrow discount has surprised analysts who had expected a significant gap between the offer price and suspension price because of the controversy surrounding the bid. Some analysts expect the offer price to fall, widening the gap. With up to six days to go before the price is fixed, RJB and its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, are facing a mixed reaction from existing shareholders. One large investor says it plans to take up no new shares. 'RJB's projections will not be wildly out,' he said. 'However, we do not think the shares will jump to a big premium.' But at least two large shareholders said yesterday they would subscribe for more than Pounds 20m each of shares. 'We are aware of the risks after 1998 but we think they are being discounted in the price,' said one. The price will depend on market conditions but BZW appears to have decided a large discount on the suspension price would risk alienating existing investors without providing a significant advantage in selling the shares. RJB aims to raise Pounds 400m through equity. Assuming a 340p offer price, this implies the issue of 120m shares, including 2m free for employees, compared with 45m in issue. With RJB predicting after-tax profits of Pounds 75m next year from the British Coal assets and at least Pounds 10.5m expected from its existing business, the prospective price earnings ratio would be 6.5. Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal Investments, said yesterday there was a risk of the English coal industry being 'drained dry' because of the debt RJB was taking on to finance the bid. 'All the profits that the industry is capable of making may be needed to service the debt,' he said.</p>

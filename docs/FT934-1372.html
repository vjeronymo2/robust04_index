			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Fisons plans closures and job cuts to restore confidence Fisons, the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, is planning plant closures and large-scale redundancies in an attempt to restore confidence in the company after the dismissal last week of chief executive Mr Cedric Scroggs. A restructuring programme already expected to save Pounds 25m in the pharmaceuticals division is to be widened to include a review of the loss-making scientific instruments business. Mr Patrick Egan, chairman and acting chief executive, said yesterday: 'Some parts of it will be closed, some sold and some rationalised. Turnover will shrink but it should become profitable.' Three directors have been appointed to strengthen the board after Mr Scroggs' departure, while a finance director is likely to be named soon. The poor performance of the instruments division, which is expected to make a loss this year of Pounds 16m against a Pounds 12m profit in 1992, was cited by the company last week as the main reason for Mr Scroggs' departure. It also emerged at the weekend that the non-executive directors had considered forcing Mr Scroggs, who was promoted to chief executive in April 1992 after 13 years with the group, to resign on two previous occasions this year. As part of the restructuring, separate businesses manufacturing organic analysis equipment are likely to be merged while the loss-making surface science operation, which produces equipment for such areas as soil analysis, may be scaled back. Some of these plans are understood to have been in place before Mr Scroggs was sacked. His departure came amid controversy over Fisons' accounting practices in the pharmaceuticals division. These practices included boosting sales and profits by offering wholesale customers discounts to buy excess stock at the financial year-end. Gross profits on these sales were treated as net gains. Mr Egan said he was unaware of the practice, introduced in 1984, until early last year and was not told that the division was showing 70 per cent profits on discount sales. 'We didn't appreciate the size of the margins on discounting,' he said. Nevertheless, Mr Egan acknowledged that some directors had benefited from the discounting practice because it boosted the company's apparent profitability and the share price at a time when the board stood to gain from favourable share options. He claimed, however, that the manipulation, highlighted in yesterday's Sunday Times, was not designed specifically to produce windfalls for directors with sizeable options. Fisons, which had begun to wind down discounting last year, has now abandoned the practice. Mr Egan, meanwhile, confirmed that moves to oust the chief executive were discussed in May when the losses emerged in the instruments business. He said the plans were postponed on the advice of financial advisers SG Warburg, who were concerned at a possible management vacuum when Mr Roy Thomas, then finance director, announced plans to retire early. According to Mr Egan, in August SG Warburg again dissuaded him from sacking Mr Scroggs.</p>

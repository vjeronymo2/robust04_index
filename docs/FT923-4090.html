			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Democrats revive Iran-Contra affair THE Democratic party, seeking to fight fire with fire, yesterday urged closer scrutiny of President George Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, said on television there were questions about 'the completeness and accuracy' of Mr Bush's statements that, as vice-president, he was mostly unaware of the White House operation to sell arms to Iran and use the proceeds to assist the Nicaraguan Contras. Pre-trial court documents in the case of Mr Caspar Weinberger have suggested the former defence secretary and Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, believed Mr Bush was supportive of the clandestine scheme organised by Lt Col Oliver North. Mr Mitchell was picking up on Monday's counterattack by Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. Apparently frustrated by insistent questions about his avoidance of military service in the late 1960s, Mr Clinton suggested that the media devote comparable energies to exploring Mr Bush's role in the Iran-Contra scandal. Yesterday morning during campaigning in Connecticut Mr Clinton tried to return to what he considers to be his strongest electoral suit - the parlous state of the economy and the need to create new jobs in manufacturing. Like Mr Bush, he claimed to be the real reincarnation of President Harry Truman, who has become the icon for both sides in this campaign. But the Bush campaign, under the direction of Mr James Baker, is now more intent on questioning Mr Clinton's personal qualities, including his courage, than in offering specific economic policy remedies. On Monday the president indirectly contrasted his own military record with his opponent's lack of one. More pointedly, a small light aircraft flew over Clinton rallies, trailing a banner that read: 'No draft dodgers.' In a speech to ex-servicemen two weeks ago Mr Clinton tried to lay the draft bogey to rest. But it has been subsequently reported that a now dead uncle had tried to secure him an extra deferment in 1969. Mr Clinton initially denied all knowledge of this, but later admitted he had become aware of his uncle's efforts earlier this year. This has lent some fuel to the Republican effort to portray him as someone who shades the truth, and has induced the media to pick up the same cudgel. Mr Clinton responded on Monday by accusing reporters of engaging in 'a feeding frenzy about something that even if it's true doesn't amount to a hill of beans.' He then raised the Iran-Contra issue.</p>

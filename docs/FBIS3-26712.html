			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- In a circular issued  the other day, the State Education Commission [SEC] criticized  the breach of discipline by the Hengyang City Education  Commission, Shaoyang City, and other units, which have set up  schools, opened courses, and enrolled students without  authorization. The circular outlines its suggestions on  punishment.    The circular notes: The "commissioned college level medical  course" at the Hengyang City Medical Training Center was  approved in 1992 by the Henyang City Education Commission, which  overstepped its authority in granting the approval. With this  approval, the city Public Health Bureau has in the past two  years recruited 120 students in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and  other provinces. The students -- who were required to pay a  yearly tuition of 2,200 yuan, excluding living expenses -- were  promised a college level medical diploma from the Henyang Public  Health School. Most of the enrollees were students who had  failed to pass the college entrance examinations. Some of them  were senior high or middle school dropouts, and some were  workers. None of them were officially enrolled by the  Provincial Admissions Offices.    In September 1992, the training center rented some floor  space from the Zhongnan Engineering Institute. It also rented  two classrooms from the middle schools affiliated to the  engineering institute. They were used as classrooms and  dormitories for the "commissioned college level medical course."    The circular points out:    1. The operation of the "commissioned college level medical  course" was a serious violation of state policy and regulations.  The Hengyang City Education Commission, which did not refer  the application to higher competent authorities and overstepped  its authority in giving the approval, made a serious mistake of  violating the provision that "no unit or individual is allowed  to set up schools, enroll students, collect fees from them, or  issue diplomas without authorization."    2. The "training center's" objective in offering the course  was illegitimate. State laws clearly provide that  profit-making should not be the goal of schools run by  nongovernment sectors. By inaugurating the course, a commercial  vehicle for making a profit, the training center diverted from  the legitimate goals of school operations.    3. As a secondary vocational school, the Hengyang Public  Health School has committed a serious violation by, without  first obtaining approval from the state, accepting the  assignment of the "commissioned college level medical course"  and giving college level instructions.    The incident also uncovers problems with regard to  implementation of state policy and school administration at the  Zhongnan Engineering Institute. To increase revenue, the  institute -- in violation of state regulations -- supported the  "commissioned college level medical course" sponsored by the  city public health bureau. Leasing out floor space made  conditions at the once relatively commodious institute rather  cramped, creating confusion in campus administration. Moreover,  the institute also violated state regulations by turning its  evening school into a full-time school.    The circular criticizes the aforementioned units for their  violations. In the circular, the SEC requested the Hunan  Provincial Education Commission and the Henyang City People's  Government to investigate the responsibility of -- and severely  punish -- officials of the Henyang City Education Commission for  giving the go-ahead to the "commissioned college level medical  course" in violation of state regulations as well as those  involved in illegally conducting the courses and enrolling  students. The SEC instructed the Henyang City Education  Commission, Public Health Bureau, and other units involved to  abolish the "commissioned college level medical course" and  properly deal with problems arising from the incident.    The "Letter on Suggestions for Dealing With the `Shaoyang  Institute of Village and Town Enterprises in Hunan Province,'"  which was reissued by the SEC, notes that in July 1992 the  Shaoyang city people's government, in Hunan Province, approved  without authorization the establishment of the "Shaoyang  Institute of Village and Town Enterprises in Hunan Province" and  took it upon itself to register applicants, compile  examinations, administer tests, and enroll students. It  admitted 106 students in 1992 and 141 in 1993. The Hunan  provincial people's government took the matter seriously and  instructed the provincial education commission to investigate.  After a thorough investigation, the provincial education  commission took a firm step to redress Shaoyang city's blunder  by abolishing the institute.    The SEC pointed out: Higher education has developed rapidly  in China over the years. Infractions of discipline and  transgressions of authority, however, have been reported  frequently in regard to the establishment, name changes, and  enrollment of institutes of higher learning. Driven by the  profit motive, some units, schools, or individuals are taking  advantage of people's admirable desire to obtain a higher  education -- in violation of specific prohibitions and repeated  injunctions and in undermining state plans -- by offering  college-level courses and recruiting at will students who have  failed to pass college entrance examinations, youths awaiting  job assignments, and currently employed workers from society at  large. Some of these educational establishments do not have any  facilities or teaching staff of their own. They hold courses by  renting primary or middle school classrooms or floor space from  factories or hotels and by scraping together a teaching staff.  Even though some courses are given at secondary or other  schools, these schools lack the facilities, teaching staff, and  administrative support needed to carry out higher education.    The circular notes: The frequent recurrence of incidents  involving illegal student enrollments, illegal courses, and  illegal diplomas can be attributed to the leaderships of a few  localities' departments who either did not understand the  gravity and the possible serious consequences of their actions,  or who have failed to implement the relevant state policy or  have even connived at or supported such actions.    The circular points out: Enrollment in 1994 at institutes of  higher learning will start soon. It is hoped that localities  and departments will, while further emancipating their minds and  accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, step up the  macroadministration of higher education, strictly observe state  laws and regulations, thoroughly investigate any incident  involving illegal schools, enrollment, or diplomas in their  respective jurisdictions, and consolidate order in educational  circles. Where severity justifies it, the unit or individual  involved shall be criticized by circulating a notice or shall be  given the pertinent administrative punishments. The individuals  involved shall be called to account for any serious consequences  arising therefrom.</p>

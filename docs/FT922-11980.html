			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge slides to Dollars 76.9m PHELPS DODGE, the largest US copper producer, saw operating income for its mining operations drop in the first quarter to Dollars 76.9m from Dollars 113m a year ago, Reuter reports. The group, which manufactures truck wheels and rims and is a leading producer of carbon black, reported first-quarter net income down to Dollars 53.6m or Dollars 1.53 per share, compared with Dollars 77.3m or Dollars 2.23 a year ago. It said first-quarter earnings were satisfactory in spite of continued slow economies in many of its markets. Group revenues for the quarter declined to Dollars 590.5m from Dollars 601.8m, while Phelps Dodge Mining saw its revenues slip to Dollars 301.5m, against Dollars 314m a year ago. Phelps cited lower copper prices and the closure of concentrator operations at its Tyrone, New Mexico mine for the reduction in mining profits.</p>

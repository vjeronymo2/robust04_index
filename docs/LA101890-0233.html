			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMERICA SALARIES: WHAT PROMISED TO GO UP IS COMING DOWN  </P> <P> Some FundAmerica Inc. watchers have wondered why Mitchell Blumberg --  successful Texas developer and Harvard Business School graduate -- agreed to  run the financially troubled company starting late this summer.  </P> <P> Documents filed in federal bankruptcy court here this week contain a clue --  money.  </P> <P> Blumberg signed an employment contract in August with the Irvine company to  earn $20,833 a month -- about $250,000 a year. Should FundAmerica emerge from  bankruptcy, Blumberg gets a $500,000 bonus and begins earning a 1% commission  on gross sales.  </P> <P> He may even get an 8% stake in FundAmerica if everything goes according to  plan.  </P> <P> "Is the compensation consistent with the challenge of this company? It's not  nearly enough," Blumberg said Wednesday.  </P> <P> FundAmerica has been charged in Florida with criminal offenses related to  running a pyramid scheme and its founder, Robert T. Edwards, was arrested. The  company and Edwards deny the charges. Blumberg joined the company a few weeks  after Edwards' arrest.  </P> <P> FundAmerica, which maintains it is a legitimate multilevel marketing company,  is currently prohibited from recruiting members. The company filed for Chapter  11 bankruptcy protection from creditors two months ago.  </P> <P> Blumberg isn't the only new FundAmerica executive promised good pay and a  possible bonus.  </P> <P> FundAmerica Chairman Peter Bradshaw is supposed to earn $16,667 a month and  receive a $400,000 bonus if the company gets back on its feet, according to his  employment contract. He could receive as much as a 5% stake in the company as  well.  </P> <P> Both men have contracts to serve on the company's board, which entitles them to  an additional $25,000 a year.  </P> <P> But so far, the employment contracts are worth about as much as the paper  they're written on.  </P> <P> The U.S. Trustee's office -- which must approve executive salaries for  companies in bankruptcy -- reduced the monthly take home pay to $11,000 for  Blumberg and $9,000 for Bradshaw. Worse yet, those salaries were only approved  for a five-week period that ended Sept. 21.  </P> <P> Neither Blumberg nor Bradshaw -- who refused to discuss his salary -- has  received a penny since.  </P> <P> "We certainly deserve every bit of compensation," Blumberg said.  </P></p>

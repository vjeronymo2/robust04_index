			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Fedorov, president of Chuvashia, by </F> ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentina Ivanova, place and date not  given: "Chuvashia Can Only Develop as a Part of Russia"]    [Text] Nikolay Fedorovich, 35-year-old former minister of  justice of Russia elected president of Chuvashia at the end of  December of last year, gives his first interview in his new  position.    [Ivanova] Nikolay Vasilyevich, now we have behind us the  fierce election campaign which crowned a two-year presidential  marathon in Chuvashia. Now you stand one on one facing the  urgent problems of the republic. On a purely human level, is it  not somewhat frightening to be taking on such an unbelievably  heavy load?    [Fedorov] Why talk about this now? The choice has been made.  By me--prior to entering the presidential marathon. And by the  people of the republic--on election day. The president must bear  this load proceeding from the fact that the stage of destruction  of Russia has long since "passed" historically and it is time to  shift over to construction. Secondly, we must not take more  people hostage to the political and personal confrontation  between these and those people. I have therefore accepted the  post of president of Chuvashia and am proposing accord and  professional compromise with all movements and social groups in  the name of the survival of society.    [Ivanova] In your view, where are the greatest "sore points"  in Chuvashia?    [Fedorov] There are very many of these, as there are  throughout Russia. Sociological surveys show, however, that  first place is occupied by the problem of crime and citizen  safety. Here fate itself commands me--as a legal specialist--to  get seriously and fundamentally involved in this business. It is  a universal problem which would seem to be outside the realm of  economics, but it is precisely here where matters involving  corruption and the intricate processes of privatization, for  example, come together, and everywhere we must see to it that  the law and strict compliance with it stand paramount.    We will fight especially hard for the interests of our  land's  (both Russia and Chuvashia) commodity producers as they face  foreign competitors. Chuvashia has traditionally been considered  an agrarian republic, but in recent decades we have developed a  powerful industry capable of competing on the world market in a  number of items. We simply have to assist it appropriately by  adjusting federal government policy through our initiatives.    Can it be considered normal, for example, that the  Cheboksary  Industrial Tractor Plant, built some time ago by the entire  country, is almost idle due to problems with the marketing of  the powerful steel machines, while Russia purchases American  tractors, exporting Russian raw materials and obtaining credits  from the West? I see my own responsibility in safeguarding from  destruction the Cheboksary Tractor Plant, and the chemical  sector, and the enterprises of instrument manufacture,  electrical engineering, and machine building. This is task  number one--and not just for the industry of Chuvashia itself.  Protecting the competitiveness of the economy is extremely  important for Russia's tomorrow as well, for its might and  dignity as a great power.    Our plans call for attracting into the Chuvash  economy--primarily into its agrarian sector--both Russian and  foreign investments, in order to create joint enterprises with  competitive technologies which yield swift returns in storing  and processing agricultural output, more than half of which is  presently being lost. One of the programs coming soon which will  help the republic better carry out economic reform and enter the  market more quickly is the beginning of construction, jointly  with federal organs, of a modern road system and telephone  network in the republic. The accomplishment of these tasks will  also help us maintain job positions, push unemployment into the  background, and hold on to individuals with unique specialties.    One additional "categorical imperative" for me is the  protection of buildings and culture. We will put our material  resources, minimal at present, primarily into the spiritual  sphere, into education. And we will pursue this course even at  the expense of certain tasks of the moment. I am convinced that  these expenditures will tomorrow pay us back a hundredfold.    [Ivanova] But is the president able to handle all this?  After  all, he must act under conditions of a complex system of  separation of powers, being guided by the Constitution of  Chuvashia and the Russian Constitution.    [Fedorov] We will be able to resolve a great many problems  if  it is not the president governing what we do, but the law. Much  depends also on the ability of politicians to view history in  perspective, to reach agreement with their partners and avoid  turning personal problems into political ones.    [Ivanova] Nikolay Vasilyevich, I cannot help but ask a  question which was posed to you at meetings with voters during  the presidential elections: Will the fact that you voluntarily  resigned the post of minister of justice of Russia and seem to  have come into conflict with the Russian president not have a  negative effect on the Russian attitude towards the republic?    [Fedorov] My departure was a protest against illegal methods  being used in the resolution of many state issues. And of  course, this did not come easy for me. After all, I was  completely preoccupied with the reforms, being the most "senior"  in tenure, appointed four times in a row as minister of the  Russian Government. What can you do? This kind of thing happens  in politics too--Boris Nikolayevich and I split over what was  permissible in politics and what was not. He and I have always  had a frank and equal relationship on the purely human level,  and it remains so today. Herein lies the value and worth of our  mutual relations.    Something else says a great deal, I believe--the fact that  he  sent me a kind telegram, congratulating me upon having been  elected the first president of Chuvashia and expressing the  expectation of "constructive work together." So we should not be  talking about any confrontation here. And with regard to  questions of economic reform, and of strengthening the  constitutional system and genuine federation in Russia, Boris  Nikolayevich has my steadfast support.    [Ivanova] In other words, Chuvashia continues to be an  entity  of the Federation and has no intention of separating in any way?    [Fedorov] There can be no discussion in this regard. He who  fights for separation will not resolve a single problem for his  people, and will create thousands of new explosive problems  instead. We must not turn national into nationalistic. I myself  was born in a large Chuvash family and I proudly relate to this  everywhere I go. We will continue to support national pride and  dignity, continue to develop the culture and traditions of the  Chuvash people. But in doing so we will not permit people of  other nationalities to feel uncomfortable--this too is the  political, legal, and moral responsibility of the president.    Chuvashia has a fine national custom: nime (mutual  assistance, mutual support). We would like to revive and protect  this custom. But I am confident we can only do so along the path  of accord. I am convinced that Chuvashia can develop, can truly  prosper, only if it is a part of Russia. Just as Russia remains  strong by virtue of the power of republics, krays, and oblasts  that comprise it, through the unity of their diversity.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Protest at London NHS plan NO HOSPITAL closures should take place in London until alternative services are available as part of a planned programme of change, the Association of London Authorities says today. The Labour-controlled association has told Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, in its response to the Tomlinson report on London health care that the study does not provide a sufficient basis for closing hospitals or reducing medical teaching. It says London has a range of particular health needs, including high accident and mortality rates, high levels of mental illness and a lack of local clinics and small hospitals. The report recommends reducing the number of hospital beds in the capital and transferring resources to family doctor and community services. The association says, difficulties facing general practitioners in the capital - with almost half in poor premises and 40 per cent working alone - are among the particular problems that need to be addressed before closing hospitals. The association also urges a single regional authority to plan services in the capital. Ministers are due to decide on the Tomlinson report, which contains controversial proposals including the closure of St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, next month.</p>

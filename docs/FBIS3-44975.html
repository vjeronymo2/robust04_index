We will be facing very  arduous tasks in our way to reform and development. To unite  and lead the broad masses of people toward this end, our leading  cadres at all levels must cultivate a new spirit and a new work  style.    Comrade Jiang Zemin recently repeatedly emphasized: "I hope  everybody can spare a little more time for studying, reduce  social appointments, conduct more investigations and studies to  avoid subjectivism, and do more practical work while refraining  from uttering empty words." This is the good style that we  should vigorously promote in the new year.    Constantly enriching one's knowledge and ability, studying  more, doing more investigations and studies, and doing more  practical work, all these aspects are linked to each other, and  none of them is dispensable. Of them the first task is to  study. Through studying we can constantly obtain new knowledge,  increase our ability, enhance our ideological and political  understanding as well as professional competence, and do  practical work in a better and more effective manner.    Nowadays, most leading cadres are aware of the importance of  studying and they always keep an eye on it. However, still  there are some comrades who do not attach enough importance to  study--they either spend much time on processing documents and  attending meetings, or indulge themselves in all kinds of social  life. They are busy in welcoming visiting guests and seeing  them off, accompanying visitors to banquets and on tours. They  are present on every occasion and meeting, accompanying and  seeing off visiting superiors, foreign guests, visitors from  other parts of the country and from other related organizations.  They believe missing any such single occasion will imply "a  lack of politeness." Perhaps you may expect that people are  less fussy when dealing with those within their own areas and  systems? But you will soon find that you are wrong. Unit A may  invite you to deliver a speech at a gathering to celebrate the  successful completion of some project, and you will have to go;  unit B may invite you to attend and address an anniversary  party, and you cannot turn it down; unit C may request that you  preside over a foundation stone laying ceremony, and you cannot  but accept it; unit D may invite you to cut the ribbon at an  inaugural ceremony, and still you will have to attend it...  anyone whose invitation is turned down by you will complain that  you "are ignoring" them. So, you are busy with social  appointments all day long and you can hardly concentrate on work  and study. For a few comrades, although they appear to be  complaining about the loss of too much time on boring social  functions, they actually are very fond of these activities.  Still worse is that they may expect others to entertain them in  such a fussy manner when they visit other organizations and, in  particular, their subordinate organs, otherwise they will be  very unhappy or will go off in a huff. Thus, a "social life  circle" is formed where everybody tries to please each other by  inviting each other to or attending social functions. So  everybody has to spend time and energy on arranging excessive  social life. Many people may even have to rack their brains to  work out the arrangement of seats around the dining table. This  is not only a great waste but also a silly practice.    Nowadays as the closed and rigid old structure has been  broken in the wake of reform and opening-up, every locality,  department, and organization has established many more external  ties, and the sense of public relations has been greatly  enhanced among people. So some social appointments are  inevitable, some even have become an integral part of work. The  point is that these activities must be arranged in an  appropriate and efficient way. Principal leading cadres, in  particular, should try their best to minimize social  appointments, or to authorize someone else to attend to such  social functions on behalf of them. They should learn to  emancipate themselves from excessive social functions and  trivial formalities, so they can devote more time to reading  books and acquiring more new knowledge.    What is to be studied? For the moment, we must first  conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping and thus further prepare ourselves with Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. This is the basis on which we rely for keeping  a firm stand, distinguishing right from wrong, blazing new  trails, and establishing ourselves in an unassailable position.  Under the guidance of this theory, we must bear in mind the  party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and study  and implement well the party's major guiding principles and  policies. For the time being, we must particularly devote more  time to studying and implementing the decision adopted by the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, read  more books on basic theories of the market economy, and thus  make contributions to the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure. "Knowledge is power." Therefore, apart  from studying theories and policies, our leading cadres must  also work hard to acquire knowledge of modern economy, science  and technology, law, sociology, and other related fields.    Some comrades think studying is not so important to them  since they have received formal education, and they believe  their knowledge and professional standards are high enough. To  be sure, since we have been applying the principle of "four  transformations" to employment of cadres over the past 10 years  or more, most leading cadres selected and promoted from all  levels nowadays are of higher academic qualifications and higher  professional standards. However, appointment can only vest an  individual with power and duties but will not automatically  increase his knowledge and ability. The appointed person's  special qualifications may not necessarily suit the needs of his  present post, and the knowledge he obtained in the past may not  necessarily apply to the present and future circumstances. We  are now in an era of "knowledge explosion." We will be able to  keep up with the times and constantly improve our leadership  standards only if we keep on studying hard, seeking new  knowledge, and improving ourselves.    Of course, learning does not mean learning only from books  but also from practice, and from the masses and other comrades  as well. So long as our leading comrades at all levels keep a  high sense of study, make the best use of their time to study,  and keep the whole leading bodies study very hard, then it will  be very hopeful for us to further improve our work and open up a  new prospect.</p>

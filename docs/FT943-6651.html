			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: Analysts fix their gaze on the horizon - London The London market rallied strongly last week with the FT-SE 100 index moving decisively through the 3,200 level helped by positive domestic corporate news and a strong US market. In recent weeks, the index has frequently stumbled on the threshold of 3,200, but on Wednesday the FT-SE 100 climbed 30 points to close at 3,205 - the first time it has closed above 3,200 since March 22. Further advances on Thursday and Friday took the FT-SE 100 index to 3,265 by the close yesterday, up 74 points on the week and 389 points above the late June low. A surge of retail buying interest on Wednesday pushed turnover up to Pounds 1.68bn that day while turnover on Thursday reached 843.5m shares, the heaviest volume for several months. With the September reporting season imminent, the summer rally has been encouraged by a growing feeling that investors are focusing more clearly on the strong rise in corporate earnings and dividends which is already evident. Forty-three companies - 27 of them industrials - with market capitalisations of more than Pounds 200m and, for the most part, December year ends, have already reported their interim results and are mostly coming in on target according to S G Warburg. S G Warburg analysts forecast underlying earnings would be 24 per cent ahead. They have shown gains of 28 per cent. Dividend increases have been two percentage points ahead of forecasts at 12 per cent. Among the companies reporting, only those in the financial sector came in slightly ahead of expectations. The 27 industrial companies are precisely on target showing 18 per cent gains with dividends 8 per cent higher compared with a forecast 7 per cent. After this first tranche of interim results, analysts have been updating their forecasts. Warburg analysts have lifted their 1994 forecasts for earnings-per-share growth at the industrials which have reported so far, from 15 per cent to 15.2 per cent and from 11 per cent to 11.2 per cent for 1995. For the broader results group, Warburg raised its EPS growth forecast for the current year from 15.6 per cent to 22.7 per cent, but the 1995 forecast has been downgraded from 18 per cent to 10.5 per cent. But how significant are profit forecast upgrades and downgrades anyway? Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull set out to analyse whether changes in consensus forecasts for earnings per share growth have been reflected in sector performance. The results (see chart) show that the pattern of earnings per share changes fall into two broad camps. Sectors which have seen an upgrade in their forecast earnings growth rates tend to be in cyclical areas such as the engineering, printing, paper and packaging and chemical sectors. However the majority of sectors have actually seen a moderation of their forecast rate of earnings growth since April 1992. There have been only modest reductions in the growth rate of the consumer shares including wines and spirits, brewers, health and household, healthcare and the pharmaceutical stocks. More significant downgrades have affected the service areas including food retailers, general retailers, leisure and tobacco. As might be expected, those sectors which have been downgraded most sharply have also been among the poorest performers in the market, but there are exceptions, for example the engineering vehicles sector. 'While the relationship between long term revisions and relative price performance may not be overwhelming, change in forecast EPS growth is likely to be an important influence on sector performance,' says Strauss Turnbull. Of course there are many other factors influencing short term performance, and this was illustrated this week. On Monday, Service Corporation International of the US, announced that it had more than doubled its 'strategic' stake in Plantsbrook, Britain's second largest funeral business to 8.4 per cent. SCI's move follows its successful hostile takeover of Great Southern Group. Plantsbrook's shares closed 9p higher on the week at 172p compared with 100p before SCI's initial expression of interest two weeks ago. On Tuesday Thorn-EMI disappointed the market by ruling out an early demerger of its music and rentals group. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, speaking as the group announced an 18 per cent decline in first quarter pre-tax profits reflecting exceptional charges, said he did not expect the board to look at demerger proposals again for three years. The shares closed the week 21.5p lower at 1041p. The same day disappointing results from NFC, coupled with the surprise resignation of Peter Sherlock, the group's chief executive, sent the shares tumbling. The shares closed the week 23p lower at 179p. On Wednesday, the regional electricity company shares rose sharply again after Seeboard became the first since the recent regulatory review to buy back its own shares. Seeboard, which closed the week 20p higher at 448p, purchased 2m shares at 425p. All 12 RECs have approval from shareholders for share buy-backs. WH Smith, the high street retailer, reported a rise in underlying pre-tax profits of 13 per cent to Pounds 124.8m, in line with expectations. The shares gained 30p on the week to 509p. On Thursday Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering group, announced the acquisition of EnviroTech Pumpsystems, a specialist US pump manufacturer, for Dollars 210m (Pounds 135m). The deal will be part funded by a one-for-four rights issue at 252p to raise Pounds 96m. The shares closed the week down 10p at 303p.</p>

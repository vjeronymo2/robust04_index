			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (8): Top crime-fighter's new approach MR MIKHAIL GURTOVOI, who is in charge of fighting state corruption and financial fiddles, is refreshingly above suspicion, writes Leyla Boulton. But this former journalist for Moscow News, who used to expose corruption scandals on paper, sometimes feels that despite the trappings of power, he is fighting a losing battle. Appointed in January as Mr Yegor Gaidar's adviser on dealing with one of the scourges of Russian life, Mr Gurtovoi says he has changed his mind about how to deal with the problem. Rather than perfecting Russia's legislation and law enforcement, he now believes it is essential to catch as many crooks as possible - 'like plugging holes in a ship so it does not sink' - while providing officials with incentives not to steal. Since he and his team - which include top investigators from the Soviet anti-mafia days - moved into offices in the former Gosplan headquarters in Moscow, they have been able to stop a few cases of embezzlement, as well as a big financial swindle involving the laundering of illegally-earned funds. But another headache, apart from the extent of the corruption, is inertia in the rest of the system. After he reversed an attempt by Mr Leonid Zapalsky, a former deputy economics minister, to give out valuable oil export licences to a charity while he was supposed to be winding up the economics ministry, the case has not been pursued by the state prosecutor. Part of the problem, he says, is that a lot of the corruption is tied to the system of patronage under which the previous generation of Russian politicians relied on new entrepreneurs for financial support to defeat the old Communists - 'for the mafia, supporting upcoming politicians was like putting money on horses.' He says that while President Yeltsin had enough popular support to get elected without paying bribes, the same is not the case for all those in power before the Russian leader appointed a new cabinet of economic reformers. Since a lot of the cases of big-time corruption involve getting money from foreigners, he would also like to hear from foreign businessmen who have specific cases to complain about. Is this naive behaviour, ask the cynics. Maybe, but it is Russia's only chance to maintain some credibility now that market reforms under way have finally begun removing some of the justification for cheating in the past. Mikhail Gurtovoi's address: 6, Okhotny Ryad, Moscow.</p>

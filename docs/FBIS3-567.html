			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kirundi </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We earlier informed you that in Ngozi, Tangara  commune, the peace had been disturbed. The governor of the  province, Joseph Ntakirutimana, informed us about the events and  told us that 32 people had died. They have organized urgent  meetings to find ways to return the peace as soon as possible.  Mr Ntakirutimana tells us what they have achieved so far.    [Begin recording] [Ntakirutimana] [passage omitted] We have  noted the names of the suspects and found that the names of the  killers were included. We brought 39 children to the Ngozi  provincial headquarters. What I can add is that we are able to  tell you the number of those killed -- only 32 deaths.    [Unidentified correspondent] What is the security situation  following the arrests in Musenyi?    [Ntakirutimana] The security is good as security personnel  in  the communes are keeping things calm. I would like to ask  everyone in Ngozi Province to carry out their duties as normal  and keep away from the people who are misleading them. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

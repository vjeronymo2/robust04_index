			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. de V.: "De Beers, the Untouchable"] </F>   [Text] Founded more than a century ago, this conglomerate  with a world monopoly on the diamond trade remains faithful to  itself: secretive, hegemonic, paternalistic, and sure of its  future...    "I know from experience that the only possible way to  safeguard the stability of the sector is by limiting the supply  of diamonds and selling through a single distribution network,"  Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of de Beers at the turn of the  century, used to say. Faithful to itself, and faithful to this  principle, the conglomerate founded in 1888 by Cecil  Rhodes--creator of Rhodesia, obsessed by Great Britain's  expansion into Africa--owns half the world's production of uncut  diamonds and markets 80 percent.    Since 1931, diamonds have escaped the almost constant  erosion  of prices of other raw materials. A miraculous survivor among  luxury products, this "king of gems" and "teardrop of the gods"  is still in insolently good health; and de Beers, a fairly  accurate gauge of the industry's condition since it holds the  monopoly on diamonds, is in equally excellent shape: The group's  turnover for 1993 was $4.444 billion, compared to $3.640 the  preceding year. In this recessionary period, it is probably the  only one to have recorded "record sales," and it displays a  serenity and faith in its own future that would be the envy of  many other companies.    Its assurance is expressed in more than mere words: de Beers  is making long-term investments, on several fronts, with  astonishing audacity: in the conquest of new markets--its budget  for this is almost unequalled anywhere--in consolidation--with  all its uncertainties!--in agreements with producer countries,  in exploring new deposits, and above all in constantly keeping  supply in balance with demand--even when stocks are  excessive...and cost is no object.    Zaire thinks it is independent enough to start selling  stones  directly to Israeli diamond cutters? Well, then, de Beers just  signs an exclusive contract with Israel and buys them up itself.  The guerrillas in Angola have decided to go into the diamond  business? It spends $400 million to block the deal. Russia  "forgets" the protocols it signed? It renegotiates, slowly but  surely convincing the backsliders--by what means?--to get back  in line, i.e., the de Beers line. In addition, it monitors and  controls the distribution system with such arrogant precision  that it sells to its clients "only as much as is likely to be  sold." It prefers to hoard all the rest, to make sure the  cutters do not warehouse too much merchandise.  <H5>  Hegemony </H5>   Does de Beers behave like a sovereign government? Is it  authoritarian, even hegemonic, behind its velvet facade?  Certainly. But one must admit it has succeeded where  international agreements and producer cartels have failed.  Secretive--it seems to keep key information under wraps as part  of its power strategy--and paternalistic, it is reaping the  fruits of its founders' vision.    What did Harry Oppenheimer, son of Ernest, say back in 1948?  "All workers should participate in the success of their business  and should benefit directly from its profits; apartheid, which  amounts to disguised slavery in the mines, can lead only to  impasse." And he supported the creation of miners' unions in the  sector. Because stable labor relations, as he saw it, were key  to steady production.    So de Beers today is cultivating "courteous" relations with  Mandela's entourage. In that regard, it is significant that the  former secretary general of the miners' union, Cyril Ramaphosa,  number-two man in the ANC, is the announced successor to Mandela.    This attractive blend of fine-tuned philanthropy and  judicious liberalism is characteristic of de Beers. Neither  Cecil Rhodes nor the Oppenheimer dynasty would take offense at  the charming words the company's current president has to say  about Mandela. Because the company has already taken appropriate  precautions to protect its wealth: In 1990, when the ANC  revealed its intent to nationalize South African companies, de  Beers immediately transferred its capital to Lucerne,  Switzerland.    In South Africa itself, nothing remains but the extraction  company (de Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd.). Whatever happens in  South African politics, Julian Ogilvie Thompson can still sleep  soundly on a pillow of diamonds.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Observer: Comfort stations Spare a thought for Sir Peter Harding, the marshal of the RAF and chief of defence staff. As if he did not have enough on his plate advising the Cabinet about sending troops to Bosnia, he also has to find cuts of Pounds 1bn a year in the Ministry of Defence's budget. His pinstriped troops have been forced to review everything from procurement costs down to the things that the military really care about, such as military bands, animals, and uniformed vets. However, Observer can report that one vital defence cut has been restored. When Air Chief Marshall Sir 'Sandy' Wilson takes over the RAF's new admin headquarters at Innsworth he'll find that the number of VIP toilets under his command is back to full strength. The MoD has shot down a report that a proposed library in the officers' mess at RAF Innsworth had been scrapped in favour of a powder room for the new commander's wife. The MoD admitted that the plans had been 'amended' to increase the number of VIP privies from one to two, but said that all its commands have two VIP toilets. There was also no question of the officers going without their reading matter for the convenience of the commander's wife. The new mess would still have a library. That's a relief.</p>

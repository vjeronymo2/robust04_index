Discua Elvir said the term voluntary can only be used to refer  to going to the movies. The military commander also talked about  the Armed Forces' ability to assist the public prosecutor in  locating missing people. [passage indistinct]    Referring to the Armed Forces' budget, he noted it had been  significantly reduced and now amounts to approximately $33  million. Asked about Honduran Ondina Cea, who fled Iran because  her father-in-law kept her in captivity, and the possibility of  Iranian terrorists in Honduras, the officer said he did not have  information on these matters.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Today, the  Honduran's lawyer [words indistinct] charged there could be  Iranian terrorists here.    [Discua] Yes, as I have already told you, I do not have any  information on this. You have caught me a bit off guard. I did  not get any information on this when I arrived. We will take the  necessary measures once we have the appropriate information.  [end recording]</p>

Honma, at his first court hearing, said he neither was  offered the 20 million yen from Taisei last year, nor received  any money.    Prosecutors said Honma, 53, took the cash in late January in  exchange for giving Japan's second biggest contractor the tender  for a cancer center worth billions of yen. They said the money  also was intended as a sweetener for future public works in  Miyagi, about 340 kilometers northwest of Tokyo.    Mitsuo Moriya, 65, a Honma aide charged with playing an  intermediary role, admitted receiving the money but denied it  was a bribe for Honma. Moriya was a senior member of the  Liberal Democratic Party's Miyagi chapter.    Three former Taisei executives who were also indicted said  in  the hearing that they gave the 20 million yen to Honma to help  him win reelection. They also said that they implicitly  expected him to act in favor of the company in awarding  contracts for public works projects.    The three executives are former Vice President Takashi  Hashimoto, 57, Koji Amada, 53, former head of the firm's Tohoku  branch and his predecessor Takaaki Wada, 57.    Their attorney asked the court for leniency, saying his  clients would not contest the charges.    Honma was arrested in September along with Moriya, Wada and  Amada. Hashimoto was arrested later.    Honma stepped down in October, half way through his  four-year  second term. He has been held at Tokyo detention house.    The former Miyagi governor also has been charged with  pocketing 100 million yen in bribes from disgraced business  tycoon Ryoei Saito, 77, former honorary chairman of Daishowa  Paper Mfg. Co.    On this occasion, Moriya apparently acted as intermediary  for  Honma in channeling the bribe. Daishowa, which also has  interests in a golf course and housing projects in Miyagi, was  implicated in December 1991.    Two governors and two mayors stand trial in a series of  bribery scandals centering on eight of the country's leading  construction companies.    In mid-January, prosecutors arrested two executives of  another contractor, Obayashi Corp., on suspicion of bribery.  That brings the number of construction officials implicated in  the scandal since June to more than 20.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Old guard hangs on: Political infighting in Taiwan Taiwan's Kuomintang, the ruling nationalist party, has overseen the island's extraordinary economic development since it was driven out of China by the Communists in 1949. But internal disputes are threatening to tear it apart and end its dominance. President Lee Teng-hui, addressing the party's 14th congress this week, acknowledged that the party was plagued by factional struggles. 'Implementing internal reform (of the party) is more difficult than tackling external challenges,' he said. The pressures on the KMT are similar to those faced by a number of long-standing ruling parties in Asian countries, where rapidly growing prosperity has fostered pluralism, democratisation, and a distaste for corruption. In Japan, disillusionment with the Liberal Democratic party, especially over corruption in high places, has just ended its long hold on power. In South Korea, President Kim Young-sam, the opposition campaigner who became the candidate of the ruling conservative party, has launched a crackdown on bureaucratic corruption. Even in China, the communist government has found it necessary to take a stern line on official malpractice, which has mushroomed in the current economic boom. 'A lot of the old ruling parties are going to have to come to terms with the corruption that they tolerated and indeed benefited from,' says Mr Peter Ferdinand, director of the Asia programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. In Taiwan, there is an additional element in domestic political struggles: the relationship with mainland China. The opposition Democratic Progressive party has called for a formal declaration of independence from China. The KMT is officially against this, although factions within it differ on how strongly to oppose such a move. All are conscious that Beijing, for which the top long-term foreign policy goal is reabsorption of Taiwan, would view with great concern any shift which looked likely to lead to a formal declaration of independence. Last week, six members of the Yuan, Taiwan's legislature, broke away to establish the New party, attacking the KMT's corruption. One of them, Mr Lee Ching-hwa, son of a reformer prime minister, said: 'The old KMT is going in the direction of money politics, dictatorial policies and Taiwan independence, while the New party is opposed to all of these.' This week's congress has shown that their departure has not ended internal dissidence. President Lee had to give way to rebels yesterday and make concessions on the election of party vice-chairmen. They are likely to be leaders of the faction harking back to the KMT's mainland origins, whose influence he has been seeking to reduce. The arguments within the party have been growing for decades. Until recent years, the KMT's right to hold power and its methods were unquestioned. Its leader, Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan with 2m soldiers, bureaucrats and others in 1949, driven out by Mao Zedong. Their stay was intended to be only temporary, the prelude to a return to the mainland, since they regarded themselves as the rightful rulers of China. Firm government and martial law were needed because of the constant military stand-off with the mainland. But as the years have passed, that pretext has become outmoded. Though China remains determined to reabsorb Taiwan, the threat of imminent military action to achieve this goal has receded. Mr Chiang's son and successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, realised that the KMT would have to strike roots in Taiwan. People born in Taiwan have increasingly dominated the KMT, displacing the 'mainlanders'. Mr Lee, who took over as president in 1988, overcame resistance from Chiang-era KMT elders to carry out political reforms including elections of the National Assembly in December 1991 and the Legislative Yuan in December 1992. The effect has been to strengthen the power of Taiwan-born politicians at the expense of those who saw Taiwan's future bound up in that of mainland China. While the KMT has yet to face a serious external challenge to its control, its attempt to transform itself from an authoritarian revolutionary party into an electoral machine has not been smooth. The congress is intended to speed the process. Its showing in last December's legislative elections, when the Democratic Progressive party - the main opposition party - won 52 seats compared with the KMT's 102, underlined growing disquiet at its policies and practices. The KMT is finding it hard to adapt to democracy. Accustomed to decreeing measures and seeing their successful implementation, it has found itself forced to backtrack several times in recent months. Its ambitious six-year Dollars 300bn (Pounds 201bn) plan for massive improvement of the island's infrastructure has had to be delayed and scaled down amid political and financing problems. Last month, parliamentary defeats forced it to cancel a Dollars 17bn high-speed railway project. Though the party has long had open factions, party leaders have been accustomed to iron discipline. Now, however, they have found themselves floundering in their dealings with dissidents. The party has also been undermined by the success of its economic policies, which have fostered highly efficient industrial companies. Independent businessmen resent the preferential treatment afforded to companies within the KMT's own extensive corporate holdings. At the root of the KMT's problems, however, remain divisions between the 'mainlanders' and Taiwanese-born. Mr Lee has succeeded in putting virtually all arms of government under the control of people who, like him, were born in Taiwan. But yesterday's developments, and the formation of the New party, have shown how difficult it is for him to exorcise the mainlanders' influence. There are few signs that the KMT leadership is taking firm action to produce new policies and internal reforms which will satisfy the party's dissidents. If it does not, it could face a growing electoral challenge from the New party. A first test will be local elections later this year. Success for the New party could create a three-party system representing a range of views on China, from independence to closer links, perhaps with the KMT occupying the middle ground. The transition to a more complex democracy will be viewed closely by the west - which wants to avoid Taiwan's status leading to eventual conflict with China - and by the island's Asian neighbours, especially China itself. Mr Ferdinand, of the Royal Institute, notes that 'the power of Taiwan to serve as a model for the rest of China should not be underestimated'.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / SIB chairman issues warning to companies The option of being regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, should not be available indefinitely to financial services companies, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board indicated to MPs yesterday. He said the ability of a company to choose to be regulated by SIB should be reviewed once the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, had been established. Mr Large told the Commons Treasury committee that he wanted the PIA to become operational as a regulator 'before and without' removing the choice of regulator available under the financial services legislation, but that once the new regulator had come into effect then that aspect of the 1986 act should be looked at again. His evidence to the committee's inquiry into financial regulation seemed to be aimed directly at reassuring the MPs about the effectiveness of the PIA after weeks in which they have heard several witnesses suggesting that the proposals will not work. Meanwhile, the MPs themselves have sounded sceptical about its prospects. In particular, Mr Large was forced to defend Mr Joe Palmer whose appointment as PIA chairman has caused some MPs to express concern. Mr Palmer was formerly chief executive of Legal &amp; General, which recently attracted a then record fine from Lautro, the existing regulator for the life insurance industry, for systemic failures in its compliance arrangements. Mr Large was pressed by Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour committee member, about Mr Palmer's answers to the committee last week. The day after giving evidence to the committee, Mr Palmer wrote apologising for having inadvertently misled MPs by saying that he had not seen an internal Legal &amp; General memorandum from 1990, which suggested there were widespread breaches of the rules by sales consultants. Mr Large also indicated the timetable for the regulatory switch to the PIA. He said that SIB would decide next month whether finally and formally to recognise PIA as a regulator. The PIA is due to become operational in July. At the same time, SIB would decide whether to withdraw recognition from Lautro and from Fimbra, the existing regulator for independent financial advisers. A likely timescale would be for the watchdogs to stop accepting new companies from the beginning of October, but to continue for about a year to regulate existing companies which had not transferred to the PIA.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEMPERATURES TO COOL AS SANTA ANA WINDS DIE  </P> <P> The Santa Ana condition that brought unseasonably warm weather and clear skies  to the San Diego area is expected to dissipate today, auguring a return to  cooler temperatures and traditional coastal clouds.  </P> <P> The weather is expected to remain mostly clear through Thursday, except for  some patchy low clouds and coastal fog early Thursday, according to the  National Weather Service.  </P> <P> The weakening Santa Ana could also mean worsened air pollution, particularly in  coastal areas in North San Diego County.  </P> <P> "When the Santa Ana starts to break down, we can expect unhealthful  conditions," said Tom Ryan, assistant meteorologist with the county Air  Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> That is so, Ryan explained, in part because pollutants blown out to sea during  the Santa Ana period may return above the land mass, particularly along the  coastal strip. The possible result: a photochemical soup in the coastal sky.  </P> <P> Consequently, Ryan said, there is a possibility of a Stage 1 smog alert today  in some North County areas, meaning that persons with respiratory ailments and  others sensitive to pollution would be urged to remain indoors. It would be the  first such alert this year, Ryan said.  </P> <P> For the past two days, however, the Santa Ana conditions have brought good air  quality to the entire San Diego area.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, when the desert-like conditions reached their peak, a high of 90  degrees was recorded at Lindbergh Field, just short of the record high of 92  set in 1976. The normal high temperature for the date is 75 degrees.  </P> <P> Some area highs Tuesday included 98 in La Mesa, 97 in Santee, 96 in Fallbrook  and 95 in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Tuesday's low at Lindbergh Field was 58 degrees, slightly below the date's  normal of 62. The coolest lows were the 42 degree readings recorded at Santee  and on Palomar Mountain.  </P> <P> Coastal highs are expected to be 78 to 84 degrees today, cooling to 73 to 78 on  Thursday. Inland areas, as usual, are expected to be somewhat warmer.  </P></p>

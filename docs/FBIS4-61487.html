			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- It would be most logical if the  resolution of the Black Sea Fleet question was transferred to  the Crimea and Russia, according to Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov.    The stationing of the fleet and the questions connected with  its supplies and social benefits for the military personnel are  all problems which the Crimean Republic must solve, he announced  in Moscow, where he arrived for the signing of an agreement  between the Crimean and Russian Governments on trade, economic,  and cultural cooperation.    Meshkov said that Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy  Radetskyy's refusal to allow Crimean representatives to have  equal representation at the Sevastopol negotiations on the Black  Sea Fleet was "inadequate".</p>

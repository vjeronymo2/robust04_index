			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- China's government  organs, social organizations, enterprises, institutions and  rural and urban mass groups at the grass roots have all made  efforts to safeguard the rights and interests of the country's  women, says a white paper issued by the Information Office of  the State Council today.    Entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women", the white paper  says that China's people's congresses at all levels are  responsible for drafting and revising laws and statutes to  protect women's rights and interests. They supervise the  implementation of relevant laws and governmental work to  safeguard the position of women and children.    Committees at all echelons of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), it says, carry out democratic  supervision and provide political consultation on legislations  concerning women's rights and interests and their implementation.    The white paper says that people's governments at each level  and their departments are responsible for drafting and revising  women-related administrative regulations, issuing relevant  decisions and orders, linking women's advance with social  development, and adopting administrative measures to oversee the  protection of women's rights and interests.    Judicial bodies at all levels, in accordance with legal  procedures, hear and judge cases and punish criminals who  infringe on women's rights and interests and see to it that laws  are upheld, it says.    The white paper notes that to coordinate and propel  governmental departments in their work of guaranteeing the  rights of women, the State Council has established a work  committee for women and children. Similar local government  bodies have also been set up in all the provinces, autonomous  regions and municipalities, with the exception of Taiwan.    It says that more than 5,800 mass women's organizations in  China are an important force in safeguarding the status of  women. The biggest of these is the All-China Women's Federation  (ACWF), which aims to represent and defend the interests of  women and devotes itself to promoting sexual equality and  raising women's position in society.    The country's mass media, including the press, radio and  television, publicize state laws and regulations upholding  women's rights and interests and civilized and progressive views  on women. This has greatly promoted public awareness of women's  rights and contributions to society, the white paper says.    It lists some of the laws and statutes on the protection of  women's rights and interests promulgated in recent years, such  as the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of  Women, the notice on reprisals against trafficking in women and  children, the decision on the strict prohibition against  prostitution and whoring and the decision regarding the severe  punishment of the criminals who abduct and traffic in or kidnap  women or children.    Female self-improvement is a strategic task fundamental to  the protection of women's rights and interests, the white paper  says, adding "the slogan of 'four selfs' (self-respect,  self-confidence, self-reliance and self-strengthening) was first  raised at the sixth national congress of women. Then, the  seventh national congress of women adopted a 10-point goal for  the advancement of Chinese women in the 1990s. The 'four selfs'  slogan and the 10-point goal produced a widespread impact upon  women and society. Inspired by them, millions of Chinese women  are realizing their own betterment and progress in the course of  propelling society forward."</p>

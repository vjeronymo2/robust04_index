			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pasminco blames loss on lower metals prices PASMINCO, the Australian lead and zinc group, blamed lower metals prices for a net loss of ADollars 58.6m (USDollars 41.9m) for the year to the end of June, against a loss of ADollars 47.6m the previous year. Revenue fell from ADollars 1.5bn to ADollars 1.3bn, largely reflecting falls of 11 per cent and 23 per cent in the average prices of zinc and lead on world markets. The loss was in line with the profits warning issued by the group last month, which coincided with the partial unwinding of an 80.6 per cent joint shareholding formerly held by North Broken Hill Peko (North) and CRA, the Australian mining groups. Pasminco said the figure included an abnormal loss of ADollars 15.4m, reflecting the cost of rationalisation and a tax charge of ADollars 12.5m following an audit of the 1985 to 1988 accounts by the Australian Taxation Office. The bottom line loss increased to ADollars 140.1m after including a net extraordinary loss of ADollars 81.5m relating to the previously announced writedown of the Elura mine in New South Wales. The group is still trying to sell Elura but has not received an acceptable offer. It said negotiations werecontinuing on the sale of its smelter and alloying plant in the UK. Mr Peter Barnett, managing director, said metals prices had risen in recent months and they The company had also benefited from the significantly better ADollars /USDollars exchange rate. As expected, the board said there is would be no dividend payment. North and CRA reduced their 40.3 per cent shareholdings in Pasminco to 20 per cent and 31 per cent respectively in July, signalling the end of their joint commitment to Pasminco.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA report: "Yes Side Reducing No </F> Side's Lead"]    [Text] The no side still has the upper hand in the battle  surrounding Swedish membership in the European Union, EU. But  the difference between yes and no has been halved since  November. The clearest change in the poll carried out by the  Central Bureau of Statistics [SCB] when compared with the  corresponding poll in November is that the no side is losing  ground.    Men still take a more positive view of EU membership than  women -- 35 percent against 25 percent. However, in both cases  the proportion of those in favor of membership has increased by  around 5 percentage points since last November. The proportion  of those against EU membership is of a similar size in the case  of both sexes, around 40 percent. Around 23 percent of men are  undecided, while 33 percent of women do not know how they will  vote.    As far as age is concerned the proportion of those in favor  of EU membership is greatest among people in the age range  50-54, around 38 percent. The smallest proportion in favor of  membership is found among the very old, around 20 percent. The  highest proportion against EU membership -- around 46 percent --  is to be found among first-time voters.    Among the supporters of the parties represented in the  Riksdag the proportion of those in favor of membership has  increased in the case of all parties with the exception of the  Left Party. There has been a particularly dramatic improvement  for EU supports among those who support the Liberal Party. They  increased from 49.1 percent in November to 63.1 percent in May.  However, the Moderate Coalition Party has the biggest  percentage in favor of membership -- 68.5 percent in May,  compared with 59.9 percent in November.    The figures for the other parties show changes as  follows:     -  Social Democrats from 15.7 to 18.7 percent.    -  Center  Party from 17.5 to 26.9 percent.    -  Christian Democratic Party from  17.7 to 26.3 percent.    -  New Democracy from 27.1 to 36.0  percent.    -  Left Party from 6.0 to 5.9 percent.    -  The Green Ecology  Party from 14.9 to 9.8 percent.     In November the no side had over 50 percent of all party  supporters with the exception of the Liberal Party and the  Moderate Coalition Party. In May the no side had an absolute  majority only in the Left Party and the Green Ecology Party.  The no side has suffered its biggest losses among Center Party  supporters, from 58.3 percent to 45.2 percent. The figures for  the other parties show changes as follows:     -  Social Democrats  from 52.3 to 47.4 percent.    -  Liberal Party from 23.7 to 19.1  percent.    -  Moderate Coalition Party from 15.4 to 12.9  percent.    -  Christian Democratic Party from 53.9 to 46.2  percent.    -  New Democracy from 51.9 to 48.3 percent.    -  Left Party  from 84.0 to 83.9 percent.    -  Green Ecology Party from 73.2 to 76.5  percent.     The SCB used a random sample of 9,300 people. Of these  around 20 percent refused to respond, were too ill to respond,  or could not be contacted. A little under 7,500 replied to the  SCB's questions. The SCB asked: If we were to have a  referendum today on Swedish membership in the EU, how would your  vote: for or against joining? Those interviewed were then  asked whether they were certain or uncertain in the choice they  have made. In the don't know category, SCB asked whether people  were leaning toward a no or a yes.    [Report is accompanied by a bar chart that breaks down the  yes, no, and don't know votes. The figures it gives are as  follows, with changes in parentheses:    Yes -- 30.5 percent (plus 4.5 percent) -- of which uncertain  9.9 percent (plus 1.0 percent) and certain 20.6 percent (plus  3.5 percent).    No -- 40.0 percent (minus 4.8 percent) -- of which uncertain  10.8 percent (minus 0.8 percent) and certain 29.2 percent (minus  4.0 percent).    Don't know -- 27.9 percent (plus/minus 0 percent) -- of  which  those who lean toward a yes, 6.4 percent (plus 0.2 percent) and  those who lean toward no, 6.0 percent (plus 0.1 percent)]</p>

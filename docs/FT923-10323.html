			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Parts are greater than the whole: How ICI hopes to unlock resources through a radical restructuring of its businesses ICI's proposal to split itself into two will come as a seismic shock to the world chemical industry. It is normal for chemical companies to shuffle their assets around. For one of the world-scale players to carve itself up in this way is without precedent. But ICI is in the mood for radical solutions. Its immunity from takeover was called into question last year by the appearance on its share register of the predatory Lord Hanson. It has expensive if unspecified plans for taking part in the restructuring of the chemicals and drug industries in the 1990s. The plan announced yesterday addresses both these issues. It also brings to its logical conclusion an argument which has bedevilled ICI for more than a decade: how far the company should depend on traditional bulk chemicals such as chlorine and plastics, and how far on more sophisticated products such as drugs and pesticides. ICI's answer is nothing if not basic: let the two sides seek their fortunes as independent companies. The problem with bulk chemicals is that their profits swing wildly with the economic cycle. In the peak year of 1988, ICI's bulk businesses made trading profits of more than Pounds 1bn. Last year they made a third of that. This year they will make less again. Drugs and agrochemicals, by contrast, are classically immune from the cycle. They are also highly cash-generative, which is useful when the bulk business is in recession or is going through one of its characteristic phases of heavy investment. In that sense, there is a good deal to be said for keeping the two sides together. Why split them? The succinct answer is given by Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating office of ICI and future managing director of the bulk side. 'There's been a debate on the board for as long as I've been on it over the right structure for the group. But the really serious debate came at the end of 1990, when we came to realise that against our expectations for economic growth in the 1990s, we wouldn't have the resources to do everything we wanted, or the focus.' The point about resources is crucial. After the group is split, the plan is that ICI Bio - the drugs and pharmaceuticals side - should raise cash through a rights issue. This is not necessarily because ICI Bio will need the money: on the contrary, it may be needed more on the bulk side. But it seems a fair guess that when ICI is split up, most of its cash will be shunted into the bulk business. ICI Bio can then replace that cash from the stock market more cheaply than ICI could itself, since as a drug company it will enjoy a higher rating. The need for cash is explained by Mr Hampel. 'As ICI is today, with its strong balance sheet, it doesn't need new equity to stay alive. But as and when the economy turns up, that would probably change. And if the two companies are actively looking for opportunities, they will want it all the more. On the other hand, if we were to go into a business depression, we simply wouldn't want to invest.' As to the opportunities in question, ICI is understandably coy. But in general terms, says Mr Hampel, 'one of the features of today's world is that large parts of the chemicals industry are prepared to consider restructuring in radical terms. In titanium dioxide (a white pigment used in paints), for instance, there are obviously some non-profitable businesses around, which could get together. Our new structure might help there. 'Or again, people have frequently said to us that our pharmaceuticals business is non-viable. We tell them that's rubbish, and we mean it. But there will clearly be more opportunities now to get together.' The capital structures of the two new businesses is a delicate matter. Mr Colin Short, ICI's finance director, says 'the first step is a massive internal restructuring of four or five hundred companies around the world, each of which will need sorting out. Having got to that point, we'll make an assessment of the capital structure of the businesses.' ICI is naturally keen to avoid the suggestion that the bulk business is being abandoned. 'If you go back to the mid-1980s,' Mr Hampel says, 'the heavy end was throwing off cash. Even as late as 1989, it far exceeded the rest of the business in cash flow terms. Obviously, ICI continues to have within it cyclical businesses where cash goes up and down with the cycle. But we're already addressing that with our restructuring programme.' Nevertheless, it is plain that the bulk business - ICI's old heartland in industrial chemistry - will be the poor relation. Last year, it made 31 per cent of the group's trading profit on 70 per cent of its turnover. That was largely the effect of the economic cycle. But precisely because the business is so cyclical, it will command a lower price in the stock market. It will take the market a little while to work out its sums on this. Early indications, though, are that the bulk business could be worth about 30 per cent of the total. On the basis of ICI's market value yesterday of Pounds 8.4bn - up 7 per cent on the announcement - that would put a rough value of Pounds 2.5bn on the bulk business against almost Pounds 6bn for ICI Bio. These are still formidable numbers. Mr Hampel says 'the bulk business will drop from number five in the world chemicals industry to number seven. The pharmaceuticals company will be number nine in the world. We're not talking about orphans here.' But there is another side to all this. Even if the threat from Lord Hanson proved little more than bluff, the fact remains that the proposal to split the business was first proposed only a few months after his appearance on the scene. When ICI talks of the bleak outlook for the 1990s and the opportunities this will create for restructuring, it must be conscious of the risk that it could create an opportunity for restructuring by someone else. From a cynical viewpoint, splitting the business can be seen as tackling this risk head-on. The attractive, high added-value part of the business is put out of reach by giving it a higher stock market rating. The commodity business is made still more unattractive by being exposed on its own. Like BAT - under fire from Sir James Goldsmith - ICI has shown a surprising turn of speed for a supposedly staid and bureaucratic management. Like BAT, too, ICI has demonstrated that corporate gadflies can have their uses. It will doubtless be sending a large cheque to Warburg, its financial advisers, for coming up with the demerger plan. Perhaps it should send a small donation to Lord Hanson as well.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ICI DIVIDES FOR GROWTH  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Trading ICI                           Turnover    profit/loss                                   1991           1991                             (pounds m)     (pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Paints                           1,588            118 Explosives                         536             54 Materials                        2,037            -20 Industrial chemicals             3,894            132 Regional                         1,246             29 Total                            8,701            313 Employees at Dec 31, 1991: 88,100  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Trading ICI Bio                       Turnover         profit                                   1991           1991                             (pounds m)     (pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pharmaceuticals                  1,588            538 Agrochemicals &amp; seeds            1,365            144 Specialities                       984             38 Total                            3,937            720 Employees at Dec 31, 1991:   35,500  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total according                 12,488          1,033 to ICI report Employees at Dec 31, 1991:  123,600  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

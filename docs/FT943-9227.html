			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mad pursuit of deeply flawed power concept Sir, 'Coal production is falling from fashion - and production is down  - in virtually all European countries,' says Michael Smith ('Coal cleans up its act for a power struggle', August 3). This is for the very simple reason that indigenous production is relatively uneconomic. The Canute-like efforts of the Spanish socialists to maintain coal production in the Puertollano region, underwritten by the long-suffering Spanish consumer and aided by pork barrels from the European Commission, which itself is maintained by long-suffering taxpayers, cannot alter the facts that IGCC (integrated coal gasifier with combined cycle) is a deeply flawed concept. The flaws are its cost and efficiency relative to lower cost and unglamorous conventional plant. Here in Denmark, the fuel conversion efficiency of 1992-commissioned, squeaky-clean, super-critical but conventionally fired coal plant is already 46 per cent, 16 per cent better than any figure ever acknowledged in any of the FT's articles for the 'best coal-fired power stations'. High-quality coal, at a landed price well below Pounds 1/GJ, is imported from all over the world. As materials for boilers and designs for steam turbines continue to improve, the efficiency of the conventional coal-fired steam plant by the end of this decade will, in Denmark, continue to stay ahead of anything foreseen by the IGCC - and at much lower first costs. In fact, a 450 MWe unit is being planned for commissioning by 1998, not far from my home here in Denmark, which will convert coal to electricity with a conversion efficiency of 48 per cent. In combined heat and power mode, it will be around 90 per cent efficient. New, better and cheaper methods of flue gas cleaning demonstrate acid rain emissions from low-cost coal at levels comparable with those from IGCC. Current events in Nigeria and Algeria, together with continuing instability in the Commonwealth of Independent States, underline the madness of the European-wide 'dash for gas' in power generation. Continued pork barrelling by politicians and manufacturers, and the interference in the market mechanisms by European Commission amateurs, will leave our children dangerously exposed to a squeeze between high-priced or even unobtainable gas, obsolete, inefficient coal-fired plants and taxpayer-subsidised, technological monsters like IGCC. When are we going to wake up to reality? Hugh Sharman, managing director, Incoteco (Denmark), Toldbodvej 12, DK-9730, Hals, Denmark</p>

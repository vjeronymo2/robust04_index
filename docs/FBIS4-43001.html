			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Some of the plutonium seized  in a spectacular operation in Baden-Wuerttemberg comes from the  production of nuclear weapons. On Wednesday [1 June] night, DPA  learned from a reliable source about the preliminary results of  tests carried out at the European Institute for Transuraniums at  the Nuclear Research Center at Karlsruhe.    Ten percent of the total of 60 grams of radioactive powder  are purest Plutonium 239 with an enrichment grade of 99 percent,  which is generated only in the production of nuclear arms. It  was further stated that neither the compound of the remaining 90  percent of the powder nor its origin are known. This requires  still further tests. Until now, the authorities had thought that  the country of origin was an East European state. [passage  omitted]    According to experts, the amount of the discovered plutonium  is not sufficient for the construction of a nuclear bomb. Under  optimal conditions, this would require at least 500-600 grams of  pure Plutonium 239.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Jobs crisis dominates campaign in France France must be the only EU state where people have been passing around the hat at some European election rallies to buy arms for a 'European' cause. 'So far we have got commitments of FFr20,000 (Pounds 2,331) to buy weapons for the Moslems in Bosnia,' said a representative yesterday of 'Action for Bosnia'. It has been raising funds at rallies of the 'Europe Begins at Sarajevo' group which is expected to file its candidate list by tomorrow, the closing date. The campaign to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia has injected a note of uncertainty into the election in France and, given France's leading diplomatic and military role there, in the future course of western policy in Bosnia. The campaign has been mounted in the media with great skill by Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, a left bank Paris intellectual who produced a film on Bosnia for this month's Cannes festival and has since gathered 86 other 'potential' names to run on the 'Europe Begins at Sarajevo' ticket. 'Potential', because for the past two weeks, Mr Levy and his colleagues have been saying that, if the mainstream parties adopt their arms-for-Bosnia stance, they will withdraw their candidates. These pressure tactics have had only limited impact on the joint government list of the RPR gaullists and the UDF centre-right led by Mr Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse, but far more on the Socialist list led by Mr Michel Rocard. Fearing that Mr Levy could provide further competition for the left-wing vote - in addition to that already provided by the radical list led by Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial Marseilles businessman and politician - the socialist leader has tried to head him off. Lifting the arms embargo would be 'recognising our failure (in Bosnia), but the only way of saving a bit of honour,' said Mr Rocard. But this statement may have come too late to save Mr Rocard votes. Less surprising is the other issue dominating the election - employment, which is already the national preoccupation in a country with a record 12.2 per cent jobless rate. A poll in yesterday's Liberation newspaper showed that two-thirds of French believe the EU's employment policy is not headed in the right direction. But there has been little precise debate about the right direction for Europe, partly perhaps because few French politicians dare espouse the labour market reforms prescribed by the Delors white paper on European competitivity. They have all seen the trouble Prime Minister Balladur ran into attempting too overt a cut in the minimum wage for French youth. The Euro-election debate has also been blunted by the fact that the joint list of the RPR-UDF governing parties is a composite, ranging from enthusiastic Europeans to all but the most die-hard opponents of the Maastricht treaty, who themselves have formed the dissident 'Alternative Europe' list under Mr Philippe de Villiers and Mr Jimmy Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. To deny ammunition to the latter, Mr Baudis carefully hides his federal faith and eschews any mention of Maastricht, or indeed of Gatt, Mr Goldsmith's particular bete noire. In the same vein, Mr Alain Lamassoure, the EU affairs minister who is one of the few ministers to be doing much campaigning, is stressing the need for subsidiarity within the EU, a rare area where the French and British governments have something in common. Taking another leaf out of Britain's book, he has also been using the campaign to try to set a series of 'Euro-scares' to rest by, for instance, emphasising that Brussels rules on unpasteurised cheeses were drawn up at France's request so that its 'fromages a lait cru' could continue to be sold throughout Europe. According to yesterday's poll, 47 per cent of French claim their vote on June 12 will be determined by European issues while 41 per cent admit national issues will dictate the way they cast their ballot. But the election will still be very largely read as a preview of next May's presidential contest. It is less crucial for Mr Balladur, or his fellow gaullist rival, Mr Jacques Chirac; neither are on the government list. But the stakes are high for Mr Rocard, who is leading his party's list; if his list gains much less than 20 per cent, it may encourage some in his party to look for another to keep the Socialist standard flying in the Elysee.</p>

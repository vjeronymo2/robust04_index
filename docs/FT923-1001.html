			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Middle East talks to resume next month ALL PARTIES to the Middle East peace talks agreed yesterday to return for a further month-long round of negotiations in Washington, starting on October 21, despite earlier concerns that discussions would have to be adjourned until some time after the US presidential election on November 3. The agreement was seen by all sides as confirmation of their commitment to keep pressing for progress in the talks, despite failure to reach any significant breakthrough in the latest round of Israel's bilateral negotiations with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. During the latest talks, the first since the election of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's new Israeli government in June, hopes were raised that Israel and Syria were close to reaching an initial agreement on their dispute over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. But these hopes evaporated after both sides had refused to shift from their essential positions. Syria still insisted that it win back the entire Golan, while Israel stuck with its demand for assurances of peace before making territorial concessions. Israel and the Palestinians agreed to set up working committees to work towards setting up an interim period of Palestinian self-government in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But they have yet to agree fully the terms for negotiating an interim settlement. Set fair for progress, Page 16</p>

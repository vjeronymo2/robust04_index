			<p>BFN     [Text] While celebrating the anniversary of the killing of  the brothers Rafael and Eduardo Vergara Toledo in Villa Francia  District in 1985, groups of youngsters were involved yesterday  in serious incidents at the intersection of Grecia and Jose  Pedro Alessandri Avenues and in Villa Francia District. At  least eight demonstrators were detained by Carabineros who went  to restore public order.    After participating in a tribute to the killed MIR [Movement  of the Revolutionary Left] members yesterday afternoon, a group  of masked people set up barricades on Grecia Avenue and threw  Molotov cocktails and stones. Carabineros cordoned off the area  and caused huge traffic jams. Vehicles were diverted to nearby  streets while Carabineros used water cannons and tear gas.    The new Israeli-made water cannons, exhibited at the FIDAE  [International Aerospace Fair] and purchased by Carabineros to  serve at the 29th Special Forces Precinct, were used for the  first time.    Carabineros yesterday evening prevented another tribute to  the killed MIR members in Villa Francia District, dispersing  those who were planning to participate in it.    Manuel Vergara, the father of the killed MIR members,  explained that it was a peaceful tribute and that Carabineros  ordered the dismantling of the stage. He said:    [Begin Vergara recording] It was supposed to have been a  very  beautiful tribute. We could have had a video with a script,  with artists. It was scheduled for 2000. The problem is that  Carabineros arrived at 1830, surrounded the area, and even  prevented the stage from being assembled.    Mounted Carabineros pushed the people. They charged at the  people and the stage had to be dismantled. [end recording]    While the mother of the Vergara brothers was expressing her  protest to journalists, a water cannon soaked the journalists  who were recording her comments. The Vergara family's house was  completely flooded during this action. The water cannon soaked  a Megavision team and a Chilevision cameraman was hit on the leg  by a tear gas canister.</p>

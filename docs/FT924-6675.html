			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Bond not guilty MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, was yesterday cleared by a Perth jury of dishonestly inducing a businessman to take part in the ADollars 370m (Pounds 168m) rescue of a collapsed merchant bank run by a fellow entrepreneur. Mr Bond spent 90 days in Wooroloo prison outside Perth after being sentenced to 2 1/2 years' detention on the same charge. He was freed on appeal by the Western Australian Supreme Court. 'I've had a difficult time through Wooroloo and other people ought to be brought to account for it,' he said.</p>

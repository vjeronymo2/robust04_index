			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Personal View: Seeds of crisis in a flawed farm deal France's negotiating partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks ought to prepare themselves for a French veto to the US-European Commission deal on agriculture. For there is bound to be a veto. The case in favour of such a step rests on strong arguments, which go way beyond agriculture and will consequently be given due regard by the newly elected French government. Of course, my union fights first and foremost on behalf of its farmers. We will press for a rejection by the European Community of the deal on farm policies, which we consider to be lopsided and flawed. The deal would make European farmers lose large market shares, both domestic and foreign. Prices and incomes would fall substantially and in the end Europe's current Common Agricultural Policy would be torn to pieces. The caps on so-called 'subsidised' exports would be especially damaging, particularly for France and Britain, which export respectively 60 and 30 per cent of their total grain output. But all member-states ought to concern themselves with those export caps, which will inevitably put a strong downward pressure on domestic prices as output surpluses are rechannelled towards EC markets. But there is far more than this to the dispute. At stake, in my view, is Europe's emancipation and its capacity to project itself as a world power in the international arena. What I have tried to do as president of the French farmers' union is systematically to point to the failings and the shortcomings of the EC institutions. Second, I have made the case that the EC will need agriculture and food exports in the decades ahead if it is to yield influence as a world power. Look at the demographic trends. The world population is expected to double within 53 years and the boom will be greater still at the periphery of Europe, where food is especially scarce. In just 40 years the population of Africa will grow threefold. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has called on all countries to increase their output to meet the forecast surge in food demand. Now, the GATT draft agreement on agriculture requires that the EC cut its subsidised exports - making it impossible for the EC to meet the demand. What is more, practically speaking, the US is exempt from this limitation only because its export subsidies are based on a budgetary mechanism different from that of the EC. In the end, only the US would be allowed to carry on exporting - thereby enabling it to retain the possibility of using food as a foreign policy weapon. A Gatt agreement on agriculture is needed, but first I would insist that Europe has enough foresight to give itself the means to break such a monopoly. In the current negotiations, the European Commission has taken a short-sighted approach and sought to secure a deal at any cost in the hope that it would give the world economy a shot in the arm. In addition, the Commission has not had the slightest regard for the views of ministers of the member states. We must make sure democracy is respected to the full. The mandate handed by the ministers on November 20 1990 was by-passed by Brussels, which is now using the deal it has struck with the US to force on EC ministers fresh reform of the CAP reform. The Commission has clearly overstepped its boundaries. It is high time democracy was brought back into the institutions of Europe and Europe's interests were no longer said to clash with those of individual member states. What then should be done in the short term? First, member states should not accept a Gatt agreement at any price. They must take a close look at the way the Commission defends Europe's interests. They must press the case that the Commission is only the executive branch and that it is for them to give clear directives. Second, member states must use the Uruguay Round trade negotiations to design a comprehensive, ambitious trade policy for Europe. They cannot go on being ordered around and giving in to diplomatic pressure or to unsubstantiated threats of trade sanctions. Only after drawing a clear picture of objectives should member states seat themselves at the negotiating table. Ours are not parochial arguments. Enough is at stake for France to be willing to take the risk of a crisis with the US or even with its European partners. The new French government can indeed be expected to veto the farm agreement in order to seek a new, balanced and fair deal with the US. It is for Europe to build itself.

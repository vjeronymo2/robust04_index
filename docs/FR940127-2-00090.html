By letter dated November 11, 1993, Sidley &amp; Austin, acting as counsel to IP, informed the Commission that the Board of Directors has proposed a corporate restructuring plan to be presented at the February 9, 1994, annual shareholders meeting. If a majority of IP shareholders approve the plan, IP will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new holding company, IP Holding Company, effective on or about April 1, 1994. IP would remain as holder of the license for the Clinton Power Station. If the plan is approved, the common stock of IP will be converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock of the holding company. According to the proposed plan, the current IP Board of Directors will serve in the same capacity for the holding company, and there will be no significant change in ownership, management, or sources of funds for operation of the Clinton Power Station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80, the Commission may approve the transfer of control of a license, after notice to interested persons. Such action is contingent upon the Commission's determination that the holder of the license following the transfer is qualified to have the control of the license and that the transfer of such control is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations and orders of the Commission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 19th day of January 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John N.

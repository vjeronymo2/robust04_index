			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Funds told to be tougher against fraud: Call from Bank to pensions industry PENSION FUNDS must take a more active stand to prevent further Maxwell-style frauds, a Bank of England official told the annual conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Glasgow. Mr Pen Kent, Bank of England director for finance and industry, said the association's members 'are not standing up to be counted'. Shareholders too often failed to exercise their right to vote and bore some responsibility for failing to insist on proper curbs on Robert Maxwell. Shareholders had not contributed enough to the debate over what companies should disclose in their corporate accounts, he added. 'We need to hear more from users of accounts about what is currently provided.' Mr Kent said that although there is 'no such thing as a risk-free society', there is a need to tighten regulation of the investment industry. Mr Brian McMahon, association chairman, outlined its support for pension reform. 'The days are gone, indeed if they ever existed, when this association could say that everything is fine, nothing wrong with the way we run our schemes, and especially nothing wrong with the way I run mine,' Mr McMahon said. 'Maxwell has cast a giant shadow over us.' The association is studying a compensation arrangement for pension scheme members similar to that available to private investors. Other reforms backed by the association include requiring boards of trustees to offer equal representation to employers and members. The association also says pension schemes should be required to pay for trustees to obtain training.</p>

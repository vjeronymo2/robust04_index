			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> VOTE ON VIEW LAW DELAYED  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday delayed voting on a law designed to protect  residential views, after several council members voiced concerns that the  proposed ordinance might infringe on the rights of property owners.  </P> <P> The ordinance would prohibit construction from blocking neighbors' window  views.  </P> <P> It would apply to two-story structures, additions of more than 75% of an  existing building and to multifamily residences with three or more units. Under  the law, each homeowner could designate one window's view for protection.  </P> <P> "This could absolutely deny a neighbor the right to build on their side,"  Councilwoman Marie T. Purvis said. Councilman Samuel Kiang said the city is  venturing into "uncharted legal waters" and could be sued by angry homeowners  who could be denied the right to develop their property.  </P> <P> Mayor Judy Chu, who supports the concept of a view ordinance, agreed that the  city must proceed cautiously.  </P> <P> If the ordinance passes, Monterey Park would become the only city in the San  Gabriel Valley with such a law, city officials said. No date was set for  reconsideration. Currently, the cities of Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills  Estates have view ordinances.  </P></p>

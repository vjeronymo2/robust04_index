			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Havas falls 6% to FFr1.08bn HAVAS, one of France's leading media, marketing and travel groups, saw its net profits fall by 6.1 per cent to FFr1.08bn (Dollars 192m) in 1991 mainly due to losses in its travel interests and the slowdown in the advertising market. The group also announced plans to take full control of Comareg, which publishes free newspapers in France, by buying the 38 per cent of the shares it does not already own. Havas is offering one of its shares for two Comareg shares. This forms part of the trend for large French companies, such as the Suez industrial group and Paribas investment bank, to restructure their investment portfolios. Havas, which is the biggest single force in French advertising through its interest in the Eurocom group of agencies and marketing service consultancies, experienced a 12 per cent increase in sales to FFr26.5bn during 1991. However, on a strictly comparable basis, the growth in sales was slightly lower at just 6.4 per cent. The contribution from Eurocom, which last week announced a 5.2 per cent fall in net income to FFr183.1m, was affected by the competitive condition of the advertising market in France and in other European countries, notably the UK. Last year Havas was also affected by a fall in profits from its free newspaper publishing interests and by an operating loss of FFr40m from its travel business. However the group's other publishing interests fared well despite the advertising downturn as investments in the Canal Plus and CLT television groups. The board proposed raising the dividend from FFr6.90 in 1990 to FFr8 a share for 1991 and said the outlook for 1992 was 'more favourable' than that for 1991. In the first two months of the year Havas mustered sales growth on a comparable basis of 10.7 per cent, with particularly strong growth from its interests outside France. In the meantime Comareg has been affected by the weakness of the French advertising market. Its net profits fell sharply from FFr128.8m in 1990 to FFr85m in 1991 on static sales of FFr1.83bn. Compagnie Financiere de Suez increased its consolidated net attributable profit to FFr3.83bn (Dollars 680m) in 1991 from FFr3.71bn in the previous 12 months, agencies report from Paris. The dividend on 1991 earnings will be FFr8.20 a share, up from FFr7.80 on 1990 earnings. Net asset value per share rose to FFr525 compared with FFr504 in the previous year. Results were also influenced by a 170 per cent jump in provisions that Suez's French banks made against property loans. However, Suez's flagship bank, Banque Indosuez, announced last month an exceptional writedown of FFr650m.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring cuts OMI's loss to Pounds 88,000 OMI International, the industrial logistics, diagnostics and optronics group, came close to break-even in the six months to September 30 as it began to feel the benefits of two years of restructuring, writes Matthew Curtin. Pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 88,000. There was a return to operating profits with Pounds 8,000, compared with losses of Pounds 103,000 on turnover of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 26.3m). Interest payable was Pounds 96,000, against Pounds 205,000 received. Mr Gil Williams, chairman, said the results were as expected, adding that a recent report forecasting Pounds 400,000 pre-tax profits was not based on information released by the company or its brokers. The shares fell from 27 1/2 p to 22p In August, the group sold its profitable technical recruitment agency and loss-making aerospace design subsidiary, which, Mr Williams said, had been a serious drain on cashflow. Average borrowings of Pounds 2m were cut to Pounds 500,000 by September 30. Electro-Optics, the manufacturing subsidiary, increased sales by 10 per cent and improved profits. Instrumentation sales were weaker and the services division operated in a difficult market. Losses per share improved from 3p to 0.2p and the interim dividend is held at 0.75p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Dieter Schulte, new chairman of the  German Trade Union Federation [DGB], has outlined the trade  unions' future policy. In his inaugural speech at the 15th DGB  Federal Congress in Berlin, Schulte said the trade unions will  press full steam ahead for social justice and social unity.  Before the 600 delegates, he called at the same time for using  reform to strengthen the DGB and its trade unions.    Schulte emphatically advocated long-term state-promoted  employment in eastern and western Germany. It must be paid  according to the wage scale, keeping to the principle of same  wage for same work. He called mass unemployment the malignant  tumor of industrial society. The nascent economic upswing  cannot obscure the fact that there is a gulf between growth and  employment, he said.    According to Schulte, the DGB and its individual unions also  want to struggle for Germany as an example of democracy and  tolerance. Extreme-right provocateurs and arsonists must not  have a chance, he said.    In the afternoon, Christian Social Union Chairman Theo  Waigel  and Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the Alliance 90/Greens want to  address the delegates.</p>

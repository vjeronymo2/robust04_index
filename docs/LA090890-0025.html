			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> THOMAS LEADS MUIR PAST PALMDALE  </P> <P> The Pasadena Muir High football team has been among the most talented teams in  the Southland in recent years. A lack of discipline on the field, however, has  kept the Mustangs from competing with top programs.  </P> <P> Muir Coach John Tyree is slowly changing that, as evidenced by his team's  season-opening victory over Palmdale, 38-13, Friday night in a Southern Section  nonleague game at Pasadena City College.  </P> <P> Muir, the Times' fifth-rated team, trailed Palmdale, 13-0, midway through the  first quarter. Struggling to establish an offense, Muir players seemed to be  losing patience.  </P> <P> But Tyree, in his second season at the school, has stressed patience and  discipline, and it showed when the team regrouped in the second half.  </P> <P> Palmdale, coming off a 3-8 season, was outscored, 25-0, in the second half.  Muir quarterback Sedrick Thomas, a 6-foot-1, 215-pound senior, orchestrated the  turnaround. He passed for more than 250 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown  pass to Demetrice Martin for the final score of the game.  </P> <P> Thomas ran the option to perfection, picking up 70 yards. His one-yard  touchdown run early in the fourth quarter gave Muir a 24-13 lead.  </P> <P> "We were ragged and sloppy," Tyree said. "But the thing about the Mustangs is  that we play four quarters of football."  </P> <P> Muir turned things around in the third quarter after blowing an opportunity to  take the lead. The Mustangs drove from their 20-yard line to the Palmdale one  after the kickoff, but running back Linza Williams fumbled and Palmdale  defensive back Anthony Ortega recovered.  </P> <P> Falcon quarterback Rodney Williams was tackled for a safety on the next play,  giving Muir the lead for good, 15-13.  </P> <P> Even the kicking game was on target for Muir in the second half. Jason Aniline  converted a 27-yard field goal to increase the Mustangs' lead, 18-13.  </P> <P> "Things opened up in the second half," Tyree said, "and Sedrick (Thomas) is a  talented guy and we got a lot of short passes."  </P> <P> Palmdale caught Muir napping on the first play of the game. The Falcons called  a halfback pass, and Ortega connected with senior receiver Paul DeAngelo for a  79-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> Muir gambled on its first possession, faking a punt on fourth-and-nine from its  23. Thomas' pass was incomplete and Palmdale took over. Three minutes later,  running back Vashon Lecesne scored a touchdown from three yards out to put the  Falcons ahead, 13-0.  </P></p>

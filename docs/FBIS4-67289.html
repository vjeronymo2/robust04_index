			<p>Allows'   <F P=102>   BK1705131994 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network in Thai 12000  GMT 17 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> BK1705131994 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok Radio Thailand Network </F> <F P=105>  Thai </F> BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri informed reporters  today that information provided by the United States regarding  its case against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong to his ministry has  been forwarded to the Interior Ministry. The relevant laws will  have to be consulted on whether it is possible to extradite the  MP for trial in the United States. [begin recording]    Prasong: There was a discussion this morning  regarding the relevant laws. We will look into every angle.    Unidentified reporter: What is the government's  position? Will the MP be tried here or extradited to the United  States?    Prasong: If there is a law that allows an  extradition, we will probably have to cooperate with the United  States to preserve our country's reputation. If the law does  not allow this, then we will not be able to extradite him. The  legal specialists will consult the law in case the United States  requests an extradition.    Reporter: In most previous cases, the United  States was able to bring major drug traffickers to trial in its  courts.    Prasong: Most of them were arrested in the United  States or in third countries.    Reporter: What if there are other officials  involved in this case?    Prasong: [Words indistinct].

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Like the fireplace in a cozy living room, everyone on the Thousand Oaks High  defense gathers around middle linebacker Lance Martin. There might as well be a  load of bricks sitting from tackle to tackle: Martin (6-foot-1, 218 pounds) is  as sturdy as a fireplace.  </P> <P> Of course, only a fool would run smack into a fireplace.  </P> <P> Newbury Park, the latest challenge for Martin and the lively Lancer defense,  became Thousand Oaks' fifth shutout victim. The Lancers won, 21-0, to secure  the Marmonte League title.  </P> <P> Martin, a superb all-around athlete who batted .379 last baseball season, leads  the Lancers with 110 tackles. Against Newbury Park, he intercepted a pass and  forced a fumble to halt drives in the first half and lead a defensive charge  that held the Panthers to nine yards rushing in the second half.  </P> <P> Martin's performance underscored what all Thousand Oaks opponents have learned:  Run from tackle to tackle and you are bound to get burned.

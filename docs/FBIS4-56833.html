			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares early this morning visited  Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon, the outstanding opponent of the  military regime that ruled this country until 1989. "Telemetro  Reports" has an exclusive report.    Ernesto Perez Balladares, virtual president elect, made his  first visit this morning to Christian Democratic leader Ricardo  Arias Calderon. Perez Balladares paid his respects to the man  he called one of the main champions of democracy in Panama.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Perez  Balladares, why are you visiting Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon?    [Perez Balladares] Dr. Arias Calderon has been an  outstanding  champion of democracy in Panama. I have been favored by an  electoral process held in a time of democracy. I wanted to tell  Dr. Arias Calderon, and I have done so, that he can rest assured  that we are also committed to democracy. In addition, with this  small gesture, I want to tell the country that we are moved by  the best spirit of national reconciliation. There are neither  vanquished nor victors in Panama. I think all Panamanians have  won, and naturally there is no hatred or rancor. We are  planning to work, everyone united, to attain our national goals.  I wanted to come and tell Ricardo about this.    [Reporter] In a few months you are going to take over as  president of the Republic. Are you going to rule with opposing  parties in view of the election results?    [Perez Balladares] I want to invite all Panamanians,  regardless of their political inclination, to make this  government what the country needs to enter the 21st century  united. That means -- and I am not evading your question --  that I am going to invite some people who have been my  adversaries and some who belong to other political parties to  form part of the government. I think it is necessary. I am  fully aware of the fact that two-thirds of Panamanians chose  other candidates. It is true that I have won, but two-thirds of  the Panamanians saw better things in other candidates. I have to  accept that with much humility, and therefore I want to form a  government that will reflect that national feeling.    [Reporter] Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon, you have just heard  Dr. Perez Balladares' opinion. What do you have to say about  this visit and about the other things that only you and Dr.  Perez Balladares discussed?    [Arias Calderon] For 21 years I struggled against the  dictatorship so we could live in democracy. Now that democracy  has born fruit in the most honest and peaceful elections that we  have had for as long as I can recall, I admit that he has won  the elections honestly and that he is the president-elect of  Panama. I appreciate his visit to my home. He has given me the  opportunity to talk with him about national problems, about  things that worry the people, such as keeping public security  demilitarized. He has reiterated his pledge to me -- just like  he has done to the country -- that it will be that way. I have  strengthened his concern about the administration of justice,  that it must be handled so their is not the slightest suspicion  of bias or politics. That is something that the country needs.  I have spoken of the need for a joint effort, just like he has  spoken of it, for an economic development that will stamp out  unemployment and help the thousands of men and women who are  jobless.    We also spoke about how to prepare the country to manage the  Canal. I think the president-elect is looking to the future. I  am certainly looking toward the future. I will support all  measures that are positive for Panama, and I will practice a  democratic and constructive criticism in everything that I  believe can be improved. He has invited me to voice my opinions  frankly, and I have done so. I appreciate his kind gesture today.    [Reporter] Dr. Arias Calderon, in the face of this joint  task ahead for the president-elect, did he make any offer for  the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] to rule jointly with the  PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] in the pursuit of better  social programs for the country?    [Arias Calderon] We did not talk about political offers  because that does not concern me. I am not the PDC president.  The party president is Raul Ossa, and the PDC candidate is  Eduardo Vallarino. I have spoken as one Panamanian to another,  as a Panamanian who struggled for democracy with a Panamanian  who has been democratically elected president. We have not  discussed offers at all; that was not part of the agenda. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] An "innovation center for microelectronics" is to be  created in Dresden. This involves two adjacent facilities to be  financed in different ways: one will be a joint project of  German business to develop future technology for electronic  semiconductors and the other a semiconductor factory which is  being planned by Siemens in association with the Japanese  electronics company Toshiba and the Center for Microelectronics  in Dresden (ZMD).    Experts say that the proximity of the research institute to  the production facility is particularly interesting. Following  the decision of the Daimler-Benz company to manufacture their  products in Rastatt, this project is also regarded as further  evidence from major industries that new production projects  located in Germany are possible.    With DM2.4 billion in investments spread over 10 years, this  will be the largest microelectronics project in Europe. At the  same time it is said to be the only production site in which the  entire technology of chip manufacture will be employed in  production. The project is to be presented this Thursday in  Dresden by Siemens board chairman Heinrich von Pierer and  Federal research minister Paul Krueger (CDU). Negotations on the  project have been conducted in strict secrecy over the past  three weeks. In Siemens' plan for chip manufacture, Toshiba is  to acquire 25 percent of the shares and the Center for  Microelectronics five percent. The Commerzbank AG and the  Dresdner Bank AG are participants in the ZMD. The production  center with 1,200 jobs in its final stage is to be constructed  next to the ZMD research park. The companies can count on public  subsidies of 35 percent of the investment total. These are not  research budget funds.    The principal chip production in Dresden will be of  application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for  telecommunications and automotive electronics. The production of  memory chips is possible, but is not to be of central  importance. The plant is to embody the concept of the  "mini-factory" for microelectronics. A modular structure is  intended to ensure that the transition to the next semiconductor  generation can be achieved at relatively low cost. The new  factory is to begin with the 16-megabit technology and gradually  widen its range to include up to 256 megabits.    The research and development unit ("nested factory") is to  consist of about 100 workers. Its task is to evaluate new chip  manufacturing technologies and introduce them into production.  The goal is to lower the wastage rate, which is sometimes 60  percent. The companies hope that an increase in profits will  partially offset the cost disadvantage in comparison with  semiconductor production in low-wage countries. The experience  gained in the optimization of production technologies is to be  made available to all German businesses. Besides Siemens,  Daimler-Benz, IBM and Bosch also figure prominently here.    These companies had already summed up their ideas over the  summer after negotiations with the Federal government in a  "consensus paper" on microelectronics. The Federal Research  Ministry then agreed to support joint projects with other  partners. The companies are reckoning on DM25 million.    For example, a personnel exchange e.g. with Bosch or  Daimler-Benz is anticipated. At the beginning of December, the  research ministry invited businesses to participate in the "chip  factory of the 21st century." Siemens also invited other  companies to work with them. The project is considered the first  concrete effect of the agreements which were made as early as  the spring in the "microelectronics dialog" between the  ministries of research and the economy on the one side and  German industry on the other. German microelectronics  manufacturers had agreed to support one another in the  introduction of new technologies or in cases when difficulties  arose with the technology so that valuable specialized knowledge  would not have to be kept within each company. Bonn says that  the conditional pledge of support does not mean an about-face in  research policy. It is said to be important that Germany possess  not only research institutes but also production plants for the  newest chip technologies. Even within the government coalition  there have been varying opinions over the past few years about  the question of whether the state should support production  plants for microelectronics.    The construction of a Siemens factory for memory chips was  already under discussion two years ago. But Siemens decided  against making this investment and noted that these electronic  components could also be produced in existing locations.  According to the company, the decision about the plant now being  planned was accelerated by the investment plans of Texas  Instruments (TI) in Saxony. The company wanted to produce  64-megabit memory chips there.</p>

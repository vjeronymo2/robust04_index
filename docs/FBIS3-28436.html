A commentary of NODONG SINMUN says there is probably no  other  pack of traitors like the Kim Yong-sam group which even bans  fellow countrymen from meeting each other while kissing  aggressive foreign forces.    The analyst notes:    For the Chondoist organisations of the North and the South  to  have a contact for a joint celebration of the centenary of the  Kabo Peasants' War was originally proposed as part of an  independent civilian-level dialogue; the authorities need not  and must not interfere in it.    However, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique of South Korea put  its nose into this matter and trampled upon the agreement on  having in early February a contact of Chondoist delegates of the  North and the South. This was an impudent act of those who do  not know their position and another unpardonable fascist outrage  of the treacherous regime wearing the "civilian" mask.    The Kim Yong-sam group brought forward the "nuclear issue",  blocking the contact between Chondoist delegates of the North  and the South. This was an absurd pretext to bar not only the  contact between Chondoist delegates, but also a joint  organisation of the celebration of the centenary of the Kabo  Peasants' War by the North and the South. This was a sophism  which could convince nobody. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, a  group of despicable traitors, truculent fascist dictators,  savages and villains, must be overthrown in South Korea.    Chondoists and other people of South Korea must not pin any  hope on the Kim Yong-sam traitor group but bring down a sledge  hammer on its head and throw it onto the dust pin of history,  united in a high patriotic spirit like the people who turned out  in the Kabo Peasants' War.    MINJU CHOSON in a commentary says the South Korean puppet  clique's blocking a working-level contact between Chondoist  delegates of the North and the South was an anti-national act of  those who do not know of the ancestors. This group of hooligans  must be removed from the nation as soon as possible, it stresses.</p>

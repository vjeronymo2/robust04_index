			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARIANS AND ROMANIANS MOVE TO SETTLE TROUBLE  </P> <P> Leaders of the feuding Romanian and ethnic Hungarian communities in this  divided Transylvanian city agreed on some moves Thursday to end tensions that  resulted in six deaths, hundreds of injured and a wave of strikes.  </P> <P> Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican headed compromise talks between the Hungarian  Democratic Union and the Vatra Romanesca nationalist movement.  </P> <P> While confrontations in the city's central square continued to flare, the  Rompres news agency said the Hungarian minority had won a demand for students  to be educated exclusively in Hungarian.  </P> <P> A statement said Vatra Romanesca accepted that the Hungarians, outnumbered four  to one by Romanians in Transylvania, did not want to separate the northern  province from Romania.  </P> <P> It said both sides called for an end to political strikes apparently called  mainly by Hungarians.  </P> <P> Demonstrators on Thursday taunted soldiers trying to keep peace between  Romanian nationalists and ethnic Hungarians. About 1,000 youths approached  tanks guarding Tirgu Mures' central square, shouting, "Transylvania is  Romanian" and "We want justice -- no privileges."  </P></p>

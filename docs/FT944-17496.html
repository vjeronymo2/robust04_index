			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Recovery fuelled by rising demand - South Korea's petrochemicals industry is coming back to life South Korean petrochemical companies are recovering from a prolonged slump due to increased demand abroad and the unexpected shutdown of several important petrochemical plants around the world. The improved outlook is in sharp contrast to the bleak situation that South Korea's eight leading petrochemical firms faced only a year ago. The industry, which ranks fifth in world production with a 4 per cent global share, then suffered from excess capacity after the government allowed a rush of new entries into the then-profitable petrochemical sector in the 1980s. To make matters worse, the worldwide recession of the early 1990s cut petrochemical prices and slowed sales for the Korean companies, which also had to bear heavy debt burdens from the rapid expansion of facilities. With the government regulating domestic petrochemical prices as part of an anti-inflation programme, South Korean companies were forced to dump their products in foreign markets at rates half that of international prices. 'During that period, South Korean petrochemical companies increased their capacity seven-fold, which disrupted the international price structure,' said Mr Kim Kyung-tae, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industry, Economy and Trade (KIET). As combined losses last year grew to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 875m in 1992, petrochemical makers unsuccessfully lobbied the government to permit them to form a 'recession cartel' that would limit production and set minimum prices. But companies are now reporting their first growth in profit for several years. Prices are climbing as a surge in Asian demand coincides with a cutback in global production caused by the temporary closure of several naphtha cracking complexes (NCC), which produce the raw material for petrochemical products. The production cuts follow recent accidental explosions at Exxon's facility in Louisiana and Enichem's Prioli plant in Italy, the largest ethylene producer in Europe. 'There have also been a series of unexpected plant shutdowns throughout Asia, including Malaysia and Taiwan. A couple of South Korean NCCs have also been closed this summer for routine repairs, while only 60 per cent of Japanese NCCs are fully operating now due to a water shortage from the worst drought in decades,' said an official at Lucky, the petrochemical unit of the Lucky-Goldstar group. This has provided an opportunity for South Korean petrochemical companies to fill growing demand in south-east Asia and China, its main export markets. Competing exports to the region from the US have fallen as its producers keep busy meeting rising domestic demand. There is also strong growth at home as South Korea's leading industries, which are enjoying an export boom, consume large amounts of petrochemicals as raw materials for their products. In the first half of 1994, Lucky reported a 61 per cent increase in net profits to Won41.9bn (Dollars 52.41m). Yukong, the nation's largest refiner, had a 22 per cent rise in net earnings to Won37bn, primarily due to the improved performance of its petrochemical business. Hanyang Chemicals reported a profit of Won3.5bn for the first half after losses of Won4.9bn last year. Losses at Honam Petrochemical, a subsidiary of the Lotte group, shrunk to Won11.1bn from Won35bn a year ago. 'The main reason behind the increased earnings is a sharp rise in the export prices of petrochemical products,' said Mr Ko Jae-pom, an official at the ministry of trade, industry and energy. 'Prices of ethylene, a major raw material for downstream petrochemicals, have soared by 67 per cent from Dollars 295 a tonne in January to Dollars 494 in September, while prices for polypropylene have also jumped to Dollars 895 in September from Dollars 535 in January.' Although analysts believed that the boom in petrochemical prices would only be temporary, there is growing optimism that the recovery may last a couple of years. 'The closed NCCs will not be able to operate until the second or third quarter of 1995, which should ensure a favourable business climate for the South Korean petrochemical industry for some time,' said the Lucky official. Mr Kim Jong-chul, an analyst with BZW Securities in Seoul, predicts that there will be a continuing shortage of petrochemical supplies for the Asian market due to the plant shutdowns and lower US exports to the region. 'We also expect a series of additional plant shutdowns to come on stream in the next couple of years as the producers raise operating rates of their NCC units, which would inevitably require more preventive and unexpected repair work,' he said. 'I think that the petrochemical companies may post another year of losses in 1994 or perhaps break even. But next year will show a return to profitability,' predicted Mr Kim at KIET. One sign of renewed confidence is that Samsung General Chemicals and several other petrochemical companies are asking the government for permission to expand their facilities. But the ministry of trade and industry, concerned about a possible renewed threat of overcapacity, is taking a cautious attitude to the requests until it is convinced that global demand will remain firm. The ministry, however, agreed this week to allow Samsung to expand its facilities for the production of styrene monomer, a secondary petrochemical product, with the understanding that the increased capacity would only be used for exports.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Second building society backs PIA BRADFORD and Bingley, the UK's seventh largest building society, has welcomed plans to form the Personal Investment Authority, the controversial self-regulatory body for retail financial services. The endorsement by Bradford and Bingley, the only big building society to remain a dispenser of independent financial advice, follows a similar decision by Halifax, the market leader. Earlier this month it became the first society to back the authority. The authority is intended to bring all retail financial services providers, including banks and building societies, under the umbrella of a single self-regulatory body. But in the authority's planning stages, banks and building societies had baulked at joining, and life insurance companies had said they would not join unless the banks did as well. Mr Geoffrey Lister, Bradford and Bingley chairman, said: 'The PIA would bring consistent rules and standards of supervision to the whole industry.' He also backed the decision by Halifax, which is a 'tied' agent so is allowed to sell only the products of one insurance provider. Tied agents do not need to belong to any self-regulatory body, but building society tied agents would find it easier within the authority than outside it to change rules that prevent them selling the products of more than one provider.</p>

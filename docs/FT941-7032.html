			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar weakens The dollar yesterday continued its recent decline in foreign exchange markets as weakness in US stocks and bonds put pressure on the currency, writes Philip Gawith. Renewed market fears of a stronger yen are also weighing on the dollar, as are worries that German interest rates may not fall as quickly as originally thought. The weakness of the US currency is puzzling analysts. It comes against the background of financial markets made nervous by fears of a further tightening in US rates - which should be positive for the dollar. The meeting today of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors in Frankfurt had a dampening effect on trading activity. Some investors were nervous of taking positions ahead of the summit for fear that post-summit statements might cause sharp fluctuations in rates. The dollar closed two and a half pfennigs lower in London at DM1.7055 from DM1.7306 on Thursday. It finished a cent lower compared to sterling at Dollars 1.4904, from Dollars 1.4796, and also dropped against the yen to Y104.725 from Y105.350. Until recently there was a fairly broad consensus behind a stronger dollar. Now this view is being called into question. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, comments: 'The consensus was tested in equity and bonds in the past few days. It may well be that the next stage in the game is to test the consensus of a rising dollar.' By contrast to the beleaguered dollar, the D-Mark was stronger against most EMS currencies. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank, said: 'The D-Mark's status as a safe haven currency seems to have re-emerged in this climate of uncertainty.' Analysts said the German currency had gained support from speculation that the January M3 figure, to be released this week or next, could be as high as 13 per cent. Others argue that an easing of policy in Germany is required to reduce pressure in bond markets, where rates rose sharply last week. 'The Bundesbank had better cut the repo rate pretty soon in order to burst the bubble otherwise things could get quite serious,' said Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO. The scope and pace of monetary easing in Europe is likely to be discussed at the G7 meeting today. The Belgian franc was quoted yesterday evening at 20.585/595 to the D-Mark, barely changed from Thursday's late 20.58/59 after the Belgian central bank cut its key central rate 15 basis points to 6.40 per cent. Sterling fell by nearly two pfennigs to finish in London at DM2.5418 from DM2.5605 on Thursday. Sentiment towards the UK currency soured on news that Malaysia had decided to impose trade sanctions against Britain. The downward revision by the CBI of its growth forecasts for 1994 and 1995 also had an impact. The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with around Pounds 60m of late assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.574bn. The revised forecast of the liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.55bn, slightly higher than the initial forecast of Pounds 1.5bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Werner </F> Sonne in Washington on 31 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Sonne] You have obviously dissuaded Bill Clinton  from continuing to threaten further military punitive actions  [in Bosnia-Herzegovina].    [Kohl] So far it is hard to understand where that would make  sense, because such actions would immediately affect the  civilian population and entail the obvious consequences. I do  not think that there are concrete plans that go beyond very  general ideas.    [Sonne] But no military intervention, chancellor.    [Kohl] No military intervention, but still action that is  based on the strength -- the economic strength -- of the  countries that are dealing with this issue.    [Sonne] The way I interpret is: economic aid -- yes,  military intervention -- no.    [Kohl] I would put it even more bluntly. Economic aid has  to be absolutely ruled out -- at least as far as I am concerned,  and from Germany's view -- if borders are changed there through  the use of force. At the 1991 CSCE summit conference we pledged  together that we would never again accept that borders be  changed through the use of force. If we start putting up with  it again anywhere in Europe, others will not hesitate to take  that as an example. Therefore, it is essential to nip things in  the bud.</p>

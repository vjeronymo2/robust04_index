			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THERE'S THE BEEF  </P> <P> One of the neat things about eating in Los Angeles is tracking the unexpected  ethnic twists that pop up now and again. The Inca-inflected fried rice at the  Peruvian-Chinese restaurants south of Hollywood, for example, or the lasagna at  that Thai-Italian place down by MacArthur Park. If you want to sample Korean  grill cooking modified to the Japanese taste, or the kind of Cantonese noodles  that say "home" to a Salvadoran, you can find them, too. And if you're looking  for a perfect triple-carom shot -- Continental cuisine cooked by Ecuadorans in  an Argentine restaurant -- there's La Choza, a newish parrillada joint where  you can dine on shrimp in Champagne-cream sauce and still get change back from  your $10. It's the kind of friendly neighborhood restaurant you'd want in your  neighborhood.  </P> <P> La Choza is a clean, modest place with upscale aspirations, located down the  road from a dozen body shops, five minutes' drive from the Pasadena Freeway.  You've reached it when you see the only Melrose-looking sign in Highland Park .  . . lemon-yellow neon that reads, oddly enough, "Gaucha Grill" . . . and pass  through the crowd of men who loiter around the Mexican cantina next door.  </P> <P> Inside, the walls are lined with thatch -- a "choza" is apparently a sort of  hut -- and are decorated with plants and Ecuadoran weavings. A small television  in a corner displays soundless nature documentaries; and on a scratchy  recording, an Andean panpipe band  </P> <P> rings many, many changes on a Simon and Garfunkel tune. On weekends, there's  live music, and as many as 35 or 40 people crowd into the pint-size dining room  to hear the thrumming guitar and eat hot, tasty empanadas.  </P> <P> "Have you tried the parrillada?" the waitress asks, spreading her arms wide to  indicate the immensity of the platter. "It is very, very good. Or the chicken.  It is . . . how you say? . . . chest of chicken, with mushrooms and champagne.  </P> <P> She points at her own chest in emphasis, and pronounces champagne  "sham-pahn-yuh," in the French manner.  </P> <P> "It is very, very good," she says. "Also, Americans like the roasted pork. It  is very good."  </P> <P> "You tell us," my friend says. "Which one do you like the best?"  </P> <P> The waitress shivers a little.  </P> <P> "Oh no, none of them," she says. "Most of the time I never like to eat meat."  </P> <P> Most of the time what people like to eat at La Choza is meat, specifically the  mesquite-grilled parrillada, a sort of garlicky best-of-cow sampler for two  that includes slabs of short ribs, lobes of sweetbreads, tripe and an odd  cylinder of steak, along with a couple of lengths of mild Argentine-Italian  sausage and some chicken thrown in for good measure. (Not included in this  version of the Argentine national dish is the traditional squiggle of carefully  grilled spinal cord, which I don't miss, and the fat, pungent blood sausage,  which I do.)  </P> <P> The parrillada isn't the best in town -- that would still have to be at Don  Felipe, in Hollywood -- but it's very good, cooked rare if that's the way you  ask for it, and at $15.25 for two, including a green salad, something of a  bargain. It comes with ramekins of the Argentine parsley sauce chimichurri --  the closest thing to a vegetable you're going to get on that plate, unless you  count French fries -- and the terrific Ecuadoran chile sauce aji.  </P> <P> "Try to say it: a-hee," the waitress says. "If you do not say it, I will not  bring you any more. A-hee." We do try . . . the aji is worth a certain amount  of embarrassment.  </P> <P> Sometimes, nothing but two full pounds of screaming meat will do. And sometimes  it won't do at all. The "Continental" dishes here alone may not be worth a  commute from Santa Monica or Rosemead. But La Choza's chef, who's worked in  several of L.A.'s fancier kitchens, has a knack for thick, old-fashioned cream  sauces, scented with mushrooms or lightly touched with garlic (also kind of  oversalted), blanketing shrimp or chicken or noodles. It may not be La Toque,  but it's a lot better than you'd expect from an eight-buck plate of shrimp.  </P> <P> The best food in the place, though, is found in the half-dozen Ecuadoran dishes  on the last page of the menu: an Ecuadoran take on chicken-fried steak; the  spicy, sweet goat stew called seco de chivo; a mess of tripe and rice called  arroz con guatita. Especially delicious is the most popular Ecuadoran dish,  llapingachos -- crisply fried mashed-potato-and-cheese patties on top of  Ecuadoran-style roast pork with onions (something like a tastier, herbed  version of carnitas) and topped in turn with fried eggs.  </P> <P> La Choza, 5930 York Blvd., Highland Park, (213) 255-1900. Open daily, noon-11  p.m. Cash only. Beer and wine. Dinner for two, food only, $15-20.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Lottery angers pools workers - National Lottery USDAW, the union representing workers in the pools industry, voted unanimously yesterday to campaign against the introduction of a national lottery, warning that it could cost thousands of jobs. The long-awaited announcement of plans for a UK lottery was first made in March by the then home secretary, Mr Kenneth Baker, after a determined campaign by lobby groups and a number of prominent MPs and public figures. The new Department of National Heritage, under Mr David Mellor, is charged with setting up the lottery, with proceeds going to sport, arts, heritage, charities and a new Millennium Fund to celebrate the year 2000. It is estimated that the lottery could raise up to Pounds 1bn a year. An independent board will be responsible for distribution of the proceeds, with day-to-day management undertaken by the private sector under contract. Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw's general secretary, warned that the lottery could have a serious impact on the pools industry. 'If the pools companies lose business then our members lose their jobs,' he told the union's annual conference in Blackpool. Delegates unanimously backed a motion to campaign against the lottery and to call for support from the TUC and the Labour party to block the bill. The pools industry has an annual turnover of Pounds 700m and employs nearly 7,000 people, mainly in Liverpool, with some in Glasgow and Cardiff. It also provides part-time employment for around 70,000 collectors around the country. Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons pools in Liverpool, said he was sceptical of the claim by lottery supporters that there was plenty of room in the market for both pools and a lottery. He said the argument that annual spending on gambling in the UK is considerably lower than in other countries did not take account of the true size and diversity of the British gambling market. Littlewoods, the biggest pools promoter, said it had been invited to make a joint submission about the lottery with Vernons and Zetters pools to the government by the beginning of June. A spokesman said he did not rule out the possibility that the pools industry might bid to run the lottery itself. 'We have raised billions of pounds over many years and would certainly be the most qualified to run it,' he said. Mr Denis Vaughan, the conductor, and head of the Lottery Promotion Company which has been lobbying for a lottery for more than a year, said he was delighted with the proposed format, but was anxious that the proceeds should be used only for capital investment and endowments. He dismissed the threat to the pools industry, saying that several thousand jobs were already at risk from a possible move towards online computer systems. He added that any job losses in that area would be more than offset by the estimated 85,000 jobs that could be created through investment of lottery proceeds.</p>

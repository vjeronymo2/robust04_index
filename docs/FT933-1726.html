			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Power group optimistic on financing HYDRO-QUEBEC'S hectic financing activity should ease in 1994 as the interest rate curve flattens, said Mr Daniel Leclair, vice-president financing and treasurer. Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest power utilities, estimates its 1993 financing operations in domestic and global markets at about CDollars 4.9bn, including CDollars 2.4bn for borrowing needs and CDollars 2.5bn of refinancing and redemptions to take advantage of declining rates. In 1994, it expects total financing of between CDollars 4bn and CDollars 4.5bn, including CDollars 3bn for fresh needs. It has reduced its average interest cost from 11 per cent in 1988 to 9.4 per cent in 1993, and expects a further reduction next year. The 1994 programme will again be mainly in Canadian dollar and Euro-Canadian markets, and US dollars.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROLLINS TAKES SMORGASBORD APPROACH TO ARTS;  </P> <P> FOUNDER OF PUNK PIONEER BLACK FLAG BRINGS HIS ECLECTIC ACT TO CAL STATE  </P> <P> Since the 1986 breakup of Black Flag, founding member Henry Rollins has taken  the smorgasbord approach to life: publishing books, telling stories, releasing  spoken-word recordings and tending to his music.  </P> <P> "I'm always eating, but I'm switching plates," Rollins said this week from his  home in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Rollins, who was lead singer  for Black Flag, the L.A. punk pioneers, will perform tonight at Cal State  Fullerton's University Center Pub.  </P> <P> Rollins' spoken performances started as more-or-less formal readings when he  first appeared in 1983 at the Lhasa Club in Los Angeles. His stage act has  since become more improvisational, relying less on his writings and more on  spinning tales from real life.  </P> <P> "I've just been telling stories," said Rollins, 28, whose act has been  described as "part pantomime, part stand-up comedy, part guerrilla theater."  </P> <P> He also continues to write daily in his journal. His eighth self-published book  is at the printer.  </P> <P> "For me, writing can't capture what I do with the speaking," he said. "When I  speak, I just kind of go off."  </P> <P> Although he has been telling his stories for several years now, it can still be  frightening to face an audience alone. "I just finished 10 weeks of this  (international) tour, and it's the hardest thing I've ever done," Rollins said.  "You can't hide behind the music."  </P> <P> He likened the experience to "unpeeling yourself like a navel orange: You feel  kind of raw afterward."  </P> <P> Rollins started writing in high school, as a way of expressing the alienation  he felt as a teen, which he described as a "horrible" part of his life: "I used  to just write to get it out of me, and that's what I still do."  </P> <P> Later, when he was invited to sing for Black Flag, he found an outlet in music.  </P> <P> He continues to pursue his music and is negotiating a recording contract for  the Henry Rollins Band. The group has a studio album in the can and plans to  embark in August for a 7-month world tour.  </P> <P> In music, as in his writings and spoken performances, Rollins said, he strives  for an honest connection with his audience, preferring to dispense with  show-biz conventions. Rollins seems to have struck a chord: He said he gets  almost 100 letters a week, many from young people who write to say they relate  to Rollins' stories and songs, which often deal with the trials of growing up.  </P> <P> "That gets me all feeling good," Rollins said. "People are really hungry for  direct communication."  </P> <P>  Henry Rollins will appear tonight at 8 in Cal State Fullerton's University  Center Pub, 800 N. State College Blvd. in Fullerton. Advance tickets are $6 for  students and $7 general; $8 at the door. Information: (714) 773-3501.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Bomb  <H4>    Court Date Expected 20 June </H4>  <F P=102> BK1006025494 Bangkok THE NATION in English 10 Jun 94 pp A1,  A4 </F>  <F P=103> BK1006025494 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok THE NATION </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Excerpts] The Iranian Embassy here yesterday called on  Thai authorities to be more vigilant against what it called  "Zionist circles" that are trying to damage the prestige of  Iran, as the court remanded for 12 more days three Iranians  arrested last week in connection with the truck bomb plot in  March.    The embassy, in a brief statement, said Iran "strongly  rejects and condemns any act of terrorism against the life of  innocent people and considers it un-Islamic and inhuman."  [passage omitted]    The three suspects were escorted to the Criminal Court,  tightly guarded by heavily-armed police commandos, yesterday to  be remanded for 12 more days as requested by investigators.    They were transferred to the Khlong Prem Central Prison for  detention after the court approved a police request for the  remand.    Investigators said they needed some more time to complete  the  questioning of 10 more witnesses and collect evidence to  substantiate charges against the three in court.    They also asked the court to deny any bail request for the  suspects, fearing they could flee.    Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen Sophon  Warachanon said yesterday he expected the suspects to be charged  in court in 10 days.</p>

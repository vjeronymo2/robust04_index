			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with National Assembly Speaker Sa'di </F> Mahdi Salih by Sami Kulayb in Paris; date not given]    [Text] The speaker of the Iraqi parliament, Sa'di Mahdi  Salih, has affirmed that France, Russia, and China have changed  their stances on Iraq. He said that the United States is  adamantly adhering to its current stance for political reasons,  which are supported by some Arab countries, and economic reasons  stemming from the fear of Baghdad's return to the oil market.  He pointed out that Iraqi authorities have implemented all the  international resolutions, including the recognition of Kuwait.  He accused Kurdish leader Mas'ud Barzani of working for  Washington's interests.    AL-SAFIR met Salih in Paris, where he was heading the Iraqi  parliamentary delegation to the 19th conference of the  International Parliamentary Union held at UNESCO headquarters  and attended by parliamentarians from 125 countries, among them  many Arabs countries, including Kuwait. This conference is  usually dedicated to looking into issues of international  interest, human rights, and bolstering democratic action.    During his speech, French President Francois Mitterrand  stressed issues of work, environmental protection, and  development. However, the Iraqi delegation, which is currently  visiting Paris for the first time since the occupation of  Kuwait, stressed other goals. Salih summarized these goals by  explaining Iraq's viewpoint to the international forum and  presenting the issue of major concern to Iraq: lifting the  economic boycott.    [Kulayb] We learned that a meeting took place on the  sidelines among the Arab parliamentarians. What were their  stances on lifting the boycott?    [Salih] The Arab meeting took place on the sidelines of the  international meeting. In general, activities during such  meetings are restricted to coordinating stances that will be  presented during the international conference. This is why  these issues were discussed, and we reached an agreement on a  way to bolster Arab issues and proposals, including lifting the  boycott on Iraq.    [Kulayb] Much is being said about a change in the French  stance regarding Iraq. Is this serious?    [Salih] I believe that it is serious; France headed those  countries that demanded that the lifting of the siege of Iraq  should be discussed in a new way, not in the usual way that  always followed an American opinion. In short, this American  formulation maintains that there is nothing new in Iraq's stance  and, therefore, the boycott must continue. But now the French,  Russian, and Chinese have rejected this argument. They believe  that Iraq has implemented many of the resolutions and a new  stance must be taken. I believe that this is a good beginning.    [Kulayb] What are the obstacles preventing the lifting of  the boycott, just so long as Iraq has implemented all or most of  the international resolutions? Is it American policy or the  economy and Iraq's return to the oil market?    [Salih] Of course, the political stance is the main reasons.  The Americans and their Arab allies want to achieve the  objective they failed to achieve through the use of weapons,  that is, changing the regime in Iraq. This in itself is a  violation of the UN Charter and of the right of people to choose  the regimes they want. We still believe that this is not a good  policy and will not achieve any results.    The second factor is economic. The oil-producing countries  oppose Iraq's return to the oil market because this would mean a  new reduction in oil prices. This is selfish. The oil issue  should be treated in accordance with quotas. Prices can be  stabilized only when quotas are redistributed and the highest  production ceiling is maintained. We believe that Kuwait and  Saudi Arabia are using this method now.    [Kulayb] The West wants you to declare a clear position on  the border issue with Kuwait. Why don't you recognize the  borders and Kuwait's sovereignty over these borders?    [Salih] Actually, we are taken aback when this issue is  submitted in this manner. Until 2 August 1990 Iraq had  recognized Kuwait as a state and had treated its amir as a head  of state. Kuwait's amir was even honored by the al-Rafidayn  medal first class. But things changed when we entered Kuwait  militarily. We believe that there are known factors behind  this, because the plot was exposed and Kuwait's amir was the  perpetrator of this plot against Iraq. Everything is now clear,  since we implemented the Security Council resolutions. The  issue of Kuwait is in the past, as stated by Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz. 'Aziz even reiterated this stance in his  message to the Security Council president, French Ambassador  Jean-Bernard Merimee.    [Kulayb] What about your relations with Iran and Turkey?    [Salih] I prefer not to talk about this subject. We had  excellent relations with Turkey. We still maintain some of  these ties, but we hope that one day we will promote our  bilateral relations. Iran's stance is variable, shifting  between negative and positive aspects. We hope that Iran, as a  Muslim neighbor country, will adopt the correct attitude toward  Iraq. This is not difficult for Iran. This would benefit both  countries.    [Kulayb] The Western countries continue their embargo on  Iraq, and you continue to besiege the Kurds. Why did the  relations deteriorate with the Kurds in the north and the  Shiites in the south?    [Salih] I believe that those who are objective would find  that all that is being said on these matters is untrue and  inaccurate. As for the Shiites, they are leading Iraq side by  side with t?eir Sunni brothers. Concerning the Kurdish problem,  if the United States, Britain, and France withdrew their troops  deployed in southern Turkey, the situation would return to its  pre-1990 status. Iraq's Kurds enjoy full rights. They have  their autonomous region and their language: the second official  language in Iraq. They also have their local parliament and  government.    [Kulayb] We asked you the question because Mas'ud Barzani  has  increased his attacks on Iraq, and also because the Kurds stress  that Baghadad has imposed a new oil embargo on Kurdistan.    [Salih] The whole country is under siege. Therefore, the  talk about the siege of Kurdistan is of no use. Barzani's  attacks on Iraq are motivated by the United States. The game  has been uncovered and it is disgraceful for an Iraqi to talk in  this way. This is treason.</p>

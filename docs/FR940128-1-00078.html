			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Developing generic plans by FDA that list critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control points and contain other information for various industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Deleting some or all of the proposed specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Requiring HACCP only for the domestic industry. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP requirements would become the basis for negotiating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements with other countries relating to the equivalency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Deleting or modifying the proposed training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Requiring HACCP for processing hazards only. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canadian HACCP system does not involve species-related safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Exempting warehouses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Although only in guidelines (Appendix B, Scombroid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toxin-Forming Species), sanctioning the receipt by a processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a harvester of an assurance of good handling practices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than detailed time/temperature records. Such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance, without further verification, would be acceptable only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from harvesters with histories of delivering acceptable products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These four alternative approaches to implementing these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Comments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invited on them in combination as well as on them individually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Information and Consumer Awareness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to requesting comment on alternative approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to HACCP, FDA is taking the opportunity to invite comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general subject of complementary risk reduction activities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily directed toward postprocessing handling. Elsewhere in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document, FDA invited comment on the advisability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying HACCP or alternative regulatory approaches to commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities that are not directly subject to these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, i.e., harvesting vessels, common carriers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail establishments (although not necessarily doing so as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this rulemaking). In addition, FDA seeks comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate education and information that should be directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward consumers and recreational fishermen. The commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of HACCP principles can mitigate somewhat the effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of poor consumer handling practices by helping to ensure that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe product reaches the home, but no such program can prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses caused by improper home handling. Similarly, HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practiced by processors can have no effect on recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishermen who consume their own catch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education has always been an important part of FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive seafood safety program, but the agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that more can be done. Recent FDA education projects include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiation of a seafood hotline, which has been consulted by over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26,000 individuals on a wide range of seafood safety issues since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it began in October 1992. (The hotline can be reached by calling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toll-free, 1&hyph;800&hyph;FDA&hyph;4010.) FDA also recently developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brochures aimed at advising certain medically compromised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations that they should not eat molluscan shellfish without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate cooking. FDA invites comment on other types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education and information activities that might be useful,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including more information that might be made available through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grocery stores, pharmacies, and other establishments, through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> media, and through other means, including labeling. FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering the merits of labeling information for consumers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molluscan shellfish, and will address this issue in proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate from these regulations. FDA notes that several states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have already mandated, or are in the process of mandating, point-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of-purchase information for raw molluscan shellfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also invites comment on whether FDA should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider proposing to require handling instructions for consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the labeling of seafood. The Department of Agriculture has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed such requirements for meat and poultry (58 FR 58922,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 4, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has a longstanding program to control the levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms of public health concern in seafood. This program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes compliance policies on such levels, including zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels (i.e., none detectable based upon official methods) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such pathogens as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Listeria monocytogenes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in cooked, ready-to-eat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in all foods. These proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require control of microbial pathogens through HACCP principles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including specific sanitation controls. Even so, FDA recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no system can reduce all risks to zero. Because all foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the home, including seafood, are subject to mishandling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross contamination from other sources, FDA invites comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general subject of handling instructions. Should FDA decide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to propose handling instructions, it would do so as a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal separate from the proposed HACCP requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule contains requirements for information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collections which are subject to review by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1980. The title, description, and respondent description of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information collection are shown below with an estimate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for the Safe Processing and Importing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fish and Fishery Products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

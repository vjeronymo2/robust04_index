			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Spain by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>   [Excerpt] We have heard the prime minister's initial  reaction to the assassination attempt against President Mubarak.  The question in this context is whether an attempt of this kind  will unsettle the relations between Israel and the Arab world,  and most notably those between Israel and Egypt. Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks reflect his emphatic endorsement of the  Israeli-Egyptian relations:    [Begin Rabin recording] I believe in the strength of  Mubarak's regime. I believe the majority of the people support  him. Yet there are radical elements, a phenomenon  characteristic in many Arab countries in which terrorism is not  repudiated. We have learned that terrorism is an integral part  of the essence of many Arab countries, and it is not exclusive  to the Palestinian, Lebanese, or Israeli context. The peace  process must be pursued despite the difficulties, of which we  are aware. As for peace in Egypt, I believe in the fortitude of  Mubarak's regime in that country. [end recording]    This was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's first public  reaction  to the news of the assassination attempt against President  Mubarak. The issue of terror, to which Mr. Rabin referred,  constituted a considerable part of his conversation with Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez. The two men discussed Islamic  fundamentalism in Iran, among Palestinians, in Sudan, Lebanon,  and in countries closer to Spain, such as Algeria.    It was disclosed in Prime Minister Rabin's meeting with  Gonzalez that Spain will assist Israel's efforts to advance its  ties with the Arab world. It should be stressed that Spain has  very good relations with many Arab countries in North Africa,  the Persian Gulf, and particularly monarchic regimes. Prime  Minister Gonzalez prefers to work quietly and not to advertise  the Spanish efforts, but he promised to advance Israel's  interests in Arab countries. [passage omitted]</p>

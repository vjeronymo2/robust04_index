			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Chrysler plans to reduce number of parts suppliers Chrysler, the US carmaker, is planning a radical reduction in the number of its first-tier components suppliers to about 150 from 1,200 at present. It is also expected in December to approve an increase in its expenditure programme to about Dollars 22.5bn (Pounds 14.2bn) for the five years from 1995 to 1999. That compares with Dollars 20bn planned for the period 1994-98. After coming close to financial collapse at the beginning of the 1990s, Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US carmakers, has emerged as the most profitable of them, with record profits of Dollars 1.89bn, in the first six months of this year. It has become one of the world's lowest-cost carmakers, partly as the result of reforms to the structure of its supply base. Most of the world's leading carmakers are sharply reducing the number of their suppliers in order to simplify and streamline their operations, but Chrysler has taken one of the most radical approaches. First-tier suppliers are being asked to shoulder much more of the research and development burden for new products, and in return are being rewarded with much longer-term contracts and, increasingly, single-source contracts. Mr Tom Stallkamp, Chrysler vice-president for purchasing, said the company had already reduced the number of its first-tier suppliers from 3,000 five years ago. Chrysler's top 150 suppliers account for 90 per cent of its Dollars 27bn total purchasing of parts, goods, services and equipment. It has cut the number of its tyre suppliers from seven to two, its paint suppliers from five to two and the number of its wiring suppliers from 14 to two. Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman and chief executive, said the company intended to concentrate on the core activities of overall vehicle design and development, sheet metal stamping and car assembly, and developing engines and transmissions and electronics. It had one of the lowest levels of 'vertical integration' among western carmakers, buying in almost 70 per cent of the cost of a vehicle from outside suppliers. Mr Stallkamp said greater integration of leading outside suppliers into its operations since 1990-91 had led to suppliers' putting forward proposals for cost savings totalling Dollars 921m. Savings totalling Dollars 504m had been approved this year and the company was targeting savings of Dollars 750m in 1995.</p>

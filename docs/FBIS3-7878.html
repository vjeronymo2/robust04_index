Primakov, who arrived for a two-day visit to the Slovak  Republic on Tuesday [22 February], met with deputy chairman of  Slovak Parliament Augustin Marian Huska and Deputy Premier Jozef  Prokes. He will also meet President Michal Kovac.    Our guest did not raise any objections against Slovakia's  effort to integrate with European systems, said Huska.    "Shall we wait until various parts of the Russian or Chechen  mafias establish themselves easily in Slovakia?," Huska replied  to the question whether it was dangerous to establish contacts  during the current unstable period in the two countries.    Both Primakov and Samolis refused to comment on the "Ames  spying affair."</p>

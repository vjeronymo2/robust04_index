			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Beacon Investment Trust raises Pounds 19m A new investment trust specialising in small companies traded under Stock Exchange Rule 4.2 - until recently known as Rule 535.2 - has raised Pounds 19m through an institutional placing. The Beacon Investment Trust is to be managed by Rutherford Asset Management, joining a stable of trusts concentrating on smaller companies. Beacon will seek to exploit the opportunities created by London's commitment to develop the Rule 4.2 market, seen as a successor to the USM. Shares in the trust will be eligible for inclusion in personal equity plans, which should boost its appeal to private investors. The shares have been issued at 100p, having an initial net asset value of at least 96.5p, with one warrant attached to every five shares. The trust will have an initial life of 10 years. Dealings are due to start on August 8. The Rule 4.2 market is a more lightly regulated and cheaper home for small company shares than the Official List. It originally operated by means of matched bargains, but there is growing involvement by marketmakers. Companies using the trading facility include football clubs and Weetabix.</p>

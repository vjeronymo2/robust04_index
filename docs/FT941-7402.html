			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Engineering workers stage protest Almost 300,000 engineering workers took part in token strikes and mass rallies across Germany yesterday, in a bid to bring their employers back to negotiations over their pay claim, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The mass day of action, the biggest so far in the wage round, was part of deliberate pressure by the engineering trade union, IG Metall, before a strike ballot is held in the state of Lower Saxony next week. The action coincided with the third round of pay talks for 3m public sector workers, in which employers are insisting on a pay freeze. The unions want a 4 per cent pay rise to keep pace with inflation.</p>

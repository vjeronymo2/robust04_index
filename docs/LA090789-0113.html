			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: RAUL JULIA'S ARCHBISHOP ROMERO: A HERO, A SAINT AND A HUMAN  BEING  </P> <P> The range of roles an actor plays, especially a fine character actor like Raul  Julia, is always bemusing, sometimes amazing, to contemplate.  </P> <P> Julia has perhaps most famously been a prisoner confined to a cell with a  flamboyant gay (in "Kiss of the Spider Woman"). He has with equal intensity  been a murderous hairdresser (in "The Morning After"), a corrupt  drug-enforcement official ("Tequila Sunrise"), the schemer behind the  dictator's throne ("Moon Over Parador") and Macheath (in a forthcoming film  version of "The Threepenny Opera").  </P> <P> Now he is the martyred Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador in "Romero," the  ambitious and precedent-creating feature film produced by Father Ellwood Kieser  and financed in part by the Paulist order.  </P> <P> Despite the auspices, Julia insisted during a recent brief visit to Los  Angeles: "It's important to make clear this is not a Catholic film. It's about  a human being who grew. The archbishop evolved from an ordinary and quite timid  person to a great popular hero.  </P> <P> "But he could have been a rabbi during World War II, fighting the Nazis, or a  Tibetan monk against the Chinese. The purpose is to show the way a human being  can reach the heights of humanity, and how one man can make a difference."  </P> <P> The assassination of Archbishop Romero had previously been dramatized in Oliver  Stone's "Salvador," and "Romero" from its different angle of attack captures  much the same sense of a society collapsing in a blood bath of  government-sanctioned butchery.  </P> <P> In lieu of James Woods' cynical and exploitative journalist being changed as he  experiences the appalling violations of human rights, "Romero" offers Julia as  the bookish priest undergoing a quite similar conversion as he is forced to  confront what is happening in the country he loves.  </P> <P> "It's the ideal for an actor," Julia says, "to be able to show that growth, the  movements and the emotions, the mountains and the valleys. These days, we seem  to have in the movies either unrealistic superheroes or bums who end up in  jail. Here you have a man who was not a superhero but who did things far beyond  his own small personal self."  </P> <P> The events of "Romero," Julia says, took place within political and religious  circumstances. But he insists again, "It's not a film about politics or  religion and it doesn't urge a fight for a particular cause, except for the  cause of humanity, seen at its best, as you see it at its worst."  </P> <P> Julia, 49 and Puerto Rico-born, was on track to become a lawyer.  </P> <P> "My family thought it was a way to economic security, and so did I," he says.  But even as he was finishing his pre-law studies, he changed course.  </P> <P> "I looked inside myself and said, what did I really like to do best? And that  was to act. And so I decided that that was what I was going to do, no matter  what. Forget the economic insecurity."  </P> <P> Julia finished his degree at the University of Puerto Rico and went to New  York, where he still lives.  </P> <P> Work came quickly, in television and in a long and ongoing association with Joe  Papp and his Public Theatre productions of Shakespeare. Julia has acted in  "Othello," "Macbeth," "Titus Andronicus," "Hamlet," "Two Gentlemen of Verona,"  "As You Like It" and "King Lear."  </P> <P> Doing "Romero" has not specifically changed his life, Julia says, but it has  deepened his awareness of the conditions amid which the archbishop lived and  died.  </P> <P> "I knew about Romero; how could you not? He was outspoken on the violations of  civil rights in El Salvador. And I remember the outrage, the fury I felt when I  heard of the assassination. That someone could walk into a church while the  archbishop was saying Mass and murder him! And the man who did it is still  walking around free today. It said something about the state of the nation."  </P> <P> One of the other things he learned from doing the role, Julia says, is that the  archbishop was a flawed human being. "The saints are flawed. It makes them  closer to us. To me a saint is someone who has become 100% human. The more  human, the more saintly."  </P> <P> In death, Julia realized during the making of the film, Romero has been the  pre-eminent symbol of the struggle for human rights in Central America. "It  takes a lot of bravery, but there are many people inspired to carry on with his  kind of commitment."  </P> <P> Playing a real rather than a fictional character is always a special and  sometimes uncomfortable assignment for an actor, more than ever when the  character has, as Romero has, the popular status of a saint and martyr.  </P> <P> "My largest concern," Julia says, "was to do him in such a way that it was not  an insult to the people who knew him and revere him. I wanted to do justice to  him in the eyes of those who loved him."  </P> <P> The film, which opens Friday, has now been seen by some of the archbishop's  friends and the first responses, Julia says, are reassuring and relieving. An  Episcopal priest who heads a civil rights commission in El Salvador and knew  Romero for years told Julia, "You've got him." The present archbishop saw the  film and said it had his blessing.  </P> <P> "What better satisfaction for me," says Julia, "than the approval of his  friends, just the fact that they're not insulted."  </P></p>

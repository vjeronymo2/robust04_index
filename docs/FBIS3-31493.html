			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The environmentalist  movement Duha [Rainbow] is demanding an explanation from the  government and the Czech Power Company, CEZ, on why it has been  concealing sections of international reports casting doubt on  the Temelin nuclear power station.    At a press conference today, Duha member Jan Beranek claimed  the movement had obtained from the Library of the European Union  a copy of a report conducted by the Belgian company Tractebel  and financed by PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for  Poland and Hungary]-Energy. The first part of the report has  been frequently cited by the Czech Government because the  completion of the Temelin plant in southern Bohemia is described  as the cheapest way of meeting the national energy requirement,  he said.    The second part, however, which deals with energy saving  possibilities in the Czech Republic, is suppressed, Beranek  claimed. The report concludes that investment into energy saving  measures would cost less than the production of electricity by  any method, including Temelin.    A second study -- by the German Society for Nuclear Safety  --  observed that progress at the Temelin site was in fact very much  less advanced than officially claimed. It also produced a  higher cost estimate for the conversion and completion of  Temelin than has been published in the Czech Republic, Beranek  said.    Duha also pointed to a World Bank report from January this  year which allegedly showed that loans offered to the Czech  Republic for the desulfurization of coal power stations in north  Bohemia (the loans were called "Energy II") and for the  recultivation of disused open cast mines ("Environment") were  suspended because of the "unconfirmed interest of the Czech  Government."    The decision will definitely slow the environmental clean-up  of northern Bohemia, Beranek said. He added that the Czech  Government had granted a state guarantee to the completion of  Temelin probably at the expense of the desulfurization of the  coal plants.</p>

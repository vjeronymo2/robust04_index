			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Chairman warns against increased trade tensions MR MICHAEL Perry, Unilever chairman, expressed concern yesterday at the recent rise in transatlantic tensions over trade and warned European Community governments against allowing national self-interest to block completion of the single market. 'Even if there may be a flicker of hope that economic growth might resume sometime in 1993, we are increasingly worried by the unhelpful political trends which are now all too evident,' he said. Mr Perry added that resolution of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was long overdue. Though Unilever, as a strong supporter of free trade, was disturbed by the protectionist noises on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr Perry made clear that he was particularly concerned by the attitude of the Clinton administration. He singled out for criticism demands in the US to increase the tax burden on the local operations of foreign companies, arguing that such discrimination would damage the world economy. However, he said recent proposals appeared less extreme than those floated during Mr Clinton's presidential campaign.</p>

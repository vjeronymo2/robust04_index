			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Planning new rail link for Heathrow A KIER/LILLEY/KUNZ joint venture has been awarded a Pounds 1.16m contract by Heathrow Airport to build a trial tunnel beneath Heathrow Airport in preparation for its new Express rail link. The purpose of the 100 metre-long test section is to assess the settlement levels of the new Austrian tunnelling method (NATM) prior to its first use in London clay. The NATM or Shotcrete method activates the loadbearing capacity of the soil by a combination of the sequence and pattern of excavation and support elements. Support will primarily consist of sprayed concrete (Shotcrete) reinforcement and steel girders. Subject to successful trial results, NATM will be used on all the airport station tunnels of the Pounds 235m Paddington to Heathrow link. The trial tunnel will eventually become part of the running tunnel between the airport's central terminals and Terminal 4. Work began on January 27 with completion scheduled for 20 weeks. The total tunnel length to Terminal 4 will be 6.6km including a 'cut and cover' section north of the M4.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today says  in a by-lined article on the 30th anniversary of the heroic June  3 uprising of the South Korean people that the South Korean  students and people will continue to fight vigorously till they  have swept away the aggressors and traitors and established a  true independent and democratic government by inheriting the  fighting spirit of the participants in the uprising.    The June 3 uprising of South Korean students and people in  1964 against the aggressive and treacherous "talks" between the  Japanese reactionaries and puppets was a just anti-imperialist,  anti-fascist democratic resistance to do away with the foreign  forces and traitors and restore the national dignity and  sovereignty.    Thirty years have passed since the uprising, but the desire  of the South Korean people to live in an independent society  free from foreign domination and interference has not yet been  realized.    South Korea still remains a U.S. colony and military base  and its people fall victim to it.    Because of the flunkeyist treacherous acts of the Kim  Yong-sam group the U.S. political, economic and military  domination over South Korea is intensifying and the people's  sovereignty is violated ruthlessly.    Having brought the North-South dialogue to a total freeze at  the instigation of the United States, the Kim Yong-sam group  committed without hesitation such never-to-be-condoned crimes  as unilaterally nullifying the "joint declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" which was adopted and  effectuated by the North and the South and announcing its  renouncement.    The reality shows that independence and democratization of  the South Korean society and national reunification can neither  be achieved, nor can the nation avoid suffering a nuclear  holocaust if such flunkeyist traitors and war fanatics as the  Kim Yong-sam group are left intact.</p>

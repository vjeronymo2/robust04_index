			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEW TRANSIT CHIEF MIGHT NEED TIME TO GET UNTRACKED  </P> <P> Alan Kiepper wanted to start off his first day as president of the Transit  Authority on the right foot. Instead, he started it on the wrong train.  </P> <P> The new subway chief got lost on the F line and ended up in Queens last week  instead of the TA's headquarters in Brooklyn.  </P> <P> But Kiepper, 10 minutes late for a staff meeting, showed his managerial sense  of direction by launching a review of train- and station-cleaning standards and  asking his staff to brainstorm on how to speed up a station-restoration  program.  </P> <P> Still, Subway Map Reading 101 might be useful.  </P> <P> Before boarding the wrong train in Manhattan, Kiepper took time to stop and  give directions to a man looking for the No. 6 train.  </P> <P> "I found out later I gave him the wrong directions," Kiepper said.  </P></p>

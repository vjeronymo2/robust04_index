			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Books: Society versus self - AC Grayling considers rights and responsibilities THE PRINCIPLE OF DUTY by David Selbourne Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15, 288 pages A chord is immediately struck by Selbourne's claim that the contemporary social order is corrupted by its overemphasis on rights and demands, and by his call for a new order based on civic bonds of duty. No doubt many will immediately see the welfare scrounger as the paradigm of what Selbourne attacks; but his views apply equally to those whose self-enrichment is made possible by the protection of society, but who resent contributing, whether through taxation or otherwise, to its common good. Selbourne's diagnosis of society's present disease is telling, and although his prescription for its remedy is not novel, it is timely and compelling. In an earlier work, The Spirit of The Age, he described the collapse of society into a 'phantom order' from which meaningful social relationships have vanished. In this new work he argues for a revitalised civic order based on principles of duty and obligation. Both the right and the old left in politics are roundly criticised for their role in the collapse of society, and Selbourne offers in their place what he calls 'social-ism', written with a hyphen to show that it is not the old socialist theory which 'reduces mankind to the level of the barrack-room', but a reawakened civil polity which opposes the greed and self-interest of individualism, the primary cause, in Selbourne's view, of the wreck of our civil polity. Society, Selbourne argues, is in a state of collapse and 'disaggregation' because it has espoused an amoral politics of 'dutiless' rights and freedoms. Emphasis on rights without duties, demand-satisfaction and self-realisation through unfettered freedom, has created a moral vacuum. When the dutiless individual calculates how to act, mere self interest is his only criterion. In such circumstances no civic order can flourish. Selbourne's solution is to reassert an argument which both the liberal tradition and the common law have long recognised, but has been progressively ignored: that people have duties to themselves, their fellows and society, which are fully the moral equivalent of their rights. This 'principle of duty' is an expression of the constraints that membership of society places upon individuals. It identifies their obligations and ways of ensuring that they are observed. Our duties include, says Selbourne, pursuing a livelihood and making ourselves informed; caring for the members of our families; respecting and helping others; and 'bestowing pains upon the preservation of the civic order'. There is also a duty to conserve natural resources and society's historic patrimony, and to fulfil obligations of public duty such as undertaking military service when necessary, sitting on juries, and contributing to public funds by taxation. Selbourne proposes a variety of sanctions for those who fail in these duties, based on loss of rights and privileges in various ways including those already familiar. Some, especially on the left in politics - Selbourne's own natural terrain - will find some of these ideas reactionary. They have certainly been unfashionable for long enough to make their revival a novelty. Politicians on the right occasionally table-thump about duties and respect for society when addressing Party Conferences on law and order issues, but never when talking about taxation, long-term investment, or public spending on education and health. Mrs Thatcher famously denied the very existence of society, suggesting thereby that it is the individualism of the right which is most dismissive and destructive of social ties. But Selbourne is correct: only where there is a strong sense of a civic bond between people, with all having a lively mutual sense of values, can there be a flourishing and progressive social order. A model is provided by memories of wartime, or at least the more nostalgic versions of its camaraderie, its sense of community and cooperation. However dewy-eyed the ideal might be, one cannot call it unworthy. There are of course problems with Selbourne's picture. His views are right; the difficulty is how to implement them. Society is so uneasily plural and fragmented, its members so divisively sold on the supreme value of getting and having; how can one be sanguine? Selbourne's vision is one at which a pre-industrial city-state might aim, if its leaders and teachers were honest and its economy such that competition among its members rarely involved conflict and anxiety - the twin spectres of the market place, where only some can be winners. But can vastly populous, fissiparous, strident modern societies, brought up - at least during this last decade and a half - on a particularly naked version of the politics of self-interest, hope to change? Hostile critics will claim that Selbourne is being self-importantly oracular in this book, offering it as a gospel for an anxiously waiting world. But charges of pretension will be misplaced; he has tried to think his way not just into the theory of a better social order, but of its practicalities. There is much in what he says that demands and deserves very careful thought.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Esso puts 1p on a litre of petrol Esso yesterday announced a 1p a litre increase in the maximum recommended price of petrol sold at its 2,250 stations in the UK, blaming increases in the wholesale price of petrol on the Rotterdam market for refined products, Robert Corzine writes. Other big retailers, including British Petroleum and Shell, said they were watching the markets closely but had not made a decision to follow Esso's lead. From today the maximum recommended prices at Esso petrol stations will be 60.9p a litre for four star and 55.9p a litre for unleaded. The price of diesel is unchanged. The Rotterdam petrol price serves as the marker for retail prices in the UK and much of the rest of Europe. Prices for unleaded petrol have edged upwards over the past month, from Dollars 179 a tonne at the end of April to the present level of Dollars 183 a tonne. But wholesale prices have experienced a sharp increase since the end of March, when unleaded fuel was trading in Rotterdam at Dollars 154 a tonne. The recent increases in refined product prices reflect in part the rise in crude oil prices over the past few months. Although Esso's price increase applies to all stations in its network, many oil companies acknowledge that a large number of their stations are selling fuel at a level below the recommended maximum, particularly where competition is especially fierce.</p>

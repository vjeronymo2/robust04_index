			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Abbey cut raises prospect of price war The prospect of a price war between banks and building societies to attract personal customers was raised yesterday by Abbey National's decision to halve the interest rate it charges on authorised overdrafts. Bank shares fell sharply after Abbey said that it was reducing the annual percentage rate (APR) on overdrafts from 18.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent. Investors feared that it was the first move in a battle for retail customers. Most banks dismissed Abbey's move, saying that because it had only 1.4m of an estimated 33m current account customers in the UK they would not need to retaliate. However TSB Group said that it would 'review the position very closely'. Abbey's move coincided with the launch of a new current account including 24-hour telephone banking by Alliance &amp; Leicester building society. The society will charge 15 per cent APR on authorised overdrafts, with no monthly fee. Earlier this month Halifax building society lowered its APR on authorised overdrafts from 14.9 per cent to 12.4 per cent. Midland, Lloyds, Barclays and National Westminster charge between 16.7 per cent and 19.2 per cent APR. Barclays and Lloyds said they did not intend to reduce overdraft charges because a high APR rate was needed to cover the cost of monitoring overdrafts. They said they believed that Abbey might be forced to raise its APR rate again. Mr Peter Waller, Abbey's banking product director, said it had calculated that overdrafts would be profitable in spite of the reduction in price. 'We have an efficient clearing system and we are passing on the benefit to customers,' he said. Mr Waller said Abbey intended to maintain a lower APR rate because it saw it as a pivotal part of an attempt to attract new customers. 'We have set our stall out and we believe that this is a viable pricing strategy,' he said. As banks have recovered profitability from lending losses in the early 1990s they have started to accumulate capital. This has led to fears that they will compete for business on price. Abbey shares closed 13p down at 392p. Barclays shares lost 16p to 518p, Lloyds lost 14p to 521p, and National Westminster lost 24.5p to 428p. Lex, Page 20 Markets, Page 42</p>

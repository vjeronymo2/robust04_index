			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation ends on the date that an institution's period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, as specified under proposed &sect;668.13 governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification procedures, expires, or the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification is revoked in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures outlined in that proposed section. This change would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made pursuant to provisions of section 498(g) and (h) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the FFEL programs ends on the date that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has determined that the institution's cohort default  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate, for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary has determined the institution's rate, is equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or greater than the threshold rates listed under proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.17(c)(2). This change simply makes the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;668.26 consistent with those of proposed &sect;668.17.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Secretary proposes to specify that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation ends on the date that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a notice from the appropriate SPRE that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation should be withdrawn. This change is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated by section 494C(h) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add to the requirements for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution when the institution's participation in a Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program ends, that the institution shall, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the NEISP or SSIG Program ended,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform immediately the State in which the institution is located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that fact. Further, notwithstanding the requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of Title IV, HEA program funds found in this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution must follow the instructions of that State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the end of that participation. The Secretary also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to add that if the institution's participation in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs end has ended, the institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform the Secretary of how the institution will arrange for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection of any outstanding loans made under the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defense/Direct Student Loan and ICL programs. These changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to make the Student Assistance General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations consistent with specific program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G_Fine, Limitation, Suspension and Termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proceedings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.81&blank;Scope and Special Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to make technical changes to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section consistent with changes proposed throughout these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations. The Secretary proposes to clarify in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section that the procedures under this section do not apply in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of an institution that fails to qualify for provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification because the institution does not meet the factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of financial responsibility. In addition, the procedures under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section would not apply in the case of an institution where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's period of provisional certification has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expired, nor would they apply in the case of an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has its provisional certification revoked. These changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to make the scope of Subpart G of these regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with provisions in section 498(g) and (h) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 690.83&blank;Submission of Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 487(c)(7) of the HEA provides that, if, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988 pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the audit requirements of section 487(c) of the HEA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department regulations implementing those requirements, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution has provided to its students in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirements, but the institution has not previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may offset the amount of those disbursements against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities owed under the audit, or if no liabilities arise from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the audit, may receive reimbursement from the Department for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HEA requires that the development of NPRMs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of changes made by the Amendments to Parts B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Federal Family Education Loan programs), G (general provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the student assistance programs) or H (Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Integrity Triad) of Title IV of the HEA, is subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiated rulemaking process. Although this provision relates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program, it is contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part G of the HEA. Therefore, it has been included in this NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of the Federal Pell Grant Program NPRM, which was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the negotiated rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Sales of bricks increase to five-year high Brick sales by manufacturers were the highest for five years in the second quarter of this year, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. Viscount Ullswater, who was appointed construction minister in last week's reshuffle, said the surge in sales provided a further encouraging sign of economic recovery. 'Construction new orders and output, including housing starts, show similar recent upward trends,' he said. Suppliers said that after an increase in new-house sales in the early part of this year, housing-brick shortages had started to develop. Butterley, one of the country's biggest house-brick manufacturers, was recently quoting 20 weeks' delivery time to builders contacting its Kirton works in Nottinghamshire. The company said that at this time last year builders could expect deliveries the following day, The Department of the Environment said the number of bricks delivered by manufacturers to customers during the second quarter rose to 997m. This is the highest number since the second quarter of 1989. As a result, manufacturers were able to reduce unsold stocks to 806m, the lowest level for five years and almost half the peak of 1.55bn in the fourth quarter of 1992. Most of the remaining stock is higher-specification bricks used for offices, shops and public buildings such as hospitals and schools. Construction activity in this area has failed to recover to the same extent as in the housing market. The rise in sales has led to an increase of about a fifth in the average ex-factory price of housing bricks from a low of about Pounds 100 a thousand in autumn 1992 to about Pounds 120 a thousand now. Mr Richard Manning, managing director of the brick division of Hanson, the conglomerate which owns Butterley and London Brick, the country's biggest brick manufacturer, said yesterday: 'Prices will have to rise further before manufacturers start to reopen closed capacity. Margins are still too low and it is still not worth their while to do so.' Between 1987 and 1989, brick manufacturers spent Pounds 200m increasing their capacity from 4.5bn to 5bn bricks a year. Permanent and temporary closures subsequently have reduced this to 3.45bn, compared with sales of 3.13bn last year. The number of workers employed by the industry has fallen from 14,000 in December 1987 to 8,500 at the end of last year.</p>

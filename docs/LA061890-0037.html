			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN HELD IN DEATHS OF EX-GIRLFRIEND, MOTHER;  </P> <P> KILLINGS: AMTRAK POLICE ARREST HIM AT UNION STATION. HE HAD CHECKED INTO MOTEL  WHERE VICTIM'S CAR WAS FOUND.  </P> <P> A 23-year-old man described by authorities as a jealous former boyfriend was  arrested Sunday in the bludgeoning deaths of a Walnut woman he once dated and  her mother.  </P> <P> Richard Russell Moon of Walnut was arrested by Amtrak police officers shortly  after midnight at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, after they received a  tip from Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives that he was preparing to leave  the area.  </P> <P> Moon was held without bail in the deaths of his former girlfriend, Melitta  Greig, 22, and her mother, Rose Greig, 53, whose bodies were found Saturday in  the trunk of the family car.  </P> <P> "When they broke up, Richard wouldn't let go," said Father Bill Leser, pastor  of St. Martha's Church in La Puente, where Melitta Greig attended parochial  school and her mother worked as the parish secretary and bookkeeper. "He was  having a very hard time saying goodby."  </P> <P> Dave Pooley, manager at the Fullerton AMC theater where Melitta Greig worked  for the last seven months, described her as "bright, outgoing, a pleasure to be  around, a take-charge kind of girl."  </P> <P> Moon was not initially a suspect in the killings, although detectives planned  to question him, Sheriff's Sgt. Rey Verdugo said at a Sunday morning press  conference. He became a suspect Saturday evening, however, when sheriff's  deputies spotted Melitta Greig's missing Volkswagen Cabriolet convertible in a  motel parking lot in Rowland Heights.  </P> <P> The car's distinctive license plates -- ATTILEM, or Melitta backward -- had  been removed and stashed in the car, Verdugo said. Moon had registered at the  motel that afternoon, but deputies did not find him there.  </P> <P> Moon, it turned out, was on his way north, Verdugo said. He had called a friend  for a ride to the Fullerton Amtrak station, where he boarded a train for Los  Angeles and then bought a combination train and bus ticket that would take him  as far as Fresno. He told the friend he was headed for Seattle, Verdugo said.  </P> <P> Moon never boarded his 1:50 a.m. bus in Los Angeles. Watching television, the  friend's mother learned that authorities were looking for him. Realizing that  her daughter had just driven him to Union Station, she called the Sheriff's  Department, which according to Amtrak police Officer Joe Gross, contacted  station authorities.  </P> <P> Gross said he and fellow Amtrak Officer Miguel Pintos arrested Moon without  incident and held him for sheriff's detectives.  </P> <P> "There was a relationship severed quite a while back," Verdugo said after  detectives interviewed Moon Sunday afternoon. "But he seems to have held a  fascination for her."  </P> <P> Authorities said they believe the mother and daughter were killed in their  garage between 1 and 3 p.m. Friday. Rose Greig was last seen about 12:15 p.m.,  when she received a phone call in the parish office and left work abruptly.  Melitta Greig never showed up for her 4 p.m. shift as a supervisor at the  theater.  </P> <P> Robert Greig, Rose's husband and Melitta's father, discovered the bodies in the  trunk of his wife's car when he came home from work about 1 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> A piece of wood and a hammer found in the garage are being examined as possible  murder weapons, Verdugo said.  </P> <P> According to friends and co-workers, Moon, a student at Mt. San Antonio  College, met Melitta Greig a few years ago when both worked at an AMC theater  in Puente Hills. They dated on and off until about six months ago, when Melitta  broke off the relationship, friends said.  </P> <P> Theater employees said Moon was raised in Modesto and came to Walnut after his  parents' divorce. They said he would clown and roughhouse with other employees  and patrons. Once, he lost his job for putting a dead mouse in the cash  register as a practical joke, said Alice Rogers, a former supervisor.  </P> <P> A week ago, Moon called Rogers and asked if he could come back to work at the  theater, she said. His job as a sixth-grade camp counselor was about to end, he  told her.  </P> <P> "I told him to come by Sunday and we'd fill out the paper work," Rogers said.  "Sometimes he would pull some stunt, but he was one of the best workers I have  had."  </P> <P> For a time, the Greigs served as a surrogate family for Moon. He lived at their  hillside home for a few months while he was between apartments and he still  stopped by Melitta's grandparents' home for lunch and to pick up mail, said  Linda Montoya, the Greigs' next-door neighbor.  </P> <P> Moon's arraignment on murder charges is scheduled for Tuesday.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Sheryl Stolberg contributed to this story.  </P></p>

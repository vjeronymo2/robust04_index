			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Hidden expenses of life policies the underlying investment performance that the life company will achieve and the expenses it will incur. It is far from easy for potential investors, and independent advisers, to judge the likely future investment performance from a company. Past performance trends are a guide, but far from infallible. However, it is easier for the investor to get a clearer guide to the level of expenses and their effect on the ultimate return if presented in a format that he can understand - namely an illustration, in money terms, of the maturity or cash-in value at the end of the investment period. Yet the various regulatory bodies have banned the use of such illustrations. Life companies and independent advisers have to provide all benefit illustrations on the basis and assumptions laid down by Lautro (Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). Thus every life company produces the same illustrative figure for the same contract. It does not distinguish high and low expense life companies. The argument put forward by Lautro to justify its decision is that contracts should not be sold solely on the basis of an illustration - a practice that was widespread in pre-financial services days and led to considerable abuse. However, the danger to the public of using standard illustrations is that they may feel that there is no expense difference between life companies - an impression that the high-expense companies have not contradicted. Investors are given details of a life company's expenses. But under Securities and Investments Board disclosure rules the details are given: within the cooling off period after the contract has been bought; as a percentage deduction from the investment return. So the investor is given information in an opaque form after he has bought the contract, and then faces the hassle of cancelling the contract if he does not like the expense deduction. Even if he could understand the significance of the yield figure, which is unlikely, it only relates to that particular contract with the life company, thus conveying no indication as to the level of expenses against other life companies. However, the April issue of Money Management* reviewed the past performance of unit-linked endowment contracts and included a table of projected illustrations on an 'own charges' basis. It provides a wealth of information which enables individuals and advisers to sort out the low-charge sheep from the high-charge goats and all those in between. The first point shown by the tables is just how much easier it is to assess the expense effect from monetary figures rather than yields. For example, it shows that for a 10-year term, the average payout is reduced by 17 to 18 per cent by expenses, while for 25 years the reduction is around 25 per cent. Second, it highlights that investor returns can vary significantly solely because of differences in expenses. Most of the life assurance industry argues that the investment return is all important, implying that expenses are incidental to the overall return. The companies arguing that expenses are important are lone voices crying in the wilderness. The table shows that the longer the period to cash-in, the greater the significance of investment performance. But how many contracts are kept in force for 25 years before being cashed-in? And the tables show that even over 25 years, the influence of expenses is far from negligible. So investors and advisers need to classify life companies according to their perceived investment potential and their expense level. Finally, the tables highlight that the Lautro illustration basis is useless in that the expense assumptions are lower than the expenses currently charged by virtually every life company. Only London Life can match Lautro on expenses. Thus potential investors are being given higher illustrative values than are justified by the current life company charges - a situation that Lautro should remedy immediately. *Copies of the article (Pounds 4) or the issue (Pounds 5) can be obtained from Alison Hannah, Money Management, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Projected 10 year Cash Payout  --------------------------------------------------------------------                          Assumed growth                          7% pa                           10.5% pa Charges                  Return         Yield red'n(%)    Return                          (pounds)                         (pounds)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- None                       5,161             n/a            6,206 Lowest (L'don Life)        4,780             1.0            5,750 Average                    4,286             n/a            5,104 Highest (Sw Pioneer)       3,463             7.6            4,000 Lautro basis               4,780             1.0            5,750  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Management  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on man aged 29 paying pounds 30 a month into a unit-linked savings plan.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Projected 25 Year Cash Payouts  --------------------------------------------------------------------                             Assumed investment growth                          7% pa                 10.5% pa Charges                  Return                 Return                          (pounds)               (pounds)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- None                      23,624                 40,317 Lowest (London Life)      20,900                 35,300 Average                   17,820                 29,689 Highest (Abbey Life)      15,307                 25,233 Lautro basis              20,900                 35,300  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Management  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Man aged 29 paying pounds 30 a month into a unit-linked savings plan  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

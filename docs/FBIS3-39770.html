			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias reiterated today  in Ioannina the government's decision to implement the measures  against Skopje.    [Begin recording] [Papoulias] The measures we have adopted  are adequate. It was a message, if you will, to [Macedonian  President Kiro] Gligorov that Greece is not playing. As I have  told our allies and partners, it is an issue of the Greek  people. It is not an issue of a single government, but an issue  of the Greek people. When there is an issue that affects the  Greek people so much, the Greek Government cannot pull back.    [Unidentified correspondent] Did the partners pressure the  Greek Government in Athens?    [Papoulias] Look, the partners are of course interested in  our having good relations with Gligorov because they know very  well that Greece is the only country that can support the  state's security and viability. The partners should not think  about this after the shock of the embargo. They should have  thought about that when we told them that we are [words  indistinct] of the Greek people. The Greek Government cannot  pull back. [end recording]</p>

He also  told AL-HAYAH that the company concluded its latest deal last  month, importing 10,000 tonnes of iron, valued at $3 million  [figure as published], from Turkey to meet clients' urgent  needs. Al-Fawzan also noted that the company imported nearly  40,000 tonnes of iron last year. It also imported 7,000 cubic  meters of lumber, valued at nearly 6 million riyals ($1.6  million), from Romania last month.    He expressed the opinion that it is unlikely that there is a  crisis in the demand for iron in the Saudi market, saying, "The  crisis started in 1991 and ended in 1993."    Khalid al-Fawzan estimated that Saudi Arabia imports nearly  500,000 cubic meters of wood annually, with an estimated value  of $1 billion.    He noted that Saudi Arabia imports white [soft] wood from  Austria, Canada, Romania, Russia, Chile, Sweden, and Finland and  red wood (hard wood) from Africa. It also imports plywood from  Malaysia and Indonesia. Khalid noted that "tree age determines  lumber prices. The average price per cubic meter is nearly $200."    He further noted that al-Fawzan Company imports nearly  70,000  cubic meters of white wood, 90,000 cubic meters of hard wood,  and 45,000 cubic meters of plywood. He also pointed out that  lumber imports have been growing steadily since 1986.    Khalid al-Fawzan further said, "Lumber prices have been  rising constantly. In recent years these prices were half what  they are now." He attributed the increase to the growth in  forest cutting and decreasing world wood reserves, considering  that the average age of trees in Russia is 180, in Canada and  Austria 150, and in Chile 70 years. This means that the younger  generations are the ones that will benefit from these trees.    Al-Fawzan pointed out that Brazil and Indonesia have reduced  their tree cutting operations and that Malaysia is moving in the  same direction, which means that prices will rise with the onset  of the year 2000. He also noted that the company owns three  factories that produce wooden platforms and luxury furniture and  decor [wood panels] in Jeddah and that the total investment in  these factories is 29 million riyals ($7.7 million).    The factories produce frames into which concrete is poured.  The factories also cover 90 percent of the market need for  wooden platforms in the western, southern, and northern  provinces of Saudi Arabia. Al-Dammam factory for wooden  platforms covers the needs of the eastern province and Riyadh.    The company also plans to introduce another line to produce  annually 671,000 wood panels that meet Brazilian standards,  which are required by the Saudi market. A similar type of decor  panels is produced currently at the rate of 743,000 units  annually. The company also produces 56,000 16-mm polyester units  and 68,000 18-mm units annually. A total of 559,000 units of  wooden platforms were produced last year. The company also  produced 15,000 wooden boxes to meet the needs of companies that  package their products, including al-Jafali Company, and 12,000  wooden molds to meet the need of domestic companies that produce  concrete blocks.    Al-Fawzan also said that the Red Sea Plant for the  production  of prefabricated homes and al-Nur Company are major clients for  the products turned out by al-Fawzan Company. An urgent request  by the Red Sea Plant for panels in various colors was met by  al-Fawzan Company at the end of last year, with the request  delivered by air.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slow recovery forecast for cocoa prices THE STRUCTURAL surplus in the world cocoa market from 1984-85 to 1990-91 is at an end, but prices are expected to recover only slowly to the year 2,000, according to a new study by the International Cocoa Organisation, Reuter reports. The 1991-92 shortfall should begin a period when deficits outnumbered surpluses, it said. Production and consumption should continue to grow, but much more slowly than during the last decade. The fall in stocks due to the predominance of deficits is expected to result in a recovery in prices in real as well as nominal terms.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / People: The knife that heals Mark Homan, head of corporate reconstruction and insolvency at accountants Price Waterhouse, is slipping on his surgeon's gloves to take up his position as the new president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency. Homan is particularly sensitive to the portrayal of insolvency practitioners as corporate undertakers, and prefers to see them described as surgeons helping companies to recover. With a year behind him as the society's elected deputy president, he has had plenty of time to contemplate his plan of action. He says he has two main priorities during his year in office: to improve the image of the insolvency profession, and to consolidate the position of the recently-created society. 'Insolvency has been unjustly treated by the media,' he says. 'The press on the whole is somewhat unthinking and uncaring in its comments. There is a touch of the journalism of envy about it.' A down-to-earth man of considerable height, he is well-equipped to take on the press, though he says his preference is to be out in the field rescuing companies. He says he will be speaking to journalists and encouraging his colleagues to do the same, emphasising the strides made by the profession after the introduction of tough entry requirements since the 1986 Insolvency Act. His second priority will be to achieve close liaison with the society's regional organisations, and he places great emphasis on fostering the involvement of smaller firms. He will have to tread a careful path to avoid sensitive toes in the relationship between the society - founded less than two years ago as a trade association and proving increasingly active - and the Insolvency Practitioners Association, which retains its role as a regulator and licensor. Homan joined Price Waterhouse as a trainee accountant in 1963 fresh from a degree in industrial economics, with accountancy and law subsidiary subjects. In the late 1960s he was seconded to work with Monty Eckman, the firm's head of insolvency, and found himself effectively taking over the job shortly after Eckman died unexpectedly in 1972.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Japan homes in on mock-Tudor houses BRITISH exports to Japan received an unusual boost yesterday with the announcement of a pioneering deal. It brings home the attractions of English village housing design to Japanese families - and still lets them take a bath downstairs. Japanese businessmen will soon be able to come home to a mock-Tudor or Elizabethan house complete with English village-style landscaping under a licensing deal. Beazer Homes, the UK's third largest housebuilder, is licensing Kureha Construction, a subsidiary of Japan's Kureha Chemical. The deal is claimed to be the first in which British housing designs have been exported to Japan. It panders to a Japanese view of British goods that contrasts with the UK's self-image. 'Anything that is British will be looked at as quality,' said Mr Dennis Webb, managing director of Beazer Homes. But the British export coup goes only skin deep. Japanese homebuyers might want landscaping and a mock-Tudor facade, but once they are through the front door, local preferences will prevail - Japanese layouts with large bathrooms downstairs and family areas with tatami matting. And, just in case the idea of traditionally solid British construction methods causes the occupants to tremble at the thought of an earthquake, Beazer's double-skinned timber-frame houses will be redesigned with flexible single skins. Designers will work out how to obtain the best brick effect without the rigidity of real bricks, Mr Webb said. Selling English village housing in one of the world's most densely populated countries might seem like the UK construction industry's craziest idea since stone cladding. But Mr Webb says there is more room for such housing away from Tokyo, and two sites about 100 miles north of the capital have been identified. In the first stage of the agreement, Beazer will license Kureha to use its names and house styles, and receive a fixed percentage royalty for every house completed. It is expected that about 60 houses will be built over the next two years or so, with the first going on sale early this year for about Pounds 170,000. The second stage will involve the export of entire timber-frame house kits. The deal gives Beazer, now part of Hanson, a foot in the door of the Japanese housing market.

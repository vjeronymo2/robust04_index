			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rosa Maria Godoy] </F>   [Text] Greetings to all listeners of this program. Working  under the sun and at the seashore, challenging and transforming  nature, the men here are placing rock upon rock to build the  road that will link one piece of land with another. These  builders are grouped within the Las Villas Campaign contingent,  the goal of which is to complete the rock-fill embankments that  will link Caibarien with the northern villages. I met them while  participating in the contingent's parliament. Pedro Ross Leal,  secretary general of the Cuban Workers' Federation, also  attended this parliament.    Unlike the other contingents we visited, the workers here  did  not talk about difficulties, lack of fulfillment, inaction,  inefficiencies, or other irregularities. These men of legend, as  Ross Leal described them, proudly outlined their achievements:  the 41,358 meters of embankment they completed, the 24 bridges  they built, the low production-cost rate, and the low accident  rate, among others, which are victories of our history.    They also told us about their ingeniousness to save and  protect the scarce raw material, as in the case of the 18-gauge  wire that is used to tie the rods [cabillas]. This wire was  replaced by steel belts taken from discarded tires. And the 24  bridges were built with wood models which were used from  beginning to end.    The Las Villas Campaign contingent has only 7 km left, to  complete the rock-fill embankment from the northern part of  Villa Clara to Caibarien. Our daily deeds and achievements are  recorded all along that white rock-fill strip in the middle of  the sea. At the parliaments, those workers from Villa Clara have  reaffirmed their willingness to keep building efficiently, with  the same quality that has always characterized them. These  projects are sponsored by several organizations.    Concerning the country's internal finances, the members of  the Las Villas Campaign contingent defended the liberalization  and increases in alcoholic beverage and cigarette prices,  maintenance of the revolutionary achievements such as public  health and education, and the payment of some gratuities.    [Begin recording of unidentified speaker] In fact, since  1959, through the first article of the Constitution, the  Revolution has provided for man's full identity. This was also  one of the first things I discussed with Marti [not further  identified]. The government has been subsidizing a large number  of products for the people, and I think the time has come for us  workers to make some sacrifice. Let us begin by admitting that  in order to guarantee the continuation of the free education and  health programs given to us, the state to a certain extent needs  to collect something in order to maintain those services. These  services require much money.    For instance, I was watching television the past few days,  and I think that 99.9 percent of us watch that television  series. How many people are watching that series? Imagine how  much could be collected if each Cuban had to pay no more than  one peso for watching such shows. Or perhaps we could pay in  accordance with the quality of the show. If the show is of  lesser quality, then we should pay a little less. But why should  we be reluctant to pay for something we enjoy watching,  something the people enjoy watching? Why should we reject the  idea of accruing a given amount of money to be self-sufficient  in sports in this country, for instance, because the state has  been fully financing this.    There are other aspects: water, for instance. All Cubans are  now receiving water free of charge. We are not thinking of  installing meters at this moment because it would be a rather  complex situation. But we could establish a fixed monthly  payment for water, and that would also provide some income for  the state.    Electricity is another aspect that requires more attention.  It consumes much fuel, which also has a high cost. We must  increase the per-kilowatt cost of electricity because that would  also create the habit of conserving electricity among the  people. We must make a sacrifice. And whom are we going to ask  to make sacrifice but the revolutionary workers. For this  reason, we believe that all aspects that are subsidized by the  state must be thoroughly analyzed and to the extent possible,  increased in price to prevent further subsidies.

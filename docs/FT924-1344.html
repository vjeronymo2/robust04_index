			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Lyonnais-BfG bank deal in trouble CREDIT LYONNAIS' proposed acquisition of a majority stake in the BfG Bank, the financially troubled German bank, has run into last-minute difficulties. The purchase of the stake in Germany's sixth biggest bank, potentially one of the largest cross-border deals in European financial services, was first announced at the beginning of last month with the aim of completion by the end of the year. The failure of the deal, which valued the German bank at DM2.1bn (Pounds 860m), would be a big embarrassment for the state-owned Credit Lyonnais as well as for BfG's shareholders, Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second biggest insurance company, and the BGAG trades union holding company. It would also unscramble a related agreement between AMB and Assurances Generales de France, the large French insurance company. The two companies, at loggerheads for months after AGF bought a 25 per cent stake in its German rival, had reached a peaceful co-operation agreement on the condition that AGF helped find a buyer for AMB's stake in BfG, as it did in the form of Credit Lyonnais. The difficulties are reported to centre on guarantees that BfG's current owners are being asked to provide to the purchaser in respect of the bank's balance sheet liabilities, a difficult point given the rapidly deteriorating credit environment in Germany. Another problem is believed to be that Credit Lyonnais is seeking an 'opt-out' clause which would allow it to pull out of the deal if the French government failed to give it approval to raise capital to inject into BfG. Bankers said that negotiators failed to reach agreement on these issues in a round of talks which took place in Paris and finished on Tuesday this week. A banker advising on the transaction said that the negotiations were extremely difficult and that all sides involved were playing 'a last-minute game of poker'. The pressure to complete the deal has mounted as AMB has called a special supervisory board meeting for tomorrow. It is likely this meeting would cancel the transaction if no agreement had been reached. Companies involved limited their comment on the developments yesterday to saying that they hoped that agreement would be reached.</p>

The ministry has invited over 40 local officials whose  villages and townships rank among the best in construction and  development to attend a meeting held in Beijing, asking for  their opinions and suggestions in the field.    China has a total of 3.75 million villages and 37,000  townships. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to  their construction and modernization in the current reform and  economic development drive.    In recent years the country has seen large numbers of modern  towns with good layout, environment, and industrial and  commercial strengths emerge in rural areas.    Construction Minister Hou Jie and Deputy Construction  Minister Mao Rubai have issued letters of appointment to the 25  consultants.    Hou said the booming rural economy has promoted the  development of township construction.    While talking with some village and township heads, Hou  found  that many of them have rich experience in local development.    The 25 consultants were selected as representatives from  developed areas in the east, south and coastal regions, and from  underdeveloped areas of the west, north and central parts of the  country.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Japan's small companies bear brunt of bankruptcies THE SLUMP in the Japanese economy is continuing to take a heavy toll on companies, with a sharp rise in corporate bankruptcies last month and a further fall in confidence among small businesses. There were 14,441 corporate failures in the year to the end of last month, up 22.7 per cent from the year before, according to a report by the Teikoku Databank, the private research company. The rise in bankruptcies is increasingly concentrated among smaller companies. The rise was mainly accounted for by a 42.7 per cent increase in manufacturing failures, a 29 per cent increase in failures in the service sector and a 22 per cent rise among construction companies. The severity of the slump among smaller companies was reflected in figures published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which show small business confidence declined sharply in the first three months of the year.</p>

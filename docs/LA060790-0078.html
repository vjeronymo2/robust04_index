			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE WON'T ORDER OFFICIALS TO OK RAZING OF SHOPS  </P> <P> A judge refused Wednesday to order Los Angeles city building officials to issue  a demolition permit to a developer trying to begin construction of an  85,000-square-foot commercial project before the proposed Ventura Boulevard  specific plan can curtail it.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski's refusal to order issuance of the permit  to Jama Enterprises, Inc. -- owner of a block-long strip of one-story stores in  Sherman Oaks that included the popular Scene of the Crime Bookstore -- was  hailed as a victory by Tom Grant, a director of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners  Assn.  </P> <P> But Zebrowski also invited Jama's attorneys to provide him with proof that the  city Building Department is delaying its review of the project for political  reasons.  </P> <P> Zebrowski earlier this year sharply attacked the Los Angeles City Council for  using its land-use powers for political purposes in a case involving a proposed  development on the site of a Studio City carwash. Homeowners opposed to the  development asked the city to declare the 1950s carwash a cultural monument to  delay its demolition. Zebrowski's caustic ruling cleared the way for the Studio  City project to proceed.  </P> <P> Jama wants to raze the empty stores to make way for a 3-story, $20-million  retail-commercial complex. At stake ultimately is whether Jama will be able to  begin work on the project in time to avoid the growth-cutting effects of the  proposed Ventura Boulevard specific plan.  </P> <P> The Ventura Boulevard plan, as presently proposed, would reduce the allowable  size of the Jama project by about one-third, from 85,000 square feet to 53,000  square feet and from three to two stories. The council is expected to approve  the plan, in some form, by early fall.  </P> <P> Jama attorney Benjamin Reznik argued in court that it was unreasonable for the  city to deny the demolition permit until completion of an environmental review  now being conducted by the city's Building and Safety Department.  </P> <P> But Zebrowski agreed with Deputy City Atty. Susan Pfann that withholding the  demolition permit served a legitimate land-use policy. If the assessment  concludes that a full environmental impact report is required, the EIR would  have to compare the effects of the developer's project with those of retaining  the existing buildings. If the buildings were demolished, such a comparison  would be meaningless, Pfann argued.  </P> <P> Reznik said in an interview that his client is seeking to get the project under  construction before the Ventura Boulevard plan takes effect.  </P> <P> The attorney also claimed that the Building Department is dragging its feet on  reviewing Jama's environmental assessment document to satisfy what he said is  Councilman Michael Woo's politically inspired desire to see the project limited  by the Ventura Boulevard plan. The proposed project is in Woo's district.  </P> <P> But Grant, the homeowners representative, said Jama's own failure to provide  the city with adequate environmental documents caused the delays.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a top Building Department official predicted that his agency will  order Jama to file a full environmental impact report. "This is a controversial  one, and Councilman Woo wants a full EIR," assistant department chief Tim  Taylor said in an interview.  </P> <P> Reznik said Taylor's remarks only bolstered his conviction that the Building  Department's review of Jama's project is being handled in a political fashion.  The city cannot determine if a full report is needed until the environmental  assessment is completed, Reznik said.  </P></p>

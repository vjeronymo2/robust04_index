			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> WATER AS WEALTH  </P> <P> The city doesn't accept . . . state water because we don't want rapid  development. I support that. Some communities have no planning -- and they have  overcrowded conditions.  </P> <P> That's the kind of environment I rejected when I moved here from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> I'm aligned with the slow-growthers, but I have mixed feelings. Santa Barbara  is the only community in California that bans lawn watering. If you stay within  the overall (water-use) limits, you should be allowed to water your lawn.  </P> <P> I think politicians imposed the ban so they could claim they were taking direct  action. We're supposed to look around and see brown lawns and feel good because  they're doing something.  </P> <P>  If the drought continues, differences between the haves and have-nots will be  heightened because some people are actually paying to have companies bring in  water from outside sources. They buy it to water their lawns because they can  afford to sustain an aesthetic environment. That's causing something of an  uproar.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Lowest RPI for 25 years sparks price rise GILTS gained ground on the back of good UK inflation data though shorter dated bonds were held back by indications of no immediate government plans to cut interest rates to lift recovery prospects. News on Friday that the year-on-year increase in the Retail Prices Index in January was just 1.7 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, sparked a price rise for long dated bonds of up to 2 points on the day. In spite of assurances by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the government saw little room for a cut in interest rates, many in financial markets believe a cut from 6 per cent to 5 per cent will emerge in about a month's time. The most likely date, according to City opinion, is around Budget day on March 16. For the week as a whole, yields fell by about 10 basis points for bonds above the 10-year mark. Yields for 10-year bonds fell back to slightly under 8 per cent from about 8.1 per cent at the end of the previous week, while at the 5-year level the yield reduction was only of the order of five basis points. Attention focused on the speech in Frankfurt by Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, who steps up to governor in July, in which he gave a stern warning that the government was unlikely to take risks with inflation with an early cut in base rates. The address was a robust effort to reassure the City about the principles Mr George intends to use in guiding monetary policy when giving advice to the Treasury. However, it failed to give more than a modest lift to the pound and to damp speculation that the pressures to stimulate economic recovery would lead the government into a reduction in borrowing costs before long. Mr Ifty Islam, a bond analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'He hasn't made much impression on me. Whatever the Bank of England says we are all thinking another base rate cut is likely soon.' Supporting this argument is that the inflation data during the week showed that the demand in the UK remains fragile, and that the extra cost pressures arising from sterling's devaluation last autumn so far are not working their way through into the price of goods at the retail level. However, data on purchases by manufacturers of energy and raw materials showed that these costs rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent in January, compared with December, largely because of higher import prices. If that trend continues, it is likely that the government's target of keeping underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage costs, at a year-on-year rate of 4 per cent or less will be exceeded within the next 12 months. Mr Sanjay Joshi, an economist at Japanese securities house Daiwa, thinks that inflationary pressures will remain subdued until the end of the first half of this year. He reckons the headline inflation rate as measured by the RPI will sink as low as 1.25 per cent by around May or June with the underlying rate coming down to 2.75 per cent from the level of 3.2 per cent in January.</p>

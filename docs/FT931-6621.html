			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / The European Market: Kindelbruck, a suitable case for privatisation - A US luggage company go to Germany Kindelbruck's position in the middle of Germany has never been much of an attraction in the past. But according to the management of York Luggage, a New Jersey suitcase company, it was the principal reason for their presence in this small town in Thuringia, late in January, partying on blood pudding, raw pork and strong east German beer, They were celebrating the end of a long search for a European manufacturing base which had started before anyone contemplated the possibility of German unification, and ended in the cast-offs department of the Treuhand privatisation agency. The Kofferfabrik Kindelbruck, founded in 1914, had been marked down for liquidation. It was to become another casualty of unification. . . and another warning that the town was fated never to enjoy the full fruits of commercial success. Kindelbruck's chronicles show that the industrial revolution simply passed the place by. In 1873, for example, an appeal for a railway connection was turned down. Two years later, the paper works, until then the town's most enduring industrial establishment in 700 years of recorded history, was closed. A shoe factory opened in 1888 and shut five years later after another failed bid for a rail link. Thanks to the new owner, York Luggage, Kindelbruck has kept its only manufacturing company, which has withstood fire, war, communist neglect and the ravages of the free market since it was founded in 1911. But the town still has no railway, no canal or river link, just a ropey two-lane road passing through. The nearest hotel still has no effective telephone system. But Mr Frank Alfieri, York's chairman and chief strategist, does not care. As well as being in the geographical centre of Germany - itself the biggest market for luggage in Europe - the town sits in the middle of a new European market of boundless potential, he says. It is home to a workforce experienced in sticking and stitching suitcases. Unusually, the company also has an established customer base among department and speciality store buyers in western Germany, which was in place before the collapse of eastern European markets which formerly bought 1.5m cases a year. Among the tangibles, the package bought from the Treuhand included nine acres of land and 30-odd scruffy buildings redolent with the smell of drains and fresh paint. The price, as usual in Treuhand deals with private companies, is a secret. The social cost, as usual, has been enormous. Of the 630 former employees, who used to make 1.5m cases a year, only 78 remain. A handful being trained to work leather and manufacture a new line in laptop computer carriers-cum-briefcases will bring the total to 100 later this year. For the medium term, York is committed to investing DM4.8m (Pounds 2.03m) in the site. What returns this will yield in jobs and earnings rest with the success of the company's bold, even curious, product strategy. York is primarily a US luggage wholesaler which gave up domestic manufacture more than 10 years ago, shifting off-shore to the far east. In north America it markets retailers' own-label product and brands such as Bill Blass, Diane von Furstenburg and Members Only with an up-market but distinctly regional cachet. In Europe, where established labels such as Samsonite and Delsey dominate the middle market and the likes of Louis Vuitton skim the cream, the New Jersey newcomer plans to start in the crowded lower reaches. (The 'Wartburg' line in its current product series, bearing the same name as the defunct East German car, gives a clue to its ambitions at this level). But the company also plans to ship products from Germany to the US and import its American ranges into Kindelbruck for distribution in Europe. In addition, Mr Alfieri says, it is trying to win licences to manufacture sports bags under the Reebok, Adidas or Nike labels, and studying the prospects for a grander design. 'What succeeded in the US with designer names may be possible in Europe,' he adds. Most challenging, however, is a project to establish the York name in the mid-range as a new brand in its own right. Tall orders for a new management which expects just DM10m sales this year and has to ride a recession into the bargain. The key, says Mr Alfieri, is that although consumers are not yet aware of the York name, it is well respected among retailers. Since distribution channels are already established, the company believes its main task is to ship suitable products down them. Meanwhile, export trade has already started with Switzerland, Austria, France and the Netherlands. Nor is the local market being neglected. While the band played and the beer flowed in the front office, cash was flowing in through the back door where a chalked sign tempted passers-by: 'Special offer, suitcases DM7 to DM35'.</p>

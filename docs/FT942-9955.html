			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Palestinian women in expectant mood An Israeli soldier waves away a woman bearing a Palestinian flag in front of the police station in Jericho yesterday as a large crowd gathered in expectation of the arrival of a group of Palestinian policemen. However the main group of 300 Palestinian police were turned back by Israeli troops at the Allenby Bridge on their way from Jordan. Israeli officers demanded that Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir Arafat phone Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to give him the names of the 24 Palestinians who will administer Jericho and the Gaza Strip.</p>

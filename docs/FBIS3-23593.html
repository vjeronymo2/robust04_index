It continues with unrelenting intensity. The  leadership of Azerbaijan does not wish to come to terms with the  idea that, even after mobilizing all the resources (human and  material) of that state for the battlefront, this offensive of  unprecedented strength has failed like all the others before it.  Even so, Azerbaijan continues to throw thousands of fresh  conscripts into the meat grinder. Hoping initially to achieve  quick success and to break through the defense forces of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] in any direction, [Azeri  president Haydar] Aliyev tried to enhance his authority and to  consolidate his rule in Azerbaijan. Because of that reason, it  is not surprising that he is willing to lose large numbers of  men and equipment for the sake of the most insignificant gain.  Although the failure of Azerbaijan's latest offensive of 1 and  1/2 months is evident, that country's propaganda machine has not  stopped its boasts, drumming up the fictitious victories of the  Azeri army. [passage omitted] This has been happening at a time  when virtually all the major battlefields are filled with  unburied Azeri corpses who have been left there by their  countrymen for political reasons (so that the large number of  casualties does not raise political complications for the Aliyev  administration). In order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics  special services of the NKR forces have been rounding up these  corpses and burying them in mass graves. However, the Azeri  authorities do not care: The killed soldier is replaced by a  fresh one, the destroyed brigade is replaced by one from the  reserves. A situation has been created whereby the fighters of  the Artsakh self-defense forces, no matter how strong morally  and convinced about the justice of their cause and their  eventual victory, are faced with severe hardships because of a  shortage of manpower. The boys, some of whom have been fighting  without rest for 5 years, are tired--some even weakened as a  result of continual sleeplessness and poor nutrition. The  endurance of their organisms can only be explained with the  astonishing Armenian will and ability to survive. The heroic  defenders of the NKR have and virtually receive nothing. Their  ammunition and weapons are primarily strategic, obtained from  the enemy. Obviously that cannot and does not meet the  requirements of a steadily intensifying war. Instances when NKR  army units cannot pursue fleeing enemy formations simply because  they are out of ammunition are not uncommon. The soldiers' lack  of clothing and food is even more distressing. The principal  elements of the Artsakh force are fighting in a state of  semi-starvation. I saw with my own eyes how, in one of the  supposedly most combat-ready (if it is possible to compare)  units, the Stepanakert brigade, which was at one time led by the  legendary Bekor Ashot, soldiers passed from hand to hand a few  loafs of bread before going to battle. Breaking small pieces  from the loaves each fighter proceeded to the post he is  assigned. Those pieces of bread were supposed to be the food  which would sustain them in a battle that could last all day.  [passage omitted]    In these circumstances of manpower shortages the defenders  of  Artsakh have performed miracles. They have won victories which  defy any military logic. Even so, the Artsakh army is in dire  need of volunteers from Armenia and the diaspora. Today there is  no man of arms-bearing age in Artsakh who has not been  conscripted; all of them are on the battlefronts. The Artsakh  army has only a small number of units, and that number is  getting smaller each day. Artsakh no longer has any reserves. As  Artsakh defends the cause of the Armenian nation today, the  Armenian nation is obligated to enlist in Artsakh's cause.  Artsakh's army is strong and combat-ready; it only needs  enlisted men. On many occasions, the fleeing enemy is not  pursued and the success of the Artsakh army is not fully  developed because there are no complementary forces to take  positions in the captured hills. Advancing soldiers often have  to stop half way and take positions in order not to leave their  rear unguarded. The same men attack during the day and keep  watch at night without taking any rest. Meanwhile the routed  enemy, having escaped hot pursuit, is able not only to rest and  recuperate but also to receive large quantities of  reinforcements and equipment and thus can reorganize its forces  and resume its offensive. As long as the entire Armenian nation  does not realize that the nation's destiny is being determined  on the battlefronts of Artsakh and as long as throngs of  volunteers do not head there with the call of blood, the war can  take a dangerous turn at any moment. The people and government  of Armenia must not allow the 150,000 Armenians of Artsakh to  stand alone against 7 million Azeris, and must be aware that  turning this war into a war of reserves cannot be allowed. Time  is working in Azerbaijan's favor. The war must be concluded  quickly.    It is time to wake up and begin building an army seriously.  Also, we must not be deceived by the Azeri offers of ceasefires,  which they remember and agree to only when they are in trouble.  Those ceasefires are used by Azerbaijan to prepare for new  offensives.</p>

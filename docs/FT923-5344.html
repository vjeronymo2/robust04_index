			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Alusuisse-Lonza declines but expects full-year rise ALUSUISSE-LONZA, the Swiss aluminium, speciality chemical and packaging group, said net income tumbled 23 per cent in the first half to SFr85m (Dollars 67.4m) but forecast a 20 to 40 per cent rise in net income for the full year. Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, said the group, formerly concentrated in aluminium, was seeing the first fruits of its recent diversification. The group had been able to increase operating margins in its chemicals and packaging divisions, compensating for falls in the aluminium division due to oversupply in world markets. Group sales rose 4 per cent to SFr3.3bn, with aluminium sales up 2.2 per cent to SFr1.8bn. Chemical sales rose 5.5 per cent to SFr791m. A-L Packaging sales were up 6.1 per cent to SFr655m. Mr Tschopp said no upturn in market conditions was expected in the second half in the primary aluminium and other commodity sectors. The large forecast improvement in profit for the full year would be realised mainly due to a poor result in last year's second half.</p>

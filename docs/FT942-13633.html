			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: New issues and tax My query concerns new issues, particularly privatisations, where the payment is made by instalments. A friend tells me that where payment of the 'calls' occurs within 12 months of the first payment, then indexation for capital gains tax applies to the full payment (including the calls) from the date of the first payment. Is this correct and, if so, where do I find the relevant legislation? There are two distinct situations (with distinct indexation rules): 1. Where shares are issued by a company partly-paid, then calls paid before the anniversary of their issue rank for indexation from the day of issue. 2. Where existing shares are sold on credit terms - as in privatisation offers - the whole of the purchase price (net of discounts, etc) ranks for indexation from the day of their acquisition. The whole of the purchase price (net of discounts, etc) is deemed to have been paid at the outset; if the shares are sold by the purchaser before all the instalments actually have been paid, the outstanding instalments are deemed to form part of the sale proceeds. The rule which prevents calls on partly-paid shares paid after the anniversary of their issue (or on the anniversary) from being indexed retrospectively is in section 113 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The basic rule - that indexation on the whole of the acquisition cost (regardless of whether the cash has actually been handed over) runs from the day of acquisition - is in section 54(4)(a) of that act. The rule that treats outstanding instalments as part of the proceeds of sale is in section 26(3). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

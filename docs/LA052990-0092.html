			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RILEY STILL CONSIDERING OPTIONS; DECISION AT LEAST A WEEK AWAY  </P> <P> Pat Riley said Monday it will be at least another week before he decides  whether he will return as the Lakers' coach. He also denied speculation that,  because of reported player unrest, Laker management is trying to force him into  accepting a front-office position.  </P> <P> Riley said he will meet with Jerry Buss, the Laker owner, again this week, and  he said he has yet to talk with NBC about a television commentator's job,  though he plans to explore that option.  </P> <P> Asked if the Laker coaching job is still his if he wants it, Riley said:  </P> <P> "Yeah, it is. Everybody is trying to create some scenario and hypothesize about  what hasn't happened yet. The team had a great season, and we were upset in the  playoffs. Everybody just needs a couple of weeks to cool off."  </P> <P> Riley said he has not been given a deadline to decide by Jerry West, the Laker  general manager. He said talks with West and Buss have been "amenable."  </P> <P> "There has been a meeting of the (Laker) minds, but the media is trying to  speed up the process," Riley said.  </P> <P> West, however, said last week he would like Riley to decide soon so that the  team could proceed with personnel changes.  </P> <P> "I told Jerry that what I'm going to do is in the club's best interest," Riley  said. "I know there are plans to be made, but everybody needs time."  </P> <P> Riley said he will be in New York this week for "a number of things, including  visiting my mother." He said no meeting with NBC is planned.  </P></p>

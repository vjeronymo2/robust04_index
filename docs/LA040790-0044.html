			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL COMPLETES WORK ON RITTENBERG REPORT  </P> <P> A Los Angeles city panel deciding the fate of Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg  finished its work Friday and sent its decision to the City Council, which will  take up the matter on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Board of Referred Powers, which has been meeting in secret, has voted to  fire Rittenberg for his handling of controversial city deposits in a bank that  employs Mayor Tom Bradley, sources said last week.  </P> <P> Rittenberg is entitled to a hearing to appeal the panel's decision before it  goes to the council, but no such hearing has been held, sources said. The quick  scheduling of the matter on the council agenda could indicate a settlement has  been reached.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Martsynovskyy: "Missiles on Target. </F> Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons Are Among the Main Objectives in  Moscow's Offensive External Policy"    [Text] It would be naive to believe that our missiles  constitute a military threat for Russia. These missiles are  under the operational control of Russia's Strategic Missile  Troops headquarters; they are serviced by Russian specialists  alongside Ukrainian ones; our military doctrine does not  envisage first nuclear strike, and so forth. Notwithstanding  this, Russia seeks Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as soon as  possible and the "missiles issue" remains a stumbling-block in  relations between Ukraine and Russia.    Moscow is developing vigorous activity. Taking advantage of  its prestige (more specifically, our lack of prestige) in the  world, it does everything it can to continue playing the role of  a big brother who holds the younger brother's hand and keeps  pointing at him: "A naughty boy!" This negative image of  Ukraine, the image of a minor nuclear aggressor is also steadily  being created by the Russian mass media, which are readily  quoted by the West. The world community is being encouraged to  put pressure upon Ukraine. An appeal was recently issued by  Russian designers, scientists, and specialists of the Atomic  Energy Ministry [Minatom] to citizens and governments of world  states, in which the Russians intimidated those governments with  the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. All the  numerous statements by high-ranking Ukrainian politicians and  military figures on the groundlessness of such assertions do not  produce any special effect and constitute, figuratively  speaking, whispers against a background of Russian loudspeakers.    Russia's official argument in this political struggle is the  dangerous state of our missiles. Having pointed out that our  politicians (people's deputy Serhiy Semenets, co-chairman of the  group for studying aspects of ratifying START I: "Emergency  Situations Are Impossible") and military figures (Minister of  Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy: "The State of Missile Facilities Is  Satisfactory") have a different opinion, we will proceed to some  other, more spontaneous, methods resorted to by Moscow for  attaining Ukraine's nuclear disarmament.    If Ukraine gets rid of its missiles, Russia will become the  only nuclear power in the region of Central and Eastern Europe.  This will also give it the traditional and desired possibility  to be at the top. The Russian desire to be in control is more  than obvious: For example, Russia's nervous reaction to plans by  Poland, Hungary, and Czechia to join NATO was very revealing.  If such plans are implemented, the alignment of forces promoted  in the region will not be in Russia's best interests. At a  recent (1 December 1993) CSCE conference in Rome, Russia  demanded that the mandate of a peacekeeper in CIS countries be  given to it -- not a single country supported that initiative.  Fortunately for us, because that mandate, alongside statements  by Russian politicians, in particular, Minister of Foreign  Affairs Andrey Kozyrev ("Russia must actively defend the rights  of the Russian-speaking population, using rapid-deployment  forces for the purpose"), would give our neighbors an  opportunity for large-scale activities, since (again, from  Moscow's point of view) that "Russian-speaking population" is  abused in almost every former Union republic. Thus, Russia is  clearly striving to gain control of the region, and Ukrainian  missiles, which are presently a real factor of deterrence, do  not in any way suit its "far-reaching" plans.    Another factor of Russian impatience is totally prosaic --  the cost of the content of the Ukrainian warheads. This amounts  to billions of U.S. dollars. That is why Russia demands that  the warheads be transferred precisely to it. Kazakhstan, which  had hitherto been "quiet," played a dirty trick on Moscow: On  13 December, an American-Kazakhstan agreement was signed -- the  Americans want to buy the entire uranium content of Kazakhstan's  missiles. That uranium is worth about $1 billion; therefore,  this money is flowing under Russia's nose into Kazakhstan's  treasury. Moscow newspapers immediately called Kazakhstan's  missiles "in fact, Russian property" and regretted that  Ukraine's uncompromising position is having such a bad influence  upon Kazakhstan's behavior. Therefore, Russia's striving to get  hold of Ukrainian warheads is perfectly understandable, as is  also Moscow's anxiety on this point: There is no agreement  between Ukraine and Russia on transferring warheads to Russian  plants.    Russia's reaction to our parliament's decree on ratifying  START-1 was all the more negative. At that time, Moscow  resembled a furious fisherman looking at yet another empty hook.  Kozyrev demonstratively refused to receive our Ambassador  Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy. The aforementioned appeal by Russian  scientists to the world was quickly arranged. The Moscow press,  having stopped pouring dirt by buckets, opened all the taps on  the tank.    A few words on the decree itself. It is quite obvious that  this document cannot be assessed in a simple way. Yes, despite  previous promises, we have actually become a nuclear power,  although temporarily so; yes, the decree is at variance with  some articles of the Lisbon Protocol under which our president's  signature appears; yes, the document itself, from the point of  view of politicians, contains rather naive points regarding  security guarantees for Ukraine. However, it is pointless to  assert either the wisdom or worthlessness of that document,  proceeding from immediate considerations alone: Doubtless the  future, perhaps, not so distant, will provide such an  assessment. Let me remind you that the deputies almost  unanimously (what a surprise!) approved the reduction, over  seven years, of 36 percent of launch vehicles and 42 percent of  warheads. They [the deputies] advanced conditions to the world:  Never use nuclear weapons against Ukraine; do not use  conventional armed forces against it, and do not resort to the  threat of force; refrain from exerting economic pressure for the  purpose of resolving any disputes; respect Ukraine's territorial  integrity and inviolability of borders. By the time the decree  was adopted, Ukraine had 176 vertical-launch installations with  1,240 nuclear warheads and 43 heavy bombers with 372 nuclear  warheads.    That the position of the Ukrainian parliament should not be  characterized in categorically negative terms was soon confirmed  by the Russian elections in which Zhirinovskiy, a "sincere  friend" of the former imperial colonies, triumphed.  Anti-Ukrainian articles on nuclear topics immediately  disappeared from Moscow newspapers (apparently, not for long).  The world became concerned and a question arose: Is it  generally safe to transfer the Union's nuclear weapons to  Russia? At any rate, the warheads of 17 missiles that were  deactivated by Ukraine at the end of December have remained "at  home." At other times, this would have given rise to certain  emotions in Russia. Now, there is complete tranquility. Maybe,  the United States will also revise its policy with regard to  Ukraine. So far, it only listened to what Russia was saying.    According to Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine will continue to  adhere  to its decision to become a nuclear-free state, but we will  demand that a tripartite agreement be concluded with Russia and  the United States. Meanwhile, an opinion is being formed among  Ukrainian parliamentarians on the need for Ukraine to gain full  control of its missiles: Such control on the part of Russia is  dangerous for our country. It is significant that there is no  nonaggression agreement between the two states. Besides,  Russia's military doctrine envisages a preventive nuclear strike  against nuclear countries. Technically speaking, according to  specialists, it is not a major problem for Ukraine to gain  positive control over the missiles. The problem is, rather, a  political one.    Without doubt, we are in favor of a nuclear-free world.  However, at present, a number of political and economic  considerations prompt us to refrain from hasty steps, such as  was the proclamation of the country's nuclear-free status at the  dawn of our independence. At any rate, the fulfillment of the  parliament's decree has already started, and this is a specific  step toward a nuclear-free Ukraine.</p>

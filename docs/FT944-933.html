			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Schauble reveals split in France Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of Germany's Christian Democrats in the Bundestag, said yesterday he was in a 'close consensus' on European Union reform with France's centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF), but was still 'not in harmony' with the Gaullist RPR party, which considered German conservatives' reform plans too supranational. Mr Schauble's remarks underlined the degree to which European policy will divide the UDF and RPR in the French presidential election. Mr Schauble told a press conference that he had carefully avoided the words 'federation' or 'confederation' in his talks with French politicians, who had initially reacted badly to the plan backed by Mr Schauble describing the European Commission as an embryo European government. Nonetheless, the leader of the Bundestag conservatives insisted that the EU had certain 'qualities of a state', and said Bonn's desire for an important role for the Strasbourg parliament and the Commission would be 'among the hardest issues' in its relations with Paris.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Swedish  counterpart Anders Bjoerck agreed today in Stockholm to closer  arms cooperation. Sweden has awarded a contract to the German  arms industry worth 2 to 3 billion German marks [DM], which  American and French firms had bid for without success.    [Begin recording] [Gabriela Gube, identified by caption]  Defense Minister Ruehe and his Swedish counterpart Anders  Bjoerck hope that this agreement will integrate Sweden into  Europe. Sweden's support for the Baltic republics is intended to  secure Europe to the East.    [Ruehe] If the Baltic states see that the way to the West is  not only via the center [as heard] but in this case via the  north, then all Scandinavian states, particularly Sweden, will  be doing something here which is in the interests of all of  Europe.    [Gube] German-Swedish cooperation extends to all kinds of  arms. Areas in which the two countries used to compete, for  example in submarine construction, they will now develop  together. Swedish knowledge in air defense systems and  simulators will help German arms.    The core of the deal, however, is the Leopard 2. Sweden  thinks that 50 new and 200 used models of the best tank in the  world will prove themselves in the tough northern climate. The  background to the DM2.5-billion deal is the concern about the  unpredictability of the East, particularly Russia, in spite of  the party mood.    [Bjoerck, in English with superimposed German translation] I  hope the Russians will not say about this deal that we Swedes  have not waged war for 200 years. [sentence as heard]    [Gube] It is a bitter fact that the end of the East-West  conflict does not mean detente but a greater degree of  insecurity. That, at least, is how it is in Scandinavia. The  German defense minister is of course pleased about the Swedish  purchase of arms, not only for commercial reasons. The  intractable Swedes are slowly being drawn toward Western  alliances, including military ones. That would have been  inconceivable even two years ago. Security is more important  than neutrality, even in Sweden. [end recording]</p>

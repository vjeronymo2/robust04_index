			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: 49ER OWNER WANTS TO KEEP COACH OUT OF TROUBLED WATERS  </P> <P> The Sporting News reported that San Francisco 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr.  bought a 23-foot fishing boat for Coach George Seifert.  </P> <P> Said 49er Vice President Carmen Policy: "The fishing boat George has been using  is 27 years old, it's small and it has capsized several times and almost sank  last year.  </P> <P> "Eddie wants to make sure George is around to coach a few more years."  </P> <P> Add 49ers: Said New Orleans President Jim Finks of former Saint defensive back  Dave Waymer, signed by the 49ers to a three-year, $2-million contract: "I don't  think -- in fact, I know -- that he can't play three years. The guy's a 10-year  guy who really didn't play that well last year as a safety. He's lost his  speed.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Ten men have hit 50 or more home runs in a season. How many can  you name?  </P> <P> Today's question: Will Charles Barkley make Julius Erving eat his words? The  Doc stated recently that he wasn't a fan of his former Philadelphia teammate  and explained: "I had trouble figuring out his style and adjusting to it. You  need a good leader to reach the pinnacle of success. That has yet to come and I  don't see any evidence that it will."  </P> <P> Add Barkley: Said Washington Bullet Coach Wes Unseld, claiming the officials  let Barkley get away with too much: "He just ducks his head and bowls people  over. He barrels right over them and nothing is called."  </P> <P> Said Barkley: "Wes should know. He's my role model. Everything I do under the  basket I learned from him."  </P> <P> No rush: Said Lee Trevino when told that Jack Nicklaus is planning to play in a  limited number of senior tournaments: "That's great with me. For every  tournament I play that Jack doesn't, tell Barbara I'll send her a dozen roses."  </P> <P> Barbara is Mrs. Nicklaus.  </P> <P> Would-you-believe-it dept.: Custom Cruises, Inc. will hold two "baseball  lovers" cruises this year featuring such Hall of Fame players such as Ted  Williams, Bob Feller and Willie Stargell. There are cruises to Alaska and the  Caribbean.  </P> <P> On the Caribbean cruise -- are you ready? -- there will be "special appearances  by Morganna the Kissing Bandit."  </P> <P> Blockhead?: Said Kelly Chase of the St. Louis Blues after a shouting match with  Wayne Van Dorp of the Chicago Blackhawks in the penalty box: "I was trying to  make friends, but he's a hard guy to talk to. I'm not fluent in 'cement.' "  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Roger Maris 61, Babe Ruth 60, Hank Greenberg 58, Jimmie Foxx 58,  Hack Wilson 56, Ralph Kiner 54, Mickey Mantle 54, Willie Mays 52, George Foster  52, Johnny Mize 51.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Comedian Tim Conway, on betting the ponies: "Fortunately, my wife is  understanding. When I come home from the races, she never asks any questions if  I tell her I just ate a $380 hotdog." HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

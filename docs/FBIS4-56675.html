			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with General Luis Alonso Discua </F> Elvir, commander of the Honduran Armed Forces, by Danilo  Izaguirre; place and date not given; from the "Morning Paper"  newscast--recorded]    [Text] [Izaguirre] We are talking with General Discua on  Congress' most recent decision to turn the obligatory military  service into a voluntary one. What is the Army commander's  position?    [Discua] In the name of the Honduran people, I would like to  congratulate the deputies, our people's representatives, for a  decision yesterday befitting of the Honduran people, including  the Armed Forces. A political decision has been made on this  issue. We have always criticized the methods used in  recruitment, because we regarded it as wrong. At that time we  did not have the political decision President Reina made now to  work on this aspect. I think his decision is right. The  Honduran people have duties to perform. Now there is a political  willingness to be carried out.    [Izaguirre] Do you people believe this decision is one made  by the Armed Forces commander in chief, the president of the  Republic, rather than by the Armed Forces as an institution?    [Discua] Correct. The Armed Forces are a nondeliberating  body and as such obey the decisions made by the commander in  chief, the president of the Republic. This position again  establishes the fact we are a permanent, national institution;  we are not a temporary institution. We are one of the columns  of this country's democracy. At no time have the Armed Forces  lent themselves to the promotion of internal disorder. We  support the democratic system, just as we did during the past  elections, and keep supporting it. The institution is permanent.    [Izaguirre] Does this mean no person or institution knocking  on the Armed Forces' doors can possibly use them for personal or  group gain because the Armed Forces have already defined their  position on the role of the Armed Forces?    [Discua] The Armed Forces' new role has been clearly  defined.  Armed institutions in Latin America play a fundamental role on  which the people's will rests entirely. This will is expressed  in the free election of officials to govern the country in a  democratic system. The Armed Forces will always stay alert. No  individuals or groups will ever be able to thwart the role the  Armed Forces play in the state. The Armed Forces are born with  the mandate to defend the state's sovereignty and the people's  rights and preserve internal order; this is the Armed Forces'  clear and fundamental role. We have assumed another great  responsibility, which we already had, according to the  Constitution, concerning education.    [Izaguirre] I talked with General Humberto Regalado, who  held  the same post as you. I would like you to discuss the people's  reports that the Army's recruitment is brutal. How are recruits  treated?    [Discua] An armed institution must have soldiers that have a  definite conviction. They must have an esprit de corps and a  physical condition fit to deal with any situation that might  arise. The Armed Forces have been trained to defend the country  and preserve internal order. There is something taken for  granted in the Armed Forces: discipline, loyalty, and respect,  all of which must be strengthened. Character is formed by  (?strict) discipline, such as the one we maintain. Recruitment  in the past had some defects, because there was no political  willingness. We now have a considerably updated and modern  military service law. This law clearly defines how recruitment  must be handled; unfortunately, there was never a political  willingness to enforce the law.    [Izaguirre] There was a lack not only of political  willingness but of a desire to obey the law. I understand that  the state must advise the Armed Forces of those who must render  military service.    [Discua] Correct. Serving in the Armed Forces is a duty  clearly defined in Article 40 of the Constitution. To render  military service is a citizen's duty. Details are now being  clarified, but we had already typified them in the Military  Service Law, which describes those who must render this service  and the way this service must be rendered. Congress has now  made the courageous decision of amending a Constitution article  under the president's initiative. I think we are on the right  track.    [Izaguirre] There is general concern among the people, and  you are the person who can explain the truth to the Honduran  people. This is their concern: What will happen in this  transition period -- that is to say, the time that will pass  before the amendment to Article 276 of the Constitution is goes  into force? How will recruitment be conducted between now and  the time the decree goes into effect?    [Discua] First, the Military Service Law is in effect. It is  true that the reform has been approved, but it must be ratified  by the second legislature. Therefore, the Military Service Law  is in force. According to this law, it is the responsibility of  the executive -- namely, the commander in chief of the Armed  Forces -- to fill the vacancies in the Armed Forces.    [Izaguirre] Some people also say that this temporal gap will  be used by the Armed Forces to forcefully recruit personnel.  Are the Armed Forces planning to carry out forceful recruitment  during this time?    [Discua] No, but there exists a constitutional duty to  recruit, according to Article 40. In addition, the Military  Service Law is in force. There are many procedures. I do not  have a copy of the law with me at this moment, but the Military  Service Law is clearly established and it remains in force.    There are drafts and boards. There is the Military  Enlistment Board, comprising the government minister and the  Armed Forces commander or his delegate. There are also  departmental boards, governors, and regional chiefs. We also  have mayors. We will issue draft documents to the approximately  1.2 million citizens who, according to the Constitution, have a  duty to serve in the military. Of this 1.2 million, less than 1  percent will be recruited into military units, whose sleeping  quarters, diners, and schools have been improved. The  Constitution establishes this service as a citizen's duty.    [Izaguirre] When this proposal was presented, were the Armed  Forces consulted on the economic repercussions of the proposal?  It is one of the important factors in this issue. To make  military service educational, voluntary, humanistic, and so on,  money is necessary. According to the president, military  service must be made attractive. Has this been discussed? Is  the country prepared for this?    [Discua] The president of the Republic has been adequately  clear on this situation. I think he has a clear, well-defined  answer. We have a new role in education. Rather, we already  had this role, but now it has been defined. We must contribute  to education in the country. I want to tell you something,  Danilo: We have always had secondary schools, trade schools, and  primary schools. I want to make something clear once and for  all. Adult Hondurans dislike attending school or studying.  When we have recruits in our units, we must force them to  attend secondary schools and primary schools. These recruits,  however, do everything imaginable to avoid going to school. We  see the results of this in the number of dropouts in primary and  secondary schools.</p>

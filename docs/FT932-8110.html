			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Personal View: The bureaucracy that stifles Europe Today, Britain's position in Europe is being damaged by a sense of false nationalism which is out of place in a changing world. This needs to be replaced by a sense of vision that certainly does not involve any real sacrifice of our national identity. Many people, including me, are old enough to remember the original visionaries of the new Europe: Monnet, Schuman and, yes, Sir Winston Churchill too. Of course they saw the considerable economic advantages of closer association. But equally they saw a Europe unlikely to be riven by conflict. A Europe with Germany as a central and involved member. A Europe of independent nation states but with citizens with a broader and richer understanding of each other, less likely to become hypnotised by old nationalistic slogans. There are few who would not subscribe to this vision. Yet today there are many who feel an increasing hostility to the whole European concept. Why should this be? The answer is one word - Brussels. Something has to be done about Brussels. Many people in business have a list of pettifogging regulations that have emanated from that great bureaucracy. But these are just symptoms of the general approach of the European Commission. Some of its members really do want to interfere as deeply as possible in local national affairs. There is a dirigiste philosophy that sometimes reminds one of Napoleonic edicts. There is an arrogance that is totally out of place, particularly in a group that has no elected status. I would hazard a guess that many of them have lost touch with the citizens whose interests they purport to serve, and especially with young people. Brussels contains too many of yesterday's people with yesterday's ideas and methods. Their motto seems to be: 'If it moves - regulate it; if it doesn't move - regulate it.' Industry is not well-served by Brussels. We seem to spend too much of our time fending off new forms of centralised social or industrial legislation and regulation. And while this is going on there seems to be studied indifference in the Community to the problem of European industrial competitiveness, as indicated by Europe's loss of share of world exports of manufactured goods from 22 per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 1992. And even when this point is addressed, some of the proposed solutions seem strangely like protectionism. I sometimes fear that Brussels would ideally like to organise European industry as well as it has organised European agriculture. This is no reason to abandon the single market as the so-called Euro-sceptics would wish. Rather it is a challenge to modify the Brussels approach so as to give primary emphasis to European industrial competitiveness. The principle of subsidiarity, with its genesis in the Maastricht treaty, is precious and needs to be refined and extended. It is clearly in harmony with the mood of Europe's people. Brussels must not be allowed to water it down or lose it under a load of bureaucracy. It is not the function of Brussels to trample over considerations of national tradition and working practices. Nothing would be more welcome to CBI members than a simultaneous announcement that parliament had ratified the Maastricht treaty and that a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord had been concluded. But the point about worldwide free and open trade is that it has a positive effect on competition. So we have a vital need to be competitive. And we need to be aware of this need as a community. The CBI's message to European governments and to the Commission is that there is serious work to be done on identifying the sources of Europe's overall loss of competitiveness and eliminating them. That is why we have persuaded our sister federations in Unice, the European employers' federation, to undertake a study of declining European competitiveness, focusing particularly on the impact of high social costs and emphasising the importance of avoiding further 'own goals' through the social chapter, or other related legislation. It is clearly in the interests of British business that the Maastricht treaty is ratified. Britain needs its government to be at the heart of the negotiations, ensuring that its concerns are taken into consideration, constantly improving and updating the single market and making it work fairly. And, I would add, curbing the power of the Brussels bureaucrats. This article is based on an extract from the speech by Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, at the CBI's annual dinner on Tuesday</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Rebel shareholder renews assault on Etonbrook MR ANDREW PERLOFF, the rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, the property developer, yesterday launched his second attempt in less than six months to take his holding to just under 30 per cent. The property entrepreneur announced a tender offer for 10.86 per cent of Etonbrook shares at 73p each, valuing the company at Pounds 2.8m. Mr Perloff and the three companies acting with him hold 19.13 per cent of Etonbrook. The action leaves little doubt among Etonbrook's management that Mr Perloff is seeking control of the company without launching a full bid. 'It is a further attempt in the saga . . . of trying to get control at a cheap and cheeky price,' said Mr Keith Moss, managing director. The offer was too low against a net asset value of 117p, he said. Twice before - in the cases of Multitrust and the Children's Medical Investment Trust - Mr Perloff has built stakes of just under 30 per cent in quoted companies before making an offer. Although Mr Perloff has twice failed to win a seat on the Etonbrook board, he has managed to thwart plans for a capital restructuring. This would have allowed Etonbrook to repay its Pounds 1.19m preference shares. One of Etonbrook's attractions is likely to be its cash balance of Pounds 2m. The preference holder, Palmerston Investment Trust, is Etonbrook's second largest shareholder with 12 per cent. It said that it had no intention of accepting the tender offer.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Unilever retreats in Procter &amp; Gamble 'soap war' Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, yesterday admitted its new generation washing powder could damage clothing under 'extreme laboratory conditions' and unexpectedly dropped a court case against Procter &amp; Gamble. Unilever had accused the US company, its bitter rival in the global detergents market, of making 'untruthful and misleading' statements. The case, which had been scheduled to be heard in the Netherlands next week, centred on alleged claims from a P&amp;G executive that Unilever's new super-concentrated detergent could damage clothes. The two companies compete fiercely in the Pounds 6bn European detergents market. Unilever said P&amp;G's comments about the new detergent, called Omo Power in the Netherlands and Persil Power in the UK, had been based on trials conducted by the US company in extreme laboratory conditions that were divorced from normal washing conditions. 'We do not believe P&amp;G's technical analysis can be generally applied to real life,' said Mr Willem Selman, chairman of Unilever's Dutch arm, Lever Nederland. Unilever said it had recreated extreme conditions in its own laboratory and found that under some exceptional circumstances a degree of wear and tear could be detected. It had therefore decided to 'fine-tune' the vital ingredient in the detergent, a manganese-based compound that accelerates washing action, to remove any doubt. Unilever said that before it launched the new powder it had tested the product with consumers in real-life conditions for more than two years and never encountered any problems after well over 10,000 washings. Unilever also dropped a second part of the suit involving trade market infringement after P&amp;G gave assurances that it would stop putting stickers with the word 'power' on the packaging of its own Ariel powder in the Netherlands. 'Some of the more lurid press reports apparently did not originate with them (P&amp;G), and there is little public sympathy for two large companies squabbling through the courts,' Mr Selman said. 'Accordingly, we would prefer the consumer to deliver the verdict,' he said. 'The product launch has been a success, and we appear not to have suffered any damage.' The detergent has been launched in 10 European countries at a cost of several hundred million pounds.</p>

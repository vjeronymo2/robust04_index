			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Major returns to the embrace of the right: Political Notebook Mr John Major heads a cabinet overwhelmingly of the Tory centre-left. He leads a party at Westminster dominated increasingly by its right wing. He was chosen four years ago by the right as the only acceptable successor to Baroness Thatcher. Under the tutelage of Mr Chris Patten, now governor of Hong Kong, he immediately chose the centre-left as his more natural political home. Now, after fighting them over Europe for most of the past three years, he has once again embraced the right. His erstwhile enemies among the Euro-sceptics are confident that the prime minister has at last ended up as 'One of Us'. But the message from cabinet big-hitters such as Mr Kenneth Clarke is: don't believe a word of it. No wonder Mr Major's party is confused. Where next? asked one senior minister with more than a hint of distaste this week. There's no going back, answered a rightwing colleague. One or two things are clear. Mr Major's tilt to the right has left him feeling more politically secure than he has been for some time. Talk of a leadership challenge in the autumn has abated. He is in a stronger position than he ever expected to be to carry out a radical reshaping of his cabinet. Waving the Union Jack during the European election campaign elicited plenty of unaccustomed plaudits from his party. Vetoing Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's presidency of the European Commission won him the sort of Commons cheers that he has not received since the immediate aftermath of the 1992 general election victory. Mr Major would not be human if he did not prefer applause to cat-calls. But the shift pre-dated the European poll. It started with the ill-fated back-to-basics campaign at last autumn's party conference when the Tory faithful were invited to parade their prejudices. The Conservatives need enemies. The unions have been tamed; the Communist bloc dismantled. Single mothers, DSS scroungers, criminals and Euro-federalists offer a convenient substitute. The slogan was obliterated by a spate of disclosures about ministerial adultery. But the benefits to be gained in terms of shoring up his own position did not escape Mr Major. The chattering classes may scoff, but the Tory faithful are not alone in caring about crime, about standards in schools and about the level of their taxes. The Euro-sceptic mood in 10 Downing Street has its roots in the same tactical manoeuvring. Back to basics saw off the possibility of a leadership challenge last autumn. Threatening and then using the British veto in Europe could do the same this year. The Tory right has, after all, proved itself consistently a much more ruthless enemy than the centre-left. There is no need to look further than the cabinet to see the consequences of the shift. The week began with Mr Michael Portillo capitalising on the reaction to the Corfu veto by setting out his minimalist vision of Europe's future. Mr Major, whose dislike of the chief secretary to the Treasury is one of Whitehall's worst-kept secrets, would once have been enraged. Now he publicly praised Mr Portillo for delivering an excellent speech. It was left to Mr Clarke to redress the balance with a typically unabashed exposition of his pro-Europeanism. The message was unequivocal. The sceptics may have put their tanks on Mr Major's lawn but they had better keep them off the chancellor's patch. Mr Major's aides just about managed to keep a straight face as they insisted the prime minister was fully in accord with both Treasury ministers. The sceptics, predictably, fumed. The political initiative remains for now with the right. As long as his future is under threat Mr Major will feel more comfortable with Lady Thatcher's acolytes than with a grumbling but not yet rebellious centre-left. Other, more fundamental, forces are pushing him in the same direction. The prospect of a Labour party led by Mr Tony Blair will raise the pressure on Mr Major to give more definition to his politics. He has failed to cast a Tory centrist alternative to Thatcherism. His party's centre of gravity has shifted back to the right. Re-inventing the Tories as the party of nationalism is an attractive option. Mr Douglas Hurd, as anxious as the prime minister to prevent the party from fracturing along its European fault-line, will offer some bricks to build the intellectual foundations for the new approach. He invented the multi-speed, multi-track Europe which played so well with the Tory troops in the elections for the Strasbourg assembly. We can expect now some more elegant rhetoric to explain how a strong commitment to British nationhood and to Europe can henceforth sit comfortably side by side. It is not enough however, for Mr Hurd to stand between Mr Clarke and Mr Portillo or between Mr Major and the Tory backbenches. The prime minister is enjoying his sojourn on the Euro-sceptic right. But his party and cabinet remain divided. Mr Major will find only temporary security in Lady Thatcher's mantle.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Israeli soldiers shot dead by militants: PLO and Israeli security forces to hold joint patrols in Gaza Strip The PLO and Israeli security forces are to hold joint patrols in the Gaza strip following the killing of two Israeli soldiers by radical Palestinian gunmen yesterday. The shootings put to the test policing arrangements between Israeli and Palestinian police for the first time since Israeli military withdrawal. The gunmen, belonging to extremist Islamic movements opposed to the Palestinian self-rule agreement, shot the soldiers at a checkpoint a few hundred metres inside the strip and then fled into the self-rule areas controlled since Wednesday by Palestinian police. Under the self-rule agreement Israeli security forces only have the right of 'hot pursuit' into the Palestinian-ruled area, but otherwise must work through Palestinian police to try and secure the arrest of Palestinian attackers. Israel reacted by barring all Palestinians from entering the Jewish state for nine days saying the closure would enable Palestinian policemen to firm up security checks and curb further attacks. Since Israel eased a complete closure last month at least 2,500 Palestinians had been crossing daily into Israel to work. The way in which Palestinian police handle their first security test and take measures to curb violence by Palestinian extremists may well determine future Israeli-PLO negotiations to expand self-rule to the rest of the occupied West Bank and ultimately to statehood. Mr Yossi Sarid, the Israeli environment minister, warned yesterday that unless Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, took stiff measures against extremists he would 'end his career as the mayor of Jericho because that will be the end of the experiment'. Palestinian security forces have said they intend to disarm radical factions like the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement who have vowed to continue armed struggle against Israel from inside the self-rule areas. The 10 factions opposed to the agreement, led by Hamas, have warned such a move could spark an internal Palestinian civil war. Major-General Nasr Yousef, head of the Palestinian police force, tried to reassure Israel after yesterday's attack. 'There is no doubt we shall exercise our right as the authority. We shall take the necessary measure,' he said. Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior PLO official who paid a surprise visit to the Gaza from Cairo yesterday to bring money to the Palestinian police, said: 'I knew some incidents would happen. I am very sorry that they happened. We have to do our best to pre-empt and prevent them from recurring.' PLO officials said the Palestinian police were not yet ready and would only be firmly in control within a week. Yesterday's attack coincided with mounting concern inside Israel about the ability of the PLO to govern the faction-riven Strip of 800,000 Palestinians packed in teeming refugee camps and squalid towns. Israeli military officers have warned that the Palestinian police are underfunded and have failed to take control of law and order.</p>

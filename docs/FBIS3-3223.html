			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Major social conflicts including racial and  religious disputes surged in China last year, jeopardising  stability, the Public Security Ministry said in a report to the  National People's Congress. The number of petitions,  demonstrations, rallies, strikes in factories and markets, and  boycotts of school classes rose sharply. The report said most  of the cases were because of delays in payment of wages for  workers and teachers, price rises, resettlement caused by urban  re-development, hefty levies on peasants and the reclamation of  farmland. Some erupted as a result of racial and religious  problems, it said.    "As the disputes directly hinged upon the interests of a  group of people, some incidents were of a larger scale and  lasted for a long period of time. They involved more people.  Over the past year, these incidents have increased. (We) should  have a high degree of vigilance over the problem," the report  said.    The increase in mass unrest was only part of a nationwide  picture of worsening law and order in the past year, marked by a  dramatic increase in major crimes, gang activities, social  evils, fraud, violence and industrial accidents. "The overall  law and order situation remains grim. The number of problems  has been relatively large," the report said.    The ministry reported that major crime cases handled by  police officers at all levels had risen by 18 percent annually  in the past few years. Theft and robbery cases took up 80  percent of cases it said. Highway robbery had sharply increased  last year. Crimes on roads and highways remained out of control  in some places. Gangsters, some armed with guns and knives, had  seriously endangered social order in some villages and township  areas, the report said.    The ministry highlighted coastal cities when discussing the  rampant growth of social evils such as the sex trade. Such  activities have also spread into villages.    The total number of fraud cases involving more than 100.000  yuan (about HK$88,800) soared by 53.2 percent in the previous  year, it said. There were more than 10 "hundreds of million of  yuan" cases, including the US$10 billion case (HK$77 billion) in  a Hebei branch of the Bank of Agriculture, which involved  malpractices in the issuing of letters of credit.    The report accused domestic and international criminal  elements of collaborating to take advantage of loopholes in the  financial system, under the guise of fund-raising. Some  criminals had given bribes to banking officials to siphon  massive amounts of foreign exchange out of the country, it said.    The report pointed out the number of assaults on public  security officers had also gone up. The number of injuries rose  from about 600 in 1985 to more than 8,000 last year and 275 were  killed.    The ministry admitted a small number of public security  officers were involved in corruption. "Although the number is  small, the impact is really bad. The reputation of the whole  police force has been tarnished and the relationship between  them and the masses has been damaged." Following the  anti-corruption campaign launched last August, it said the  ministry had handled 1,677 cases of violations of laws and  regulation by 2,002 public security officers. The report said  it was hoped a new People's Police Law would be forwarded to the  Standing Committee for discussion soon.    The ministry urged police forces to prepare for unrest and  to  closely monitor the situation.</p>

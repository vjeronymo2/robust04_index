			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, the definition of ``ownership or control link'' included references to ownership or control ``under paragraph (b)'' of 30 CFR 773.5. Since the publication date of that proposal, OSM has proposed changes in the definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' contained at 30 CFR 773.5. See Proposed Rule, Definitions and Procedures for Transfer, Assignment and Sale of Permit Rights; Definition of Ownership and Control, 58 FR 34652  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (June 28, 1993). If some of those proposed changes are ultimately adopted, the reference to ownership or control as defined by ``paragraph (b)'' contained in the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' would be inappropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, to assure flexibility, OSM has deleted the reference to ``paragraph (b)'' of 30 CFR 773.5 from the final definition of ``ownership or control link.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' indicated that a link included presumptive ownership or control relationships which had not ``been successfully rebutted under the provisions of &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.26 or &sect;&sect;773.25 and 773.26 or under the provisions of part 775 of this chapter and &sect;773.26 of this part.'' As is discussed below in this preamble, OSM has deleted proposed section 773.25, procedures for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS and has renumbered proposed &sect;773.26 as final &sect;773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations. The final definition of ``ownership or control link'' has been amended to reflect these changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules are adopted containing the provisions described in this preamble above at  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of Rules Adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 773.10_Information Collection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have revised &sect;773.10 which contained a list of the existing information collection requirements in part 773 and also the OMB clearance number indicating OMB approval of the information collection requirements. The proposed rule revision would have updated &sect;773.10 by including the proposed AVS-related rules containing information collection requirements. The proposed revision provided an estimate of the average public reporting burden per response of three hours, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The proposed section also listed the addresses for OSM and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) where comments on the information collection requirements may be sent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters asserted that the estimate of three hours to prepare an average response for the collection of information required was unrealistically low. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with commenters' assertion. The three hours estimated burden was an estimated average, rather than a predicted figure for the burden of a single, typical response. The calculation of an ``average'' response means that there are some responses which may require larger amounts of time to prepare and that there are also some responses which may require significantly lesser amounts of time. It is entirely reasonable to expect that the reporting and information collection burden of these regulations may vary among entities depending upon the entities' size and structural complexity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, once companies have researched and compiled their particular ownership or control information, they have done the basic research which can be used for future compliance. This basic ownership or control research will then be readily available to the company and the company only needs to update such research to reflect changes in ownership or control for future applications. Once entities and regulatory authorities develop experience in complying with the regulations, they will also develop experience in collecting, storing, retrieving, and reporting the necessary compliance information. A number of large companies have told OSM that they have already collected and stored their ownership or control information in a computerized database or are in the process of doing so. Once such information has been so stored, it would be readily accessible and easily retrieved for compliance purposes. Thus, the amount of time required to prepare a typical response under these regulations should diminish over time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, in the final rule adopted today, OSM has recalculated the estimated time for compliance in accordance with standard procedures required by the OMB. OSM has concluded that the public reporting burden for the collection of information required by part 773 as amended by these final regulations is four and one half hours per response, rather than three hours. The final rule also has been modified to delete specific references to the particular sections of part 773 which are relevant for information collection purposes. Instead, OSM has provided a reference to the collection of information required by 30 CFR part 773, since this part encompasses all sections of part 773, including the final rules adopted today, which generate an information collection obligation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

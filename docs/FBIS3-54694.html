			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin article under "Opinion" rubric: "The Arab </F> East: Compass of Security"]    [Text] The visit to Moscow by Kuwaiti Defense Minister  Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah, the signing of the intergovernmental  agreement on cooperation in the military sphere, and the  subsequent exercise by ships of the two countries in the Persian  Gulf have elicited lively comments both in the East (the Arab  East, above all) and in the West.    The first thing they noticed was that Russia is striving for  a colossal arms market. Kuwait, which intends to spend  approximately $12 billion over 10 years on acquiring weapons,  really does represent a highly favorable trading partner. Well,  it would be the height of hypocrisy to deny that Russia is  motivated exclusively by altruism [sentence as published]. The  Arab East is of definite interest to us also from the viewpoint  of replenishing our more than meager currency reserves.  Particularly since it seems that we will not receive any  palpable aid from the West. The fears of the United States,  Britain, and France, which have taken up key positions on the  arms markets, about a possible Russian breakthrough into this  territory are indeed understandable.    It seems to me that the chief thing is not only and not so  much the financial opportunities which the arms trade promises  as the fact that Russia is at last starting to aspire to (or, at  any rate, is making a serious bid for) the role of one of the  guarantors of the security system in a very difficult region of  the globe. At the same time, Russia is also taking care of its  own interests. If only because of our geographic proximity to  the southern borders of the CIS, there exists a real danger of  the spread, or "overflowing," of instability across our borders.  To be more precise, the simple configuration of the potentials  for conflict in the Caucasus (the "Caucasian knot") and in the  Persian Gulf region could produce a totally different quality of  confrontation in this segment of the "arc of crises."    Moscow has a vital interest in preserving peace and  stability  in this region also because the Gulf zone is the source of such  terrible dangers as narcotics trafficking, an uncontrolled arms  trade, and so-called extraterritorial threats. Finally, some  states are drawing up ambitious plans to create weapons of mass  destruction. Their possible use close to the borders of Russia  and the CIS is fraught with very unpredictable consequences.  Moreover, from the military viewpoint the presence of  unfriendly forces in the region could in time become a lever to  exert pressure on our country.    In our view Saudi Arabia can be the main link in the system  of security in the Persian Gulf region. Whereas prior to the  war in the Persian Gulf the balance of power here was maintained  chiefly thanks to the Iranian-Iraqi standoff, now there is  hidden, indistinct rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The  Saudis, who for a long time preferred to act exclusively by  peaceful means, have decided to try independently to create  armed forces capable of responding to any regional challenge to  their security.    The bitter experience of proximity to such dangerous  countries as Iraq and, to some extent, Iran has made Riyadh make  substantial corrections to its defense concept. In practice  this has resulted in huge military purchases thanks to which  Riyadh has become the world's biggest arms importer. It  accounts for more than one-third of all the arms supplied to the  third world.    The Saudis should not, however, be condemned for  overmilitarization. They have something to defend and the right  to defend it. Particularly as the arms being acquired and the  building of the army are aimed not at expansion (the Saudis have  no need of other people's property -- they have more than enough  of their own) but defense. Once bitten, twice shy.    Of course, the growth in the strength of the Saudi Army's  armed forces is limited by the country's total human resources,  which are comparable with Iraq's but considerably inferior to  Iran's. In addition, Saudi generals have no experience of  waging combat operations. In practical terms, the army has not  come under fire. It will take many years to create really  battleworthy armed forces. No wonder, in this connection, that  the Saudis' defensive concept is geared above all to support  from the U.S. armed forces.    Of course, Riyadh's close ties with Washington determine a  certain regional preponderance of forces in favor of the United  States. Therefore Russia's more active -- to one degree or  another -- participation in the regional security system would  meet Moscow's interests. But this is not the only reason.  Riyadh, being the official custodian of the chief Islamic holy  places in Mecca and Medina, is opposed to religious extremism in  politics. Possessing indisputable authority in the world of  Islam, it could also play a more active role in settling local  conflicts on CIS territory, particularly in the so-called new  Muslim states.    I believe that these arguments will suffice to acknowledge  Russia's right to be concerned about peace and security in the  Arab East.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos titled: "Our Homage"] </F>   [Text] Good evening. Today, our words are dedicated to  several sectors of the national life, whose commemorations we  have observed. First, I do not want to forget that today, 6  June, is the 33d anniversary of the creation of the Interior  Ministry [Minint], one of the most active fronts at this current  juncture of the fatherland, the most active sector against crime  and those who wish to threaten national security. I extend my  respect and admiration to these honorable men and women.    Comrades, our people are perfectly aware of the  conscientiousness and morality with which you conduct your work  in the midst of enemy lies and the barrage of hostile  propaganda. Our people are aware of how treacherous is the lie  abroad that distorts the impeccable attitude of even the last  man of the Minint in the midst of very difficult conditions and  against totally amoral people.    We constantly witness the committed endeavors of the Minint  workers to confront crime, which has strategically sided with  the enemy. Yet, this is to no avail with those people who take  women and children as hostages in their petty personal desires  to emigrate. Leaving Cuba does not condemn them; what does is  that they do not hesitate to use violence, trickery, theft,  lies, and unlawfulness to do so. Our people clearly understand  this struggle and this is why they admire and support you  because the people recognize your bravery and the need to  maintain order and confront those who attempt to make chaos and  crime the rule.    Other sectors are also observing important dates. The day  after tomorrow is Legal Workers's Day -- lawyers and judges,  clerks and prosecutors, registry workers, notaries, and lawyers'  office workers. To them, we also extend our respect and hopes of  seeing their efficiency increase in the fight against crime and  illegality.    There are other important dates. There is also the Library  or  Librarians' Day; friends who are many times not recognized given  the urgency of the other problems we face. We find libraries and  librarians at every level of our school system, and in the  cities, with their supply of information and culture ready for  our work or leisure -- a book, magazine, pamphlet, map, data,  math tables, a name, a dictionary, the title of a book, or a  foreign tale, anything. A thousand things that we need to know  and for which we have to consult libraries and librarians. We  know that nowadays these institutions face many difficulties,  given the shortage of resources, and perhaps some might have  closed their doors. These are transitory problems, however.  Libraries continue to survive despite it all, and their wealth  of knowledge is at our disposal. There is nothing more fair or  well deserved than extending to them our respectful salute.</p>

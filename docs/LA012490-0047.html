			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: GRANT GUARD WEINSTEIN GIVES OPPONENTS FITS TO  THE VERY END;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: TAKING CHARGE DOWN THE STRETCH, THE SENIOR FINISHED WITH MORE THAN  HALF OF HIS TEAM'S POINTS IN AN UPSET OF NORTH HOLLYWOOD LAST WEEK.  </P> <P> On almost any given weekend morning, the regulars show up at a Van Nuys  elementary school for a pick-up game.  </P> <P> You can count on Keith Weinstein and the Grant High players to show up. And,  just as regularly, Harry Marks and Robert Hill from archrival North Hollywood  show up too.  </P> <P> Except this past weekend. Because it wasn't just any given weekend.  </P> <P> "They didn't show up this weekend," Weinstein said.  </P> <P> They are the North Hollywood players.  </P> <P> And the Huskies should be forgiven. They had seen enough of Weinstein raining  three-point shots. They had seen enough of him stealing the ball. They had seen  enough of him just plain beating them.  </P> <P> So why go through it again on a day off?  </P> <P> Yes, 5-foot-10 shooting guard Keith Weinstein had a day to remember last  Wednesday when Grant upset North Hollywood for the second time this season.  Last month, in the North Hollywood tournament, Grant beat the Huskies, 54-43.  </P> <P> This time, the score was 48-46 and it sent North Hollywood to its only other  loss of the season. What role did Weinstein play?  </P> <P> The senior scored 25 points -- more than half of his team's total -- on  nine-of-15 shooting from the field. He made five three-point shots, had four  steals and handed out a couple of assists. More importantly, he proved to be  the coolest of players in an important game.  </P> <P> Time and again down the stretch, the Lancers looked to Weinstein. Time and  again, he answered.  </P> <P> "I feel like I can do it at the end," Weinstein said simply.  </P> <P> With Grant leading, 35-33 and time running out in the third quarter, Weinstein  scored on a buzzer-beating jump shot to make the score 37-33.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 37-37, and just 6:03 left, Weinstein launched an  NBA-distance three-point shot and was fouled. The shot hit only net, as did his  free throw, giving Grant a 41-37 lead.  </P> <P> Then, as Grant trailed, 44-43, with less than a minute remaining, Weinstein  picked up a loose ball, streaked down the court, made a layup and was fouled,  setting off bedlam in the gymnasium. He made the ensuing free throw and Grant  led, 46-44.  </P> <P> "He's our most valuable player," Grant Coach Howard Levine said. "He has been  all along."  </P> <P> Weinstein scored nine of the team's final 13 points. Almost more crucial to him  and his mates, though, was winning a little respect.  </P> <P> "Every time we play (North Hollywood) it's something special," Weinstein said.  "Because last time we beat them, not many people thought that it was for real."  </P> <P> They have to believe now. Weinstein followed his performance in the North  Hollywood game by scoring a team-high 17 points -- in just three quarters -- on  Friday during a routine win over Poly on seven-of-15 shooting. He made three  three-point shots and handed out six assists.  </P> <P> Weinstein has made 27 of his past 50 shots from the field -- including 11  three-point shots -- in Grant's past four games, all wins. But like a true  disciple of the disciplined Levine, he switches to team-oriented discussion.  </P> <P> "We have to play hard in every game or else," he said. "We try really hard.  We're not at all a cocky team. We're kinda like a humble team."  </P> <P> On an individual note, though, Weinstein said that he has received a few  letters from Division II schools but likely will attend a junior college next  fall.  </P></p>

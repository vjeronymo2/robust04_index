			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun] </F>   [Text] The BALTIMORE SUN of 15 January reported that the  U.S. Defense Department has approved the sale to the ROK of a  very defective electronic jamming system for F-16 fighters.    This electronic jamming system was jointly produced by the  U.S. firm Westinghouse and ITT [expansion unknown]. However,  its actual combat performance tested in 1992 failed to show  satisfactory results, leading the U.S. Defense Department to  cancel its contract to buy the system.    While noting that the F-16's which the ROK is set on  purchasing are supposed to be equipped with this system, the  BALTIMORE SUN did not specify the price or number of systems the  ROK will purchase from the United States.    The paper said that the U.S. decision to sell this system to  the ROK was noted in the letter which U.S. Deputy Secretary of  Defense William Perry recently sent to the ROK defense minister.    The system was developed as a self-defense system to protect  the fighter plane from a radar-guided arms attack of an enemy.</p>

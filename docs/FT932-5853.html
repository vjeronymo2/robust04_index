			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Cambodian Elections: Moment of truth in Phnom Penh - UN is resisting losers' call for poll rerun THE communist Cambodian government, trailing the royalist opposition in preliminary results from the UN-organised election last week, has insisted polling be held again in at least four provinces, and has threatened to reject the results if its demands are not met. Officials of the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) have produced several unsubstantiated reports of electoral 'irregularities' and issued veiled warnings to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) that the government might resort to violence to press its demands. 'We get many indications that there might be some insurrection or riot, and we fear that the situation might get out of control,' Mr Khieu Kanharith, the government spokesman, told a news conference yesterday. In a meeting with diplomats from countries which supported the 1991 Paris peace accords and the election, other government officials said they might not be able to restrain army officers from acting without authority. The government wants new elections in Phnom Penh, Battambang, Kompong Chhnang and Prey Veng. Untac, although disturbed by the government's threats, said it had no plans to hold the elections again without proof that there had been irregularities. The UN has increased security at Untac's popular radio station, accused of bias by the government, and installed heavy machine guns. 'I don't believe that the predictions of unrest have any basis,' said Mr Yasushi Akashi, who heads Untac's Dollars 2bn mission to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia. 'I hope the result of the elections will be respected.' With about two thirds of the votes counted, the royalist party Funcinpec looks set to win more seats than the CPP in the new 120-seat assembly, which is supposed to write a new constitution within three months and then give birth to a new government. Trying to maintain stability during the coming months, Untac is seeking an unspecified sum of international financial aid to pay the government's 200,000 or so soldiers, policemen and militiamen, and to keep the rest of the administration ticking over. Government revenues have plunged in recent weeks because of corruption at customs posts and because Chinese traders, reluctant to keep high levels of stock in Cambodia, have cut imports. The government is dismayed by the imminent loss of its monopoly of power and evidently confused about how to react, prompting speculation that the ruling CPP is divided on the issue. 'I think they are having some internal difficulties to convince these people to accept these elections,' said Mr Akashi. 'It may not be easy.' Early results from Kompong Cham, showing nearly a two-to-one lead in favour of Funcinpec, are a particularly hard blow for the government. The province accounts for 18 of the 120 assembly seats and is the home of Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister; his brother is the provincial governor. Official spokesmen yesterday veered between threatening to reject the results completely and suggesting that objections are technical ones which could be resolved with Untac. Options for the government are limited. Denied international recognition since it was installed by the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979, the CPP is unwilling to undergo a further 14 years of isolation. It is doubtful CPP leaders could mobilise genuine public demonstrations in Phnom Penh, where again the vote was two-to-one in favour of Funcinpec. The claims of irregularities and fraud are unconvincing. Also, army loyalty cannot be guaranteed because many soldiers are paid late. Funcinpec, meanwhile, continues to complain of government attacks on its members. According to Funcinpec officials, a 57-year-old woman member of the party and her son were murdered in Prey Veng province at the weekend.</p>

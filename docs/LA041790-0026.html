			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK DEFENSE SEEKS NON-LOCAL JUDGE  </P> <P> Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick's attorney filed a formal challenge Monday to  the San Diego bench, contending that no San Diego County Superior Court judge  can preside over his client's murder trial without there being an appearance of  impropriety.  </P> <P> Jack M. Earley said that San Diego judges will appear to be biased because one  of Broderick's alleged victims, her ex-husband, was a prominent malpractice  attorney and one-time president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. who often  fraternized with members of the bench. Earley asked to have the case assigned  to a judge from another county.  </P> <P> "The allegations are basically that it's a close-knit legal community, and that  that causes a problem with any judge hearing the case because people fairly  well know each other," Earley said. "By keeping a judge in the county here,  they create a legal boondoggle that otherwise would be completely erased. Why  would you jeopardize a four- to six-week trial when the easy procedure is to  bring someone in from out of county and eliminate all those questions?"  </P> <P> Broderick, 42, is accused of shooting Daniel T. Broderick III, 44, and his  28-year-old wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, early on the morning of Nov. 5. She  has pleaded not guilty, and her trial has been set for July 16.  </P> <P> Judge Jesus Rodriguez did not make Earley's declaration public Monday, but,  after the hearing, Earley summarized it.  </P> <P> Earley said there are people in the legal community who have indicated "that  Betty Broderick will burn for this offense." He noted that Daniel had worked  for San Diego's oldest law firm, Gray, Cary, Ames &amp; Frye, and that some of  his former colleagues are now judges. Earley added that one judge, Thomas  Ashworth III, had told prosecutors that he feared Betty.  </P> <P> These details would likely "have an effect on the other judges, knowing that  prominent members want to make sure that she gets convicted," Earley said,  </P> <P> adding that San Diego judges might be influenced in their decisions because  they know their future assignments could depend on how other judges view their  conduct.  </P> <P> Earley said he expected that judges would be called as witnesses to testify  about Betty's mental state throughout her divorce. He also plans to challenge  decisions made during the Broderick divorce by local judges.  </P> <P> "There was a number of ex parte orders, restraining orders and jailing of Betty  Broderick that will be challenged and some judge is going to have to sit and  judge credibility," he said. "They have a power to admit or not admit certain  evidence. So there might be evidence that never gets before the jury because  they want to save embarrassment for a fellow judge or the court system."  </P> <P> Rodriguez will rule on Earley's motion April 25.  </P></p>

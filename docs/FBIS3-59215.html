As  the minister said after the cabinet had approved the annual  economic report for 1994, he will not allow his views to be  altered by "professional Cassandras."    Moderate wage agreements and low interest rates mean above  all that the "growth" of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent in  western Germany and between 6 percent and 8 percent in eastern  Germany predicted by the government is realistic. An increase  in prices of about 3 percent is not "too rosy a picture." As  for the level of unemployment, which is supposed to rise by  "about 450,000" in 1994, "a change of direction will only become  possible in 1995." That is because this year, adjustments will  still take place in large companies to make production cheaper.    Criticism from the opposition and industrial associations to  the effect that the government is being too optimistic about  economic development was described as "carping and much ado  about nothing" by Rexrodt. Rexrodt also demanded "fair  treatment" for "the program for more growth and employment." It  is incomprehensible that "some associations are already  complaining that we have not done anything yet." However, along  with the annual economic report, the government has already  repealed the law on discounts as well as produced bills for a  new conversion law and the introduction of small-scale  joint-stock companies. Over the next few weeks, things will  proceed "one after another." That particularly applies to labor  measures, which include "sensational things" contained in the  "action program."    At the same time, the FDP politician complained about  "spiritual ossification" in Germany, which manifests itself  above all in hostility toward technology and "bureaucratic  senility." Quoting Bismarck, the minister said: "Heavy  industry always has a hard time."    Rexrodt stressed that investors need "reliable budgetary  perspectives." Scope must be created for "the necessary  reduction in taxes and dues." Hermann Rind, FDP spokesman on  economic affairs, criticized statements made by Joachim  Gruenewald of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] that in the  next term of office, there will only be reform of company  taxation that is neutral in its effects on revenue. As soon as  the budgetary situation permits, the FDP would be more inclined  to effect a genuine reduction in the taxation burden on  companies, which is high in international terms.</p>

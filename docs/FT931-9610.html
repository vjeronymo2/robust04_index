			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / GM improves in fourth quarter GENERAL Motors yesterday reported improved fourth quarter results from its troubled North American car business, but also announced a Dollars 23.5bn (Pounds 15.5bn) loss for 1992, largely because of a non-cash change in accounting principles. The net loss for the year was the largest ever recorded by a US company but was discounted by Wall Street, which focused instead on the group's encouraging fourth quarter figures. GM had fourth quarter income before special items of Dollars 273.3m, or 10 cents a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of a loss of up to 50 cents a share and its loss of Dollars 520m in the same period of last year. Analysts said the figures boded well for improved 1993 profits and GM's shares closed up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 40 1/2 . GM said North America lost Dollars 4.5bn in 1992 before interest, tax and special items, down from Dollars 7.9bn in 1991. The full year loss of Dollars 23.5bn, or Dollars 38.28 a share, included a previously announced Dollars 20.8bn charge for the change in accounting for retirees health benefits. All sizeable US companies face this accounting change, but GM's charge is by far the largest, because of the size of the business and the age of its workforce. In the fourth quarter, the loss was Dollars 966m, down from Dollars 1.27bn a year earlier. Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said the company had enjoyed strong positive cash flow in the quarter and continued to aim for the 'aggressive but achievable' goal of break-even in North America in 1993, before interest, taxes and retiree health expenses. The company is restructuring to return its North American vehicle operations to profit. This involves factory closures, staff cuts, new working practices and a reduction in money-losing sales to bolster market share. GM expects the highly prof-itable European market to weaken.

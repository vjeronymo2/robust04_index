			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires. 20 May (NA) -- The trade sanctions  that might be applied by the U.S. Government against Argentina  if it does not approve a patents law by 30 June were termed "an  illegal and illegitimate action" today by Pablo Challu,  executive director of CILFA [Argentine Industrial Center of  Pharmaceutical Laboratories].    In a new CILFA onslaught against the U.S. Government, Challu  said Ambassador James Cheek "is mistaken" when he justifies the  "threat" of trade sanctions with "the argument that GATT acts a  reference."    While the draft of a new patents law continues without  resolution in Congress, the pressure of interested groups was  again refloated this week.    In his most recent meetings with the media, Cheek took  advantage to once again apply the thumbscrews on the topic of  patents, and on 19 May, after meeting Radical [Radical Civic  Union] deputies, he warned that trade sanctions "will be  unavoidable" if the new law is not approved.    Meanwhile, CILFA, through its executive director, today  parried these remarks with an ardent defense of the GATT  agreement's precepts.    "The countries that signed the agreement are not obliged to  approve patent laws that surpass the norms established in it,"  Challu emphasized.    The executive director of the organization that groups  national laboratories considered it a "mistake" to justify that  GATT "is a reference point that must be taken into account by  the countries that must introduce greater protection."    This is exactly one of Cheek's justifications to insist that  Congress approve a law that will favor his country's  laboratories.    To disqualify these justifications, Challu today clarified  that despite the fact the Article No. 1 indicates that GATT  members can include complementary protection in their national  legislation in addition to the protection demanded by the  agreement, "this cannot violate its precepts."    Challu stressed that due to this motive "there is no  obligation for Argentina to grant those greater concessions."    "The unilateral U.S. trade sanctions are an illegal and  illegitimate action because it is not contemplated in the GATT  nor in any other international legislation," Challu stressed.

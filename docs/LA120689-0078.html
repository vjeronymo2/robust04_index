			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTOPSIES PLANNED ON TWO CHICAGO HARNESS HORSES  </P> <P> Autopsies are planned on two horses that died while running a harness race at  Maywood Park, a track spokeswoman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Preliminary examinations indicate that Fredericton N. died of a heart attack  and that a common condition called "choking down" (when the animal chokes on  blood pumped from its heart into its lungs) killed the other pacer, Judge For  Yourself, according to spokeswoman Eleanor Flavin.  </P> <P> Both horses collapsed during the eighth race Monday night and were dead by the  time track veterinary aides reached them.  </P> <P> Fredericton N., a 7-1 shot, went down just past the quarter-mile pole during  the race.  </P> <P> Then, just past the turn for home, Judge for Yourself, off at 9-2, swerved off  the track, crashed through a rail and died on the spectator apron. Driver Jim  Knowlton, who fell from the sulky before it broke through the rail, was  uninjured.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Violeta Pacheco Garcia] </F>   [Text] Veracruz, Ver., 16 March--The representative of the  State Attorney's Office, Marco Antonio Gonzalez Baez Cardoso,  announced that 810 kg and 600 grams of cocaine were seized in  the municipality of Casitas, north of this city, where a  presumed drug trafficker was captured.    He explained that Federal Judicial Police agents under  orders  from the force's deputy commissioner, Fernando Asiain Diaz  Barriga, have spent several months investigating the possible  drug dealing case. At 1400 today, they arrested Jose Luis Acosta  Morales, as he was attempting to transport the drug in his  pickup truck.    He noted that the cocaine was contained in 25 burlap bags,  camouflaged in cardboard boxes labeled "Sandals and Playsuits."  Acosta Morales was caught while leaving his residence in the  Veracruz municipality of Casitas. He was attempting to board his  panel type Dodge vehicle with license plates SA 38347, of  Puebla, his native state.    Gonzalez Baez Cardoso added that the preliminary  investigation for crimes against health has already been opened,  and that Acosta Morales, with the drugs and the vehicle, have  been sent to the state office's facilities located in this city.    The police official concluded by indicating that this  shipment of 810 kg and 600 grams of cocaine had considerable  market value, because each kg is worth between 30,000 and 40,000  new pesos. Since these were drugs in a pure state, 6,000 doses  could have been obtained from each kg.</p>

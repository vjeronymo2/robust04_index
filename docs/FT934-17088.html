			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Regulator backs funding of new London radio station BRITAIN'S Radio Authority has approved the finances of London News Radio, the consortium that has won both the broadcasting frequencies in the capital of LBC, even though the new venture has yet to put together a group of shareholders. Question marks have arisen over the involvement in the venture by Hachette, the French media group, which was understood to have been a main backer when the franchise victory was announced last month. At present the only significant shareholder is Mr Bruce Fireman, the Guinness Mahon merchant banker responsible for putting LNR's application together and who plans to become its managing director. Mr Fireman is backed by a letter from Guinness Mahon guaranteeing the Pounds 4m needed to finance the new radio station. LNR is due to displace LBC as London's main news and speech commercial radio station in 12 months. LBC had held the franchise for more than 20 years, but lost it mainly because it planned to continue simulcasting - broadcasting the same programme on both its frequencies at night. LNR won with plans for a complementary service of news on one frequency and a more conversational approach on the other. The doubts over Hachette's involvement emerged yesterday with Mr Martin Brisac, managing director in charge of the international interests of Europe 1, the Hachette-controlled French station, saying his intention to invest had been subject to contract. He is understood to be unhappy with the business plan and is seeking more data. It is believed that Guinness Mahon is no longer enthusiastic about Hachette as a shareholder and plans to place shares among institutional shareholders. Dame Shirley Porter, chairman of LBC, said yesterday of the news that LNR does not yet have its shareholders in place: 'I think that all LBC listeners will begin to question why there was ever a need to change.' Dame Shirley plans to continue to run LBC, which is in effect controlled by the Bank of Scotland, and use it as a launch pad to bid for the national commercial speech station in 1995. It is clear that Dame Shirley, backed by extensive family interests based on holdings in the supermarket group Tesco, aims to make an aggressive bid for the franchise. The national franchise will go to the highest bidder. In approving LNR's finances, the Radio Authority had to be satisfied that one month after awarding the franchise the promised funding was in place. The authority, which regulates UK commercial radio, has a written assurance from Guinness Mahon that the Pounds 4m is available. The fact that no other shareholders have yet signed up is not seen as a factor.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Wine: The '91 clarets; a hard year to sell - Edmund Penning-Rowsell tastes last year's frost-hit vintage and finds it better than expected THE 1991 Bordeaux vintage was written off months before the grapes were picked, after the devastating frost of April 25/26 last year. The white wine crop of 42 m hl was the smallest ever appellation controlee in the Gironde. Red wine production was less than half of the two previous years at 2.16m hl. With the vintage also affected by heavy rain, is the quality any good and are the wines worth buying? The first answer was given at the annual tastings of the latest vintage by the Union des Grands Crus. The Union represents 120 leading growths, except premiers crus and a few important chateaux which do not like their cask samples tasted en masse with the others. I was able to taste all left-bank firsts and one of the most reliable of the others. The tastings showed that the 1991 vintage cannot be classed as poor, contrary to some forecasts, and is better than 1984 and 1987. Helped by the small yields, the wines have very good, deep colour. The more successful have enough fruit but at this stage cannot be described as welcoming on the nose and palate like their two predecessors. Apart from the top wines, they were hard work to taste, and it was significant that only 94 of the union's members showed their wines in the tastings. The Medocs came off best; the Graves, which suffered hail and more rain, less well; and the St Emilions or Pomerols, by their very limited representation, demonstrated their problems. The few dry whites shown were generally good, as were the Sauternes. The others either were not considered ready to be shown or were probably not being offered en primeur. It is not improbable that a number of the reds were 'assisted' by some dollops of '90, not yet bottled; but there is no harm in that. The Union's wines were shown more or less alphabetically by appellation. The Medocs were divided into two tastings of 25 and 23 growths. Here are those that I picked out in the order as arranged. The figure in brackets indicated the number of wines tasted. Medoc south (25): La Tour de By, Beaumont, La Begorce, Citran (particularly successful in the bourgeois range), Angludet, Marquis de Terme and Latour-Carnet. Medoc north (23): Clarke, Poujeaux (very fruity), Beychevelle, Branaire, Gruaud Larose (very good balance and structure), Lynch-Bages, Pichon-Longueville, Pichon-Lalande, Cos Labory, Ormes de Pez and Montrose. Red Graves (14): Domaine de Chevalier, de Fieuzal, de France, La Louviere, Malartic-La-Graviere, Pique-Caillou and Smith-Haut-Lafitte. White Graves (12): Chantegrive, Carbonnieux (elegant), Domaine de Chevalier (exceptionally full-bodied, oaky), de Fieuzal (less structure but fine), Larrivet-Haut Brion, Olivier. Sauternes (6): Lafaurie-Peyraguey, La Tour-Blanche and Climens (the richest, best structured). St Emilion (5): Pavie and Troplong-Mondot. Pomerol (9): Nenin, Petit-Village, Clinet, La Croix-de-Gay (with an authentic brown-sugar Pomerol nose) and La Conseillante (elegant, light but true Pomerol style). I believe it is a mistake for the first-growths and some leading seconds to refuse to mix with their social inferiors: as they may not always continue to sell on their names and reputations. To visit them, individual appointments must be made. All except Mouton-Rothschild opened their '90s for me as well, which show how rich and concentrated the '90 vintage is, and maybe superior to the more trumpeted '89. Listed in the order tasted, my notes were as follows: Haut-Brion: fine nose, well-balanced but somewhat light in flavour. (La Mission-Haut-Brion from the same stable but different cellars had more flavour and size). Margaux: very elegant nose, on the light side but very well-balanced - one of the best; the second wine, Pavillon Rouge, was surprisingly fruity and engaging. Lafite: very good colour, like all these firsts; elegant nose, classic style but rather hard; its associate property in the Bas-Medoc, Cardonne, had an agreeable oaky aroma, and light but long taste. Mouton-Rothschild: very big colour, closed nose, but concentrated flavour and excellent balance - particularly attractive. Its fifth-growth Clerc-Milon was very fruity and long on the taste. Latour: very closed on the nose now and with a good deal of tannin, but plenty of body, and probably the most long-lived (Les Forts de Latour, the second wine, very similar in appearance and aroma, with lots of fruit). The Borie family own Grand-Puy-Lacoste and Ducru-Beaucaillou. The former had colour and plenty of life and fruit, the latter more structure, elegance and fine aroma. The position of the '91 whites is simple: they can be excellent, but there is very little of them. For the reds the problem is of saleability after three fine vintages and of price. The main encouragement to buy this controversial vintage must be bargain appeal. Yet the hard-pressed trade needs the cash-flow of an en primeur market. In Bordeaux, price comparisons are being made to the 1987 vintage. This would give 'opening offer' ex-cellar, in-bond prices of around Pounds 220 a case for the first-growths, Pounds 110 for the seconds, Pounds 60-Pounds 75 for other classed growths, Pounds 50 for many crus bourgeois, and Pounds 35-Pounds 45 for petits chateaux. But another view is that since the 1990 prices came down 12-15 per cent and the '91s are better than the '87s, prices should be between the '90s and '87s. Some claim that only a steep reduction will attract buyers. The chateaux will shortly have to decide. Lafite, Margaux and Mouton-Rothscild have already come out at FFr 160 a bottle (Pounds 300 a case in bond). As the classier '91s are unlikely to appreciate in price in the next year or two, the only reason to buy them is if one is short of their predecessors back to '86. But the crus bourgeois and the petits chateaux are likely to develop fairly quickly, and once initially sold are unlikely to appear again on merchants' lists in the UK.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge A. Bolanos </F> Suarez: "The Truth About Cuba"]    [Text] Some days ago, the CIA once again released  apocalyptic reports about my country. It is not the first time  the CIA has done such a thing. In 1961, one such report served  to obtain President Kennedy's support for the Bay of Pigs  invasion. Among other things, the report said that 80 percent  of the population would rise against the government within 72  hours after the invasion. The deadline was confirmed, but the  reaction was the opposite. As is known, this was precisely the  time the Cuban people needed to defeat the invasion.    Another example: In December 1990, one year after the  destruction of the Berlin Wall, 422 frustrated foreign  journalists returned to their countries after a visit that had  been arranged for witnessing the collapse of the revolution. At  least this is what other CIA reports had announced in November  1990.    The Cuban Government does not deny its great economic  difficulties. However, it tries to handle figures and data more  impartially than does the CIA. The year of 1993 will be  recalled as the most terrible year for the revolution. The  damage caused by the rage of the empire [U.S. Government] was  increased by the climatic calamities that hit the country,  causing the loss of valuable lives and material damage estimated  at $1 billion.    Despite such adverse circumstances Cubans have maintained  their organized society with solidarity, showing -- according to  ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America] -- the world's best  income distribution. Without beggars or homeless people, with  schools and hospitals for everyone.    The motivation for the CIA is today the same as in the past:  to destroy the revolution. To attain this goal they resort to  all means to block Cuban efforts to survive and rejoin the  world's economic system. Such attitudes, says London's  FINANCIAL TIMES, "are applauded if they are adopted by Communist  countries like China or Vietnam, but are determinedly and  unscrupulously sabotaged if they are adopted by the small  Caribbean island..."    After the disappearance of the USSR and the end of the cold  war, the United States has concentrated on one single country:  Cuba. The entire formidable destabilization potential which  operated previously on the countries of the so-called socialist  world are now concentrated on Cuba. According to U.S. press  sources, the cost of anti-Cuban operations runs at $700 million  annually. Operations include fanciful and absurd projects like  transmissions from a television station on U.S. territory which  are not seen in Cuba.    Despite being condemned for the second consecutive year by  the United Nations General Assembly, the blockade remains the  centerpiece of an abominable policy that is more than 30 years  old. It has banned all trade with Cuba, and it has compelled  other countries' companies with U.S. technology or capital to do  the same, flagrantly violating international law.    Still unsatisfied, the United States has shamelessly  pressured and threatened entrepreneurs, whatever their  nationality, to prevent them from selling oil or food to Cuba.  Such a blockade has caused not only inhuman losses to the Cuban  population, but has also hit U.S. entrepreneurs themselves,  banning access to a market of more than $2 billion annually.    It is deplorable that the mass media have totally or  partially ignored this situation. It is even sadder to see the  silence maintained about the lonely and manly fight that Cubans  are waging to resist with dignity, decency, and hope the impact  of such criminal harassment.    In the end, I think that whatever the differences or  disagreements about my country there are, to write now the  entire truth about Cuba is equivalent to preserving Latin  America's independence and sovereignty. Whoever disregards this  today will certainly pay for it tomorrow.</p>

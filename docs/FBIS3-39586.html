At a rally of his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement  in this Adriatic port city, the entrepreneur who parlayed real  estate into a publishing and television empire looked first to  the contest at the polls.    "The men of the left were convinced they had won, that they  were the assigned rulers," he said with the gains of the  progressives in two-tier municipal elections around the nation  in November and December last year. "But when you scratch under  the paint, you find the state-ism and manager-ism of always."    A victory of the left next month, Berlusconi insisted, would  spell "disaster for economic freedom" because of an ideology  "rejected by history," though these progressives now "mumble  liberalism. We cannot resign ourselves to the fact of a  minority taking the government of the country in hand and taking  it on the dangerous path of recession," he declared to an  assembly of some 1,000 Forza Italian supporters here. He went  on to promise a crusade waged "with new men... without personal  attacks on the adversaries" and one pursued to "relaunch the  economy...and maintain jobs and create new ones." On the  maneuvers afoot for the formation of alliances and coalitions  ahead of the elections, the new face on the political scene  said, "For whole nights I looked at the ceiling with my chest  swollen with anxiety" before deciding not to go it alone.    The day after formalizing an alliance with the insurgent  Northern League, plus two center-right splinter groups orphaned  by the collapse of the Christian Democratic Party and others,  Berlusconi said that despite the "coarseness" of the League,  this movement "has provided a great contribution.    "They too have understood that the time of succession has  passed and now is the time for construction and government  responsibilities. With our moderation and balance, we will be  able to start up positive cooperation," declared the Forza  Italia leader.    After noting that the new majority electoral law works in  favor of alliances and coalitions, Berlusconi discussed his  "technical" agreement with the recently-formed National Alliance  on the far-right. He noted that the National Alliance mainstay,  the neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], captured nearly 50  percent of the mayoral vote in Rome and Naples at the end of  last year. The MSI, "a party always left in the ghetto, outside  the democratic span," has "taken many steps forward and I am now  convinced of their liberal and democratic ideas," he insisted  with reference to the party which traces its lineage directly to  dictator Benito Mussolini's rump Republic of Salo.    He went on to sweep in the other groupings "extending  cooperation," the Democratic Christian Center and the Centrist  Union plus areas of Mario Segni's Pact for Italy.    Shared by Forza Italia and the Democratic Christian Center,  he said, are "the inspiring principles of the Catholic tradition  and culture, the irrevocable values of family, life, solidarity  and justice. It is right to use their valid support."    On his platform, Berlusconi emphasized the need to put the  public sector "on a diet," overhaul the fiscal administration  and apply a ceiling on fiscal pressure and reorganize public  services "of low quality" which now penalize the weakest sectors  of the population. On law and order, he declared, "There is a  high percentage of murders and thefts which go unpunished. The  first and fundamental duty of the state is to assure safety and  security for its citizens," he added.    At the end of last month, Berlusconi handed to his deputy  the  chair of his Fininvest financial holding company, Italy's second  largest private enterprise after the Fiat group, to begin  campaigning full time at the head of his Forza Italia movement.</p>

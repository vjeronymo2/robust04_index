			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Patten moves to standardise GCSEs A MANDATORY code of practice covering all aspects of the GCSE examination is to be introduced by Mr John Patten, education secretary, to ensure that even standards are maintained throughout the country. The move, which endorsed the recommendations of the government's advisers on exams, follows a highly critical report by schools inspectors last month warning that standards might be slipping. The proposal is the clearest indication so far that Mr Patten is determined to raise academic standards. The code of practice, to be drafted by the end of the year and introduced before next summer's exams for 16-year-olds, is aimed at combating alleged differences in the way some GCSE papers are set and marked by the five examining boards in England and Wales. Advice from the Schools Examination and Assessment Council, published yesterday, supported the critical views expressed by inspectors last month. The council concluded it was necessary to 'increase the transparency of the examination process' to maintain public confidence in the GCSE. The Education Department said that meant results should be 'more clearly defined and more easily understood'. The new code demands standardised marking and will also cover the setting of questions, coursework assessment, grading of standards and boundaries, and assessment of spelling, punctuation and grammar. Mr Patten will be able to withdraw his approval from any examining board that infringes the code. Boards are expected to toe the line as they are businesses and need the support of schools and candidates' fees to survive. Mr Patten said his purpose was to have an exam that pupils, teachers, parents and employers could trust. Lord Griffiths of Fforest-fach, council chairman, said in his report that because the GCSE was introduced to provide greater motivation for students, he would have expected an improvement in examination results. He added: 'We are nevertheless concerned that the sharp increase in the number of school leavers with five or more GCSE A to C grades in the last two years raises questions about standards, which we are investigating.' Mr Patten said he wanted more time to reflect on the council's call for a wider review of the structure, funding and accountability of examining groups. Lord Griffiths proposed the appointment by the council of external GCSE marking and grading assessors, similar to the system of external examiners used by universities. The minister also welcomed the council's conclusion that other reforms being prepared for 1994 - including limits on coursework, different papers to stretch more able pupils, and marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar - would strengthen the exam. The Associated Examining Board, which had more than 800,000 GCSE entries this summer, said the code of practice offered 'nothing new' and would change little.</p>

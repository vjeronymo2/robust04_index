On 8 February the cabinet assigned the  foreign minister to sign the agreement on the formation of the  joint commission with the Republic of Uzbekistan during the  official visit of a high-level delegation from Uzbekistan from  15 to 17 February. The delegation is the first  ministerial-level team from Uzbekistan to visit Thailand since  that country gained its independence and seceded from the former  Soviet Union in late 1991. Uzbekistan has shown its intention  of having the agreement signed during the visit.    Therefore, the foreign ministry organized a signing ceremony  on 16 February. Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  and the first deputy minister of the Uzbek Ministry of Foreign  Relations signed the agreement on behalf of their respective  governments. Uzbekistan is a new country in Central Asia with  political stability and high economic potential. The joint  commission is a mechanism to promote bilateral cooperation on  economic issues, investment, and other issues in the interests  of both countries.</p>

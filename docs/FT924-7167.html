			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / S African interest rates cut THE South African Reserve Bank, the central bank, yesterday cut interest rates by 1 percentage point in response to data showing increased weakness in the economy and evidence that monetary policy is achieving greater financial stability, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Mr Chris Stals, the bank's governor, said it would be lowering its benchmark lending rate - the Bank rate - from 15 to 14 per cent. The rate cut, the fourth since March 1991, had been widely discounted in the money markets. The average tender rate for Treasury Bills with a maturity of 91 days, for example, declined from 13.38 per cent on July 3 to 12.16 per cent on November 13. Mr Stals cited sustained lower money supply and credit extension figures, and the downward trend in producer and consumer price inflation (13.5 per cent in September) as supporting a rate cut. He also referred to recent figures suggesting real gross domestic product shrank at an annualised rate of 5.7 per cent during the third quarter of the year.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The small investor and the big takeover IF THE terms are good, many investors are apt to see takeovers of 'their' companies as money for jam. But perhaps they should think again. In April 1986, I bought the shares of a small company called WSL Holdings. Formerly Wolverhampton Steam Laundries, it had been reincarnated not long before by putting together two companies running school tours abroad, educational cruising and skiing. A teacher, I recall, could get a free trip by taking charge of a certain number of children. WSL, said Investors Chronicle, was 'the dominant firm in an attractive niche market.' There could be additions but there was 'no intention of moving into the mainstream travel business.' Unfortunately, I was not the only person struck by WSL's possibilities. A year later, the Granada group made a successful takeover bid, mainly in shares. There was an immediate profit. But the 'attractive niche' had vanished into a labyrinth winding through TV production, bingo halls, property, video rental and so on. Instead of a single-minded company with an intelligible design, I had acquired a vast, complex undertaking which was difficult to follow and where the 'swings and roundabouts' principle seemed likely to apply. It is surprising how often this happens. Carried away by the immediate profit, the small investor might fail to notice how far his intentions are being subverted. In the spring of 1987, for instance, shareholders of British Car Auctions had every reason to congratulate themselves upon their shrewdness. Second-hand sales were rising and the company had transplanted its simple formula successfully across the Atlantic. It had no debt in England. At this point, however, Michael Ashcroft's Hawley Group, which already had a holding in BCA, made an all-share bid for the group. The stated aim was to add another service leg to Hawley's contract cleaning, while providing capital for BCA's US expansion. Again, there was a satisfactory profit on the deal. That might have caused shareholders to overlook the fact that AGMs would henceforth be held in Hamilton, Bermuda, where the company was registered. A few months later, Hawley took over a large electronic security group, American District Telegraph, and followed by changing its company name to ADT. At a presentation meeting for British shareholders, Ashcroft assured those puzzled by this change that while ADT might mean little in England, the initials had long been famous in the US. Using a film and diagrams, he re-assured shareholders further that ADT was bound for steady, sober growth thanks to the relatively recession-proof supports of car auctions and electronic security. This, however, was some time before the company embarked on a course of investing its funds in a diversity of service enterprises such as BAA, LEP Group and Christie's - in the latter case, just as the bottom was falling out of the once-fabulous art auction market. BCA's former shareholders have watched ADT's shares slide from over Pounds 12 to a low of Pounds 2.80 over the past 14 months. It is not only in the service industries that investors may find their portfolios transformed willy-nilly. How many holders of John Brown, which had transcended its great Clydeside ship-building past successfully, can have dreamed they would find themselves sharing the conglomerate roof of Trafalgar House? Did the holders of Northern Engineering Industries realise they would vanish into the maw of Rolls-Royce just when long awaited power-station contracts were on the horizon? Even without takeovers, though, investors may find the shape of their portfolios changed almost out of recognition by new chairmen. Take Grand Metropolitan. Some shareholders no doubt invested in it as the hotel company its name suggests. They will recall how rapturously the acquisition of Intercontinental Hotels was greeted - 'a leading hotel in every city of the world.' Yet, seven years later, they were being cleared out like old rubbish as (in the words of the annual report) the new chairman, Sir Allen Sheppard, carried out 'a complete realignment of the business portfolio.' The small investor should perhaps take note of the word 'portfolio.' In this case, he has benefited from the transformation of GrandMet into an international food and drinks company based on hamburgers and a galaxy of brand names. But such forced changes of focus are by no means always successful. Ask the shareholders of Barker and Dobson, who thought they had put their money in boiled sweets and jujubes - handed out in sacks at the agm - but, after the advent of John Fletcher as chairman, found themselves, to their cost, the owners of an extensive chain of supermarkets.</p>

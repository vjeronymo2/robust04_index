			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea consumes about  2.5 times as much energy as North Korea instead of 5 times more  as previously known, according to a leading North Korea watcher  in the United States.    Dr. Chang Yong-sik, an economics professor of New York State  University, said in a recent report that in 1991 South Korea  consumed 79,705,000 tons oil equivalent (TOE) of coal, oil, gas,  charcoal and electricity while North Korea used 32,114,000 TOE.    The report was prepared in a contract awarded by South  Korea's semi-official think tank, Korea Development Institute  (KDI). It was released by KDI Thursday.    The energy South Korea consumed in 1991 included 17,394,000  TOE of coal, 51,263,000 tons of oil, 1,541,000 TOE of gas,  617,000 TOE of charcoal and 8,690,000 TOE of electricity.    Those used by North Korea in the same year comprised  23,720,000 TOE of coal, 3,507,000 tons of oil, 951,000 TOE of  charcoal and 3,932,000 TOE of electricity.    Per-capita energy consumption stood at 2,128 liters oil  equivalent in the South and 1,712 liters in the North.    Dr. Chang claimed South Korea's National Unification Board  earlier erroneously said South Korea used 5 times more energy  than North Korea in 1991 due to mistakes in the conversion of  the amount of coal production into tons oil equivalent and also  in the calculation of electricity output.    As of 1991, Chang said, North Korea's energy  self-sufficiency  was 88 percent while it was mere 8 percent in the South.    However, due to the inefficiency of Pyongyang's energy  policy  of depending primarily on coal and a decline in oil imports  caused by the lack of hard currencies, North Korea suffers an  energy crisis so acute that they supply power even to Pyongyang  on a limited basis, Chang said.</p>

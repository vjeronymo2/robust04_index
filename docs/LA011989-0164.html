			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Motorola Corp. sued Hitachi Ltd. and two U.S. distributors, charging patent  infringement and unfair competition in the sale of microprocessors. The suit,  filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, accuses Tokyo-based Hitachi of  engaging in unfair competition with its new microprocessor. Motorola, based in  Schaumburg, Ill., says the unfair competition began shortly after it granted a  patent license to Hitachi for its MC6800-68000 family of microprocessors in  May, 1986. A hearing will be held today on Motorola's request for an injunction  halting sales of Hitachi's H-8 microprocessor.  </P></p>

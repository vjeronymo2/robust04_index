			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration wants a New York pharmaceutical manufacturer  to recall an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections because it  believes the company cheated on product safety tests, an FDA official said. An  FDA probe found indications that Bolar Pharmaceutical substituted the brand  name product Macrodantin for its generic version of the drug nitrofurantoin in  tests to win product approval, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit. "Because of the  evidence indicating a substitution, it is not possible for the FDA to assure  whether the Bolar product is therapeutically equivalent to the brand name  product at this time," Nesbit said. The Washington Post quoted Bolar President  Robert Shulman as saying the company would decide by early this week whether to  recall the product. Shulman said there is "no difference" between the drug that  was tested and Bolar's version now on the market.  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Morgan Grenfell jumps 194% pre-tax to new record Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based investment bank subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, yesterday announced a 194 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and said it would pay a Pounds 100m dividend to its parent company. The group's profits for 1993 were Pounds 235.8m and it had a pre-tax return on average capital employed of 55 per cent. Mr John Craven, chairman, said the profits were a record for the company which, when it was acquired by Deutsche Bank at the end of 1989, appeared to be in its decline as a merchant bank. Deutsche Bank paid Pounds 950m for the group amid market comment that it had paid too much. While Morgan Grenfell benefited from favourable conditions in all its markets in 1993, Mr Michael Dobson, group chief executive, said that two businesses - debt arbitrage and trading and Treasury activities - contributed roughly a third of all revenues. Fee and commission income, generated by most of Morgan Grenfell's individual businesses, contributed roughly half of all revenues. Of the group's eight sectors, each contributed at least 5 per cent of all revenues. Profits were particularly strong in debt arbitrage and trading - a sector that in the past year has incorporated an emerging markets equities team. Trading volumes last year exceeded Dollars 118bn (Pounds 80.8bn), up from Dollars 68bn in 1992. Morgan Grenfell's trading activities for its own account in foreign exchange, debt and derivatives also contributed strongly to revenues, although Mr Dobson said it appeared unlikely that similar conditions would be repeated in 1994. The Morgan Grenfell Asia unit, a merchant banking and stockbroking operation concentrated in the six emerging markets in the Pacific Rim, achieved record profits on the back of a surge of investor interest in the region. Morgan Grenfell also had strong growth in its asset management division, where net new business rose by Pounds 2.5bn in 1993 and total assets under management rose to Pounds 28.3bn from Pounds 20.5bn. Mr Dobson said that Morgan Grenfell was attracting new business at a rapid rate, and in the first two months of 1994 alone net new accounts totalled Pounds 1.5bn. The group also said its corporate finance activities grew in 1993, advising on 145 transactions worldwide worth Pounds 12bn. Mr Craven said that about 80 per cent of all its corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions advisory businesses were cross-border.</p>

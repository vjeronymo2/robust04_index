			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Julio Ottoboni] </F>   [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- Brazil has increased the  scheduled activities of the MCEB [All-Brazilian Space Mission].  A third data monitoring satellite (SCD-3), which is not  included in the original schedule, will be placed in orbit in  the first half of 1996. This satellite will test the first  national voice-operated command systems [primeiros sistemas  nacionais de comando por voz], which will be created for the  group of satellites on low-altitude equatorial orbits -- the  ECO-8 -- which the Brazilian Space Agency considers a priority.  In addition to giving continuity to the process of  environmental data collecting work that began with SCD-1, the  new satellite will fulfill agreements with Latin American and  African countries.    The Brazilian space program was scheduled to operate with  two  data monitoring satellites (SCD-1 and SCD-2), two remote  sensoring satellites (SSR-1 and SSR-2), and the Satellite Launch  Vehicle (VLS). The SCD-1, which was placed in orbit in February  1992, is operating beyond its planned useful life, while its  successor is being tested at Inpe (National Institute of Space  Research). The SCD-2 should start operating in 1995. The SSR  series is behind schedule. The SCD-3 will compensate for this  delay and feed the environmental data network until the launch  of the first satellite in the program of cooperation with China  (CBERS) [China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite].    Inpe Director General Marcio Nogueira Barbosa has said that  this year he will receive an additional $3 million budget  allocation for immediate construction of the SCD-3. "The Space  Agency is obtaining the funds," he said. The technicians at the  scientific center are replanning the other satellites to match  the expansion of the MECB.    The satellite will test the voice communication center that  will operate in the ECO-8. The estimated cost of the new  satellite is $14 million. Brazilian Space Agency President Luiz  Gilvan Meira has said that this will adjust the deadlines for  current Brazilian scientific needs.</p>

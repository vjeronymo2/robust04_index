			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Speaking at a press conference on 6 June in  connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  development, Vice Foreign Minister Saito indicated there was  still a possibility that negotiations would be held between  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  depending on the next move by Pyongyang.    Saito said: "The IAEA's report says 'North Korea's overall  cooperation is necessary to satisfactory inspections.' This  means that the possibility of conducting inspections by other  means has not been eliminated."    He cited special inspections of two nuclear-related  facilities which have not been filed for inspection as potential  "other ways" in which inspections might be carried out.</p>

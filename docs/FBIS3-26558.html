They gathered to discuss the close relations  between soldiers and civilians, as well as double-support work.    Provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin chaired and addressed  the forum. He said: Hunan was an important place of origin for  the founding of the Chinese armed forces and was the native  place of our great leader, Chairman Mao. It has always had the  fine tradition of supporting the Army and giving preferential  treatment to the families of soldiers and martyrs, and of  supporting the government and cherishing the people. Both in  the revolutionary war years and in the period of peaceful  construction, the Hunan people have united with the People's  Army, shared weal and woe with it, and established deep feelings  with it. In recent years, officers and soldiers stationed in  Hunan have developed the fine tradition of supporting the  government and cherishing the people, have taken an active part  in the province's spiritual and material civilizations, and have  made major contributions to maintaining social order, providing  relief aid to disaster-stricken areas, helping the poor,  carrying out key construction projects, and invigorating Hunan.  Wang Maolin stressed these three points: First, double-support  work should be taken as a major matter that has an important  bearing on the overall situation and should be done well.  Second, focusing on economic construction, we should carry out  double-support work and the activity of building civilized units  and villages. Third, it is necessary to serve the construction  of the armed forces wholeheartedly.    Provincial party deputy secretary and Governor Chen Bangzhu  also spoke at the forum.</p>

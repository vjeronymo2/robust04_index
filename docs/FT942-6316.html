			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: On course against the odds - US purchase became a black hole / Logica Can Logica recover the panache which in the early 1980s made it the UK's most buccaneering and stylish computing services company? Or is it condemned to further restructuring, decline and eventual acquisition? The company remains a maze of contradictions. Highly visible, oozing with technological expertise and with the bluest of blue chip customer lists, it has nevertheless been a financial stretcher case more than once during its 25 year existence. The shares at 292p on Friday are where they were a decade ago. In the year to June 30 1993, the company made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 9m on sales of over Pounds 217m. Logica was a leader in some superficial aspects of corporate culture when it pioneered annual reports which were masterpieces of good design. However, few companies have so relentlessly underperformed both the market and their sector. Mr Richard Holway, a computer industry authority, describes it as a missed UK opportunity: 'It is Britain's largest indigenously owned computing services company, yet it is not even in the European top 50'. The appointment of Mr Martin Read as chief executive a year ago may mark the beginning of the long journey back. As the UK's last large independent computing service company, Logica has been a perennial acquisition target - most notably in 1985 when a parliamentary furore helped prevent a swoop by Electronic Data Systems of the US. Some would argue that Mr Read's appointment is proving tantamount to a takeover given the radical changes he is trying to make. Formerly with GEC-Marconi where he had responsibility for businesses with sales of Pounds 500m, he is injecting a cool measure of market realism into Logica's technological hot-house culture. He has begun to put his own people into key positions: Mr Jim Yates, recruited from GEC, has direct responsibility for the company's poorly performing international businesses, while Mr Jim McKenna has been brought in as human resource director, a key role in transforming the corporate cul-ture. The problem, in part at least, is that within Logica, founded by engineers, technology has always come first with sales and marketing dragging along at the rear. 'We have lacked punch, focus and an international, market-led culture', Mr Read explains. The company's lack of competitiveness over the past five years was exacerbated by the worldwide recession, by the retirement of co-founder Philip Hughes, the company's style guru. But most of all Logica was hit by the problems of Data Architects, a US-based banking and telecommunications software company which it bought in 1988, hoping it would provide a platform for US expansion. It became, instead, a financial black hole for the company, pulling down profitability and leading to successive waves of restructuring in the US. Now the problem seems to be nearly solved although the US subsidiary is still losing money because of the continuing cash needs of developing a funds transfer package. How do Logica's management regard the purchase of Data Architects now? Mr Colin Rowland, currently director of international operations, believes on balance it was 'a great mistake'. Mr Yates, however, argues that an international services company has to have a base in the US to provide a pathway into a broad range of opportunities. Mr Read's strategy at Logica is based on two elements. First, a drive to improve margins and profitability. He plans to build on the company's existing technical excellence and the loyalty of its customers. He is also anxious to instil 'rewards-led' rather than 'technologically' driven attitudes. The aim is to achieve a return to at least a 10 per cent return on sales; between 1988 and 1992, operating margins fell from 10.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent followed by a return to 4.1 per cent in 1993. Second, a renewed search for repeatable sales, leveraging the company's international network to find new markets for products and services that have proved successful in the UK. Some 50 per cent of the company's turnover comes from the UK; Europe accounts for 28 per cent, North America, 12 per cent and the rest of the world, 10 per cent. Mr Read has a lot to do, however, to sharpen the company's focus. About a third of its business is in the finance sector while the rest is spread between government, energy and utilities, defence, telecommunications, transport and industry. About half the business is in fixed price contracts, the rest being charged on a time and materials basis. Mr Read and his senior executives talk of the company as being 'liberated' from the layers of bureaucracy which, they say, built up over the past decade, stifling initiative and drive. 'Mobility' is another watchword. He is working towards a flat, flexible corporate structure which will enable highly skilled and mobile technologists to move anywhere their services are needed.</p>

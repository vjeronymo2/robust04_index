			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VIETNAM VETERAN KOVIC MAY RUN AGAINST DORNAN  </P> <P> Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic, whose life is chronicled in  the film "Born on the Fourth of July," is considering a race this year for the  House seat held by archconservative Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove),  according to Kovic associates and Democratic Party officials.  </P> <P> "We met with Mr. Kovic. We encouraged him to run," said Howard M. Schloss, a  spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which recruits  and backs Democratic candidates in key congressional races.  </P> <P> The DCCC's chief recruiter, Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.), traveled to Southern  California last fall to talk over a Dornan challenge with Kovic, 43, who is  paralyzed from the chest down as the result of a Vietnam combat wound. The  meeting with Synar was held because of "mutual" interest in a Kovic candidacy,  Schloss said.  </P> <P> Kovic, who lives in Redondo Beach outside of Dornan's Orange County  congressional district, said through a spokesman that he would not comment.  </P> <P> Dornan, 56, said he would welcome the fight, should Kovic choose to run.  </P> <P> "Kovic is going to have to defend the Hollywood far left," Dornan said  Thursday. "If he thinks he's going to recruit Oliver Stone (who directed  Kovic's film biography) and Top-Gun-turned-top-malcontent Tom Cruise (who plays  Kovic in the film), and bring the whole Jane Fonda team down here to Orange  County, I welcome it. Let's go."  </P> <P> Sid Galanty, a longtime friend of Kovic and a Los Angeles political consultant,  said that Kovic was intrigued by the DCCC's interest and that he is considering  a race against Dornan.  </P> <P> After Synar's visit, Galanty said, Kovic also was wooed by several House  Democratic leaders in another Los Angeles meeting.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt  (D-Mo.) and Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown met with Kovic while they  were in Los Angeles for a DCCC fund-raiser in November, a source said.  </P> <P> Foley's and Gephardt's staff had no immediate comment.  </P> <P> "I think he was very taken by the fact that some of the most powerful men in  the Democratic leadership in the country would want to meet him and convince  him to run for office," Galanty said.  </P> <P> "From that point on, he expressed the fact that he would love to serve his  country again," he said. "Having served as a Marine and winning a Medal of  Honor, he felt . . . that might be an opportunity he would consider."  </P> <P> Galanty said he suggested Kovic's name to DCCC officials when they called him  last fall during a national search for potential candidates. He said Kovic had  not considered a campaign bid before he was approached and that he was  sensitive about being perceived as an opportunist capitalizing on the celebrity  status created by release of the movie.  </P> <P> Ironically, Dornan said he had played a key role in one of the pivotal events  in Kovic's life. During the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami, Kovic  and another disabled Vietnam veteran gained access to the convention floor and  briefly disrupted the proceedings. Dornan, then a television producer, said he  was the man who let Kovic in.  </P> <P> "I personally wheeled him in," Dornan said. "Against my better judgment, but he  promised he'd be polite. He broke his word within the hour."  </P> <P> Dornan also said that Kovic appeared three times on "The Robert K. Dornan  Show," a KTLA television program that Dornan hosted from 1970 to 1973.  </P> <P> "We kind of get along," Dornan said, "because he knew I respected him for not  dodging the draft and for serving. . . . Ron is a fighter, he's a Marine. He  wouldn't want me to baby him. He'd want a two-fisted race."  </P> <P> Dornan's 38th Congressional District, which includes Santa Ana, Garden Grove,  Buena Park and sections of Anaheim, is the only House seat in Orange County  with a Democratic edge in registration. Democrats lead Republicans in the  district by about 50% to 41%.  </P> <P> The district also includes the largest concentration of Vietnamese in the  United States, according to the National Journal's 1990 political almanac. The  almanac said that the Vietnamese community has supported Dornan's hawkish  politics and contributed to a 69% turnout in the district for Ronald Reagan in  1984.  </P> <P> If Kovic chooses to enter the race, one of his more formidable tasks will be  raising money. Dornan's 1980 congressional campaign was the most expensive in  the country. In 1988, he spent $1.75 million when he won reelection over  Democratic political novice Jerry Yudelson by a margin of 60% to 36%. Yudelson  managed to raise only $250,000.  </P> <P> "Let's face it," said Schloss of the DCCC. "Running against an incumbent,  especially one who has been there for a while, it's not only very expensive,  but the odds are certainly against winning. Not that it can't be done. But it's  a rough road."  </P> <P> The political dynamics of a Kovic-Dornan race would be unusual.  </P> <P> Schloss said the DCCC promised to help finance a Kovic candidacy. And Kovic  would be expected to tap the significant pool of Democratic money in Hollywood,  which is experiencing a new activism by celebrities in liberal causes and  candidates.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Dornan played a major role in President Bush's 1988 campaign  and was rumored to have been considered for a high-level presidential  appointment. If Dornan's seat is threatened, political experts said, they  expect Bush to campaign on Dornan's behalf.  </P> <P> "I still have the biggest star of Hollywood of all time in politics -- Ronald  Reagan," Dornan said. "So, what I say to the Hollywood left is: 'Try again.  Come and get me.' "  </P> <P> Christopher Townsend, an officer in the Orange County Democratic Party, said a  Kovic-Dornan race would pit a candidate "who has actually fought for the flag  against one who just wrapped himself in it."  </P> <P> Townsend, a vice president in the Orange County development company of  Democratic activist David Stein, said he was aware that Kovic was being  encouraged to run for the seat. He added that Kovic "will have tremendous  fund-raising potential from a national base."  </P> <P> "Born on the Fourth of July" was released just before Christmas and has been  nominated for several Golden Globe awards, including best picture, best actor  for Cruise, and best director for Stone, whose earlier Vietnam-era movie,  "Platoon," won four Oscars.  </P> <P> As depicted in the movie, Kovic was raised in a strict Catholic family on Long  Island and grew up to be a gung-ho Marine who volunteered to serve in the  Vietnam War and was paralyzed during a 1968 combat mission.  </P> <P> The movie follows Kovic's personal struggle when he returned from the war as a  decorated and disabled veteran who received cruel treatment in a government  hospital and was alienated from his former friends and family.  </P> <P> Kovic eventually became active in the anti-war movement. The closing scenes of  the movie depict Kovic and Bob Muller, founder of Vietnam Veterans of America,  being ejected from the GOP convention after shouting anti-war slogans during  President Nixon's acceptance speech.  </P> <P> In the dramatic scene, Cruise is beaten and bloodied by police outside the  convention before he is rescued by fellow protesters. In the final scene of the  movie, Cruise is wheeled onto the podium of the 1976 Democratic National  Convention in a re-creation of Kovic's speech, which was enthusiastically  received.  </P> <P> Dornan, who has been in the House for 11 years, is a former Air Force fighter  pilot as well as television talk show host. He has acquired a reputation as a  flamboyant, theatrical advocate of a strong national defense and a staunch foe  of abortion and homosexual rights.  </P> <P> Even so, Dornan has been known to forge unusual coalitions around key issues.  For example, last summer, Dornan joined liberal Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), an  avowed homosexual, in sponsoring legislation to create a national police corps.  The program would attempt to recruit new police officers for the nation's  cities by offering to reimburse them for college tuition.  </P> <P> Dornan was first elected in the district in 1984 when he defeated incumbent  Democrat Jerry Patterson by a margin of 53% to 45%.  </P> <P> Before that election, Dornan had already served three terms in Congress  representing the old 27th Congressional District, centered around Santa Monica  in Los Angeles County. When the district was redrawn by Democrats during the  1981 reapportionment, Dornan lost many of his Republican constituents and  decided to run instead for the U.S. Senate in 1982. He came in fourth in the  Republican primary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 38TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AT A GLANCE  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:1.89IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Registration  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Voters  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Republicans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 78,763  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40.89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Democrats  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 95,793  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49.73  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Other  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18,052  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.38  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 192,608  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 100.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 1988 Presidential Vote  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.11IN:1.78IN:1.34IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Candidate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bush  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 93,697  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 61  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dukakis  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 58,068  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 38  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 1988 Election Results  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:1.78IN:1.34IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Candidate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Robert K.

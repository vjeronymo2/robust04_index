			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Step forward in Aids fight A long-established drug used in the treatment of diseases such as leukaemia has emerged as a strong candidate for Aids therapy, according to a study published today in Science, the US journal. Researchers at the Laboratory of Tumour Cell Biology at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, conducted a laboratory experiment which showed that hydroxyurea blocked the replication of the HIV virus in blood taken from people with Aids. The antiviral effect was achieved using doses of hydroxyurea that were non-toxic and lower than those currently used for leukaemia treatment. Hydroxyurea is unlike existing Aids drugs such as AZT, which directly target viral proteins in that it does not attack the virus directly but works by inhibiting one of the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis. The researchers believe that the HIV virus is far less likely to develop resistance to hydroxyurea than conventional antiviral drugs.

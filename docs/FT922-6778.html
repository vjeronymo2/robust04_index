			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Stocks boosted by KIO stake talk ANY FEELING that the sunshine might draw dealers away from their trading screens was dispelled yesterday, as London stocks received a boost from what many in the market discounted as no more than rumour, and remained surprisingly firm all day. The FT-SE 100 Index was marked up at the opening and rose sharply in the morning to show a gain of 24.4 points, before slipping to a close of 2,711.9, up a net 11.3, but with no sign that it will stumble in the next few days. It was helped by a strong close on Wall Street overnight and a clutch of well-received company results. However, its first kick-start of the day came from rumours that the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) was about to sell its 9.8 per cent stake in BP to Lord Hanson. The idea that Hanson might bid for BP has been talked up and knocked down for some time, but the possibility that the KIO might sell its stake, amounting to more than 500m shares, gave a new twist to an old story. BP rose 10p initially but analysts pointed out that the shares had underperformed the market significantly since the general election. Some pinpointed the derivatives markets as the source of the talk and, certainly, the Footsie future for June delivery traded at a significant premium to its estimated fair value throughout the day. As the BP impetus faded, the market began to look at the UK retail sales for April, which were higher than the weak March figure but slightly off the 1.1 per cent rise expected. Traders also looked towards the opening on Wall Street. Although the Dow had reached a record peak at the previous close, some felt it could move higher on hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut the discount rate. Others argued that a huge issue of new General Motors shares would hold back the Dow. The Footsie ticked back from its mid-morning high of 2,725, affected partly by an overhang of stock in Argyll, a profits warning from Ranks Hovis McDougall, and fears that Sun Alliance would offload its stake in Commercial Union. When it opened, New York gave no clear direction but the Footsie was strong enough to hold on to a gain of around 10 points. Buying by overseas institutions was still evident even though London had to compete with strong demand in most of the other European markets. Traders added that the buyers were matched by a wall of reluctant sellers. Individual stocks providing support included Bass, with good results, and well-received figures from Land Securities. Elsewhere, the pound was steady and gilts were firm. Turnover of shares, which many had expected to drift, was a solid 598.7m, compared with Tuesday's 565.4m. The volume was helped by two medium-sized programme trades, but it still indicated that the value of genuine customer retail business would be higher than Tuesday's Pounds 992m. Hopes that the Federal Reserve would reduce the discount rate remained unfulfilled and the Footsie June future slipped back slightly in after-hours' trading. However, dealers were convinced that the London market had not reached a ceiling.</p>

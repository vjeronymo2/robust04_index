			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chai Mao (2693 5399): "Operation Has Been Normal </F> Over the Past Four Months Since the Introduction of the New Tax  System"]    [Text] According to information received from the State  General Administration of Taxation, the overall operation of the  new tax system, which began to be implemented on 1 January 1994,  has been normal; most of the problems arisen have been or are  being solved; and a smooth transition from the old tax system to  the new one has basically been achieved. At present, the  development of our national economy has entered the limits of  the expected goals of macroscopic regulation. By the end of  April, tax payments increased 29.2 percent over the same period  of last year, and incomes at the central and local levels grew  at the same pace. The tax reform has not triggered off large  fluctuations in market commodity prices.    As introduced by a leading cadre of the State General  Administration of Taxation, since the new tax system has only  operated for four months, only initial results have been  achieved. One type of the new problems that have arisen, in a  nutshell, is problems related to the tax policy, which are  primarily manifested in whether the tax burden of enterprises is  justifiable and whether tax payments received can be deducted in  a reasonable way. The other type is related to operation. For  example, massive operational training was organized before the  introduction of the new tax system, but, overall, it has not  been enough, and problems such as calculation mistakes,  erroneous classification, and mixed-up accounting have occurred.    With studies and investigation conducted over the past four  months, most of the tax burden policy problems commonly  reflected have been solved. For example, as far as enterprises  of civil administration and welfare, school-run enterprises, and  enterprises running the wholesale business of "shopping basket"  commodities are concerned, preferential policies are still being  applied to them, and the method of collecting taxes first and  then returning the levies to them is being implemented. The  value-added tax rate of agricultural produce, metal mineral  products, non-metal mineral products, and coal has been reduced  from 17 to 13 percent. Grain and edible oil allocated and  transferred wholesale to the people by state-owned grain and  commercial enterprises will be exempt from value-added tax for  two years; as will agricultural means of production, such as  feed, seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting,  and farm machinery. Tap water, small facilities of water and  power supply below the county level, and some building  materials, such as sand, soil, and stone, will be taxed at the  rate of 6 percent. The tax on junk purchased from society is  reduced by 10 percent, and tax on freight is reduced by 10  percent. Moreover, it is clearly stated that preferential  policies concerning enterprise income tax are still applicable  to enterprises involved with new and advanced technologies,  service enterprises, enterprises utilizing "three wastes," new  enterprises in "old, new, border, and impoverished" areas, labor  service and employment enterprises, school-run enterprises,  enterprises of civil administration and welfare, and township  and town enterprises.    The leading cadre of the State General Administration of  Taxation said: The contradiction of some problems has been  alleviated after taking a number of measures, but a process is  still necessary before the small taxpayers' problem, the problem  of deducting tax payments contained in the opening inventory,  and so on are completely solved. Moreover, solutions for some  problems have been fixed and are being implemented.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON AIMS AT $29-MILLION BUDGET; LESS THAN IN '89-'90  </P> <P> The Carson City Council agreed Monday on $29 million as the target for the  current year's budget, a decrease of $900,000 from what the city spent last  year.  </P> <P> The decision, made at a budget workshop more than two months into the fiscal  year that began July 1, set no specifics for the amounts to be spent by each  department.  </P> <P> Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said the council hopes to vote on a complete budget  package, which will be drafted by Finance Director Lorraine Oten, at a budget  hearing Tuesday.  </P> <P> Last year, the council passed a $34.8-million budget but spent only $29.9  million after instituting a hiring freeze and cuts in capital purchases midway  through the year to keep down an anticipated deficit. However, the city still  spent $2.2 million from its reserves to balance the 1989-90 fiscal budget.  There is now $7 million in reserve.  </P> <P> The city's financial problems stem, in part, from stagnant sales tax revenues,  on which the city depends for about half of its income. Overall, expenditures  have risen almost twice as much as revenues in the last five years, city  officials said. In addition, state budget cuts this year cost Carson $1 million  in anticipated revenue.  </P> <P> The city built up a large reserve fund in the early 1980s, which the city wants  to preserve. Officials are reluctant to use it for routine expenses, preferring  to reserve it for replacement of capital equipment and emergencies.  </P> <P> The latest 1990-91 budget proposal is an increase from the $28-million spending  package presented to the council last week by an advisory committee. The  committee's proposed budget recommended steep reductions in services and  layoffs to balance the budget.  </P> <P> In writing the budget, Oten will use suggestions made by employees, union  representatives and staff, as well as public and council input at workshops  held this week. The budget is likely to include an array of increases in fees  and charges for services, council members said.  </P> <P> Oten presented the tentative $29-million spending plan to the council at its  workshop Monday. Discussions at the workshop indicated that any final budget  will require layoffs, although the number of positions that would be affected  has not been determined.  </P> <P> Oten said her tentative proposal is fiscally sound and is based on "a more  optimistic outlook" regarding city revenues than the advisory committee's.  </P> <P> In addition, she said, proposed fee increases would account for an additional  $600,000 in revenue. Such increases would include raising the price of Parks  and Recreation Department swimming lessons and swimming pool rental fees, as  well as instituting a charge for participating in the city's youth sports  programs.  </P> <P> The latest proposal, one of many efforts since May, moves the city a step  closer to adopting a final budget for this fiscal year. Last year's budget was  adopted halfway into the fiscal year.  </P> <P> DeWitt last week blamed the other council members for the city's recurring  tardiness in preparing a budget. "Nobody wanted to bite the bullet" and face  budget cuts, she said, adding that hostility among council members has made it  difficult to work together on the budget.  </P> <P> Council members Sylvia Muise and Michael Mitoma disagreed, saying city  department heads had done a poor job in coming up with areas where they could  save money.  </P> <P> "I think that staff becomes politically motivated when it comes to budget  time," Muise said. "I think staff, in fact, riles up the troops if we propose  any cuts -- that's how staff saves their territory."  </P> <P> Mitoma said the staff "is under the misguided conception that there are  unlimited resources in the city."  </P></p>

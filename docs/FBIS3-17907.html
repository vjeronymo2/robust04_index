			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The complexity of the elections for the Crimean  Supreme Soviet which took place on Sunday [27 March]  considerably slowed down the vote-counting process. [Word  indistinct] results of the election will probably not be made  public until Wednesday, the general outcome is known. Our  correspondent reported that (?so far) 12 deputies to the Crimean  parliament were elected in single-seat districts. The Russia  bloc, supported by 77 percent of the electorate, became the  unquestioned leader in multiseat districts, where the elections  were based on party preference. (?Most of) the 14 legislative  seats earmarked for parties were won by this bloc. The  Communists can count on only one or two seats in the Crimean  parliament; as little as 11 percent of the electorate voted for  them. In the Crimean Tatar national electoral districts, most  of the seats were garnered by candidates proposed by the  kurultay [congress of all Tatars], who won the support of 89  percent of the constituency. Representatives of the displaced  Crimean people are allocated 14 out of a total 98 seats in the  Crimean Supreme Soviet.</p>

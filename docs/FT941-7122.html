			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Greek finance minister chosen Greece's finance undersecretary, Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, was promoted to finance minister yesterday, replacing Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, writes Kerin Hope from Athens. However, Mr Gennimatas, who has cancer, will stay as economy minister, a post he has held since last October. The changeover is likely to delay tax legislation due to go before parliament this month, heightening concerns that Greece's rising public sector deficit is going to exceed this year's target of 12.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Papadopoulos will also need to tackle 7.5m disputes over tax liability, some going back more than 10 years. The finance ministry estimates that settlement could raise an additional Dr300bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in revenues this year.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: The benefits as swords turn into ploughshares The peace dividend has turned out to be one of the more elusive promises of the post-Cold War age. Instead of immediate welfare gains from disarmament, industrialised countries with large arms industries such as the US and Britain are in the throes of difficult cuts in defence establishments with consequent job losses among suppliers of military hardware. Military cuts have been big news on both sides of the Atlantic over the past year. In Britain, the struggle between the Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards to secure the order to refit Britain's Trident submarine fleet has left a question mark over the long-term future of Rosyth, Scotland's biggest industrial site. When in March the US defence department recommended closing 31 big military bases in the US and scaling back operations at 134 other sites, it was calculated that 57,000 civilian and 24,000 military jobs would be lost. With some commentators blaming defence cuts for slow and patchy growth in the US and elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund has entered the debate on the economic effects of reducing military spending. In a special section of its latest World Economic Outlook, it concludes that there are big gains to be made from turning swords into ploughshares. The IMF's study is timely because cuts in defence spending are already moving apace and the trend is expected to continue for some years to come. IMF statistics suggest that military spending in the world, excluding the countries of the former Soviet Union, fell by nearly a quarter to 3.1 per cent of global gross domestic product in 1992 from 3.9 per cent in 1986. As a result, world military spending amounted to Dollars 662bn (Pounds 429bn) in 1992. If spending relative to GDP had stayed at 1986 levels, it would have been Dollars 854bn. The fund projects a further decline to 2.3 per cent of GDP by 1998 with an especially sharp drop of 40 per cent in the US military spending-to-output ratio. The IMF's research shows that such spending cuts initially reduce economic growth. But using a computer model, known as Multimod, to simulate the effects of a 20 per cent reduction in all military spending carried out in equal instalments over five years, it concludes that big gains accrue in the medium and longer-term to the entire global economy. The IMF chose a 20 per cent reduction over five years because it is broadly comparable to the decline in military spending contained in its medium-term projections. In the case of the industrial countries, the simulation suggests that the initial reduction in economic growth can be reversed by the second year. By the sixth year, when the decreases in military spending have ceased, 'the performance of the industrial countries is considerably improved'. Looking further ahead, the IMF economists calculated that by the end of the 11th year, GDP in the industrialised countries would be Dollars 60bn (or 0.3 per cent higher) than it would have been with no military spending reductions. More significant for future welfare, consumption and investment would be up by Dollars 144bn and Dollars 83bn or 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively over the base line. Military spending, which rarely generates further wealth, would be Dollars 170bn lower. The remarkable thing about the IMF findings is that gains accrue to all types of country. The US, which at the end of the 1980s had military spending of 6 per cent of GDP, predictably suffers an output drop for several years. But after five years, the cuts are generating growth elsewhere so that the cumulative output loss is only Dollars 7bn, a tiny amount compared with the cumulative Dollars 250bn reduction in military spending. After eleven years, US private consumption and investment are respectively 1.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent above baseline, suggesting that the US stands to gain more from cuts in military spending than the average industrialised country even though its military spending-to-GDP ratio was the largest in the industrialised world just before the end of the Cold War. Japan, with only a small arms industry and small military budget, gains from lower military spending, although its benefits are less than those of the US. Developing nations also gain from global military spending cuts. All countries benefit because military spending cuts will create room for other beneficial policy changes such as tax cuts and lower interest rates which feed through into increased consumption and investment. There is also a gain from increased volumes of international trade because the private sector spending that replaces the military spending has a higher trade component. These trends have been simulated by the Multimod computer model which is a multi-regional, rational expectations model in which expectations about future behaviour feed back into exchange rates, interest rates, consumption and investment. In making their calculations, the IMF economists assumed that each nation will also lower its military aid, imports and exports by 20 per cent. Another assumption is that cuts in government consumption caused by the military spending reductions were accompanied by tax cuts of a size to leave government deficits unchanged. The belief that governments will cut taxes in this way may be too sanguine, given the fragile fiscal state of most industrial nations. Another problem is that the IMF simulation does not analyse the consequences of lower military spending for different sectors or regions. This means that it cannot take account of hostile political reactions from threatened groups that might make governments embark on outlays that are just as economically unproductive as the curtailed military spending. The full economic benefits of lower military spending are felt only if all countries participate equally in the cuts. Logically, a 20 per cent across-the-board reduction in spending should result in no loss of security for the nations of the world. But the history of disarmament suggests that persuading countries of this would be a monumental task.</p>

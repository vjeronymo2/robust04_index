			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks about the  danger of war with Syria elicited sharp criticism from  opposition members. The Likud, Tzomet, and Moledet factions said  that it is most deplorable that the prime minister is attempting  to prepare Israeli pubic opinion for a withdrawal from the Golan  Heights through threats of war. Here is what Likud Chairman  Binyamin Netanyahu had to say:    [Begin Netanyahu recording] What the prime minister  apparently fails to understand is that the danger of war lies  only in his blabbering about it. The reason the Syrians have  not and will not fire the missiles they already possess at  Israel is the simple fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  is sitting on the Golan Heights at zero-range from Damascus.  These missiles will become a real threat only if the IDF  withdraws from its positions on the Golan Heights. [end  recording]</p>

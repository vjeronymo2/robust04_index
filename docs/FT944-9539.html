			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: BMW's US plant first in global network BMW is to open a new Dollars 600m car manufacturing facility in the US today. Mr Berndt Pischetsrieder, chairman, described the Spartanburg plant yesterday as 'only the first' of a global network of manufacturing sites which will preclude further expansion in Germany. BMW sees the plant as by far the single most important manufacturing step it has taken outside of Europe. Mr Pischetsrieder insisted the plant, where 570 employees earn little more than one-half of their German counterparts, and which - on current exchange rates - has costs some 30 per cent lower, was not a signal that BMW was 'emigrating' from manufacturing in Germany. However BMW's four existing plants could meet all foreseeable demand for its cars in Europe, within its strategy of remaining an 'exclusive' carmaker with a world market share of around 2 per cent. 'We don't want to grow in Europe,' said Mr Pischetsrieder. BMW would now concentrate on developing a global component supply infrastructure and manufacturing network for the BMW and Rover brands, he said. BMW has declared a long-term goal of producing 90,000 cars a year at the US plant, probably before the end of the decade. But according to Dr Helmut Panke, chairman and chief executive of BMW (US) Holding, and in charge of all BMW's North American activities, the plant may have to expand further - to 120,000 or 130,000 units annually - if BMW is to achieve the full benefits of flexibility within a global production system. 'In the long run there will be other opportunities . . . that's why we have a 1,000-acre (Spartanburg) site.' Although only being formally opened today, the plant has been in limited production since September. It is making only 12 cars a day but this is due to rise to 150 a day by the middle of next year and 300 a day in 1996. Initial production is of 3-series saloons, to be joined by a new open two-seater next September.</p>

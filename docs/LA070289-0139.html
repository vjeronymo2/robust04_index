			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS SLUG OUT ANOTHER INDOOR WIN OVER TWINS  </P> <P> It's been said that you can't carry offensive momentum from game to game, but  for the third night in a row, the Angels failed to notice when batting practice  ended and the game began.  </P> <P> Led by left fielder Chili Davis with two prodigious homers, the Angels pounded  the Twins into submission again Saturday night before a crowd of 28,682 at the  Metrodome. The final score was 6-1, but with three home runs, a 410-foot triple  and three fly-ball outs that put Twin outfielders against the wall, it seemed  like more of a rout.  </P> <P> The Angels scored in every inning except the third, eighth and ninth. Tony  Armas hit his second home run in as many nights; Devon White had two runs  batted in and that triple off the top of the center-field fence, and Wally  Joyner chipped in with three singles and an RBI.  </P> <P> For the fifth time in his career, Davis had home runs as both a left-handed and  right-handed hitter in the same game. Mickey Mantle, the all-time leader, did  it 10 times. Davis came a foot or so short of having his first three-homer game  when he sent center fielder Kirby Puckett to the wall to snag his drive in the  second inning.  </P> <P> "It was nice, but it would've been nicer to see that first one go over too,"  Davis said. "Hitters are greedy. You're always thinking about the one that got  away. You never seem to have a good enough night."  </P> <P> On this evening, however, Davis was good enough to propel the Angels to their  seventh victory in eight games, keeping them just a half-game behind the  American League West-leading Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> "They pay me a whole lot of money to do that," Davis said. "They don't pay me  to steal bases and they don't pay me to play awesome defense, 'cause I don't.  I've got one stolen base and zero triples. I've got to drive in runs and hit  the ball out of the park."  </P> <P> Davis, who has six hits in his last 11 at-bats with five RBIs, leads the team  in homers with 11 and RBIs with 40 but isn't satisfied with his performance of  late.  </P> <P> "Some guys say you've got to have fun in this game, but there ain't no fun  unless you're doing well," Davis said. "I've been waking up mad and I smile  only when something is really funny. I just stay angry inside and try to take  it up to the batter's box with me."  </P> <P> Davis did manage a grin or two after this one, as did Angel starter Kirk  McCaskill. But McCaskill (9-4) seemed to be smiling more out of relief than  anything else. He lowered his earned-run average to 2.86, but he almost didn't  make it out of the first inning.  </P> <P> The first four Twin batters got hits -- although none were as awe-inspiring as  many of the Angel outs on this evening -- but McCaskill squirmed out of the  inning with just a one-run deficit.  </P> <P> Randy Bush led off with a sharp single to right field. Wally Backman followed  with a bunt single. Puckett blooped a single to center to load the bases. Then  Kent Hrbek dumped a run-scoring flare into right.  </P> <P> But McCaskill regrouped and struck out Gary Gaetti before getting designated  hitter Jim Dwyer to hit one back to the pitcher. McCaskill threw to catcher  Lance Parrish, who fired to first to complete the double play.  </P> <P> The Twins collected six more hits after that but didn't push a runner as far as  third base until the ninth, when Bryan Harvey was on the mound.  </P> <P> "Actually, I made some pretty good pitches in the first," McCaskill said. "I  tried not to panic, figuring if I kept making pretty good pitches, something  good might happen . . . and it did.  </P> <P> "You try hard not to think, 'Oh no, it's going to be one of those days,' but  it's important not to. Today, I managed to keep pretty level-headed, and it  paid off. We kept notching runs, and that allowed me to relax."  </P> <P> McCaskill is one of three Angel pitchers -- along with Chuck Finley (9-6) and  Bert Blyleven (7-2) -- who merit All-Star consideration, but McCaskill says he  "doesn't deserve" to make the team.  </P> <P> "I got off to a good start, but I haven't pitched that well recently," he said.  "I think Chuck and Bert deserve it more, not necessarily in that order. In my  opinion, those are the two guys to choose from. It'd be an honor to make it  someday, but I don't think I have a chance."  </P> <P> Angel Manager Doug Rader said he hopes that "at least one pitcher and one  player" from his team will be on the American League squad in the All-Star game  at Anaheim Stadium July 11, but just about everybody with a halo on his cap  seems more concerned with staying on the heels of the Athletics these days.  </P> <P> "The important thing is we won and kept pace with Oakland," Davis said. "I hope  somebody beats them and gives us some help. I'd hate for it to be just up to  us. I'd like us to be like a good distance-runner: Get ahead and never look  back."  </P> <P> A few more games under the Metrodome wouldn't hurt the Angels. They used to  think of this ballpark as the not-so-great indoors, but they've averaged 14  hits and eight runs a game here this season.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Umpire Dan Morrison was ill, leaving a three-man crew to call the game. John  Shulock worked behind the plate, Tim Welke at first base and Jim Evans at  third. Welke was scheduled to work at second and Morrison at first. Morrison  also will miss today's game. The nature of the illness was not disclosed.  </P> <P> The mysterious case of Claudell Washington's infected left shin has taken yet  another bizarre twist, and Manager Doug Rader is beginning to lose patience  with the medical community's inability to figure out exactly what's wrong.  Washington took extra batting practice Friday and said he felt fine. Then he  played 4 1/2 innings Friday night and the shin began to swell and hurt again.  Washington left during Saturday night's game to return home and will be  admitted to Centinela Hospital Medical Center today for further diagnostic  tests. "If we knew specifically what it was, we could treat it and get it over  with," Rader said, "but we can't get a unified opinion."  </P> <P> The infection was originally believed to have been caused by insect bites and  was diagnosed by Angel dermatologist Ron Cotliar as cellulitis (an infection of  cellular or connective tissue). Then Cleveland's team physician, John Bergfeld,  diagnosed the condition as hives early this week. "Then Claudell's wife called  and said the kids had contracted poision oak," trainer Rick Smith said. "He had  been rolling around, playing with the kids before we left. It's been like a  roller coaster. He felt as good as new (Friday). He said he was ready to go  with no hesitation when we asked if he could go in the game and then it was  swollen again after the game."  </P> <P> Rader is worried about the durability of Washington's replacement, Tony Armas.  Armas has already spent 65 days on the disabled list this season with a  sprained hamstring and left Friday's game when he felt tightening in his right  buttock. "We have to be careful with him," Rader said. "He's not in the  greatest of shape and it's not fair to ask him to take over the entire  workload. I'll have to think out (today's) lineup really carefully. I don't  want to get greedy at Tony's expense." Armas' legs may be questionable, but  there's no doubt about his ability to swing the bat. He hit his second homer in  as many games Saturday night and added a single, extending his hitting streak  to 12 games. . . . Jack Howell was hit in the right thigh by a pitch from Roy  Smith in the eighth inning and left the game but should be available today.  </P> <P> The Anaheim Stadium ticket office will be open from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. today,  selling general admission tickets on reserved-seat basis for the July 4 game  against the Texas Rangers and postgame fireworks show. Tickets are also  available for Wednesday's matchup between Texas' Nolan Ryan and Finley.  </P></p>

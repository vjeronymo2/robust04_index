			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Why the Fed should tighten To raise or not to raise, that is the question. But Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve should not, like Hamlet, take too long to make up their minds. If, as has happened so often before, monetary policy were to be tightened too slowly as well as too late, both the credibility of the Federal Reserve and the medium-term performance of the economy might be endangered. Between the end of 1990 and July 1992, Mr Greenspan's Federal Reserve cut the discount rate seven times, from 7 to 3 per cent. But the economy had already fallen into recession in the third quarter of 1990. With the benefit of hindsight at least, those cuts were both too late and too slow when they came. That was an unfortunate error, particularly, as it turned out, for former president George Bush. Avoiding the same mistake in the opposite direction is still more important. Cutting rates too slowly does at least reinforce price stability and central bank credibility. Raising too slowly, particularly under strong political pressure from the administration and congress, would threaten the reverse. At worst, the valuable achievement of a low inflation base for long-term expansion could be put in peril. With the US economy now nearing the third anniversary of the end of recession, watchers of the Federal Reserve are becoming increasingly nervous. Short-term interest rates, unchanged for one-and-a-half years, and not raised for almost five, are also unusually low for this stage of a recovery. They are bound to rise. The question is when and by how much. The answer must be derived from examination of the state both of the economy and of domestic politics. Full capacity An expected annualised rise of over five per cent in gross domestic product in the final quarter of 1993 suggests that excess capacity is rapidly diminishing. A slow down in the first few months of this year is inevitable. But full capacity is already quite close. Unemployment at 6.4 per cent, for example, is not far short of the point at which wage inflation would normally be expected to take off. Add to this the high prices of financial assets, notably equities, and the 11.6 per cent expansion of narrow money (M1) in 1993 and overheating, rather than a faltering recovery, looks the more immediate danger. Markets agree with this assessment. The upward slope of the yield curve indicates that investors expect short rates to rise above 3 1/2 per cent during 1994. Over the past year-and-a-half of discount rate stability, the Federal Reserve disappointed similar market expectations, but its relative optimism about future inflation also proved well founded. It would be risky, however, for the Federal Reserve to remain persistently more optimistic than the markets on the future course of inflation. If it were to get one of these bets wrong, interest rates might have to be raised substantially to tame inflation. This would be at considerable cost to the economy in terms of lost output and jobs. Worse, the painfully regained credibility under Paul Volcker and Mr Greenspan might be damaged. Difficult decision Here is where politics enter. The Federal Reserve is being told not to raise rates from many quarters, not least Mr Clinton's. Prudence suggests acquiescence. But a central bank judged to be the politicians' poodle will have to inflict more damage to the economy than if its credibility is unquestioned. The difficult decision is the one to raise rates before everyone agrees it is necessary. By then it will be too late. Since timely rate increases are always unpopular, Mr Greenspan should tell politicians they have an interest in keeping an independent Federal Reserve as their whipping boy. Naturally, Mr Greenspan will wish to avoid tightening either too soon or too much. It will be another few months before it is evident how much the rate of growth has fallen since the last quarter. But the Fed must remember that there tends to be a trade-off between early jumps in interest rates and big ones, while certainty always comes too late. It should, in short, be looking to make a small increase in the discount rate soon. A modest firming of interest rates is warranted by the fundamentals and would inject welcome credibility into US monetary policy.</p>

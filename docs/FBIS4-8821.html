			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Arpad Goncz by Gyorgy Jozsef </F> Farkas; place and date not given: "Agreement on Evaluating  Central Europe"]    [Text] The meeting of seven presidents in Litomysl focused  on the situation of the region and provided an opportunity for  bilateral meetings. In the framework of these bilateral  meetings, Slovak President Kovac told Arpad Goncz that  Bratislava wished to solve the problem of family names, among  other things. Arpad Goncz expressed his opinions about the  results and lessons of the Litomysl meeting in an interview to  NEPSZABADSAG.    [Farkas] Mr Goncz! Many international forums offer  themselves to exchange of views today. What justifies the  Litomysl-type meetings?    [Goncz] I think that this type of meeting, like a typical  discussion forum, has its own role to play. In our region and,  the way I see it, all over Europe, the function of state  president is beginning to shift into some kind of a moral role,  and such a meeting capable of clarifying many issues is  important precisely in this respect. I would say that the  presidents carry and express the values and opinions of their  people. For example, we experienced a surprising agreement on  evaluating the role of regionalism, and I can say the same thing  about the borders. There are people who talked about  Maastricht-type borders and others preferred the creation of  connecting borders. These two things practically mean the same  thing, namely to stop the separating role of the borders.    [Farkas] In addition to the presidents' moral role, has the  spiritual weight described by President Havel also been asserted  in the meeting?    [Goncz] There are no two identical countries in Europe, but  the regions can, nevertheless, be clearly discernible. Although  it is more difficult to precisely delineate Hungary's Western  borders, but it is easier to find its Eastern border: It lies  somewhere along the line of the Orthodox religion. It is  characteristic of Central Europe that the seeds of the system of  Western institutions can be found in every country, and the  characters of these societies also resemble the others. Our  experiences, that are simultaneously related to the West and the  East, are connecting us. We can say that, even if not in the  actual sense of the word, spiritually we understand each other's  language.    [Farkas] If this is the case, for how longer do we have to  convince the other half of Europe that we belong there?    [Goncz] This does not depend entirely on us. The West puts  forward a system of requirements that are partly political and  partly economic. Regarding the latter, it is possible that, at  a given moment, they may change this into a secondary  requirement if their interests dictate this. Economic interests  and interdependence can best be expressed by the principle of  markets for markets. If we get a market there, in exchange we  can offer them the Central European market that is still open  and is in their immediate vicinity. When modernization starts  here and we also find markets for these products, our import  ability will also increase, and problems and tensions in this  part of Europe can decrease along with the increase in the  mobility of products.    This requires long-term planning but, in times of recession,  private economy is engaged in providing day-to-day answers for  the time being. The way I see it, there is always full  agreement at the top, but daily interests are increasingly  emerging the more we get to the bottom.    Therefore, it would be important for this way of thinking to  seep through from the top and reach some kind of general level;  in other words, everyone should accept the necessary and  unavoidable steps. This can be achieved through slow and careful  work, but also with a change in international circumstances that  might make it necessary for the Central European countries to  join the Western structures overnight.    [Farkas] The German president, who celebrated his 74th  birthday at the meeting and will soon step down from his  position he filled for 10 years, received the most attention  among the seven presidents present in Litomysl. How did you  decide on your common present given to the German president,  namely a map of Europe with borders that have been not valid for  a long time?    [Goncz] I only learned about the decision to give this  present before my departure, and I found this idea very  ingenious. The idea obviously originated from Vaclav Havel, who  is known for the well-chosen symbolic means to give quite firm  signals. Weizsacker was very moved to be celebrated by us, but  no one questions the prestige gained in his long activity, a  prestige with which he became a sort of "father figure" and a  model figure as president in our region.    [Farkas] Has some kind of "Litomysl spirit" emerged in the  meeting that was clearly held in a good mood, a spirit that can  be remembered and used in the future?    [Goncz] We can call it that way if this covers the fact that  seven presidents discuss things together and understand each  other in friendship, but we better call this a Central European  spirit. The whole meeting had some kind of signal value: The  seven presidents here focused on regionalism. There were people  among us who represented a member of the European Union, like  Germany, and countries that have reached the threshold of the  European Union, like Austria; several countries have associate  membership in the European Union; Slovenia has not yet reached  that point, but it definitely belongs there. The idea of  broadening the circle of members also emerged, because this is  not a closed format, just like Central Europe itself, something  that everyone knows what it is but no one can really define.    [Farkas] On the first day of the meeting, you announced  that you invited your fellow presidents to a similar discussion  in Hungary next year. Have a concrete place and time of the new  meeting been already set?    [Goncz] There is still no answer regarding the place; as for  the time, I can only say that it will be held sometime between  the end of May and the end of June. I hope that we will also be  able to have a similar exchange of views there, just like in  Litomysl now, a place where we sought understanding, not  agreements, while we were talking about a lot of things. This  was the essence of this whole meeting: Our subjects of  discussions should not be limited, no protocol should be  prepared about them, but we should clarify for ourselves and for  each other what would be good for all of us and what we  presidents can do to promote all this.</p>

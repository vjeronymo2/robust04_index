			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: Trading places - Schools Several recession-hit independent schools will close for good at the end of this school year. Parents caught up in a closure will face a dilemma over choosing a new school, for there will be no shortage of other schools offering places. Those with daughters at Felixstowe College already know the phenomenon. A strong hint the school might be considering closure came about a month before it was formally announced, when they received a letter from another local private school, Amberfield, suggesting they might want to move their girls there. However, Felixstowe was in a stronger position than many schools when they close. As a member of Allied Schools, a group which also includes Stowe and Harrogate Ladies' College, it was able to steer parents in the direction of other schools. Rather more anger was generated at the Waterside School in Bishops Stortford, where the staff were dismissed by the receiver two weeks ago after the school had become insolvent. One group of parents distributed a press release claiming children had woken 'to find the school had gone overnight'. Amanda Robertson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the receiver, said she was 'deeply angered' by this reaction. She said she had made it 'blindingly obvious' to parents at a meeting in the second week of June that the school had a 'zero per cent chance' of surviving beyond the following Tuesday. Invigilators were found for those pupils who had not finished their GCSE exams, and school meals stayed available until the end of the week. But it is difficult to close a school without pain for the pupils. The only way for parents to avoid this is to ask some searching questions about the accounts before enrolling children at a new school. According to Robertson: 'Waterside's accounts showed fat losses each year and were publicly available.'</p>

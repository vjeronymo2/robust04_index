			<p>BFN     [Text] A source at the Interior Ministry disclosed that  intelligence officials at the joint Thai-Lao coordination center  reported mysterious deaths among Hmong immigrants receiving  treatment for drug addiction at Wat Tham Krabok in Saraburi  Province. The deaths were recorded at an average of one every  day, or at least five every week. Death was caused by strong  vomiting as a result of herbal medicine taken by drug addicts to  cure heroin addiction. The dead were then cremated inside the  compound of the monastery. No proper records of the deaths were  kept.    According to the report, the Interior Ministry, with  cooperation from the European Community, or EC, will on 30 June  dispatch a group of 323 Hmong and lowland Lao refugees back to  Laos. The EC has cleared a site in Bokeo Province as a  settlement area for the refugees, and will provide them with  supplies for farming. The project is part of the UNHCR program  of repatriation for the Hmong and lowland Lao refugees.</p>

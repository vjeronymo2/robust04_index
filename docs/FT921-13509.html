			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Japan warns on N-weapons Japanese foreign minister Michio Watanabe warned India yesterday that Japan might eventually refuse to extend economic aid to countries that have nuclear weapons or sell conventional arms, Reuter reports from Tokyo. In a meeting with visiting Indian external affairs minister Madhavsinh Solanki, Mr Watanabe urged New Delhi to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mr Solanki said India's complicated position - with China, which has nuclear weapons, and Pakistan, which is frequently accused of trying to develop them, as neighbours - meant it was not ready to join the treaty. India says it does not have nuclear weapons but in 1974 it exploded what it called a 'peaceful nuclear device'.</p>

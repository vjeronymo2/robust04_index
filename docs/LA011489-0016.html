			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. NAVY SHOOTS DOWN 2 LIBYAN JETS  </P> <P> I applaud your editorial stand against the "vigilante" role our country has  assumed in regard to Libya. You are to be honored for resisting what Walter  Cronkite called the "subtle ideological intimidation" which stilled so many  critics of our past unilateral actions in Grenada and Tripoli.  </P> <P> The ideological intimidation isn't really subtle. The outcry about the "threat"  from a nation of 3.9 million people is quite blatant. Can't we see that from  the Libyan standpoint it is the U.S. who threatens them? We bombed them in  April, 1986, in retaliation for a terrorist act in Berlin which belatedly was  found to be attributable to others. We are fulminating against their possible  production of chemical weapons, when we have that capability and a lot more.  Our planes and warships are near their coast.  </P> <P> I hope that our government will apologize, offer compensation, accept Libya's  invitation to inspect the controversial facility, and henceforth abide by  international law.  </P> <P> HELEN L. TRAVIS  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Windwards to restructure banana industry The banana industry in the Windward Islands, the main source of Britain's imports of the fruit, is being restructured by the islands' governments in what they say is part of an effort to make it commercially competitive and to improve its chances of retaining its market in Europe, which is threatened by Latin American competition. The Windward Islands Banana Association, known as Winban, a statutory commodity board, is being dissolved early in the new year, and will be replaced by two new companies, both to be jointly owned by the four governments and private business. 'At the moment, all our agencies are statutory boards and I do not think that is good enough,' said Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, one of the Windward Islands. She met with her counterparts from Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent to discuss the future of the industry, on which the economies of the four islands depend. 'I think they must be commercial corporations which have to do business on a business-like basis. We have to look at the fact that this is a business and if we don't do it in a business-like way we will go to the wall,' Dame Eugenia said. The company that will replace Winban will have a subsidiary that will be responsible for procurement of inputs at lower costs, technical operations and extension services to improve the quality of fruit exported from the four islands. Dame Eugenia said that the company would seek higher profits from contracts negotiated with exporters. Geest has been the exporter of Windward Islands bananas for the past 40 years. The Windward Islands banana industry, and that in other Caribbean and some African countries that are traditional suppliers to Europe, has been under increasing pressure from more commercially competitive Latin American producers seeking unfettered access to the European Union. Latin American countries have challenged a European Union import regime that took effect in July, which imposes a 2m tonnes-a-year quota for Latin American fruit. The imports attract duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78) a tonne, while the duty on imports above the quota is Ecu850 a tonne. Europe's traditional suppliers in the Caribbean and Africa have access for the remainder of the EU's needs of about 1.5m tonnes a year, and will attract no tariff. The summit to discuss the Windward Islands industry's future attacked the EU's recent decision to offer access for an additional 100,000 tonnes of bananas to Latin producers next year, and another 200,000 tonnes in 1995. The concession came during the last hours of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade earlier this month. Caribbean producers fear that this increased access, if accepted by the Latin producers, will eat into their market and depress prices. 'What upsets us is that Gatt has taken seven years to come into being but it didn't take seven minutes to decide that the Windward Islands don't count,' said Dame Eugenia. She said the current attitude in Europe was that Caribbean producers 'can be thrown to the wall, let them sink, let them go, let them go completely bankrupt, we don't care, we're going to help the Latin countries'.</p>

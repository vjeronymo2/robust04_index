			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN WAR CHESTS  </P> <P> Thank you for your expose "Deficit-Reduction Bill Rife With Favoritism" (front  page, Oct. 30) that clearly demonstrates the basis of the frustration and anger  being found in the American people today.  </P> <P> The gross irony of the situation, in the stark reality of those pork-barreling  politicians lavishing favoritism on their constituents, is that the necessary  votes to "throw those bums out" may not arise from their home states for  obvious reasons.  </P> <P> I sincerely thank Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and wish him total success in probing  this apparent miscarriage of the budgeting process at a time of great national  crisis.  </P> <P> MARWIN H. GONSIOR, Fullerton  </P></p>

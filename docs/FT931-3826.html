			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Questions of imperialism THANGLIENA: A LIFE OF T H LEWIN by John Whitehead Kiscadale Publications Pounds 25, 437 pages 'WHO ARE these Victorians? By what mark are we to know them? What creed, what doctrine, what institution was there among them which was not at some time or other debated or assailed?' THUS GM Young in his Victorian England: Portrait of an Age. We will find a partial answer to the question in this excellent biography. But the answer will be disconcerting. Much of the value of Thangliena lies in the fact that the biographer, ostensibly narrating the life of a typical 'Guardian' in the old Anglo-Indian mould, reveals the inner man. Lewin was a Victorian imperialist; born in 1839, he died in 1916. He was characteristic of his age and class in his energy, range of interests and accomplishments, his undoubted devotion to the Lushai Hill Tracts tribesmen he first vanquished and then ruled paternally. But Lewin was consumed nevertheless by hatred of 'this beastly country', and burdened with longing for an English arcadia where he could gain peace of mind. Lewin did not find that peace; even in retirement he was reduced to depressed resignation, solace in music and tobacco. Unfeeling parents, unhappy schooldays, and the horrors of the Mutiny through which he fought aged 18, may have shaped his temperament into a pattern whereby the surface was all action and decision, the background dark and obscure. Such a psychological evolution was not uncommon with imperialists, who devoted much of their lives to unselfish service yet could never find true fulfilment therein. These Victorians, who brought a kind of law and order to the world  -even if a punitive expedition always remained to back them up - were conscious to a degree which perhaps we fail to appreciate today that 'the day's work', as Kipling expressed it, begged more questions than it settled. James Abbott amongst the Hazara, Robert Sandeman amidst his Baluchis, faced the problem which confronted Lewin on the distant frontier between Assam and Burma, one which John Whitehead describes so well. He narrates Lewin's experience in the 1860s and 1870s of nearly a decade of endeavour in a destructive climate. Did the Lushai and Chin Hill tribesman accept 'pacification'? Up to a point. Did these tribes want schools and telegraph? Yes, very much up to a point. Was Lewin's zealous work interpreting and transcribing their dialects appreciated? Yes, and it is here that we can see why these men of the wild green earth called Lewin 'Thangliena', the 'Lushai's first white friend'. Lewin was so honoured - much as a tribe in Iraq called itself the Beit Mackenzie, 'Mackenzie's people', in memory of some otherwise forgotten son of empire - not because he subdued, ruled and succoured them, but because he identified himself with them, living as a man amongst men rather than as a ruler amongst ruled. He did so in the hope of answering that nagging Victorian question: for what purpose am I here, in wilderness or by the Surrey pine to which, his health broken, he rather prematurely retired. Answer came there not; doubts multiplied, about religion ,about women about himself. Yet Lewin left his mark, and in an imperial context after all. The Lushai and Chin tribes were courageous guerrilla warriors in the second world war, and succumbed to no Japanese lures. One hopes that, in some Victorian nirvana, Lewin had his question answered at last.</p>

The governments of the United States and Japan held their  first security consultative committee meeting under the new  format in Tokyo on March 11, 1994. Representing the United  States were Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Undersecretary of Defense Frank G. Wisner. Representing Japan  were Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs  Tsutomu Hata and Director General of the Defense Agency Kazuo  Aichi.    2. The two sides affirmed that the U.S.-Japan alliance has  grown stronger and has increased in importance in the post-Cold  War period. The treaty of mutual cooperation and security  between Japan and the United States of America, the basis of the  bilateral security relationship for almost 35 years, remains  vital to the maintenance of peace and stability in the  Asia-Pacific region.    The two sides noted that the security treaty also  constitutes  the foundation of our political partnership, which is pivotal to  peace and stability in the world.    The vigorous partnership between the United States and  Japan,  based on strong bilateral security ties, is also an essential  element of an emerging Pacific community.    3. The United States reiterated its commitment to  maintaining a strong, forward-deployed military presence in  Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. also expressed  appreciation for Japan's high-level host nation support, for the  provision of facilities and areas for use by U.S. forces in  Japan, and for the hospitality of host communities. These are  valuable contributions to the effective forward deployment of  U.S. forces and thereby to our mutual security. The two sides  confirmed the importance of Japan continuing such host nation  support, and agreed to start consultations on this in the coming  months, taking into consideration that the current special  measures agreement is to expire at the end of March 1996.    The continued harmonious use of facilities and areas by U.S.  forces in Japan is indispensable to deterrence and the readiness  of U.S. forces in Japan. At the same time, the understanding  and cooperation of host communities are essential to the smooth  and effective operation of the security treaty. Both sides are  determined to continue their cooperation on issues related to  facilities and areas provided to U.S. forces. In this context,  the two sides pledged to continue their efforts for  consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas,  particularly in Okinawa, consistent with the purposes of the  security treaty and U.S. operational requirements.    4. The two sides stressed the importance of interoperability  and complementary defense cooperation. They also noted that  cooperation in acquisition and defense technology exchange has  contributed to the effective operation of the security  arrangements and enhancement of mutual security. In this  connection, the two sides stressed the importance of expanding  the two-way flow of defense technology.    5. The stability of the Korean peninsula is of vital  interest to both the United States and Japan. The two countries  have worked closely together on the North Korean nuclear issue.  The two sides reaffirmed that a diplomatic solution is the best  means of resolving the issue. They insist on North Korea's full  compliance with all of its international commitments, including  the Nonproliferation Treaty.    The two sides endorsed efforts to enhance regional political  and security dialogues and welcomed the convening of the ASEAN  regional forum. They noted the need to increase the  transparency of defense plans and expenditures among the nations  of the Asia-Pacific region in order to enhance their shared  sense of security.    6. The two sides emphasized that the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and missiles poses a serious  challenge to our mutual security and that it is important to  counter such threats. The United States and Japan continue to  discuss theater missile defense in bilateral security  consultations.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: Primary beneficiaries of the passage of Nafta - The Emerging Investor The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement may not herald a Latin American stock market boom, but it sure helped avoid a bust. A collapse of the agreement would have battered the Mexican stock market and the other Latin American markets would have suffered in its wake. Worse, for longer-term market prospects, it would have threatened the Mexican government's economic strategy. Many economists believed capital outflows from Mexico after Nafta's demise would have made a devaluation difficult to avoid. A Mexican devaluation would have worried holders of the Argentine peso, whose parity with the US dollar is the bedrock of Argentina's anti-inflation strategy. Economic problems would probably have engulfed Latin America's second economy - Mexico - and its third - Argentina. The largest economy - Brazil - meanwhile, is so preoccupied with domestic, political and economic difficulties that Nafta's failure would hardly have registered. The Brazilian market rallied last week, not because of Nafta, but because many Brazilians see it as the best place to hold capital in the face of the shock economic programme they now view as likely. Of course, Nafta guarantees nothing. As investors were reminded on Friday as the US stock and bond markets tumbled, continued flows of capital from the US into Latin American markets depend to a large part on investors avoiding panic at home. Nonetheless, its passage continues to provide a reason for institutional investors to look to the region to boost returns. For Latin American economies, the major consequence of Nafta is probably the boost it gives to the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. But says Ms Tamzin Hobday, Latin American strategist at Baring Securities in New York: 'From the market perspective, the important issue is that it provides support for the kind of economic model Latin American economies have been following.' It should reinforce incentives, she and others suggest, for Latin governments to continue to pursue free trade and market-oriented economic policies. Yet in stock market terms, the impact of Nafta's passage will be far from equal across the hemisphere. Most observers believe that two markets, other than Mexico's, will be the primary beneficiaries: Argentina and Chile. More peripheral markets such as Colombia and Peru may also benefit, some reckon. But most analysts think Venezuela or Brazil have little to gain, and Brazil might even be a loser. Chile and Argentina have been identified by US officials, in that order, as the next candidates to join Nafta, and both governments are clearly interested in the prospect. These two countries are most like Mexico in terms of economic policy, and have inflation more or less under control. In trade terms, both have much less to gain from Nafta than Mexico. Only about 14 per cent of Argentina's exports go to the US, and 17 per cent of Chile's, compared with 73 per cent of Mexico's and 23 per cent of Brazil's. Yet the reduced risk of a reversal of economic strategy with Nafta on the cards is viewed by analysts as definitely helping flows to the stock market. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging markets equity research at Bear Stearns in New York, sees the price to earnings multiple of the Buenos Aires market falling from 18 this year to 14 next. The benefits of corporate restructurings brought about by the country's economic programme should begin to flow through to earnings in 1994, he believes. In the Chilean market, the average p/e should slip from 17 to 14. Mexico's current p/e is about 14.5, but could rise with a market rally to 16.5 by the year end, Mr Dennis says. On the other side of the coin, Venezuela is so wrapped up with domestic preoccupations that it is unlikely to benefit much, even though US officials consistently suggest it could follow Chile and Argentina into the agreement. With two military coup attempts last year and presidential impeachment proceedings this year, Venezuela faces presidential, congressional and municipal elections on December 5. A populist is leading in most published opinion polls, and even if he does not win, the new Venezuela Congress is likely to be fragmented and ill-disposed to economic reform. As for Brazil, it may be the one large economy in the region that will suffer from the passage of Nafta, since its mix of export products is very similar to Mexico's. 'Mexico's tariff-free access to this important market cannot be good for Brazil,' says Mr Stephen Rose of the London-based Stephen Rose &amp; Partners, a broker specialising in the Argentine and Brazilian markets. Both politically and economically, Brazil seems the last in line to accede to Nafta. Politicians and bureaucrats in Braslia are absorbed in the country's domestic turmoil. When they think about it, they are suspicious of Nafta, reckoning the North Americans should stick to North America.                            *      *      * Taiwan: Equities are expected to remain nervous ahead of local elections this weekend. Greece: Proodeftiki, a construction company, launches a share issue on the Athens market tomorrow. Poland: The market has been weakening ahead of the public offering in Bank Slaski. Lebanon: The Bank of Lebanon is aiming to revive the country's shattered financial markets, and hopes to raise Dollars 30bn through domestic and foreign investment.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Friday Week on week change Stock                             Country    close    Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alarko Holding                    Turkey    1.0815    +0.24     +27.90 Teletas                           Turkey     1.009    +0.20     +24.80 Polysindo Eka Perkasa          Indonesia    2.8561    +0.54     +23.49 Grupo Financiero Bancomer         Mexico    1.7926    +0.30     +20.31 Cifra (B)                         Mexico    2.8809    +0.46     +19.18 Eregli Demir Ve Celik             Turkey    0.3929    +0.05     +16.17 Yape Ve Kredi Bankasi             Turkey    0.3749    +0.05     +15.88 Int.

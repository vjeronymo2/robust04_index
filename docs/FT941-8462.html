			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Expansion plan for David Lloyd Shares in David Lloyd Leisure rose 5p to 240p yesterday after the tennis and health club group announced a large-scale expansion plan. The strategy follows an 84 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.67m (Pounds 3.1m) in the 12 months to September 30. The company said that the expansion could double the size of the group and would be financed from the proceeds of last year's Pounds 13.3m flotation. Mr David Lloyd, chairman, said the group was involved in negotiations to develop a number of new clubs around the country. He told the group's annual meeting yesterday: 'Premature disclosure of these sites would unnecessarily place the company in an exposed position in relation to local competitors.' He confirmed, however, that it was hoping to build clubs in Birmingham and Bristol. The company already operates six clubs in London and the home counties, one in Glasgow and one in Eastbourne. 'Meanwhile, I am pleased to report that current trading is particularly encouraging,' Mr Lloyd added. The shares have climbed steadily since flotation last year when the company came to the market at 150p.</p>

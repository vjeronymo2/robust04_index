			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to canister equipment and design, the DSC or canister is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC), Section III,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection NB. The DSC provides a containment boundary for the radioactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material and the cladding of the fuel rods provides confinement of fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pellets. Only intact fuel assemblies (rods) with no known cladding defects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are permitted to be stored. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach assures the structural integrity of the fuel to confine the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pellets and its retrivability. In the unlikely event of a breach that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required the canister to be unloaded, the canister can be returned to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor spent fuel pool. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no place to unload a canister. The Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 349, which is the required code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nuclear structures made of reinforced concrete. The transfer cask is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed according to the ASME BPVC, Section III, Subsection NC; ANSI-N14.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for heavy loads; ANSI&hyph;50.9 for load combinations; and NUREG/CR 1815 for impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing. Because the cask itself is required to meet such exacting standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of construction, the transport mechanism and the trailer that move the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canister into the HSM are not considered to be important to safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the design that meets industry standards is sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. A number of commenters raised issues relating to releases of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactivity from surface contamination and leakage from the casks under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal and accident conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter pointed out that the Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance Surveillance Requirement 1.2.12 does not have a section stating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action that is to be taken when the contamination level in the transfer cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds limits after the DSC has been transferred to the concrete HSM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Certificate of Compliance Surveillance Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Section 1.2.12 has been modified to clarify that decontamination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer cask is required if the surface contamination limit is exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter, who was concerned with the seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, stated that a displacement pulse of 60 cm, as observed in the Lander's quake in the Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles, would completely destroy the HSM and allow a substantial release of radioactivity from the fuel within.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The potential for a seismic event is not the same at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every reactor site in the United States. For Davis-Besse, the maximum ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacement has been calculated to be 3.33 inches (8.46 cm), corresponding to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 0.15g maximum ground acceleration. This is substantially less than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacement observed in the Lander's quake and appears to be well within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design of the Standardized NUHOMS. Each general licensee using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS, including Davis-Besse is required to document their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations to determine that the reactor site parameters, including seismic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events, envelope the cask design basis, as specified in its SAR and SER.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter, citing a Wisconsin Public Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Point Beach, asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an explanation of why NUHOMS and metal casks have a greater potential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spread contamination than the Pacific Sierra Nuclear Associates ventilated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage cask (VSC) system, VSC&hyph;24 cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

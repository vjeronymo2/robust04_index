			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Congress leaders face tactics challenge: A single reform bill must somehow emerge For much of the summer, President Bill Clinton's ambitious attempt to overhaul the entire US healthcare system had disappeared into a maelstrom of detailed legislative drafting and behind-the-scenes political dealing. Even the intervention last Thursday by the Democratic leadership, with the approval of the president, to draft a new compromise bill does not, per se, transform the maelstrom into a quiet, pellucid pond. For the task of the Democratic leaders of both chambers - Senator George Mitchell on the Senate side and Congressman Richard Gephardt for the House of Representatives - remains much as it was. This is to work to pull together a single bill from the heterogeneous versions presented to them by separate committees. But the different rules and traditions of each chamber present each leader with a very different tactical challenge . The Senate's free-flowing rules of debate mean that virtually any amendment can be brought up at any time. Mr Mitchell will therefore try to produce a single working bill (with luck, by the end of this week) which could then be debated for weeks on the Senate floor. His challenge is to bring together senior Democrats such as Senator Edward Kennedy, whose labour committee passed a bill closely resembling Mr Clinton's proposal, with the finance committee centrists who produced a very different reform plan relying largely on improvements to the insurance market, and falling a long way short of the president's goal of universal coverage. In the House the hand-to-hand fighting will take place not on the floor but in the rules committee, which is dominated by the Democratic leadership and the chairmen of the main committees. This committee can decide which amendments and which rival plans come up for debate. The leadership is expected to adopt a 'king of the hill' strategy, under which the last version to win a majority would stand, eliminating previous versions. The timing of a House bill, however, is problematic. Many members are wary of being 'BTU-ed' again; they fear a repetition of the battle over the budget in 1993 when they were cajoled or coerced into casting a difficult vote for Mr Clinton's proposed tax on the number of British Thermal Units (the common measure of heating energy) in fuels, only to see the BTU tax dropped in the face of Senate opposition. The House may, therefore, seek to open debate after, or at least at the same time as, the Senate. In both chambers, however, the employer mandate - a cornerstone of Mr Clinton's plan under which employers would be required to provide health insurance to all their workers and pay for 80 per cent of its cost - is seen as having at best an outside chance of survival. Senator Kennedy has mooted a plan that seeks to gain centrist support by requiring employers to pay only 50 per cent, and not obliging them to cover their workers' dependents. Mr Mitchell has endorsed this approach in principle. Even the backing of these two titans, however, still falls a long way short of commanding a majority. The administration ran the risk of being left on the sidelines in this process, until the White House's strategy session with the Democratic leadership last Thursday night left something of the impression of a common purpose. Mr Clinton claimed on Friday that there was agreement on the broad principles - guaranteed universal coverage, if not necessarily by 1998 as he had proposed, quality and choice for the patient, emphasis on preventative and primary care, and cost containment. But until then, both he, his wife and a phalanx of administration officials had been trying to fight fire (the unbelievable blitz of special interest commercials attacking the government plan) with fire of their own. Typical was a speech by Mr Clinton two weeks ago in Pennsylvania on who has comprehensive medical insurance coverage. 'The politicians have it. The wealthy have it. The poor have it. If you go to jail you've got it. Only the middle class can lose it. I don't think that makes much sense in America.' The understanding with the Democratic leadership did not prevent Mrs Hillary Clinton and other officials from fanning out around the country to start a series of bus caravans which will converge on Washington from all corners to campaign for whatever bill the Democratic leadership may produce. But the administration role for the time being is mostly limited to providing computer regressions and cost estimates for the variations being discussed by congressional staffs as they try to piece together a bill. That jigsaw work is still difficult to complete, for a number of pieces are missing. One of the principal ones is the official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office on the plan produced by the Senate finance committee. The CBO is expected to show that the scheme falls Dollars 80bn to Dollars 100bn (Pounds 51.6bn to Pounds 64.5bn) short of financing itself over the next five years. This is potentially a damaging blow to a plan that has until now been hailed as the most centrist version of reform. Although some White House officials would still dearly love to produce a bipartisan bill, most have given up all hope of winning over more than one or two Republicans in the Senate. Senator James Jeffords of Vermont seems the most susceptible, though Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, his reputation already grievously damaged by charges of sexual harassment, may seek to redeem himself by working to pass a cause with which he has long been associated. That leaves the administration searching for the kind of wafer-thin majority that passed its budget in 1993, and extremely vulnerable to the defection of Democrats who feel strongly about ancillary issues. Potential coalition-breakers include the tobacco tax, which will finance much of the reform's additional costs, and the question of whether abortion should be included in a nationally mandated benefits package. But unlike the budget, where individual elements could be traded away, the healthcare reform has to work as a complete system - or it could end up making everything worse.</p>

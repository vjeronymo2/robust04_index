			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUTINE TRANSFER OF PRINCIPAL DRAWS PROTEST;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: EAGLE ROCK PARENTS AND TEACHERS WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE THE PRINCIPAL  BUMPED BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS HAVE PERSUADED THE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO  RECONSIDER THE MATTER.  </P> <P> To the Los Angeles Unified School District, it was a mechanical process based  on seniority: Sheila Watson, principal of Eagle Rock Elementary School since  January, would be reassigned as an assistant principal elsewhere in the  district. A higher ranking administrator whose job was eliminated due to budget  cuts would take over Eagle Rock.  </P> <P> That was a process the district is using to deal with massive budget cuts, and  Watson reluctantly had accepted her fate, calling it a fair and impartial  system.  </P> <P> But Eagle Rock parents and teachers, who faced the prospect of a third new  principal in a year, took it personally. They held a rally last week at the  small school on Fair Park Avenue and protested before the board this week.  Their message: Leave Sheila Watson alone.  </P> <P> "There have been so many changes at our school during the last year, and there  will be so many more with teachers retiring, construction going on, a new  building going up and the school going year-round," said Kristie Denzer,  president of the school's PTA. "The possibility that we could lose Sheila  Watson scares us to death."  </P> <P> "Things just don't roll along on their own momentum," added Suzanne Kagan, a  United Teachers-Los Angeles representative at the school. "Ms. Watson is a  spearhead for getting things done. She's a real fighter."  </P> <P> The message may have gotten through. Responding to outcry from the school and  community in her district, Board of Education member Leticia Quezada has asked  the board to allow Watson to stay at Eagle Rock. District officials said they  are optimistic about Watson's chances. The board is expected to vote tonight on  the issue.  </P> <P> "It just wouldn't be healthy for the faculty or the community" to move Watson  out and a district administrator in, said Ernie Delgado, a spokesman for  Quezada. "She seems to have done a lot within a six-month period, and they seem  to like her style, so why change it?"  </P> <P> Since January, Watson, who took over Eagle Rock after the former principal left  to head a larger, year-round school, has garnered remarkable support, Kagan  said.  </P> <P> Watson was informed June 15 by the district that because of budget cuts, she  most likely would lose her position at the end of the month. She was told she  would be replaced by a district administrator whose position had been cut and  would be reassigned as an assistant principal elsewhere.  </P> <P> Three days later, Eagle Rock teachers, parents and students began writing  letters to the Board of Education in protest. A rally in front of the school  last week drew more than 75 supporters, who carried placards and clapped and  cheered for Watson -- who at the time was hundreds of miles away at a funeral  and unaware of the event.  </P> <P> On Monday, five parents attended a Board of Education meeting to express their  concern.  </P> <P> "Our last principal was very well-liked and talented, but before Sheila Watson  came in, teacher morale was low, really low and the children, their morale was  low. Discipline was at its worst," Denzer said Tuesday. "In the six months she  was there, everything just picked up. She's a very upbeat, go-get-'em woman."  </P> <P> Watson, who was an assistant principal at Hoover Street School downtown before  becoming principal at Eagle Rock, said she felt awkward about the outcry  because she knew of other principals whose positions were threatened because of  budget cuts and did not want to be favored.  </P> <P> "I love this school and I really want to stay," Watson said. "I'm very  fortunate to have very vocal, very supportive parents and teachers. But many  other people are facing the same situation. Everyone I know personally has  worked just as hard as I have."  </P> <P> Watson is the lone administrator at the Eagle Rock campus, which has an  enrollment of 850 students in a regular elementary program, two gifted magnet  programs and three special education classes. The magnets have part-time  coordinators, but Watson oversees the programs, Denzer and others said.  </P> <P> Watson faced some opposition to her proposal to initiate bilingual classes next  year, Kagan, Denzer and others said. The classes would combine Spanish- and  English-speaking students and be assisted by aides who would translate the  teacher's instruction into Spanish, they said.  </P> <P> But she generally has gained widespread approval. Parents and teachers have  credited her with smoothly stepping in as principal when classrooms are crowded  and reconstruction is months behind schedule.  </P> <P> Her supporters said she is known for spending recesses and lunch hours with  students, particularly those who are disruptive in the classroom.  </P> <P> Watson also has made a variety of popular proposals, including working more  closely with Eagle Rock High School, which serves children in grades seven  through 12, to prepare elementary students for higher grades, said Lucy Cole, a  parent of an elementary school student.  </P> <P> Most important, Cole said, parents and teachers are counting on Watson to lead  the school through its next challenges: Construction of a new building will  begin in January and year-round education will start in 1991. And teachers and  parents are expected to be given more say in the way the school is run, as a  result of contract negotiations with teachers last summer.  </P> <P> "It's not that we're really good friends or that we've known her for years and  years," said Linda Cassidy, an Eagle Rock teacher for 22 years. "We're just  impressed with her dealings with parents, her dealings with teachers. She has  come in with a lot of new ideas and is making change in a gradual way."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ACCUSED OF LETTING FOSTER CHILDREN SUFFER ABUSE;  </P> <P> WELFARE: CALIFORNIA'S CHIEF OF SOCIAL SERVICES SAYS L.A. AGENCY HAS FAILED TO  PROTECT ITS WARDS AND REPORT PROBLEMS PROMPTLY.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services has continuously  failed to protect children in foster care from substandard conditions and  physical and sexual abuse, including instances where 10 children were found  sleeping on the floor of a garage and 20 infants were kept in 10 cribs,  according to state officials.  </P> <P> State Department of Social Services officials said they are considering  stripping the county of its authority to license and monitor foster homes.  </P> <P> In a scathing letter to Robert Chaffee, director of county children's services,  Linda McMahon, head of state social services, accused county officials of  repeatedly failing to promptly report deaths, abuse and overcrowded conditions  in foster homes to state officials who are responsible for revoking licenses of  such facilities.  </P> <P> "The majority of the revocation cases sent to us from Los Angeles County  involve sexual molestation, physical abuse or death of children in the care of  foster parents," McMahon wrote in the letter last month. "It is still typically  six months to a year after the discovery of the incident before referral for  legal action occurs. This is an unacceptable delay."  </P> <P> Foster homes are operated by private citizens, paid with public funds, to care  for children who have been declared wards of the court, usually because they  have been abandoned, neglected or abused. Los Angeles County is paid $3.3  million a year by the state to license and monitor 3,800 foster homes that  house more than 10,000 children.  </P> <P> McMahon's five-page letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, details  two recent cases in which county children's services officials allegedly failed  to take prompt action after discovering dangerous conditions in foster homes.  In one case, county officials last July allegedly discovered 10 children  sleeping on the floor of a foster home garage and 10 more youngsters living in  one bedroom upstairs.  </P> <P> "Three of the children have been abused, two of them severely," the letter  said. Despite this, McMahon charged that county officials waited five months  before reporting the case to state officials for license revocation.  </P> <P> When the home was finally closed in January, the letter says, "Los Angeles  County removed five . . . children who were still in placement. Based on a  medical examination, one of the children was determined to have been physically  abused, resulting in a skull fracture and two broken limbs."  </P> <P> The letter cites another case in which county officials in late November  allegedly found one person in a foster home looking after 20 infants who were  sleeping in 10 cribs. The home was licensed for only four children, but county  officials allegedly failed to report the conditions to the state, pending a  coroner's report on the death of a baby who had been living at the home.  </P> <P> State officials learned of conditions at the home "through an independent  source" and contacted Los Angeles County officials on Dec. 8.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles County did agree to remove the children," McMahon said in the  letter to Chaffee, "but only after the state informed your staff that 20  infants in a foster family home licensed for four placements was grounds in and  of itself to suspend the license and remove all of the children."  </P> <P> When the infants were finally removed from the home in December, McMahon  contended in her letter, county children's service workers were so ill-informed  that they had to rely on the foster-care operator to identify the children and  to help find their placement workers.  </P> <P> In several instances, McMahon charged, "The wrong children were given to the  placement workers because the staff person at the facility and some of the  placement workers did not know which child was which.  </P> <P> "After all of the original 20 children were removed on Dec. 8. 1989, another  Los Angeles County placement worker placed a child in this same home over the  succeeding weekend."  </P> <P> McMahon contended in the letter that the county has shown no consistent  improvement in its services to foster children despite efforts by state  officials to provide such assistance as training in regulations and complaint  investigations.  </P> <P> "There have been no long-lasting improvements," McMahon wrote.  </P> <P> McMahon's letter requested that Chaffee send state officials a "corrective  action plan" by March 1 and implement the plan July 1. Otherwise, the state  might terminate its contract giving the county responsibility for licensing and  monitoring foster homes.  </P> <P> The state would take over licensing and monitoring responsibilities if the  contract were terminated, according to Larry Bolton, assistant chief counsel in  the state Department of Social Services.  </P> <P> Bolton said other counties have mutually agreed with the state to give up  certain licensing authority in the past, but said he was unaware of a situation  in which the state unilaterally terminated such a contract with a county.  </P> <P> McMahon contended in her letter that the recent cases she cited of alleged  child abuse and grossly overcrowded foster homes as examples that have  "highlighted the county's continuing failure to meet its contractual  obligations with the state."  </P> <P> "These facts," she warned, "have caused my deputy directors and me to  re-evaluate our position on whether it is responsible for the state Department  of Social Services to continue to contract out the foster-care licensing to Los  Angeles County."  </P> <P> In a March 2 letter in response to the accusations, Chaffee said McMahon's  concerns in the letter were "difficult to appreciate" and contended that  McMahon had referred to "isolated incidents" in her criticisms of county  foster-care officials. Chaffee also complained that McMahon's letter had not  mentioned any of "the recent program enhancements my staff has made."  </P> <P> In his letter, Chaffee also questioned McMahon's authority to request a formal  plan to correct alleged deficiencies without rewriting the state contract that  pays the county to license foster-care homes.  </P> <P> "I find no provision for a formal corrective plan," wrote Chaffee. "Under a  contract of this type we would expect to consult with you or your staff on a  regular basis and discuss our performance under the agreement. However, if  additional or new information is required . . . these additional requirements  must be specified into the agreement."  </P> <P> Chaffee was unavailable for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Emery Bontrager, executive assistant to Chaffee, told The Times that county  officials are themselves considering turning over foster home licensing to the  state.  </P> <P> "That would certainly be on the agenda. . . . " he said. "If the state  considers they can do it better than we are, it's their program."  </P> <P> Bolton said state officials have not yet decided on the next step in the  dispute.  </P> <P> In a Feb. 13 memo to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, in response  to McMahon's letter, Chaffee said his staff was reviewing the state contract  "to determine what impact there would be should (it) be terminated."  </P> <P> The memo also said: "On first reading the state letter appears to be a litany  of past problems. . . . "  </P> <P> Bontrager, in a telephone interview with The Times, reiterated the contention  that the state's "isolated" examples contain "distortions" and represent a  small portion of the thousands of cases handled.  </P> <P> In a separate letter, McMahon told Chaffee last month that the state had  rejected as "unacceptable" a county plan to correct alleged deficiencies in  procedures used to visit children in foster homes.  </P> <P> The "visitation compliance plan" was drawn up in connection with a lawsuit  against the county Department of Children's Services filed by several  public-interest law firms that are attempting to force social workers to visit  foster children at least once a month as required by state regulations.  </P> <P> The state Department of Social Services was also named in the suit upon the  motion of the county, but state lawyers took the unusual step of filing a court  document siding with the public-interest attorneys.  </P> <P> "(The state Department of Social Service) has filed a cross-complaint . . .  against the county defendants because it has found that Los Angeles County has  failed to meet the minimum visitation requirements in the state regulations,"  says the document, filed in April.  </P> <P> The county has also been charged in other suits with negligence in connection  with failure to make regular visits to foster children. Last June, a foster  child was awarded $7 million in Superior Court after evidence showed she had  been repeatedly raped as a toddler in a foster home in the early 1980s.  Evidence indicated the child was left in the home after other children were  removed because they were sexually molested and that social workers rarely  visited her and ignored a psychologist's report in 1983 that she lived in "a  chronic state of terror."  </P> <P> Another foster child was awarded $5.5 million last January in Superior Court.  Court documents allege that in 1985, at the age of 6, the boy was placed in a  foster home where he was severely abused, sexually and physically. In 1986, the  youngster was reduced to a quadriplegic when he was nearly drowned at the  foster home. Social workers allegedly rarely visited the home.  </P> <P> Bontrager said these were isolated cases that happened several years ago.  </P> <P> In her letter regarding the visitation plan, McMahon accused Chaffee of failure  to be specific about problems in county visiting procedures because of pending  lawsuits.  </P> <P> "It appears that this concern had a strong influence on your approach to the  plan and your unwillingness to make the modifications necessary to ensure  approval," McMahon wrote.  </P> <P> County officials would not discuss the visitation case, citing pending  litigation.  </P></p>

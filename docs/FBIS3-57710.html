The Supreme Soviet Presidium session, held with  the participation of Prime Minister Kebich and the heads of the  oblast executive committees, has nominated five candidates for  the speaker post: Mikalay Vaytsyankow, Myachyslaw Hryb, Mikhail  Marynych, Viktar Danilenka, and Uladzimir Lysakevich. However,  the list was not complete. Today, the people's deputies added  to this list Vyacheslav Kebich, Hyenadz Karpyenka, Viktar  Hanchar, and Valantsin Vyalichka. The majority of the  candidates refused to accept their nomination. Thus, the list  of candidates for the speaker post includes three names:  Myachyslaw Hryb, head of a parliamentary commission; Mikhail  Marynych, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign  Economic Relations; and People's Deputy Viktar Hanchar.</p>

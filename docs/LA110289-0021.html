			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Say cheese: Former First Lady Nancy Reagan says she's concerned about the  impression created by the 83 photographs in her book, "My Turn," which do not  include her stepdaughter, Maureen Reagan, or her brother, Philadelphia  neurosurgeon Richard Davis. The Reagans' California spokesman, Mark Weinberg,  said that pictures of both were "slated for the book, but the publisher cut  them out for space. . . . Mrs. Reagan is upset that those pictures weren't  included."  </P> <P> * If at first you don't succeed: John F. Kennedy Jr. has failed his first  attempt to pass the New York state bar examination. The 28-year-old son of the  slain President was among about 7,000 people who took the test in July. About  70% passed. A New York University law school graduate, Kennedy works in the  Manhattan district attorney's office.  </P> <P> * Reel expert: A Baltimore man so skilled at burglary that he once made  videotapes on the subject for local police is being tied to more than 1,000  break-ins in Florida. Richard Makofski, 35, is charged in a fugitive felony  warrant with dealing in property stolen over the past nine months in Palm  Beach, Dade and Broward counties. Convicted of burglary in 1985, Makofski is  being linked to a gang that broke into as many as six apartments a day.  </P> <P> * And the righteous shall flourish: West Germany awarded its highest medal for  civilians to Mies Giep, 80, a Dutch woman who helped hide Anne Frank from the  Nazis in an Amsterdam canal house. In London, Queen Elizabeth II made former  South African lawmaker Helen Suzman, 71, an honorary dame in recognition of her  lengthy campaign against apartheid.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's economic analysis evaluated the costs associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing its water quality standards for the Bay/Delta. Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element essential to conserve the delta smelt, an analysis of the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with implementing the salinity standards is included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule. Though the water costs associated with the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality standards are attributable to EPA, the Service includes this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion to make clear the approximate cost of implementing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinity standards alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The water costs associated with the salinity standards and fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migration standards are reported in EPA's final RIA (EPA 1994). EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports the water costs as the sum of costs associated with the salinity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and fish migration standards. However, depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrologic conditions, approximately 35% to 73% of the water costs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA economic analysis can be attributed to the salinity criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alone, apart from the fish migration criteria (EPA 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The overall estimated water supply impacts of both the salinity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish migration water quality standards (change in total exports) over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those associated with existing D&hyph;1485 State salinity standards and water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality requirements for winter-run chinook salmon under a NMFS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological opinion are 376 thousand acre-feet (taf) per year on average,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 577 taf during critically dry periods. However, the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan for EPA's water quality standards will substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the magnitude and distribution of the costs associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the water quality standards. A more detailed discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the water costs associated with different implementation scenarios  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appears in the final RIA (EPA 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Economic Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Actions taken to preserve and recover threatened and endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species may result in the re-allocation of resources within the regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and national economy. National economic costs, best described as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency costs, include changes in the consumer and producer surplus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and related employment impacts. These measures capture the net social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gains and losses resulting from the resource allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The national economic cost of the five activities evaluated above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection activities, operation of the Montezuma Slough Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Structure, and bridge and marina construction) is minimal since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall economic cost of those activities in the region is minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's economic analysis used the above described measures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate the costs and benefits of the water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the results of EPA's economic analysis is identical to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis done for national economic costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits of Critical Habitat Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation of the delta smelt with designation of its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat will result in a wide range of benefits. Section 2(a)(3) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act recognizes that fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Nation and its people. EPA (1994) categorizes the benefits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating water quality standards and designating critical habitat as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, nonuse, and other benefits. A more detailed description of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses are contained in the final RIA (EPA 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several use and nonuse benefits can be attributed to designating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat for the delta smelt, apart from benefits attributable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to EPA's water quality standards. Generally, the designation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat will prevent the further decline of estuarine health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benefits include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Reduced need in the future to list fish and wildlife species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently in decline;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Increased biological production of commercially important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, such as waterfowl and salmon;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Increased protection to a wide variety of estuarine species,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several of which are unique to the Estuary (e.g., winter-run chinook  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salmon, Estuary population of longfin smelt, and Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Curtailed establishment of newly introduced exotic species and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterred explosion of the current population of already established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exotic species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Increased recreational fishing and hunting opportunities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

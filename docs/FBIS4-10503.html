			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 12 Apr (DPA) -- Several Banco Latino  branches in Caracas were the targets of low-intensity explosions  this morning which resulted in only property damage. Banco  Latino was taken over by the Venezuelan state in mid-January for  a lack of liquidity, thus giving rise to the worst financial  crisis in the country's history. The bank reopened its doors  last week.    A homemade explosive device exploded at the Banco Latino  branch in Quinta Crespo (southwestern part of the Venezuelan  capital) at 0520, causing only slight property damage. Police  found and defused another device placed inside a gasoline  container at another nearby Banco Latino branch. Banco Latino's  main office has received several phone calls throughout the day  warning of possible explosions.    Banco Latino press department spokesmen reported about an  attack on one of the bank's branches in Altamira (eastern  Caracas), the windows of which were all shattered.    So far only one person has been arrested. Interior Minister  Ramon Escovar Salom said he will wait to see the police reports  before issuing his position on the incidents.</p>

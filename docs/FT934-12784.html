			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / BTR to spin off Graham business BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, plans to spin off the Graham group of builders merchants and other businesses through a stock market flotation in the first half of 1994. The flotation is expected to value the Graham group at around Pounds 200m. The timing is opportune since the share prices of companies like Tavis Perkins and Wolseley, which have large builders merchant operations, have been buoyed in recent months by the recovery in housebuilding. Explaining the move yesterday Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'BTR's stated strategy is to concentrate its resources on the development of its core industrial manufacturing businesses. Today's announcement is 'a further step in the execution of this strategy'. Graham group includes Graham Builders Merchants, one of the largest distributors of building materials in the UK; George Boyd, a large ironmongery and tools distributor based in Scotland; and Goodman Croggon, a specialist distributor of agricultural and fencing products. Graham Builders Merchant's has 134 branches across the UK and supplies a wide range of building materials. Last year the group, which employs about 3,000 people, had turnover of some Pounds 350m and BTR said it had continued to make 'substantial' profits during the recession. The proposed divestment underlines Mr Jackson's determination to push on with the strategy adopted after he became chief executive in 1991.</p>

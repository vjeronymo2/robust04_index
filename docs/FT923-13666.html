			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Whistleblowers to be protected WORKERS who blow the whistle on dangerous working practices will be protected from employer victimisation, Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said yesterday . Unions are likely to see the planned legislation as the first piece of positive employment law brought forward by the four Conservative governments since 1979. The planned legislation will give workers the right to leave their workplaces if they believe themselves in 'serious and imminent danger'. If dismissed, they can take their employers to an industrial tribunal, irrespective of length of service or hours of work. Under present UK law, workers are usually barred from going to industrial tribunals until they have served two years. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said: 'We welcome the move as far as it goes.' He added that the two-year time bar ought to be lifted. Mr Nigel Harris, executive member of the AEEU engineering and electrical union with responsibility for health and safety, welcomed the move. He said hundreds of AEEU members had been dismissed for raising health and safety issues. The move is partly a response to the European requirement that workers should not be penalised for refusing to obey instructions from their employers that they believe are dangerous. It is also a response to claims by oil unions - after the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, in which 167 men died - that workers believe they face the sack if they raise health and safety issues. Mr Forsyth described victimisation of workers who raise safety claims as 'totally unacceptable'. He said: 'I know there is considerable anxiety among the workforce about victimisation.' Mr Ronnie McDonald, chairman of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee, the union for North Sea Oil workers, described the announcement as a 'publicity stunt'. He said the right to take employers to industrial tribunals was not adequate protection: 'Tribunals have little real power.' The Cohse health service union, is developing guidelines to help individuals who are concerned about safety in the National Health Service after several recent controversies over whistleblowing. The union says a recent analysis of whistleblowers showed that all but one had suffered retaliation from their employers and their colleagues.</p>

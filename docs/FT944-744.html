			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / White House shooting man dies A knife-wielding homeless man shot by police in front of the White House yesterday died after undergoing two lengthy operations. Marcelino Corniel, 33, was shot by a US Park Police officer on Tuesday after he ran across Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House pavement with a hunting knife taped to his arm. White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said the administration was saddened by the death. President Bill Clinton, who was working in the Oval Office at the time of the incident, was never in danger. Officials defended the shooting as a justified use of force because the man did not follow orders to give up his weapon. Witnesses said Corniel was menacing police. But video footage showed him standing almost motionless facing four officers when one of them fired twice, hitting him in the torso and leg.</p>

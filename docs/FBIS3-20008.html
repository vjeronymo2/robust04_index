			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "The Democracy Party Problem and </F> Crisis Between Turkey and Western Countries"]    [Text] The move made by the Turkish Grand National Assembly  [TGNA] to lift the parliamentary immunity of several Democracy  Party [DP] deputies has caused a serious crisis in Turkey's  relations with the Western countries. The visit by foreign  delegations and the messages conveyed to Ankara by several  leaders in the West constitute serious pressure on the coalition  government. The messages criticized the TGNA decision and the  subsequent detention of the DP deputies. It is appropriate to  mention that the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs focused all  its attention on the DP file every working day during the past  week. According to a high-ranking official, the ministry is  making a strenuous effort to "sell a faulty product to the  outside world."    As far as Turkey is concerned, the matter has assumed a  dangerous proportion in the international arena. In fact, the  detention of the DP deputies has created the conditions that are  required to internationalize the "Kurdish problem." Meanwhile,  an impression has been created that the DP deputies have been  "oppressed." Of course, whether that is true is another matter.  Nevertheless, the matter has created an opportunity for  propaganda campaigns against Turkey.    The problem is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not  have any difficulty in explaining the reason for the TGNA move  to lift the parliamentary immunity of the DP deputies.  Meanwhile, several diplomats are convinced that the problem  would have been easily resolved if the action against the  deputies had been limited to the lifting of their immunity.    However, the main causes of the problem are:    1. The use of forceful action against DP deputies.    2. Detention of the DP deputies by the police for a  considerable length of time.    Although a strong case may be made to lift their  parliamentary immunity, it seems that developing an effective  case to explain the forceful action against them and their  detention will be difficult. Furthermore, considering western  standards, no one should be expected to be satisfied with the  arguments to support such actions.    Another serious aspect of the matter is that Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin have  been worried by the mistakes made by officials and by the  extended amount of time in which the deputies have been in  custody. Ciller and Karayalcin agree that the detention of the  deputies should be as short as possible and that they should be  released before the religious festival.    Of course, their effort to find a formula for the release  has  been confronted by the independent judicial organs.    Unfortunately, the coalition government has given an  opportunity to six DP deputies to place Turkey's relations with  Western countries under their control.    The success the coalition government has had in placing  itself in a difficult position will probably be an important  addition to the list of its inefficiencies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Japan will back down from  its plan to promote plutonium use for nuclear recycling,  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said  Tuesday [19 April]. Kumagai was referring to reported calls by  the Advisory Committee for Energy, his advisory organ, for  reviewing Japan's policy in favor of plutonium use as a way to  meet energy demand in the future.    The committee is now formulating a report on Japan's new  energy policy by accounting for recent rapid changes in the  energy field.    Speaking before a regular press conference, Kumagai said the  committee is moving toward a consensus against active use of  plutonium. "Discussion so far by the committee seems to be  convincing," Kumagai said.    Japan has come under global criticism for its plutonium  policy as leading to nuclear proliferation. Doubt has also been  cast at home over the feasibility of commercial use of plutonium.    Kumagai said he will meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on  Tuesday to discuss Japan's stance on the so-called trade  "framework" talks with the United States.    Discussion will focus on assessing last week's meeting  between Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in  Marrakech, Morocco, in search of a breakthrough in the stalled  framework talks, the trade minister said.    Kumagai said Japan should maximize its efforts to reopen the  bilateral trade talks before the annual summit of the seven  major industrialized countries in Naples in July.    The Hata-Kantor meeting failed to produce an accord on  setting a time for resumption of the trade talks. But reports  said some progress was made over "objective criteria" or  numerical targets.    The framework talks have been suspended since Japan rejected  a U.S. request to use numerical targets to measure the openness  of its markets.</p>

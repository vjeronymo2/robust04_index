			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Petrogal privatisation shudders to a standstill - The Portuguese oil group desperately needs an injection of fresh capital The privatisation of Petrogal, the Portuguese oil company, had high ideals. It was to provide the country's biggest commercial enterprise with entrepreneurial management and fresh capital to compete with world players in a rapidly deregulating market. But the denationalisation process has shuddered to a halt less than two years after it began without a representative from a private shareholder on the executive board and the company in desperate need of capital to ease a debt burden fast approaching Es330bn (Dollars 1.88bn). Private shareholders who bought 25 per cent of the company in July 1992 were expected to take up an option to purchase a further 26 per cent of the equity by March 1993. But they have held back, contesting valuations of the stock and apparently unable to raise the necessary cash. Recently, the group threatened to pull out of the company altogether if the terms of the privatisation were not rewritten. Unless the private shareholders, dominated by Total, the French oil company, commit themselves to buying the additional 26 per cent, to be used to increase Petrogal's capital, the government also refuses to inject fresh money. The result is a damaging stalemate that contributed to a net loss of Es16bn last year, despite an operating profit, as debt servicing costs rose to Es26bn. Total owns 48 per cent of the capital in private hands. 'We urgently need fresh capital to reduce our heavy debt burden,' said a Petrogal executive. 'Our debt to equity ratio is 4.2. This is clearly abysmal when compared to a company such as Elf Aquitaine of France which has a ratio of 0.48 or British Petroleum which has a ratio of 0.8.' However, the company hopes to reduce the debt to equity ratio to below 3 this year. Given the reluctance of either private or state shareholders to provide fresh capital, Petrogal's government-appointed management has turned to the money market to raise what cash it can. It recently raised Es25bn through an issue of participation titles, a bond and equity hybrid, and plans to issue commercial paper worth Es20bn and Es30bn in March and April. The commercial paper issues will be in escudos to help reduce the foreign exchange exposure of the debt, half of which is in foreign currencies. This year Petrogal hopes to eliminate foreign exchange losses that cost the company Es10bn in 1993. Some Es270bn of Petrogal's accumulated debt is placed with banks. Despite these efforts, executives estimate that the company needs a further capital injection of Es50bn to Es60bn this year to reduce indebtedness and prevent financial costs from eating away profits. No decision has been taken on how to raise the money. But an option the government may have to consider is a renegotiation of the privatisation process that would bring new private shareholders into the company, even if they were not immediately given voting rights. Petrogal's private shareholders, grouped together in the holding company Petrocontrol, have until July 1995 to acquire the additional 26 per cent before a penalty clause requires them to forfeit 6 of the 25 per cent they already own. They were expected to take up the option on the outstanding 26 per cent by March 1993 because from that date the price of the equity began to climb, according to an index taken from Portuguese public debt rates. What would have cost Petrocontrol Es41bn will now cost Es47bn and the price is rising all the time. 'The logical moment for Petrocontrol to buy the additional equity and take over control of the company was in March 1993,' said one market analyst. 'Their failure to make a move then shows that they either don't want a majority holding in Petrogal or that they can't afford it.' In addition to the stalemate over raising more capital, the course Petrogal's privatisation has taken could raise further problems. Portuguese law prohibits foreign investors from directly or indirectly holding a majority of the company's privately-owned capital. Total holds only 48 per cent of Petrocontrol directly. But another company, Petromadeira, has subsequently acquired 25 per cent of Petrocontrol, reportedly using a financing guarantee from Total to do so. 'Petrogal faces important challenges from maintaining its share of a liberalised market to completing investments in modernisation to internationalisation,' said Mr Jose Viana Baptista, Petrogal president. 'The sooner we can resolve the issues of privatisation and capital the more successful we will be in meeting these challenges.'</p>

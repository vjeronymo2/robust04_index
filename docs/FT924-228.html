			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / US starts crackdown on Somali gunmen US FORCES began a crackdown on gunmen in the Somali capital yesterday seizing weapons, missiles and battlewagons 48 hours before a visit by President George Bush, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. US Air Force aircraft dropped 100,000 leaflets on Mogadishu warning residents that machine guns, mortars, and battlewagons would not be tolerated on the streets. 'Anyone aiming or pointing weapons directly at CTF (Combined Task Force) forces will be shot,' the leaflet said. Military spokesman Colonel Fred Peck said US troops seized a large cache of arms and missiles in north-east Mogadishu and a smaller arsenal from a building opposite the US embassy, which Mr Bush will visit. The actions marked the start of a clampdown by the multinational task force on bandits in Mogadishu, where shootings, looting and mugging are still widespread. More evidence emerged that Somalia's warring clans engaged in a final fling of killing and looting just before the December 9 US-led intervention in Somalia. Diplomatic sources confirmed that a clan in the southern port of Kismayu massacred over 100 people from another clan on the eve of the US Marine landing in Mogadishu. The diplomatic sources said the killings were believed to have taken place over three nights. Mr Sean Devereux, a Unicef worker in Kismayu, recently called the pogrom 'targeted clan killings.' Gunmen also shot dead four Somalis working for the International Red Cross (ICRC) and one from the relief agency Care on Monday in incidents which highlighted continued lawlessness, officials from both agencies said. Mr Bush is coming to Somalia primarily to meet US troops for the New Year in what will almost certainly be his swan song as commander-in-chief of the US military before he hands over the White House to President-elect Bill Clinton on January 20. The visit will last about 27 hours, half of it aboard the amphibious assault ship Tripoli. Mr Bush will meet soldiers at bases in Mogadishu, Baidoa and Bali Dogle and make brief stops at a relief agency field centre and a home for orphans of Somalia's famine and war, US officials said.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PROPOSAL FOR HOTEL  </P> <P> Plans by La Quinta Motor Inns to construct a 168-unit, three-story hotel in  Garden Grove will be considered tonight when the City Council meets.  </P> <P> The $8-million project, planned for a 2.8-acre site at the northwest corner of  Haster Street and Garden Grove Boulevard, has been delayed while the city and  the San Antonio-based developer wrangle over issues raised by the proposed  hotel's location in the Santa Ana River flood plain.  </P> <P> Under guidelines issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the project  would have to be elevated five feet to protect it in the event of a flood of a  severity to be expected once in 100 years.  </P> <P> On Oct. 23, city officials determined that La Quinta was in default of its  agreement with the city for failing to submit completed plans, including the  five-foot elevation, by Aug. 30. All the parties are scheduled to try to  resolve the issue tonight, which could result in a time extension or the  cancellation of the agreement with La Quinta.  </P> <P> The meeting is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.  </P></p>

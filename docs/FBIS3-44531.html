			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["People's Forum" by Li Demin (2621 1795 3046): "Gambling </F> Is Fiercer Than Tigers"]    [Text] "The winners indulge in eating and drinking and go  whoring, and the losers end up stealing, picking pockets, and  mugging." That is an assessment of gambling by the common  people. Those who gamble, whether they win or lose, will  certainly come to no good end.    It is not now that the CPC and the people's government are  opposed to gambling. In the past thousands of years, in this  ancient country of civilization of ours, gambling has always  been denounced and banned and subjected to punishment. Gambling  money, gambling paraphernalia, stakes, gamblers, and inveterate  gamblers have never been commendatory terms. As far back as in  the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, cock  fighting, horse racing, and other similar gambling conduct were  denounced as "evil ways"; in the Tang Dynasty, gamblers were  subjected to bludgeoning and whipping; and in the Song Dynasty,  they were even beheaded. It was decreed in the early Song  Dynasty: "Those gambling in the streets will be beheaded and  those neighbors who shield, harbor, or fail to report them will  be treated in the same way." Although the "Law of the Qing  Dynasty" gave the Man people certain privileges, the penalty  meted out to those guilty of gambling was even harsher than to  the Han people. In the West, there as "legitimate gambling" or  "nonprofit institutional gambling," such as casino gambling,  horse racing, and lotteries. However, after repeated  investigation and studies, it can only be regarded as "something  with a deep-rooted dual nature in terms of ethics and philosophy  and many outstanding social issues." In modern or ancient  times, in China or elsewhere, decent people do not gamble and or  are opposed to gambling.    However, dying embers glow again and the dregs of society  have come to the surface. In socialist China, gambling, which  is a social plague, has spread again in recent years. It  involves a fairly wide spectrum of people, old, young, men, and  women in both rural and urban areas. The modes of gambling have  also diversified, from the indigenous to the foreign ones. What  merits special attention is that criminal syndicates with  gambling as their profession have taken shape in some  localities. The number of gamblers has risen, the stakes become  bigger, and cases of gambling- related theft, corruption,  bribery, mugging, and homicide have increased. Gambling, as an  ugly phenomenon, has seriously polluted society and poisoned the  people.    It is a great pity that some people have wittingly or  unwittingly defended gambling, saying that it is an "exciting  recreational activity," "kindling the spirit of competition and  fighting to win," and is a psychological experience of  "expectation," "confrontation," and "trusting to luck." Others  regard gambling and pornography as "tourist resources" like  sunlight, beaches, songs, dances, and shopping. All this is  preposterous. Gambling is gambling. It is harmful in the same  way as drug-taking, prostitution, and going whoring. How many  people have lost their family fortunes, broken up their  families, and brought disgrace and ruin upon themselves by the  144 mahjong pieces and 54 poker cards. These kinds of tragedy  have been enacted one after another. To make a lot of money,  some people in the Xinhui Qiaoqu Economic Development Company,  Guangdong Province, recklessly took a gamble on over 10 million  yuan of public money in Macao; they lost and suffered stern  punishments according to state law. To be able to play mahjong  free from care, a female worker in Shenyang, Liaoning Province,  unscrupulously drowned her eight-year-old daughter.    Gambling is fiercer than tigers. Failure to wipe out this  scourge will bring calamity to the country and the people.  Gambling is not recreation. Those wanting to have amusements  should not gamble because they are entirely different. Now that  New Year's Day and the Spring Festival are coming, it is good  for people to come together and have fun, but on no account  should they gamble and turn a good thing into a bad one.</p>

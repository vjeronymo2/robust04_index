			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Observer: Solley on pools Whatever happened to Stephen Solley QC? He is the lawyer who represented Victor Gray, alleged owner of the Savings and Investment Bank, the Isle of Man's most famous collapsed bank. Gray got off as did Solley's recent clients in the Titaghur Jute and Barlow Clowes cases. With a record like that, and the current boom in white collar crime, surely Solley can't be short of money? However, last week he was complaining on TV about delays in the speed with which barristers are paid and now Observer finds that Solley has been moonlighting as a freelance travel writer. He has just finished a guide book to French hotels with swimming pools. Early days yet, but it could turn out to be the standard reference work on this specialist subject and it is certainly more readable than the likes of Weinberg and Blank on Take-Overs and Mergers. However, Solley is not yet ready to abandon the bar. 'Getting people off complicated fraud charges was considerably easier than getting this book produced', complains the author.</p>

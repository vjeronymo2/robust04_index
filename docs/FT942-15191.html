			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rodime appeal after disk lawsuit setback Rodime, the Scottish disk drive pioneer whose future depends on licensing its technology and on successful claims against companies which infringe its patents, has suffered an adverse judgment in a lawsuit with Quantum, the US disk drive maker. Rodime is to appeal against the judgment, but warns that failure could reduce future licensing and patent infringement revenues. It would significantly cut both the number of disk drive manufacturers using Rodime technology without a licence and the volume of infringing disk drives subject to royalties under Rodime's patents. Mr Peter Bailey, managing director, admitted that if the appeal failed it would be a 'severe setback' for Rodime. Yesterday Rodime shares halved in value, falling 16 1/2 p to 15p. The shares have attracted much speculative attention in recent months, reaching a peak of 51 1/2 p, having been relisted at 1 3/4 p in August 1992. The company had patented aspects of the 3 1/2 inch disk drive which it pioneered but later ceased to manufacture. The Minnesota district court, however, has now declared invalid certain claims of Rodime's '383 US patent', its principal disk drive patent. Quantum had sought a declaratory judgment on the patent. Rodime said it was not clear what bearing the Quantum judgment would have on its own lawsuit against Seagate, another US disk drive maker, which it is suing for continued wilful patent infringement. In that lawsuit, before the California district court, Seagate has filed an identical motion to that of Quantum. In 1993 Rodime incurred losses of Dollars 2.14m (Pounds 1.46m) before tax. Yesterday it said its bankers had indicated that they would continue providing working capital to fund litigation. The company said it strongly believed, on legal advice, that the Minnesota judge's order should not have been granted and will appeal to the federal appeals court in Washington DC early next week. The appeal is expected to take no more than a year.</p>

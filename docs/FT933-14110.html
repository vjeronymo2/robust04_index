			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Big Abbey turnover An agency cross in banking group Abbey National sent turnover soaring to 22m shares, the day's highest total. Agency broker James Capel was believed to have taken a block of 7m from an institution at 410p, passing it on to several investors at 411p. The stock has been weak since the tail end of last week when Robert Fleming reiterated its negative stance on the stock, saying bad debt was too high and thus the shares were overpriced. SG Warburg was also said to have turned cautious earlier this week, removing the stock from its buy list to a hold position. However, James Capel advised investors to buy on weakness. The shares closed 5 lighter at 409p.</p>

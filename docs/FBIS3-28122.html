			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2311 GMT on 29 January, in its regularly scheduled  "News 2001" program, carries a 41-minute interview with former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP). The interview is held at an Asahi Television studio in  Tokyo and moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori  Matsuyama. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan (SDPJ), joins the interview through remote  hookup. The interview is also joined by regular guest  commentators columnist Kenichi Takemura and Keio University  Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi.    At 2311 GMT, Kuroiwa asks what Watanabe, who was against  approval of the political reform bills, thinks of the compromise  between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono on the  political reform package. Watanabe says: "They (coalition  parties) made a compromise and accepted the LDP's proposals with  minor changes. I think the LDP deserves 90 points out of 100 if  the single-seat constituency system is eventually approved." He  admits that he is satisfied with the outcome.    On the LDP executives' performances in dealing with the  political reform bills, Watanabe says LDP President Kono and  Secretary General Mori have done well. He flatly denies that  the LDP became weak- kneed at a crucial moment and made a  compromise with the coalition because of the rumor that the  public prosecutors office might search offices of some LDP  lawmakers on 30 January for their possible involvement in a  series of recent construction scandals.    Asked if LDP factions will cease to exist after introduction  of the single-seat electoral system, Watanabe says:  "Theoretically, factions will disappear if the single-seat  electoral system is introduced because there will be no need for  the LDP members to compete against each other in elections."  Regarding a rumor that Watanabe may secede from the LDP and  form a new party, he says that he was just joking when he  commented on that matter.    Pointing out that LDP President Kono have moved closer to  Prime Minister Hosokawa over the political reform bills, Kuroiwa  asks what Watanabe thinks of apparent new movement to settle  various issues through policy cooperation between the LDP and  the Hosokawa administration. Watanabe explains: "I think this  is a very good sign. We are not saying no to everything. We  have been saying that the LDP is a responsible opposition party.  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) is playing the central role in  the coalition government. Komeito and the SDPJ joined the  coalition of Shinseito, Japan New Party, and Sakigake (Harbinger  Party). They said that they would maintain the fundamental  policies that the LDP had kept for 38 years. It is quite fine  and we can cooperate with them."    Saying that the Hosokawa administration's next major task is  to tackle the issue of raising the consumption tax rate, Kuroiwa  asks Watanabe if the LDP can cooperate with the Hosokawa  administration on this matter. Watanabe says: "It is  impossible to implement policies by ignoring the opposition  party, which is a major party and has seats close to a majority  in the Diet. When the LDP had 300 seats, we gave due  considerations to the intentions of the SDPJ, which had only  130-140 seats then. Needless to say, considerations should be  given to the intentions of the LDP, which has seats close to a  majority. There is no need to fight because they are saying  that their fundamental policies are the same as ours."    At 2330 GMT, Matsuyama asks SDPJ Chairman Murayama, who just  joined the interview, why his party gave way to the LDP on the  issue of corporate donations. Murayama says: "The greatest  goal of the recent political reform was to eliminate corporate  donations, which are a cause of political corruption. Everybody  knows that. Therefore, we intensely devoted ourselves to the  pursuit of getting rid of the root of corruption. It would have  been nice if our demands were accepted 100 percent. However,  cooperation and conciliation are needed in politics. Therefore,  we decided to accept it on condition that we will continue to  make further efforts to improve it in the future."    Saying that the SDPJ -- which was against the introduction  of  the electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with  proportional representation and liberalization of Japan's rice  market -- gave up many things and made compromises one after  another after it joined the coalition, Kobayashi asks Murayama  if the SDPJ will give up its resistance to a consumption tax  hike as well. Murayama says: "I think it is necessary for us to  remain in the coalition to exert efforts to make improvements,  even a step or two, while reflecting our opinions in policy  matters." Kuroiwa asks: "What is the SDPJ's intention regarding  remaining in the coalition government even at the risk of giving  up a fundamental part, which the SDPJ thinks is the most  important? Murayama explains: "As I said earlier, it is our  task to exert our efforts while remaining in the coalition to  respond to the people's expectations by realizing our demands."    Kuroiwa asks Murayama to comment on the fact that the  coalition ultimately had to accept the LDP proposal on corporate  donations due to the SDPJ rebels, who voted against the  political reform bills in the upper house. Murayama answers:  "Originally, those who voted against the political reform bills  were opposing an introduction of the electoral system combining  single- seat constituencies with proportional representation.  They were not talking about the corporate donations alone, but  saying that it was their fundamental stance not to approve the  bills. They had their own individual beliefs. I think the  problem was that they continued to stick to their beliefs. As  you all know, the SDPJ was originally against the single-seat  electoral system. After the general election in July, however,  the SDPJ finally took action and joined the coalition to answer  to the expectations of the people, who wanted us to change the  politics. Although we had a heated debate at the party  convention, we had no other choice but to accept the combination  of single-seat constituencies with proportional representation.  Therefore, I was hoping that they would abide by the party  decision."    Asked if the SDPJ executive department will bear the  responsibility for the recent series of events, Murayama  responds: "The party will have many chances, such as an  emergency party convention and central committee meetings, to  talk about the executive department's responsibility."  Matsuyama asks if Murayama will resign from the post of SDPJ  chairman to take responsibility, Murayama says: "No, I am not  thinking of that."    At 2341 GMT, Kurosawa asks Watanabe what he thinks of  increasing the consumption tax rate. Watanabe explains that the  government should increase the consumption tax to cover a  financial shortfall that is inevitable should the income tax be  reduced. He continues to explain short-term economic merits of  a decision to increase the consumption tax.    As for a positive impact of approving the political reform  bills, Watanabe says: "It is true that it gave the people a  sense of relief."</p>

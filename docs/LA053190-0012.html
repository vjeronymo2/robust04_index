			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> DIGITAL UNDERGROUND CAN'T GET OVER THE HUMPT  </P> <P> It was a sad case of Humpty interruptus.  </P> <P> As its show unfolded at the Palace on Tuesday, Digital Underground looked to be  the long-awaited rap group willing to make its performance a true stage  spectacle.  </P> <P> The Oakland outfit was a dizzying whirl of charged energy, with showers of  confetti and Silly String creating a New Year's Eve environment.  </P> <P> There was some stage fog for atmosphere, and on a salute to their fellow  rappers the musicians hauled out huge cartoon masks of their rivals. The nasty  stuff came across as more coarse than it does on the group's "Sex Packets"  album, but DU did preserve some of its subtlety, trusting its storytelling  enough to offer a gentler, more subtle tone now and then.  </P> <P> Of course there's nothing gentle or subtle about "The Humpty Dance," rap  music's "Louie Louie" -- dumb, irresistible and essential. When DU's clown-star  Humpty Hump started bouncing around and the booming bass line struck, the crowd  erupted. The show was poised to blast off into untracked realms.  </P> <P> But sorry -- it was over. A half-hour build-up to greatness instead dissolved  into a guest-star party-jam encore with Tone Loc and Ice Cube, among others, on  a crowded stage. Financial note: the ticket price for the 30-minute set (which  was preceded by Mellow Man Ace's 20-minute stint) was $20. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

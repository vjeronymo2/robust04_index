He also said that there is a real danger  that the accident rate will go up.    By a miracle an accident with the most modern MiG-29  aircraft  was avoided last night at Ravnets Airport. The reasons for the  near miss -- the lack of pilot training and the shortage of  spare parts, fuel, and lubricants, Mikho Mikhov said.    The ratio of aviation resources vis-a-vis our neighbors is 1  to 1.6 and even 2.6 to Bulgaria's disadvantage. The combat  readiness aircraft are of the second, third, and fourth  generations. Only 8 percent of the total number of aircraft are  modern aircraft. In neighboring countries the corresponding  percentage is 45-50 percent, Gen. Mikhov said. Scheduled  repairs were not carried out at the end of 1993 because of a  shortage of spare parts. Some 31 percent of the airplanes and  46 percent of the helicopters are faulty.    If the envisaged budget does not provide the Air Force with  funds for technical supples, by the end of 1994 some 80 percent  of the aircraft will be defective. The Air Force needs a  minimum of 4 billion leva. More than 1 billion leva are needed  to maintain the missile and antiaircraft troops.</p>

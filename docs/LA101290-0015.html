			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNBEATEN SANTA MARGARITA ROLLS OVER GAHR, 34-0  </P> <P> It took just 6 minutes 30 seconds for Santa Margarita High School to score two  touchdowns, knock out Gahr's quarterback and establish dominance that  eventually led to a 34-0 victory in a nonleague game at Gahr Thursday.  </P> <P> Josh Ireland and Trevor Yankoff each ran for touchdowns within the first 6:30  for the Eagles (6-0).  </P> <P> Both touchdowns were set up by long kick returns. Mike Farris returned the  first one 56 yards to the Gahr 40-yard line. David Shearer took the second  kickoff 29 yards to the Gahr 16. Ireland's three-yard run culminated the first  drive just 1:38 into the game. Three minutes later, Yankoff, the Eagles'  quarterback, scored from the five.  </P> <P> On the next play from scrimmage, Gahr quarterback Greg Van Lear was blindsided  by defensive back Eric Brown and was taken off the field on a stretcher with  what was preliminarily diagnosed as a broken collarbone.  </P> <P> His replacement, Randy Calhoun, had a rough time as well. He was sacked seven  times, four times by defensive end Matt Deller. Gahr managed just 80 yards  total offense and just four first downs in the game.  </P></p>

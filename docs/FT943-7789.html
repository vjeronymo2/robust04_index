			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Travel: The desert is waiting - John Westbrooke sets out on a camel in Morocco and discovers the real reason for visiting the sand dunes M'hamid is the end of the world. The road peters out as it arrives; side streets are no more than dusty alleys. The buildings are low and made of mud brick. There is a hotel, but no water or electricity. Against the wall of the last house in town, the sands of the Sahara pile up in waves. M'hamid is Moroccan, and has seen use as a garrison town, but the borders in this region are unfixed. Algeria is nearby, probably within 30 miles. In truth, there is only nothing out there - all the way to the Nile. We had set out, rocking wildly, on camels. Lolling along on big flat feet, the animals bore no stirrups, which proved painful to our inside thighs until their driver suggested we sit forward on the saddle, our legs crossed around the pommel, our ankles resting on the dromedary's uncomplaining neck. The ride was still bumpy, but less of a strain to underused muscles; this is how the pros do it. Round our heads, to keep out the sun and dust, we wrapped fine scarves. After three hours of this and lunch prepared fresh in the shade of the only tree for 10 miles, we were getting used to our mounts when our hosts decided we were not going fast enough to see the real desert - the sand dunes - in the limited time we had, and called up 4WD vehicles to take us to M'hamid and beyond. A few hours looking out of their windows demonstrated that even nothingness comes in different varieties. Some desert is level and stony. Some is almost green, with bushes holding hillocks of sand in their roots. Some is boring - scrubby little plants that would not feed a camel, soft sand that slows driving to a crawl, featureless flatlands under a clear blue sky. The sun was fading when we arrived at the dunes, but sure enough, this was the real desert, the way it appears in our dreams. Beyond the great, shadowy, wind-driven curves of sand it was easy to imagine Lawrence of Arabia, Ali Baba, Fort Zinderneuf, all out there somewhere. The sky darkened, shooting stars hurtled overhead, the night became chilly. While we huddled round a brushwood fire, our drivers whipped up another meal on the spot: Berber bread kneaded and risen and cooked over hot stones, salad, tajine (meat and veg baked in earthenware pots) and slices of orange dusted with cinnamon, all accompanied by Moroccan red wine. Many visitors, it should be said, also rate the local hashish as a tourist attraction. At the end of a chilly but romantic winter evening (summer is impossibly hot, spring and autumn are the best times to come), we went to bed in a bedouin tent, fully-clad, under thick blankets, with a glimpse of the big night sky through an open flap. The next night we spent in the expensive Royal Mansour Hotel in Casablanca, several hours' driving and flying away. Its comfort seemed like a mockery of the previous night's austerity, but both are authentic aspects of Moroccan life. The country's interior may be empty sands, but the coastal strip is green and fertile, and home to the imperial cities of the country's gilded Moorish past. Casablanca is nothing like the film, which was shot in Hollywood. The reality is a bright, white port city with - newly opened on the seafront - the world's second biggest mosque after Mecca; unbelievers may not enter it. The town has none of the movie's mystery. In search of seedy nightlife we went to a disco. It felt like all the discos in all the towns in all the world, circa 1972, except that boys danced with boys and girls with girls. Marrakesh and Tangiers are closer to the exotic Araby of our dreams, but both are well used to tourists; you cannot even take off a lens cap in Djemaa el-Fna square in Marrakesh without kids storming up and demanding money. For a different experience, try Fez, perhaps the world's last truly medieval city. A walk through its souks conjures up sights, sounds and smells which must have existed in London 500 years ago. And it is still startling to look at a map and realise that this headily oriental bazaar is actually five degrees west of Greenwich. Between the coast and the desert is a third Morocco, the land of the High Atlas. There are three main passes through the mountains, good roads but liable to closure during winter snows. There were a few small villages, tinged red by manganese in the soil, with women sweeping snow off the flat roofs, and scattered stalls optimistically offering rocks and fossils to passers-by. In the foothills on the eastern side, though, some of these hamlets are spectacular, if forbidding. Tribal warfare meant until recently that towns had to be more or less fortified, so the streets are often lined with blank walls and overlooked by small towers. Standard procedure for besiegers was to divert a river towards their mud-brick foundations and wash them away. There are several such villages - called ksour - grandly situated in the Todra and Dades gorges, but the most eye-catching we saw was Ait Ben Haddou, just outside Ouarzazate. The houses spilling down the side of a small hill are mostly empty and crumbling, but their roof lines are decked out with machicolations like baby castles. It looked like a Hollywood set. It was a Hollywood set. It has been used as a convenient background in films such as Lawrence of Arabia, but that much is common enough in Morocco: the kasbah (fortress) at Ouarzazate, for instance, became a brothel in The Sheltering Sky; the walls of Essaouira appeared in Orson Welles's Othello. Part of Ait Ben Haddou, however, was actually built for the filming of Jesus of Nazareth. This was good news for the locals, who could now afford to move to a comfortable new village across the river. But for travellers it is a depressing thought. You come all this way through the snowy mountains and rocky valleys and you might as well be on the Universal Studios tour. That, finally, is why you go out into the desert. Hollywood can build its own kasbahs for Schwarzeneggers to knock down. Some Morocco Disney will one day reproduce the imperial Moorish palaces, three-quarter size and cleaner, with popcorn stands. But what showman could build the sands? For that you need the wind and the sun and the hand of Allah. John Westbrooke was a guest of Inspirations Morocco (tel: 0293-822244), which offers city, beach, fly-drive and trekking holidays. A week split between the coastal resort of Agadir and a camel trek with two nights in the desert costs from Pounds 534.</p>

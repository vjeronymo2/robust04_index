			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "Why We Won't Be </F> Dragged Into the Quagmire"]    [Text] The Bosnian civil war, like the Spanish Civil War in  the Thirties, stirs strong frustration and anger here -- and  bitter comment, as in the caricature of British policy by John  Nott which the Evening Standard Published last week.    Policy has to rest on facts. The great majority of those who  are fighting in Bosnia are Bosnians. Bosnian Serbs have  besieged Bosnian Moslems in Sarajevo. Bosnian Croats have  besieged Bosnian Moslems in Mostar. Bosnian Moslems have  besieged Bosnian Croats in Vitez.    All now receive some help from outside. The Bosnian Serbs  and the Serb government in Belgrade bear the greatest  responsibility for starting the war and for the atrocities  committed in it. That is why the international community  imposes sanctions against the Serbs and not the others. But  even now, after fighting and ethnic cleansing, the different  communities in Bosnia are hopelessly mixed up on the map. That  is why the parallel with Kuwait in 1990 is out of place, and why  in the end there will be no stable military victory.    John Nott advocates lifting the arms embargo. So did the  Americans last year. It was not the British Foreign Secretary,  but the majority of the Security Council which turned this down.  If it had been lifted, all sides would have rearmed. Instead  of dying down, the war would probably now be in full blaze. It  might well have spread by now to other parts of the Balkans.  Petrol does not put out a fire.    A British government needs to look at the British interest  --  the interest of a European nation with limited resources but  willing to work hard with others for a more decent world.    It is in our interest to stop the war spreading -- and so  far, with our allies and partners, we have succeeded.    It is our interest and instinct to help keep people alive,  to  relieve cold and hunger. Hence the 160 million pounds of your  money which we have spent already on the humanitarian effort.  Hence the 2,500 British troops escorting the convoys -- a  bigger contribution than any except the French. Hence our aid  workers and civilian drivers like Paul Goodman who lost his life  last month.    I don't have much time for those who belittle this effort.  Of course, keeping people alive is not the same as ending the  war. But it's a good deal better than leaving them to starve or  freeze.    It is in our interest to help efforts for a negotiated  peace.  The fighting will only be stopped by those who are doing the  fighting. That sounds obvious. But some people witter on as if  outsiders hold the key to peace. What outsiders can do is  prepare the way with ideas and a framework for negotiation.  That is what David Owen, Thorvald Stoltenberg and Peter  Carrington before them have been doing. One day, when a peace  has been built, their names will be found on the building blocks.    If the surgical use of force by the West could have ended  the  war, we would have used force long ago. The justification has  been there. But government, unlike retired Defence Secretaries,  have to weigh the consequences of what they propose.    We have to pay heed to professional advice. Britain has been  more cautious than some others about talking of the use of  force, and has asked practical questions about proposed  rhetorical declarations.    If the UN forces escorting convoys are attacked, they will  be  protected from the air. If the relief of Srebrenica or the  reopening of Tuzla airport are prevented, these operations can  be helped forward from the air. If the No Fly Zone is  infringed, it can be enforced, it has been this week. If the  Bosnian Serbs renege on what NATO and General Rose have achieved  in Sarajevo, there, too, air power could be used.    On balance, we believe that these measured commitments can  deliver benefit which outweighs the risks. We do not warm to  the idea of military operations entered into without judgement.  They might satisfy the television viewer for a week or two, but  could then draw us month by month, or even year by year, into a  quagmire of loss and casualties.    Ministers have the power to put at risk the lives of British  servicemen. They should do this only after consultation and  calculation, not to snatch a headline or appease a mood.    There will be setbacks and more bloodshed yet before there  is full peace in Bosnia. But in the last few weeks the patient  work of many countries and individuals shows signs of bearing  fruit.    As the Prime Minister's visit to the United States showed,  our disagreement with the Americans over Bosnia last year is now  history. We work harmoniously with our fellow troop  contributors, of which the core is European. We helped to bring  the Russians back into the peace effort. From this work we now  hope for four main results:    First, the resumption of air convoys. They were suspended  when air strikes and retaliation against air strikes seemed  likely. Those in charge on the ground have to judge the risks  day by day. The trucks and drivers are getting back on the road  to central Bosnia which our engineers partly built and which our  army manages.    Second, the civil life of Sarajevo should be restored. Under  General Rose French, British, and other troops keep the peace.  It should now be possible to open roads and restore services.  The Prime Minister and President Clinton announced a joint  British-American mission to visit Sarajevo urgently to consider  how to help the city get back to as normal a life as possible.    Third, the benefits should spread to other towns and  distressed areas. The plan for opening Tuzla to relief supplies  should be carried out. Mostar, Vitez and the Maglaj pocket need  relief. this means redeploying the UN force and may need extra  men. Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Canada, Malaysia and many  other countries are doing their bit. The extra should come from  elsewhere.    Fourth, the peace process needs to be revived. The Americans  and Russians are needed here. If either hangs back, there will  be generals and politicians in Bosnia who will advise against  signing up to a peace agreement. We should not be dogmatic  about the content. It has to be agreed, not imposed.    If, thanks to American initiative, the Croats and Bosnian  Moslems are willing to come together in a confederacy, well and  good. Everyone, including the Bosnian Serbs, know that a  settlement has to start with substantial Serb withdrawal from  land they now occupy.    We have put an end to war in West Europe. That is one reason  why the European Community was founded.    Neither NATO nor the European Union now can sensibly claim  to  be able to stop wars in Central or East Europe. but we have to  try. Not by rhetoric and pretence, but by bringing those  countries step by step into the European framework which we have  created.    Exhaustion, pressure and persuasion are opening the way to  an  end of the war in Bosnia. but that is only the beginning of our  task.</p>

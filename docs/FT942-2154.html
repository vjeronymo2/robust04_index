			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Ministers back move to revive CrossRail Ministers are giving discreet support to an initiative by a Tory MP to revive the CrossRail project, in the belief that it now represents the best chance of the east-west underground rail link in London. As concern grows at Westminster over the future of CrossRail, the government is backing an initiative by Mr David Lidington, the Tory MP for Aylesbury, who is hoping to table a Commons motion this week calling for a parliamentary committee to re-examine the project. Legislation to build the rail-link, which has the backing of British Rail and London Underground, suffered a surprise rejection last month when a four-strong committee of MPs on the private bill committee turned it down. However, ministers believe that Mr Lidington, who is drawing up a petition to back his case, may persuade the Speaker to consider a motion calling for the bill to be sent back to the committee for reconsideration. It is understood that more than 100 MPs have endorsed the petition. At the same time, Mr John MacGregor, transport minister, has rejected a proposal that he and his Labour counterpart, Mr Frank Dobson, should make a joint plea to the deputy speaker that the bill should be sent back to the committee. He is also understood to have rejected alternative ways of resurrecting CrossRail, including a new bill or summoning an independent inspector to examine the project. By quietly backing Mr Lidington, the government is determined to avoid a clash with the bill committee.</p>

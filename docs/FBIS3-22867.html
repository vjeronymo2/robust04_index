BND director Konrad Porzner told (the Thursday edition of) the  HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that there was no indication  that countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons had had any  success in recruiting Russian nuclear weapons experts.    "Nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union is not as  widespread as portrayed in the media. As far as we are aware  there is on the black market no material available for nuclear  weapons construction, either in terms of type or volume,"  Porzner stressed during the interview. "It can be said with more  or less certainty that the atomic arsenal is under the control  of the armed forces there. We have no knowledge that the  Russian mafia has any influence on nuclear facilities."    Nuclear weapons were still sought after by other countries,  Porzner said, and cited North Korea by way of example. However,  Iran "is clearly striving for nuclear weapons" as well. Iran  was already capable of manufacturing chemical weapons, he said.  The German Government stopped nuclear cooperation with Iran  years ago.    According to security service information, there is still a  threat to the states from worldwide organized crime. "The threat  has been recognized but not banished," said Porzner. The 3,000  or so gangs in the Russian mafia had no access to nuclear  material, "but there is no doubt that their influence reaches  into administrative structures and authorities."

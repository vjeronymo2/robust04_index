			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Delta set to win London Detroit route - News in Brief DELTA Air Lines has received conditional final approval from the US Department of Transportation, to fly between London and Detroit, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The route authority used to belong to Pan Am, and since the international carrier's demise Delta and Northwest Airlines, which uses Detroit as a hub airport, have been battling to take over the route. The DOT approval is conditional on the US courts deciding Pan Am's contract to transfer the route to Delta is still valid. ***** REEBOK, the US sports shoe manufacturer, yesterday reported first-quarter after-tax profits of Dollars 62.3m, up from Dollars 58.4m in the same period a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait. Sales rose from Dollars 695.3m to Dollars 797.4m and the shares gained Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 33 1/2 on the news. ***** CONRAIL, one of the large US railroad companies, said it expected 'slow but steady' growth in volume through the second quarter and rest of the year, writes Nikki Tait. It reported after-tax profits of Dollars 38m in the first three months to end-March, against Dollars 18m in the same period a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 798m against Dollars 755m, with freight volumes up by eight per cent over the first quarter of 1991. ***** NORTHROP, US defence contractor, reported first-quarter net profits of Dollars 47.2m or Dollars 1 a share, against a loss of Dollars 34.8m or Dollars 0.74 a share in the same period last year, Reuter reports.

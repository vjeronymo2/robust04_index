			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Groupe Bull France's troubled computer maker may suffer from many of the same ills as its one-time mentor IBM, but the French government has helped concoct a very different remedy. The government will inject FFr7bn into the company to plug the gaping holes in its balance sheet and is encouraging other shareholders, such as France Telecom, IBM, and NEC to be similarly supportive. Such aid seemingly flies in the face of the EC's strictures on state subsidies. Computer rivals, such as Siemens, Olivetti and ICL will justifiably be angered about the move, which is bound to prolong the agonies of the European industry. By itself, however, the recapitalisation will do little to ameliorate Bull's woes. Radical restructuring will have to follow if the company is to have any chance of surviving as a viable entity. The incoming chairman, Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, is an iconoclastic industrialist who may well be prepared to mince Bull's sacred cows into more palatable beefburgers. But it will be a complex task. Bull's heavy reliance on mainframe computers has left it vulnerable to nimbler systems. The company may be forced to cut costs mercilessly and focus on more selective products and markets. It will also have to move fast to resolve its troubles in the US market following the disastrous Zenith acquisition. Bull retains considerable technological strengths and a powerful position in its home market. But unless Mr Descarpentries works wonders, the government's hope for an early privatisation looks ambitious.</p>

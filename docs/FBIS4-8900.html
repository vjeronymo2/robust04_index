			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Leszek Miller: "It Must Not Continue That Way"] </F>   [Text] What is really happening to Poland? Where are we  heading? What does the future have in store for us? These are  difficult questions, and there are no ready-made answers to them.    It is worth recalling the forecasts made by the so-called  reformatory camp during the election campaign. After the  victory of the left, "a black night of chaos and incompetence"  was supposed to ensue. The nation was supposed to "wail," and  the shocked West would turn its back on us in revulsion. Poland  was supposed to be isolated both politically and economically.  Lines of people, rationing, and the proverbial vinegar on shop  shelves were to return as symbols of the hardship of life and  the condition of the economy. However, politicians and  journalists had not made a greater mistake for a very long time.    After the first quarter of this year, inflation was the  lowest in seven years--it dropped to 4.5 percent. The 10-percent  production growth is the highest in 15 years. Unemployment  dropped by 20,000 people. It is obvious that these as well as  other indicators are not so high as to be felt everywhere as  favorable. They do, however, have something in common: They are  all positive.    As a result of the prospect of a stable government and  economic growth, Western states are revalorizing their interests  in Central Europe. They are beginning to perceive our country as  an important factor of political peace and economic reforms. A  long-term strategy of investment and trade involvement of the  main economic powers is being shaped. The impossibilities that  have so far been observed in the relations with neighbors are  being broken. Prominent politicians from East and West are  stressing that Poland is heading in the right direction. This  is what the evaluation of the first six months of the coalition  of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] is based on. It should be stressed, however,  that former governments have contributed to it as well.    Therefore, the election victory of the left is even more  aggravating. "We could have prevented this" was how Bohdan  Cywinski recently expressed his irritation in RZECZPOSPOLITA.  How? "For example, by limiting the passive franchise of former  communists. That it is undemocratic? Nonsense." The author  answers his own question, and, at another point, he appeals to  remove from memory this "hideous date of 19 September 1993" as  soon as possible. This is how much has been left of the words  about "respecting the will of the people" and the conviction  that this will is the only pass to the political scene.    The fears that the situation might not be as bad as it was  supposed to be are obvious to not only the bickering leaders of  the right. They can also be found in the evaluations of serious  people, surrounded by the halo of independence, not meddling  with minor skirmishes. This is no wonder because the problem is  extremely important. Even a moderate success of a government  including the left must mean the compromising of the myths on  which Poles have been fed for years.    It will turn out that a "postcommunist" formation not only  does not pose any threat to the favorable future of Poland, but,  on the contrary, is a chance for its development, strengthening  the mechanisms of parliamentary democracy and the market  economy. The center-left government does not only deter the  West but it is a considerable and serious partner for Western  democracies. In addition, it does not have to be legitimized by  any authorities, and it does not need any intermediaries, which  may be the most painful thing. It settles for the mandate of  its voters.    The reaction of some authority centers is quite significant.  I would like to be wrong now, but it is becoming increasingly  clear that the activities of Lech Walesa are, unfortunately,  destructive. The persistent maintenance of the vacancy in the  extremely important post of the economy's head and finance  minister, threats for the democratically elected Sejm,  embarrassing decisions concerning the National Council of Radio  and Television, refusal to competently take part in the work of  the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, veto of  the wage-control law, the already announced refusal to sign the  electoral law governing local elections--all this aims at the  emerging chances of political stabilization and economic growth.    In this light, the strategic goal of the president seems to  be obvious: to prevent the four-year governing of the PSL-SLD  coalition, to prove that the results of the 19 September  elections was a mistake, to strengthen his own power, and to  weaken his opponents and potential countercandidates.    Is Lech Walesa all alone in his strivings? Certainly not in  all of them. In the 18 March issue of TYGODNIK "SOLIDARNOSC,"  Andrzej Gelberg wrote, quoting Marian Krzaklewski, "Solidarity  will not resign itself to the fact that power has been taken  over by the communists and will fight against this configuration  with all its might." Even though the author adds that it will  do this by peaceful means, he writes later on with disarming  frankness that the aim is to "change the present parliamentary  configuration"; he does not explain by what peaceful means it is  going to achieve this. It is an important sign, especially now  that strikes and protests have been announced that "defend the  employees' interests."    Thus, the aim of the president's actions, regardless of  whether they are agreed on or not, is clear. Is it possible to  achieve this goal? No, it is not, if the rules of a democratic  state are to be applied. Yes, it is, if the government of the  center left is gradually discredited and if the social peace is  disturbed. The price of such destruction would be enormous;  however, it looks like it is neither appalling nor shameful.    Against this backdrop, disquieting are the  mistakes--sometimes seemingly minor--committed by the SLD. The  left displays a lack of ability to think in advance. It cannot  see obvious traps and poorly estimates its own limited or badly  utilized capabilities.    The circumstances of the recall of Marek Borowski are  particularly instructive and painful here. We would not have to  look for a new finance minister now if all of the consequences  of this decision had been considered. It is also not good when  the main platform of the disputes that the SLD gets involved in  are cadre issues. Why speak about meetings that are not held  because one does not have any influence on their organization?  Why announce the names of deputy prime ministers who have not  been nominated? What sense does it make to make retorts to the  Belweder if there are serious doubts about the possibilities of  making them?    I am writing these words with sorrow; however, I am  beginning  to fear that there may arise the impression of defensiveness and  decreasing efficiency. The SLD could have been wrong when it  did not bear responsibility for the state. Today the risk and  the cost of even an accidental mistake are enormous, and the  limit of mistakes has already been reached.    The subject that should be thought over are relations within  the coalition. One can sometimes get the impression that the  electorates of the PSL and the SLD are closer to one another  than its leaders are. That is better than the other way around  because, in this way, a strong foundation for lasting  cooperation between the two groupings, independent of any  temporary tendencies, is being created. The PSL-SLD coalition  is not the exclusive property of politicians who can do anything  they want with it. It is an indirect expression of the will of  millions of voters, the property of the people who have elected  such a parliament. One has to bear this in mind if one wants to  respect the electorate and the social groups that sympathize  with the coalition.    Nevertheless, relations in the highest places between the  PSL  and the SLD are far from expectations. It started with the  submission of a composition of the government that was different  from the one that had been agreed on. Then came the statement  that the SLD would really prefer an alliance with the Democratic  Union, and then it really started....    Some of the misunderstandings definitely result from the  lack  of understanding of the partner's uniqueness, sometimes from the  lack of sufficiently acceptable information channels, sometimes  from the manipulation of the media unfavorably disposed toward  the coalition. At any rate, a breakthrough is needed--something  like a declaration of goals and intentions that would begin with  the words "the two parties hereby decide to speak about each  other favorably."    Tensions within the coalition exert a destabilizing  influence  on the entire political configuration and fuel the activeness of  the centers that aim to weaken or break it. If this really  happened, we would all lose the possibility of winning the  four-year period of Poland's stabilization, Poland would lose  its credibility, and internal and external conditions of its  socioeconomic development would be more acute. If the coalition  fell apart, no new effective parliamentary majority would be  formed. The instability of a minority government would lead to  early parliamentary elections, which would weaken both the SLD  and the PSL.    Therefore, a minimum of programmatic order should be defined  and observed; it might come down to the following goals:    1. Adopting and implementing a three-year socioeconomic  program for the country's development.    2. Ensuring a full four-year term of parliament and the  coalition government.    3. Approving the constitution before the presidential  election.    4. Reaching a coalition agreement in the presidential  election.    5. Holding the elections for local self-governments in the  period defined by the Constitution.    Aside from strategic points, the coalition's program of  cooperation should also include practical and short-term goals  concerning the aspirations and expectations of millions of  Poles--that is, rapid implementing the program of the National  Investment Funds; amending the Labor Code; adopting laws that  constitute the Pact on Enterprise; implementing a mass housing  construction program; improving the citizens' security;  implementing large-scale economic projects, such as the  construction of highways, and so on.    Even though it is acting in complex circumstances, the  coalition is not defenseless. It has at its disposal the  capital of many election votes and sustained social support.    The concord between the PSL and the SLD may curb the  destructive activities of the coalition's opponents; lack of  crevices and cracks makes it impossible to broaden them. The  understandable dissatisfaction of many Polish families with  their living standards does not have to be the fuel for  "Solidarity." As social research proves, people do not believe  that the activities of this union are a hope for an improvement  of everyday life. We can also see the reorientation of the  West, for which a stable Poland and a lasting, predictable  government create the conditions for serious investments and for  economic recovery in this part of Europe.    On whom, then, does the further development of the situation  depend? It depends on ourselves.</p>

It is not alone in this, at a time of recession in Europe. But  economic difficulties are hitting the Spanish particularly hard,  with, for instance, an estimated 23 per cent or more unemployed.    At the same time the socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez  has been weakened politically. The socialist party (PSOE)  emerged as the winner in last June's general election, in spite  of expectations that it would be overtaken by the conservative  Partido Popular (PP) [People's Party], but it lost the overall  majority in parliament it had held since 1982.    Senor Gonzalez tried to form a coalition with two  nationalist  parties, Convergencia i Unio (CiU) [Convergence and Union] of  Catalonia and the Partido Nacional Vasco (PNV) [Basque National  Party] of the Basque country, with which he would have commanded  a permanent majority, but this proved impossible. So he now  heads a minority government which needs to win support from  elsewhere for each of its legislative measures.    For the parties of the opposition, all this implies that  after being in power for nearly 12 years, the socialists are  approaching the end of the line. Jose Maria Aznar, leader of  the PP, told THE TIMES that though in the end his party had not  won last Junes election, it had increased its votes from  5,200,000 to 8,200,000. It made its appeal to the young,  particularly professionals and townspeople in general, and was a  clear alternative to the socialists.    Inaki Anasagasti, parliamentary leader of the PNV, talked of  "the end of an epoch," and said that Senor Gonzalez, the  towering figure in Spanish politics since 1982, was "tired."    This is not the way the socialists see it, however, and,  faced with an admittedly difficult situation, they are fighting  back confidently. Narcis Serra, the deputy prime minister, who  is himself a Catalan, said there were signs that Spain was  emerging from recession. "Statistics for the second half of  1993 show a change in the trend," he told THE TIMES. "There  won't be a sudden change for the better, but we are slowly  getting out."    Spanish companies were improving their profits, Senor Serra  said, interest rates were still going down, and the favourable  exchange rate for the peseta, after three devaluations, was  helping the growth of exports. If other European countries  picked up, so would Spain.    Senor Serra conceded that having only a minority government  made things more difficult, but claimed that the results so far  were "not bad." The government had received the support of the  CiU and the PNV for austerity measures in the budget for 1994,  adopted last autumn; and this was followed by an overwhelming  parliamentary majority last month, including the PP, for an  important series of reforms to the laws on employment.    Other reforms were either under way or planned, Senor Serra  said, with two overall aims: to allow companies to become more  competitive without reducing the number of employees, and to  adjust the Spanish labour market to wider European conditions.    The underlying question is whether the government will have  the will, and the political muscle, not just to pull Spain out  of recession, but to carry through some fundamental reforms that  are thought to be needed if the Spanish economy is to become  competitive in the European Union. Since democracy returned to  Spain after the death of General Franco in 1975, the overriding  aim of all Spanish governments has been to overcome the  backwardness and isolation the country had known for many years;  and with the rapid growth of the 1980s there were hopes of  achieving that.    The onset of recession has revealed continuing weaknesses,  however, and steps have been taken to address them. One was the  rigidity of the employment laws, some not so different from  those of the Franco era. The new legislation is designed to  improve that by, for instance, allowing for part-time  employment, and the taking on of young people as apprentices at  lower wage levels, and in general making it easier to hire and  fire.    For the moment, difficulties have been crowding in on the  socialists thick and fast. In December, Promocion Social de  Viviendas, a housing cooperative run by the Union General de  Trabajadores (UGT) [General Workers Union], the big socialist  trade union confederation, collapsed; and this was followed by  the near-collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), Spain's  fourth-largest bank, leading to the dismissal of its board by  the Bank of Spain and the appointment of a new team.    On January 27, the UGT and the Comisiones Obreras [Workers  Commissions], the other main union confederation, called a  one-day general strike in protest against the new employment  legislation.    The strike slowed Spain down for a day, but it is not  expected to deter the government from its reform policies. It  reflected the differences between a socialist government that  has long been one of the most pragmatic and market-orientated in  Europe and its former supporters in the unions. These  differences are still being fought out inside the PSOE, where  Senor Gonzalez has tried to shake off the influence of the left,  and will come to a head at a party congress next month.    In the background is the age-old tension between Madrid and  the Spanish regions, whose most extreme manifestation is the  continuing, though weakened, terrorist campaign by Euskadi Ta  Askatasuna (ETA) [Basque Homeland and Liberty], the Basque  independence movement. The fact that the government is dependent  on support from the CiU and the PNV in parliament has given  moderate Catalan and Basque nationalists a greater degree of  leverage. Both parties are basically in sympathy with the  current reform moves, but have been pressing for the granting of  greater autonomous powers in return.    At Catalan insistence, a new arrangement for the funding of  the regions was agreed last autumn. This did not help the  Basques, however, and both Miquel Roca, parliamentary leader of  the CiU, and Senor Anasagasti want more. The Madrid government,  they say, has still not fully carried out the terms of their  original autonomy statutes, dating back to 1979.    There are significant differences between the Catalans, more  numerous and prosperous, and the Basques. Senor Roca points out  emphatically that the CiU is not a separatist party, and  sometimes gives the impression that the party's aim is, far from  secession from Spain, rather influence over the whole country.    Senor Anasagasti, on the other hand, caused a storm last  month by publicly protesting against a speech by King Juan  Carlos, made before a military audience, in which he made an  oblique, and mild, reference to regional differences. "The  diversity which enriches us," the King said, "must unite us  rather than separate us."    By tradition, statements by the King are not publicly  criticised in Spain, but Senor Anasagasti said that the speech  had been "neither balanced nor just," and this was followed by  fiery statements by other PNV leaders attacking the army and the  Guardia Civil, the paramilitary police.    Senor Anasagasti said later that his objection was  essentially to the audience before whom the King had spoken,  since the position of the King should not be based just on  "bayonets," but on the various constitutional bodies. He denied  it, but the assumption in other parties is that the PNV was  looking ahead to the regional election in the Basque Country  this autumn, when it does not want to be outflanked by the  extreme nationalists.    In its foreign policy, the Spanish government retains its  belief in closer integration in the EU [European Union], based  on the Maastricht Treaty and going beyond it. This is in spite  of recent difficulties in the exchange rate mechanism, which led  to the devaluations of the peseta, and the more general  disenchantment with the integration process.    Spain has demonstrated its greater involvement in  international affairs by sending troops to Bosnia, and taking  part in other United Nations operations in Angola and  Mozambique. Within the EU, it has pressed for more attention to  be paid to future tensions in North Africa, with its growing  populations and its political, religious and economic  difficulties.    Officials concede that as a result of recent difficulties in  the EU, and the recession, public enthusiasm for the process of  European integration has waned in Spain. But Senor Serra says  that enthusiasm would revive once the recession ended, and that  Spain continues to believe in monetary union. "Europe has to  deepen both its economic and its political union. That will  give Spain a stronger position."</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Mexican inflation at 13-year low MEXICO'S inflation rate slowed to 18.8 per cent in 1991, almost 5 points higher than the government's target, but still the lowest annual rate in 13 years. December's monthly inflation rate was 2.4 per cent, reflecting in part a 5.3 per cent increase in transport costs resulting from November's 55 per cent rise in leaded petrol prices. Over the year costs of transport, education, and housing and utilities increased by 29.8 per cent, 24.1 per cent, and 23.9 per cent respectively. Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, of the consultancy Grupo de Economistas y Asociados, attributes these increases to bottlenecks in the provision of some non-tradeable goods, and rises in government-controlled prices. The prices of food, clothes, consumer goods and other tradeable products rose less than the average, thanks partly to the roughly 10 per cent real appreciation of the peso against the US dollar during 1991. The government has made the reduction of inflation to single digits its principal economic goal this year and plans to run a budget surplus.</p>

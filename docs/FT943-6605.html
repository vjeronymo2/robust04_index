			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: The Borodin Quartet takes up Beethoven theme - Music in Edinburgh Just in case the moral seriousness of Beethoven looks as though it might make a heavy theme for a festival, Edinburgh has thrown in Chabrier as well. Whoever brought these two composers together certainly has a sense of humour, but at least the two together are providing variety. That a composer as well-known as Beethoven should have been chosen at all as a festival theme has been criticised in some quarters, which is hardly fair. Leaving aside the need to attract an audience, a big international festival like Edinburgh will always have to focus on composers who left great music across as wide a range of disciplines as possible, preferably including opera as well as orchestral and solo music. Beethoven fits the bill - just. His weak area was opera, but the festival director, Brian McMaster, neatly side-stepped that problem by offering a 'Fidelio day' that widened our view of Beethoven's experience in opera to take in the years of struggle and re-writing during which Fidelio was born. The rest of Edinburgh's Beethoven is less adventurous. Assorted pianists are offering piano sonatas and all nine of the symphonies are being performed by sundry orchestras, both period and modern. No attempt to be dogmatic about performance style there. For the string quartets, the Borodin String Quartet has monopolised the field. The Borodin is of course, a modern-instrument quartet. (Although period orchestras are making notable headway with Beethoven, period chamber groups have had less success; perhaps four period strings just sound too thin and scratchy in our present-day recital halls.) There need never be any complaint about tonal blend when the Borodin is playing. Over nearly 50 years, and despite changing its personnel on the way, this quartet has maintained an admirably civilised tone quality, second to none for subtlety. Its Beethoven mornings in the Queen's Hall this year were far removed from the Lindsay's strenuous, abrasive combat or the Emerson's hard-edged intelligence, but perhaps that was half the problem. Of their five programmes, I attended two. The early quartets - Op. 18, Nos 4 and 5 - were playful in the gallant manner, elegant court games, not Beethovenian rough-and-tumble. The sforzandos needed a tougher attack.  In the A Major's slow movement one of the variations was nevertheless marvellously rapt. Of the two mature quartets, the concise Op. 95 held together better than Op. 130, which passed through some finely cultivated passages without suggesting it had any decisive goal in mind. Trenchant Beethoven playing only firmly took the stage with the Grosse Fuge, a challenge to which all four players roused themselves with fire in the belly. That performance drew enough applause to warrant an encore. The Borodin Quartet is among Edinburgh's favourites: hopefully it will be back next year, whatever the theme. The Queen's Hall recitals were sponsored by the Bank of Scotland; and Fidelio by the Royal Bank of Scotland</p>

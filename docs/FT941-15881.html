			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / IMF persuades French Africa to go for growth: The CFA bloc's devaluation will ensure the adjustment needed for revival The 13 French-speaking countries of west and central Africa finally bit the bullet on Tuesday night and agreed to depreciate their common currency, the CFA franc, by 50 per cent against the French franc to pull their economies out of deep recession. Described by an economist as the 'most foretold and least well prepared devaluation in economic history', it came after two days of often acrimonious wrangling between African leaders and the International Monetary Fund, abetted by France, in Dakar, the Senegalese capital. It is the first parity change since 1948 for the CFA (Communaute Financiere Africaine) franc, which is now worth one French centime. The distant Comores Islands in the Indian Ocean have devalued their CFA franc by one third. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director who was in Dakar to press for devaluation, said in Paris yesterday that at the outset many of the African leaders thought they were being asked to make 'a leap into the void without a parachute', but were subsequently convinced that devaluation would promote 'a dash for growth', with the accompanying aid provided by the IMF, World Bank and France. The IMF chief expressed confidence in the CFA franc's new parity, whose change would produce the external adjustment necessary to the franc zone's revival. France said it would continue to guarantee the convertibility of CFA francs which, along with fostering regional integration, is the aim of the franc zone. In a joint statement, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur also said France 'will not fail to show its solidarity with its (CFA) partners' by, for instance, forgiving FFr25bn (Pounds 2.87bn) worth of their debts to it. The Balladur government denies it imposed devaluation on the CFA countries, acknowledging only that in its tougher financial attitude abroad as well as at home it had recently made clear to CFA countries that they could no longer expect France to top up their budgets, unless they reached agreements with the IMF. But this is a pro-forma distinction, since Paris knew well the IMF's strong preference for CFA devaluation. The package of measures to support the devaluation includes: The IMF will provide aid worth *something in here (HP) * Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.01bn-Pounds 1.14bn) over the next three or four years, Mr Camdessus said. This would initially take the form of standby credits because, being quicker to negotiate, they would more rapidly unlock other credit possibilities and pave the way to possible debt rescheduling. But thereafter the 10 poorest CFA countries would be able to draw on the IMF's 'enhanced structural adjustment facility' at a 0.5 per cent rate of interest repayable over 10 years. To soften the impact of higher prices for imported staples, particularly on the poorest, the IMF would approve subsidies on some basic goods like bread, vegetable oil, rice or even petrol out of the CFA countries' budget revenues which were expected to rise, Mr Camdessus said. The World Bank will step up its lending, partic-ularly to education and health. For the 10 poorest CFA countries, France is to forgive all of the FFr6.6bn of bilateral aid debt which it did not cancel in 1989. Paris is also cancelling half, or FFr18.4bn, of the aid debt that the four relatively richer countries - Gabon, Cameroon, Congo and Ivory Coast - owe it. In addition, France is to set up a FFr300m 'special development fund', to which it hopes the European Union and World Bank will contribute and with which Paris intends to help the urban poor in CFA countries. 'We hope that other creditor governments in the Paris Club (which deals with the rescheduling of official debt) will give CFA countries the best terms,' said a French official yesterday. Clearly, France is willing to pay a price to keep the franc zone going. The cost to the Bank of France of converting CFA francs into French ones on demand is minimal, because the arrangement is backed by the requirement that CFA countries keep 65 per cent of their hard currency reserves with the French central bank. The Bank of France pays market rates on these deposits and charges market rates on any CFA borrowings. Nor is cancelling the debt of the 10 poorest countries a big sacrifice; it might never have been recovered. But the much larger cancelled debt of the four richer countries might one day have been repaid. France's private sector will also pay a price. 'The shock wave of the CFA devaluation for French investors could reach FFr10bn this year,' complained the head of the Council of French Investors in Africa in a letter yesterday to Mr Balladur. Yet such sacrifices are small beer compared to the 40 per cent drop in real per capita income suffered by the inhabitants of the franc zone since the mid-1980s. A World Bank report prepared for the Dakar meeting comments that 'the only other region of the world experiencing an economic decline of comparable magnitude is the former Soviet Union'. While in 1970-85 output and exports grew faster and inflation was lower in the CFA zone than in the rest of Africa, the trends reversed dramatically thereafter. Internally, CFA governments continued to spend too much on their public sectors and civil servants, while externally the terms of their trade worsened with their currency tied to a French franc itself trying to hold fast to the D-Mark. The World Bank and IMF have privately pointed to the 'silent crisis' caused by the increasing over-valuation of the currency. By the end of the decade, average government and manufacturing wages relative to average incomes, in Senegal for example, were three to six times higher than in Indonesia or Ghana. Last year Mr Ishrait Husain, chief economist in the World Bank's Africa department, published a study in which he compared the economic performance of the CFA countries with 14 countries which have pursued structural adjustment in the 1980s. Between 1986 and 1991 the appreciation of the CFA franc and subsequent losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average of 0.2 per cent a year. But GDP in the other 14 African countries which the Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an average 4.5 per cent a year over the same period. The losses were not evenly shared, however. The gainers were civil servants and students whose salaries and grants consumed an increasing majority of CFA governments' dwindling budgets. The losers were the rural masses whose incomes from agricultural production dwindled while access to primary education and health remained low. The World Bank and IMF say the devaluation was needed to sharpen the incentives for exporters and raise the incomes of poor farmers. But, in the short-term, the immediate sharp rise in import prices will aggravate rising labour unrest among civil servants and urban dwellers in West and Central African states, many of whom already have trouble meeting wage bills because of falling tax revenues. Cameroon's civil service has already been paralysed for a month by a strike over a 50 per cent wage cut announced last November. Some 55,000 secondary school teachers have been on strike since the end of November and many state hospitals are closed or maintaining only emergency cover. Magistrates went on strike at the beginning of the year. Further north, in landlocked Niger, the government closed Niamey university last Friday after students hurling stones and petrol bombs fought riot police. The students' grants have not been paid for eight months. In January 1993 the university cancelled teaching for the academic year because of lack of funds. The contrast with the tendency for neighbouring anglophone countries to devalue frequently has been felt in both exports and imports. Cheap imports from Nigeria have flooded into the CFA zone, while Ghanaian pineapples have edged those of the Ivory Coast out of the European market. 'Devaluation will bring instantaneous benefits to the Ivory Coast,' says Mr Cheikh Ibrahim Fall of the African Development Bank in Abidjan. 'Exports revenues will increase, farmers' incomes will rise and the government will have more cash to pay its domestic debt. . . But I am not convinced of the long-term benefits, if devaluation is not accompanied by other reforms.' Mr Camdessus sees signs of a new seriousness to reform and to integrate the CFA zone, particularly in the African leaders' pledge in Dakar to meet every six months to review their imminent IMF agreements. 'The CFA zone has been just a monetary arrangement. Now we may see some genuine economic convergence within it.'</p>

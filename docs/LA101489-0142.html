			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST;  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> HOMES DEVELOPMENT VOTE PLANNED TODAY  </P> <P> The City Council will hold a special meeting today to vote on plans for a  355-home development on a portion of the old Hellman Ranch, the site of a  former wetlands.  </P> <P> The meeting is at 3:30 p.m. at Seal Beach City Hall, 211 8th St.  </P> <P> Members of the local Wetlands Restoration Society want development banned from  portions of the site, located north of Pacific Coast Highway and west of Seal  Beach Boulevard, where they hope 100 acres of former wetlands will be restored.  </P> <P> In its proposal, the Newport Beach-based Mola Development Co. promises to  restore 26 acres of degraded wetlands on the property and expand them to 36  acres. As part of the restoration, Mola will return tidal flow to the wetlands  and replant native flora, making it again a viable habitat for local and  migratory birds, the company has said.  </P> <P> However, the society disputes such claims, saying the wetlands will be spurned  by birds because of the close proximity of homes.  </P> <P> If the council approves the project, the plan would go to the state Coastal  Commission, the final authority. The commission is scheduled to hear the  proposal during the week of Nov. 13.  </P> <P> In 1988, the commission rejected Mola's previous plan for 770 homes and a golf  course on the property because it infringed on six acres of wetlands.  </P></p>

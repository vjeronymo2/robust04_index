			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Speculation hits Belgian franc PRESSURE for lower European interest rates and a wave of speculative sellling hit the Belgian and French francs yesterday. Sterling also suffered as a result of disappointing statistics on inflation and industrial production, writes Peter John. The Belgian franc spiked lower against the D-Mark in early European trading as one large investor was said to have sold the currency very heavily. The trade was apparently sparked by a report from a US financial consultancy which painted a very grim picture of the Belgian economy. A number of dealers said the selling might have been carried out by Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, which played a large part in the forced exit of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism last year. Mr Soros has become something of a market bogeyman and whether he was involved or not the currency continued to be held back by what one dealer described as 'genuine commercial selling'. The Bank of Belgium intervened sporadically and maintained the currency around BFr21.90 to the D-Mark. The currencyclosed at BFr21.89, down from BFr21.78 at the close of trading on Tuesday. Economists said the market would remain concerned at least until there is some news next week on the Belgian government's social pact - a consensus on how to improve companies' competitiveness, reduce labour costs and create jobs. Also causing investor concern are Belgium's huge national debt and lingering worries that Luxembourg might decouple its currency from the Belgian franc. The selling spilled over to the French franc which fell sharply as lower overnight money rates provided signals that the Bank of France may be more kindly disposed to lower interest rates. Also, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the minister for the economy, said a weaker franc over the past year had been a key fact for stimulating growth. The French franc closed at FFr3.5290 against the D-Mark, down from FFr3.5120. In the UK the spectre of inflation without growth was raised by the announcement of rising inflationary pressures at the retail level and lower than expected manufacturing output. The pound fell sharply against a strong D-Mark - hitting DM2.4361 at one stage - and also against the dollar. However, it was revived by a spurt of buying from the Middle East and recovered from a low of Dollars 1.5195 to Dollars 1.5220. Against the German currency, it closed at DM2.4420, slightly down on the day. The dollar staged a brief rally early in the day as some dealers decided that it had fallen far enough and they were picking up a bargain. It moved back through DM1.60 to close at DM1.6035 against the D-Mark, up from DM1.5960, but there was little volume to back up the rise. The market is waiting for tomorrow's data on September retail sales and producer prices.</p>

Some 350 enterprises, already registered as open  joint-stock companies, passed through municipal and all-Russian  check auctions last year. A real basis has therefore been  created for a second securities market.    Mikhail Manevich, chairman of the Committee for Municipal  Property Management (KUGI) of the municipal council, informed us  that out of 854 -- the total number of enterprises subject to  privatization -- the documents for 487 were examined and  approved at KUGI. In the course of last year, check auctions  were intensive (held several times a month) in the city, and  5,328,545 vouchers were accumulated at them. This amount exceeds  the number of inhabitants in the city. Since we know that not  all the Petersburg citizens have parted with their vouchers yet,  this means that there is a process of drawing in checks from  other regions. This makes it possible to draw a conclusion as to  how attractive Petersburg's enterprises are to potential  shareholders.    An analysis of the choices of privatization variants in 1993  reveals the following picture: over 120 enterprises preferred  the first variant, 330 liked the second and 15 were privatized  according to the third variant. In a percentage ratio, choice of  the first variant of privatization (the most "capitalistic") was  higher in Petersburg than in other regions of Russia.    Investment marts (a constituent link to privatization  complexes) began only last year. There are no grounds as yet for  talking about their mass success. Manevich thinks that the  reason why investors do not display the desired activity at the  marts is the lack of high-quality business plans worked out in  detail. Nevertheless, as an example of the successful holding of  investment marts, he mentioned the experience of the Samson  Meat-Processing Combine Joint Stock Company and of the 5th Dairy  Combine, in which the well-known Parmolat firm acquired a block  of shares. Re-outfitting these production facilities with modern  equipment had already yielded results in the form of new meat  and dairy products. According to plans approved in KUGI, another  10 investment marts will be held in Petersburg in the next two  months. Specialists feel that marts like these are the optimal  variant for changing the form of ownership and are really  contributing to drawing funds into the production sphere.    Petersburg's leading position is established not only by its  quantitative indicators, but also by the "running-in" of new  investment schemes. The charter documents of a number of  enterprises specify a 50-percent increase in charter capital  after part of the investment programs are fulfilled. An investor  acquiring 20 percent of the shares in alliance with the  initiative group of enterprise workers, actually turns out to be  the owner of the controlling block.    Almost a year's experience in carrying out "large-scale"  privatization in Petersburg makes it possible to speak of  certain special features in it, and of the general stabilization  of the privatization process. One stabilizing factor is the  presence of a legislative state and normative-regional base,  lacking at the start of privatization. Among the special  features is the appearance of a competitive market in  Petersburg. Today the owner of a voucher can choose from  enterprises producing goods of the same description and invest  in its stock. A second feature is the appearance of really  active investment institutions: banks, brokerages and financial  investment companies. A third feature lies in the change in the  psychological climate surrounding the process of privatization.  While at the beginning of last year, notes Manevich, the  associates of KUGI and the municipal property fund had to  convince enterprise directors and workers of the advantages and  need for shareholding, the picture is now just the opposite.  Representatives of enterprises are pressing KUGI to be included  in the privatization plan. Moreover, practical experience in  stock-holding increasingly proves the inefficiency of the second  variant of privatization, according to which the controlling  block of shares should theoretically belong to the work  collective. In reality, the shares are bought from the workers  by outside parties, and the enterprise loses control over the  production and also the possibility of attracting sound  investors.    Privatization of privatization itself has become another  special feature. A system is forming in Petersburg of check  auctions being held, not by a property fund, but on the  instructions of banks, financial-investment companies or other  middlemen. In this way, separation of the privatization process  from the state is observed.    Mikhail Manevich also noted that the method, adopted at the  start of privatization, of evaluating the property of an  enterprise by the residual value has proven itself and has not  affected the sale of stocks. Nevertheless, despite the widescale  distribution of privatization, it is still too early to talk  about the economic efficiency of enterprises which have changed  the form of ownership. Investment marts, which must be regarded  as post-privatization support of enterprises, are still in store  for many of them.    The formation of the municipal program of privatization-94  is  ending in Petersburg. Since, according to the federal program of  privatization-94, the functions and powers of the regions are  expanded, the Petersburg program has its own special features.  In particular, privatization according to the first variant only  is permitted for hotels. The allotting of a "golden share" for  the state is specified in the privatization of publishing and  printing enterprises and book traders. One must also include  among the special features the permission to buy up built-in and  added-on facilities, for which long-term lease contracts are  concluded according to the results of competitions and auctions.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European Court to rule on quota compensation The European Court is being asked to decide whether the British government should set up a scheme to force tenant farmers to compensate landowners when they transfer European Union livestock quotas elsewhere. A judicial review sought by the Country Landowners Association, which says holdings can become uncommercial if farmers transfer or sell quotas on giving up the land, yesterday transferred the case to the European Court. This could mean a delay of up to 18 months before it is heard.</p>

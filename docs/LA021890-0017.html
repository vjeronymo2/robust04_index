			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT SCULPTURE  </P> <P> Abbot Kinney, the founder of Venice, once dreamed of building palaces in this  seaside community. Now, a few blocks from the beach, architect Ted Tokio Tanaka  has created a cluster of residences that might have fit Kinney's dream.  </P> <P> Behind an impressive facade of cut-out arches and pediments and a fretted roof  line are four 2,200-square-foot condominiums that deftly combine style, privacy  and light. The style is bold: symmetrically arranged geometric shapes in white  stucco as simple and engaging as a child's building blocks. Privacy is achieved  through layering: The living room is set behind the cut-out facade and an inner  wall of glass brick, features that let in lots of light and frame nearby palm  trees while shielding the residents from the street. The units face southwest,  but so deep are the windows that sunlight is diffused and softened. Even in the  afternoon, when the sun is high, sharp edges dissolve. Patterns play across the  walls and black concrete floor until the whole interior becomes a light  sculpture.  </P> <P> Most impressive of all is the versatility of the space. Within a 30-foot height  limit, Tanaka has designed six split levels. At the rear is sunken parking,  with two small bedrooms stacked on top. In front is a double-height living  room, an entry hall framed by an inset patio and a semi-open kitchen, with a  steel-balustraded mezzanine gallery above. Most of the second floor is occupied  by the master bedroom and a spacious balcony overlooking the street.  </P> <P> Only one thing is missing: the canals that Kinney dug and city officials later  filled in. How delightful it would have been to arrive at this Venetian palazzo  in a gondola.  </P></p>

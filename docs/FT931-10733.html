			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: Dow breaks through to brave new heights - Wall Street THE BULLS were firmly in command of Wall Street this week, and many analysts think their charge is far from over. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finally broke through to an all-time peak on Thursday, topping the record 3,413.21 reached on June 1 last year, when it closed at 3416.74. However, the Dow was only playing catch-up with two broader market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and Nasdaq index of smaller stocks, which have been setting records. The Nasdaq index has risen more than 20 per cent since early October, underlining Wall Street's traditional enthusiasm for small stocks in the early stages of an economic recovery. The Dow, which tracks 30 of the country's largest companies, has risen by only around 9 per cent since, held back by the large representation in its ranks of cyclical stocks. Their performance tends to track the rise and fall of the economy, and the problems facing some of its best-known constituents, notably International Business Machines and General Motors. The Dow's move into new territory this week was sparked by good economic news both at home and abroad. The overseas contribution came on Thursday when both the the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan lowered interest rates, raising hopes of a revival in the flagging global economy. In the US, a string of statistics bolstered the belief that the economy is headed for much more robust growth. January retail sales were stronger than expected as the Christmas consumer splurge continued into the New Year. The index of leading economic indicators jumped 1.9 per cent in December, the biggest rise since 1983. Yesterday's employment report for January was reasonably positive, with non-farm jobs rising by 106,000, in line with Wall Street expectations, but not good enough for it to cause appreciable inflationary anxiety in the bond market. The most positive statistic of the week was the 2.7 per cent jump in US productivity in 1992, the largest gain in 20 years. This followed five years in which productivity growth averaged some 0.5 per cent and provides further evidence that the US economy is emerging from recession much leaner and more competitive, which bodes well for profitability. This new vigour has also shown through in the financial reporting season, which is nearly over. Based on results so far, analysts say operating earnings were up 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with the same period of 1991, and they expect further strong rises as companies benefit from the recovering economy. All this helped the Dow's great leap forward this week. Other factors may have included greater overseas interest in US stocks, caused by the economic revival and the strengthening dollar. Furthermore, long bond yields have at last started moving strongly downwards. This week yields rose a little in response to the economic news, but this was offset by an announcement from the federal government that it will cut the volume of new 30-year bonds it sells next week, and is weighing a more permanent reduction in long-bond sales. The stock market's rally may take a pause now, but many analysts believe the extremely heavy volume of the past week, coupled with the movement by investors into big, cyclical stocks, shows an underlying momentum that could carry the Dow 200 or more points higher over the next few months. A substantial change in the interest rate cycle to tighter money could choke the rally, but this still seems a long way off, and for now the US markets are enjoying a benign world of low interest rates, low inflation and healthy economic growth. That said, there are still plenty of companies facing huge problems, and none more so than General Motors, which is struggling to return its loss-making north American operations to the black. This week it suffered a further spate of bad news, including a ruling by an Atlanta court that it had to pay Dollars 105m in accident damages because of the design of a controversial truck. GM is appealing, but the case could lead to even heavier financial liabilities for the company. Standard &amp; Poor's, a leading credit information agency, also downgraded GM's debt rating, while giving a boost to that of its once-ailing Detroit rival Chrysler. However, even GM's bad news had a positive side. S&amp;P said the company's new top management would return GM's north American operations at least to break-even and said further downgradings were 'unlikely' over the next few years.  ----------------------------------------- Monday      3332.18   +   22.15 Tuesday     3328.67   -    3.51 Wednesday   3373.79   +   45.12 Thursday    3416.74   +   42.95 Friday      3442.14   +   25.40  -----------------------------------------</p>

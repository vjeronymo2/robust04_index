			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HOLLYWOOD HARRISON  </P> <P> After years of trying, Hollywood has finally brought one of Jim Harrison's  novels to the screen. It's Columbia's just-out "Revenge," starring Kevin  Costner, which Harrison began scripting 11 years ago just after its  publication.  </P> <P> "I think I wrote about 12 different endings to it," says Harrison, noting that,  originally, John Huston was going to direct Jack Nicholson in the project. Then  it went to Orson Welles. And then . . . "I lost interest for a long time."  </P> <P> Costner and producer Ray Stark revived the project about a love triangle  (Costner, Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Quinn) that leads to violence -- and  brutal revenge. Tony Scott directs from a script by Harrison and Jeffrey  Fiskin.  </P> <P> "They pretty much shot the novella," says Harrison, who saw a print shipped to  Northern Michigan, his home. "I was so swept away by it that I cried -- I  really did. And I'm not known for crying." (He's known more for his macho  style, on and off the page.)  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a host of projects -- based on Harrison's novels -- are percolating,  including:  </P> <P> * "The Man Who Gave Up His Name" and "Farmer," with Sydney Pollack's Mirage  Prods.  </P> <P> * "Legends of the Fall," recently purchased by film maker Ed Zwick and Tri-Star  Pictures. Bill Witliffe is adapting.  </P> <P> * "A Good Day to Die," with a French company, Compagne Production  International.  </P> <P> As to how Harrison gets along with Hollywood: "As a farmer, I come from a long  generation of horse traders. It's not all that much different." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE UPSETS USD, DEPRIVES EGAN OF 100TH VICTORY  </P> <P> The comments were loud, clear and to the point. They were not the comments of a  happy coach.  </P> <P> Hank Egan, in his seventh year as coach at the University of San Diego, had a  chance Friday night against Cal State Northridge to win his 100th game. He did  not.  </P> <P> Northridge upset USD, 83-73, in front of 368 at the Matador Gymnasium, a  facility a group of students are trying to get renamed the Matadome since the  Matadors (2-6) are 2-0 in the building since becoming a Division I member this  season.  </P> <P> "I thought the other team played very well," said Egan, who was visibly upset.  "They outhustled us. They outexecuted us. They ran their stuff. They played  like a team.  </P> <P> "We did none of the above. Absolutely NONE of the above. At ANY time. We had no  consistency tonight."  </P> <P> Pete Cassidy, coach of the Matadors for 20 seasons, was asked if he was  surprised his team won so handily. His reply: "I think so . . . no, what am I  saying? I know so."  </P> <P> Behind the three-point shooting of Kyle Kerlegan, who finished with a team-high  18 points, and the slicing and driving antics of point guard Andre Chevalier,  who scored nine of his 16 points in the second half, Northridge began taking  control of a tight game 4:05 into the second half.  </P> <P> That's when Kerlegan made his second consecutive three-pointer to begin a 25-7  run that didn't end until the Matadors led, 67-52, with 9:10 left. Kerlegan  added the fourth of his five three-pointers and two free throws during the run.  </P> <P> "We've been humiliated on the road," said Cassidy, whose team was winless on  the road and had allowed more than 100 points in five road games. "And I have  some guys with tremendous pride. We were tired of being humiliated."  </P> <P> USD made a 15-5 run to pull to 72-67 after a three-pointer by Michael Brown  with 3:42 left but could not get any closer. The Toreros then missed shots,  turned over the ball and had shots blocked just like in the first part of the  game.  </P> <P> "I didn't look at the schedule and think this was going to be a cake walk. You  are the ones that have been saying that," said Egan, who directed some of his  frustration at the media. "I've said all along, this is a basketball team that  has to perform very well and together to be good. I've had a hole in my gut all  week about this game.  </P> <P> "But it is disappointing. This is as disappointed as I've been. Ever."  </P> <P> Each team missed its first three shots to set the tone for the first half. It  was ugly, perhaps even pathetic.  </P> <P> Oh, it was close, and therefore somewhat suspenseful, but only because neither  team could get anything going.  </P> <P> Neither team scored more than four points in a row in the first half, and  neither took a lead of more than four points.  </P> <P> USD took a 35-34 lead into the intermission. Fittingly, Kelvin Woods rebounded  his own miss and layed it back in for a 35-33 lead with 14 seconds left. The  Matadors had a chance to tie it five seconds later, but Chevalier missed the  second of two free throws.  </P> <P> The Toreros know all about missed free throws. USD, which made a season-low 50%  Monday in a 72-63 loss at UC Santa Barbara to fall to 60.7% on the season,  missed eight of 10 in the first half. USD made four of four in the second half,  but Northridge made 18 of 25 (72%) in the game.  </P> <P> The Toreros weren't much better from the field, making only 32 of 82 (39%)  shots, including 16 of 49 (33%) in the second half.  </P> <P> Center Dondi Bell led the Toreros with 18 points, followed by Pat Holbert with  17 and Anthony Thomas with 16.  </P> <P> USD has a week off before traveling to Eastern Washington next Saturday.  </P></p>

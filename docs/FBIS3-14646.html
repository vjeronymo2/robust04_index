			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, March 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed Tuesday [29 March] expressed  disappointment with the poor turnout of leaders at the ongoing  summit here of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries,  attended by only six of the heads of government.    The leaders of at least 10 nations had pledged to attend the  meeting, he told Malaysian journalists covering the summit.    Those attending the three-day meeting are Dr. Mahathir,  President Suharto of Indonesia, President Abdou Diouf of  Senegal, President Sani Abacha of Nigeria, President Robert  Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao of host  India.    Absent are the heads of government of Algeria, Brazil,  Chile,  Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. The incoming G-15  chairman, President Carlos Menem of Argentina, is scheduled to  be present on the last day of the meeting.    The absent leaders had cited, among other things, pressing  domestic problems as their reason for staying away.    Nevertheless, Dr. Mahathir said, the leaders who attended  were really serious about wanting to undertake all the  programmes of the grouping.    He also said that the meeting came up with a formula to get  around the insufficient quorum of attendance by requiring only  eight leaders to make up the quorum instead of the previous 10.    Of the eight, at least five must be heads of government  while  the other three must be acting, deputy or vice heads of  government, he added.    Dr. Mahathir said the decision would be made known to all  member nations.    Asked whether the absence of many of the heads of government  at the ongoing summit reflected their level of commitment to the  G-15, he said the majority of the leaders remained committed to  the grouping.    From the letters and the representatives, many of them  foreign ministers, sent by the leaders, I gather that there is  commitment.    Although some countries did not send any representative, six  nations sent top-level delegations. It is clear, therefore,  that the majority remain committed, he said.    Dr. Mahathir acknowledged that it was not easy to get all 15  heads of government to together [as received] at the same time.    On a suggestion for the summit to be held biennially, he  said  the majority of the leaders present at the ongoing meeting  seemed to want to retain the present annual session.</p>

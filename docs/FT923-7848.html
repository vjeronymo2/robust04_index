			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Baker appointed election chief: Bush calls on old friend to head campaign for the White House PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday finally called on Mr James Baker, his old friend and the US secretary of state, to pull his political chestnuts out of the fire. On August 23 Mr Baker will become White House chief of staff, the position he held in President Ronald Reagan's first term. Mr Bush, conceding that many Americans were 'anxious' about the future, said Mr Baker's prime task was to lay before the public a coherent set of domestic, foreign and economic policies for a second term in office. To this end he is being given sweeping powers over the campaign and policy, including supervision of the Middle East peace negotiations. The absence of coherence, combined with occasional hysteria in the Bush campaign, helps explain why Mr Bush is so far behind Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, in the polls. The deficit has narrowed little recently. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll out yesterday still had Mr Clinton ahead by 60 per cent to Mr Bush's 34 per cent, a lead only one point less than its previous survey. Mr Bush described Mr Baker as 'a committed trustee of the American interest' and 'the sort of man you want on your team'. That team is going to be reshaped by Mr Baker, who is bringing with him four trusted aides from the state department, including Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the spokeswoman, Mr Robert Zoellick, the economics expert, and Mr Dennis Ross, head of policy planning. Mr Baker replaces Mr Samuel Skinner, who is being shunted aside to the honorific job of general chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr Robert Teeter remains as nominal campaign chairman, but reporting to Mr Baker as well as to the president. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, Mr Baker's deputy, takes over as acting secretary of state. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said he would remain in his job, with Ms Tutwiler as an assistant, but he waved a hand with crossed fingers as he said so. He ducked questions about the future of other senior White House advisers, including, on domestic policy, Mr Clayton Yeutter. The transfer of Mr Baker, who left the treasury department four years ago to take over the Bush campaign, has been expected for a month. In anticipation, Mr Clinton and other leading Democrats have said that events in the Balkans, the Middle East and elsewhere make this the worst time for him to be withdrawn from control over foreign policy. Mr Clinton himself described Mr Baker as 'a talented man', adding: 'I think they want him back because they won with him before and they obviously are a little bit in disarray.' Preparations for the Republican convention in Houston next week are too far advanced for Mr Baker to change much. The party platform being drafted this week reflects the dominance of the right wing in both social and economic policies. But he can be expected eventually to rein in some of the wilder assaults on Mr Clinton and the Democrats. These have grown in virulence over the last week to a point that may be politically counterproductive. A recent target has been Mrs Hillary Clinton, portrayed by Mr Rich Bond, Republican national chairman, as a radical reformer who equates marriage with slavery. Mr Clinton has dismissed such assaults as 'pitiful' and 'pathetic'. Career man, Page 4</p>

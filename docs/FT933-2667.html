			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / They'll huff and they'll puff . . .: The whole Gatt edifice could be blown down if France vetoes the farm trade accord At the moment last year when European Community agriculture ministers came to vote on the long-awaited overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy, Mr Ray MacSharry, the former EC farm commissioner, gave the Portuguese chairman then in charge of the Council of Ministers precise instructions on how to face down a threatened Italian veto. 'You go in; you ring the bell, and whatever you do, you don't look up.' Italy was not convinced enough of its case to make a fuss as the endorsement went through. But the current French threat to veto Blair House - the EC-US farm trade accord reached last November in Washington and made possible by the CAP reform - is another matter. As Mr Jean Puech, the French agriculture minister, reminded France's EC partners on Wednesday, the farm trade imbroglio could lead to a full-blooded crisis in an already divided Community. The EC and its international trading partners need no reminding that Blair House is the foundation for hopes of building a successful world trade accord under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the mid-December deadline. If Blair House crumbles, it would almost certainly bring the whole edifice of the Round down with it. On Monday, therefore, foreign and agriculture ministers of the 12 meet in Brussels, in what will be a lengthy attempt to find out, first, what the French want, and second, to decide which demand can feasibly be pursued with the Americans. A majority of the member states, as well as the European Commission which negotiates trade deals on their behalf, rule out any reopening of Blair House. Washington already feels the EC got the better of the compromise, as its negotiators have made clear. But the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur made an electoral pledge earlier this year to veto Blair House if it was not renegotiated. This commitment went rashly beyond the previous Socialist administration's refusal to sanction the farm deal, until it saw what was on the other side of the Gatt ledger - such as openings in services and enhanced market access for manufactures, areas in which France is respectively the second- and fourth-largest world exporter. In essence, France opposes the accord's requirement to cut the volume of subsidised food exports by 21 per cent over six years, maintaining this will demand sacrifices of EC farmers beyond the severe price and production cuts agreed under CAP reform. The Blair House cuts, Paris insists, would destroy France's vocation exportatrice as the second-largest agricultural exporter after the US, and turn swathes of rural France into a wasteland. Isolated at first, Paris has pressured its partners into recognising it has a genuine political problem with its farmers, even if it is partly one of its own making. The French breakthrough came three weeks ago when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, presumably fearful of losing a Gatt deal, sundering the traditional Franco-German axis and sparking an EC crisis, offered France political cover by announcing that Germany too 'had problems' with Blair House. But since then, the EC side (including France), has tended to talk of 'refining', 'clarifying', 'amplifying' and 'interpreting' Blair House, rather than reopening it. The US for the most part has been eloquently silent. Amid the flurry of meetings, in Washington and across Europe, hopes are thus rising that it will be possible to accommodate France. 'I don't think there's that much room for manoeuvre, but there is some,' Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, said yesterday, warning, however, that 'there will be a cost to pay for concessions in agriculture'. Part of the problem is disentangling from the amorphous list of France's demands what are its strategic priorities and what is political window-dressing. 'In our experience, you have to distinguish between the battle cries and the strategic aims,' says a senior German official. 'They are not unrealistic people,' he adds, 'they know what is at stake.' France's strategic interest in agriculture is to get its and EC farm prices down to world market prices, impossible in the past because they were pegged to low levels of German productivity. This aim should be achieved by 1997, by when the CAP reform price and production cuts Paris initially opposed will have taken hold. Its underlying priority is to ensure this scenario is fulfilled with no additional pain for its farmers. For if it is, France will be one of the most competitive producers in the world, and free to export as much as it can without Blair House curbs. That is because at world price levels, export subsidies are redundant. France's shopping list reflects this aim. It includes: Freedom to shift the bulk of the 21 per cent volume cuts to the end of the six-year period, by when, if all goes well, they will not be required. 'I would say that is a contender,' Mr Steichen says. The Uruguay Round 'final act' spreads the cuts evenly over the six years, but that is a document still on the Gatt negotiating table; Blair House is vague on the matter. No export volume limits on food aid, current EC food stockpiles or value-added food products. Blair House places no restrictions on food aid, as Paris must well know. On stocks, a deal may be possible. But in any case, assuming a Gatt deal would not start until 1995, the production restraints in the CAP reform would by then have reduced the exportable food surplus well under the Blair House limits on subsidised exports. Grain stocks, now building up at half the rate of this time last year because of CAP reform, would be needed to fill the gap. Commission officials deem the added-value food products demand 'impossible', but point out that Blair House only covers 'primary processed products' like flour and cheese. 'Aggregation', meaning cuts applied to whole sectors rather than individual products, allowing France, say, to sell more cheese if it cut more than required on skimmed milk powder. 'Not realistic,' says Mr Steichen, given US rejection last year at Blair House. Guarantees that the export curbs will not deny the EC a share of any growth in the world food market, for example in China. This could be fudged since a growing market would raise world prices above EC target prices, freeing Europeans to exort without subsidy. Safeguards that export curbs would be relaxed in the event of large and sudden movements in prices and currency parities. The problem here is that the safeguards could cut both ways, working against the EC if these movements were in its favour. But Blair House already contains provision for higher EC tariffs on incoming food if the dollar weakens 10 per cent beyond a parity with the Ecu fixed by the accord. France's quest for greater protection against cheap US cereal substitutes like corn gluten, however, looks hopeless, since the provision for EC-US 'consultation' in the event of sudden surges was drafted by Chancellor Kohl's office, and France needs firm German support to get its deal. Extending the 'peace clause', under which the EC and US would refrain from unilateral action against each other, beyond the six-year timetable. 'That is a legitimate demand,' says Mr Steichen, widely shared by France's partners. On closer examination, therefore, a deal for France on agriculture may be attainable, especially as French demands become more polished by intensive diplomatic contact. 'I think the French now have a feel for how far they can go,' Mr Steichen says. Complications, however, could arise outside the Gatt farm chapter proper, most obviously if Paris insists the EC should have the means to trade sanctions similar to those under US '301' trade laws. Bonn strongly opposes such a move. Less tangibly, much will also depend on how the process is managed, particularly on the European side, by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, and by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general. 'A disaster as a result of an accident is more likely than a disaster because of immovable positions', judges one German diplomat, who adds that the key, on Monday, 'is not to give the French too much time'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Nikita </F> Yermakov and Igor Shchegolev]    [Text] Paris, 8 Jun -- Closer ties with the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], an organization  embracing 25 of the world's most developed countries, will make  a real contribution to Russia's integration with the world  economy. This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev in his address at the signing of a declaration on  cooperation between the Russian Federation and the OECD and an  agreement between the Russian Government and the OECD on the  granting of privileges and immunities for the organization  within the Russian Federation. The ceremony was held today at  the Paris headquarters of this international organization.    These documents "pave the way for the expansion of effective  cooperation between Russia and the OECD in the long term and the  mutually complementary interests of both countries," the  minister said. "Thanks to its material and natural resources,  Russia's involvement with the OECD will help to further enrich  trade, economic, scientific, technical, and intellectual  exchanges in the extensive Euro-Atlantic and Pacific region,"  the minister noted. He feels that these documents also provide  "further important evidence of the world community's support for  economic reforms in Russia."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commanders of the 1st, 3d, and 7th Corps of the  Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Vahid Karavelic,  Sakib Mahmuljin, and Mehmed Alagic -- met with Vitez Region  Commander Filip Filipovic at a command of the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina today. They met to discuss the  concretization of the military part of the agreement signed in  Washington. In an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding,  representatives of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]  expressed interest in implementing the details regarding the  formation of the joint Federal Army.    The effects of the truce signed between the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO on 25 February 1994  that have been achieved so far represent a good-quality basis  for realizing tasks issued by the Joint Command, and the regions  covered by the 1st, 3d, and 7th Corps, as well as the Vitez  Region are definitely important for their implementation in the  field. On this occasion, attention was also focused on the  joint activity of the forces of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO in the struggle against chetniks.  The commanders assessed that the talks today were extremely  successful.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Heseltine hails advances - The trade and industry secretary talks to Clive Cookson Michael Heseltine, secretary of state at the UK's Department of Trade and Industry, and chief sponsor of the R&amp;D Scoreboard, is delighted with the spending increase it shows this year. 'It is very encouraging that an area which has been a matter of some controversy and much concern is being addressed by the management of Britain's leading companies, despite very difficult trading conditions,' he says. 'But there is still some way to go to catch up with the world's best standards.' Heseltine believes the Scoreboard's R&amp;D comparisons around the world 'are valuable because they focus management's attention on the ingredients of international competitiveness. They are a broad indicator of what is possible, what the best are doing,' he says. The managers of most British companies are taking seriously the message that R&amp;D is important, according to Heseltine. 'That doesn't mean that all management is taking it seriously. This is indicative of what the best are doing. We should never let the people at the low end of performance off the hook,' he says. However, Heseltine refuses to discuss the performance of individual companies or condemn them for spending too little on R&amp;D. 'I would not seek to put my judgment as a politician - as a minister away from the hurly-burly of the capitalist world - into the minds of individual boards of directors. 'I don't believe in ministers laying down formulae for industrial success. There are too many exceptions. Just imagine the effect of a politician saying all companies should be spending X per cent of turnover on R&amp;D, and the consequence was that a significant proportion of companies upped their expenditure, went into loss and were taken over. Who would thank you?' Hanson may stand out for its low and declining R&amp;D spending but, Heseltine points out, 'it also stands out as a company with a quite remarkable success record'. At first sight, Heseltine's own department is not setting a good example in raising R&amp;D spending. According to the 1994 Forward Look at Government-funded Science and Technology, the DTI's net expenditure on science and technology is set to fall steadily from Pounds 500m in 1992-93 to Pounds 350m in 1996-97. Heseltine rejects that as 'facile criticism'. He says the fall results mainly from a reduction in nuclear research, coupled with increasing receipts from past expenditure on aerospace R&amp;D and changing arrangements for small business consultancy. At the same time, the DTI is shifting the balance of its innovation support away from generating new technology 'on which industry and government already spend billions', to concentrate more on 'influencing the broad environment which allows innovative firms to flourish'. That means cutting collaborative research projects and spending more on technology transfer and spreading the word about best practice. The R&amp;D Scoreboard itself is a small example of such activity. Of course, R&amp;D is only one ingredient in the overall process of innovation  - defined by the DTI as 'the successful exploitation of new ideas'. The DTI Innovation Unit is now tackling the greater challenge of drawing up an 'innovation index' which would take account not only of funds that companies put into R&amp;D but also the outcome. Measures might include patents, new products, even stock market valuations. Defining and quantifying these - and combining them into an index that would be acceptable to industry and useful for managers - pose formidable mathematical and econometric problems. Even so, two groups - Stoy Hayward consultants with Warwick University, and Imperial College - have drawn up practical proposals for an innovation index. DTI officials are now considering which approach to develop further, in consultation with industry. There is a reasonable chance that the innovation index will be ready for launch next year. Barring a corporate upheaval, Glaxo is certain to emerge as the leader of the 1995 UK R&amp;D Scoreboard. A more interesting subject for speculation is which company will emerge as the most innovative.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Salomon Bros lures Warburg director ONE of the three managing directors of SG Warburg's German operations is leaving the German arm of the UK investment bank to become a managing director of Salomon Brothers in Germany. The departure of Mr Nicholas Coulson follows the defection of Warburg's German highly-rated equity analyst team to Goldman Sachs earlier this year, combined with other difficulties in the German market, which is notoriously difficult for foreign financial institutions to penetrate. Mr Piers von Simson, head of Warburg's European investment banking activities, said that Mr Coulson's departure was 'part of the normal comings and goings of investment banking staff'. Mr von Simson said the departure was regretted. He said, however, that corporate finance relationships with German corporations would not be damaged since he had handled these personally from his base in London. Mr Coulson joined Warburg in London in 1984 and moved to the bank's German operations in 1990. In 1991 the bank established a wholly-owned German subsidiary to complement the acquisition of Berwein Wertpapierhandels- und Borsenmakler, Munich's leading specialist brokerage house in 1989. Warburg has won some large corporate finance mandates in Germany, for example advising the Treuhand, the east German privatisation agency, on its sale of Interhotel, the east German hotel chain. It won a high profile advising Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest insurance group, in its defence last year against what were then the unwelcome attentions of Assurances Generales de France. But Warburg's advice was not heeded and the two companies reconciled their differences. Warburg lost Pounds 11.6m (Dollars 17.8m) last year on the closure of the German arm of its Pallas Leasing Group, an important factor behind disappointing figures at the Warburg group last year. These leasing operations were not managed by Warburg's German subsidiary. Warburg is in the process of transferring its German operations, which employ over 60 people, from Munich to Frankfurt.</p>

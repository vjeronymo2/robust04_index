			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 25/4/1994 -- The prime  ministers of Romania, Nicolae Vacaroiu, and of the Great Duchy  of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, agreed in the talks they had  Monday, 25 April, on the need that the two countries extended  their bilateral cooperation, with a stress on the economic side.  The three-day visit to Romania of the delegation led by Premier  Santer is the first at this level since the two countries  established diplomatic ties in 1910.    Premier Vacaroiu communicated to his Luxembourg counterpart  his cabinet's surprise to find out that Romania was left out of  the community's crediting programmes for the development of  infrastructure networks and requested Luxembourg to help Romania  get access to such credit lines. Mr. Vacaroiu also asked for  Luxembourg's help, as acting president of the Western European  Union, for a non-discriminatory treatment by that body. The  Romanian prime minister also found useful for the sides the idea  of a joint bank to assist business people in both countries.    Prime Minister Santer promised to sustain closer business  and  financial ties with Romania, not only at a country-to-country  level, but also at the level of the European Investment Bank and  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in his  capacity of governor and chief of the exchequer. These bodies  should take, in his opinion, a more active part in financing  Romania's air and seaport projects and energy development  schemes, and said his country perfectly understood the adequacy  of non-discriminatory treatment of Romania in both the Council  of Europe and the Western European Union.    The prime minister of Romania asked his guest to convey the  grand duke of Luxembourg the invitation to visit Romania. In  his turn, Premier Santer invited his Romanian counterpart to be  the guest of Luxembourg, an invitation readily accepted.</p>

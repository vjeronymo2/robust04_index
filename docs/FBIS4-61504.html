			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Sten Sjostrom report from St. Petersburg] </F>   [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt today visited St.  Petersburg, where he met Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev. The most important question in the negotiations was the  withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries.    [Begin Bildt recording] I think there is a Russian will to  withdraw. We have had a dialogue around these questions and  other questions concerning the Baltic countries, and I believe  that this has been of importance, both for Russian policies and  for developments generally. [end recording]    Last week, the presidents of Russia and Latvia signed an  agreement on Russian troops withdrawing from Latvia on 31 August  at the latest. The Russian Army has already been withdrawn from  Lithuania, so the only remaining country now is Estonia. Prime  Minister Bildt has involved himself deeply in this matter, and  Estonia was also the main theme at the negotiations between  Bildt and Foreign Minister Kozyrev. A vital question is, what  sort of status the thousands of retired Russian military  personnel will have, people who often are not older than 40-50  years; Russia managed to sign a special agreement with Latvia  which will regulate their position in the society: They have  the right to stay in Latvia but they will not receive Latvian  citizenship. Estonia has refused point-blank to sign any  special agreement, and said that Russian military personnel will  be subject to the laws on citizenship and laws on aliens which  already exist. It looks, at least on paper, that it is Estonia  which right now is most actively stopping an agreement on  getting the troops to leave. So the question is, should Prime  Minister Bildt not be putting pressure on Estonia, instead of  Russia?    [Begin Bildt recording] No, I think such pressure should lie  mainly on the Russians, because it is Russia which has troops in  Estonia; it is not Estonia which has troops in Russia. It is a  fundamental principle in international law that one is not  allowed to have troops on the territory of other states without  the agreement of these states. There are a number of questions  which have been raised in connection with this from the Russian  side; those questions we will also try to solve, but they are  not allowed to be decisive; the withdrawal of the troops must be  completed by 31 August.

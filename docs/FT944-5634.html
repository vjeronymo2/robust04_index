			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Brothers triumph at Barr The rebel shareholders at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust yesterday claimed a costly victory in the family feud over the motor and leisure group, writes Richard Wolffe. The rebels, led by brothers Nicholas and Robert Barr, succeeded in their attempts to join the board in place of both the chief executive and finance director. The Barr brothers now share the boardroom with their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, whom they had earlier asked to stand down as chairman. At an extraordinary general meeting held in Leeds yesterday, the brothers voted to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, the finance director. However, the board said the rebels' campaign had cost the company about Pounds 1m in severance payments and extraordinary meetings - equivalent to more than 20 per cent of pre-tax profits last year. The Barr brothers, who speak for almost 30 per cent of ordinary voting shares, reaffirmed their intention to demerge the two divisions, and enfranchise the non-voting A shares. They also appointed their leisure industry adviser, Mr Helmut Schweimler, to the board. The boardroom coup follows the collapse of a compromise deal between the board and the rebels last weekend.</p>

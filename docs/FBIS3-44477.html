In an interview with XINHUA, he said that to meet the demand  of national economic reform and development in 1994, the reform  of the farm production structure must be enhanced so as to  ensure a steady increase in cotton, food and oil production.    He also said that efforts should be redoubled to accelerate  the development of stock breeding, aquatic and vegetable  production to provide more and better non-staple food for urban  people.    The development of township enterprises should be focused on  raising economic returns, he added.    Liu said that his ministry has made a decision to put into  full play the role of the ministry's macro economic control, by  strengthening the building of the information system, improving  the legal system, expanding capital construction and fostering a  contingent of people with farming technical skills.</p>

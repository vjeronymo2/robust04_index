			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PUC DECISION;  </P> <P> EX-SDG&amp;E DIRECTORS CAN TESTIFY ON MERGER ADVICE  </P> <P> Two former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. board members can testify about  legal advice that the board relied on when it approved a proposed $2.4-billion  merger with Southern California Edison, according to a state Public Utilities  Commission decision issued Tuesday.  </P> <P> The ruling runs counter to SDG&amp;E's claim that Charles (Red) Scott and O.  Morris Sievert, who resigned to protest the November vote, are prohibited from  discussing legal advice that has traditionally been treated as confidential  information. The utility unsuccessfully argued that the legal advice is covered  by the attorney-client privilege.  </P> <P> PUC Administrative Law Judge Edward W. O'Neill ruled Tuesday that SDG&amp;E's  attorney-client privilege evaporated shortly after the board vote, when an  SDG&amp;E executive gave a detailed analysis of the merger in a speech in  Phoenix.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Might Appeal Ruling  </P> <P> "I'm shocked and disappointed with the ruling," Jeff Guttero, SDG&amp;E  assistant general counsel, said Tuesday. "And I'm not exactly clear on what  (O'Neill) meant when he said that we'd waived the attorney-client  relationship."  </P> <P> Guttero told O'Neill on Tuesday that the utility might lodge an appeal with the  full PUC once a written decision is issued. It was unclear when O'Neill would  release a written decision.  </P> <P> If O'Neill's ruling stands, it will clear the way for the city of San Diego to  resume depositions with Scott and Sievert, both of whom have expressed doubts  about the quality of legal advice that SDG&amp;E's board received before the  vote.  </P> <P> During depositions earlier this year in San Diego, Scott and Sievert stopped  short of revealing the confidential legal advice. The two San Diego businessmen  instead agreed to honor SDG&amp;E's confidentiality request until the issue was  resolved by a PUC law judge.  </P> <P> "What happened today is an important decision," Robert Wright, Sievert's San  Diego-based attorney, said Tuesday. "Of course, it remains to be seen if  SDG&amp;E appeals to a higher level."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Haunt SDG&amp;E  </P> <P> Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San  Diego-based consumer group, said the ruling clears the way for Scott and  Sievert to resume testifying about information board members had when they  endorsed the proposed merger.  </P> <P> "The judge determined that whatever attorney-client privilege did exist  disappeared when (utility executive Stephen Baum) made that speech," Shames  said.  </P> <P> Shames also suggested that the law judge's decision might haunt SDG&amp;E when  utility executives take the stand during the PUC's upcoming review of the  proposed merger.  </P> <P> "I think it broadens the (questions that) intervenors can ask when they  cross-examine (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom Page" and other SDG&amp;E executives,  Shames said.  </P></p>

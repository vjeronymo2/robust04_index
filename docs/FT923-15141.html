			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (7): A steep learning curve The privatisation process throughout eastern Europe has involved a steep learning curve and frequent changes of course, writes Nicholas Denton. The following chronology of Hungarian privatisation traces the development of privatisation in one country. December 1989: Majority stake in state-owned Tungsram lightbulb producer sold to General Electric of the US for Dollars 150m, in the first large privatisation deal. March 1990: State Property Agency set up to supervise privatisation in response to accusations of corruption when companies 'spontaneously' privatised themselves. Democratic elections produce a conservative government which is suspicious of communist managers safeguarding their positions through privatisation and pushes for tighter control. June 1990: Ibusz, the national travel agency, privatised by public offering and floated on the newly founded Budapest Stock Exchange. The price rises sharply after the launch but then falls well below the issue level, leaving investors with heavy losses and discrediting the stock market route for privatisation. September 1990: Hungary launches First Privatisation Programme, a closely controlled scheme by the authorities for model privatisations of 20 attractive companies. March 1991: 100 per cent of Lehel, a refrigerator maker, sold to Electrolux of Sweden in Hungary's first outright privatisation sale. October 1991: Decentralised privatisation programme for small companies under way, marking a move away from bureaucratic control. November 1991: Flotation of Danubius, a hotel chain, cancelled after last-minute changes to the company's tax position, effectively killing the First Privatisation Programme. December 1991: Spate of trade sales of state-owned consumer goods companies to western multinationals give Hungary Dollars 500m in privatisation proceeds in 1991. January 1992: Mr Tamas Szabo appointed minister responsible for privatisation, giving clearer political direction to the State Property Agency after a year of damaging turf battles within the government over control of privatisation. May 1992: As figures show western multinationals dominating privatisation and government unpopularity mounts, measures announced to stimulate domestic participation in privatisation. They include easy payment terms for domestic investors and discrimination in favour of them over foreign investors in the case of similar bids.</p>

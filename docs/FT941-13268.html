			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Renault sells Colombian arm Renault, the French state-owned vehicle company, is selling control of its Colombian subsidiary to the Santo Domingo Group, one of the country's largest business concerns. The move is the latest and final step in Renault's policy of reducing its exposure to financial and political risks in Latin America, while maintaining its commercial presence. In April last year, it sold its Venezuelan subsidiary to local industrialists and in 1992 it sold control of its Argentine operations to a local holding company. Under the terms of the deal, Renault is selling 51 per cent of the shares in Sofasa, its Colombian subsidiary, to Bavaria, part of the the Santo Domingo Group. Renault's stake in Sofasa is reduced to 24 per cent, with the balance held by Toyota and Mitsui of Japan. Sofasa, which assembles the Renault 9 and the Renault 21 at its Medelin plant, will continue to produce Renault vehicles. It will also expand Renault's commercial base and its distribution network in Colombia. The production of Toyota's utility vehicles - the Landcruiser and Hilux - will be unaffected. Last year, Sofasa produced more than 12,000 Renault cars and accounted for about 13 per cent of the Colombian market. In 1992, Sofasa reported net profits of FFr18m, and remained in profit last year. Renault's sales in Latin America increased from about 83,000 in 1992 to 108,500 last year.</p>

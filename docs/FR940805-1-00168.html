			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequently, in 1992, the CPAA Act codified the FAA's 2-year limit for civil penalty assessment cases adjudicated by the FAA, but did not establish a limitation period for civil penalty assessment cases appealable to the NTSB. Thus, the law limiting the time in which the FAA may initiate civil penalty assessment actions against persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, or repairmen continues to be section 2462. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 25, 1993, the Board published interim rules to implement the CPAA Act (58 FR 11379). In requesting public participation, the NTSB asked particularly for comments on the proposed applicability of its stale complaint rule, 49 CFR 821.33, to civil penalty actions. That rule applies, by its terms, to certificate action cases adjudicated before the NTSB, that is, cases involving the amendment, modification, suspension, or revocation of certificates issued by the FAA. It provides, with some exceptions, that a complaint may be dismissed where an offense occurred more than 6 months before the Administrator advised the respondent as to the reasons for proposing certificate action. The Board will now apply the 6-month stale complaint rule to both certificate action and civil penalty cases it hears on appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In responding to the Board's request for comments, the FAA stated that it will continue agency policy to initiate all cases affected by the new procedures as expeditiously as possible. It is expected that those cases generally will be initiated within 6 months of the date the violation occurred. There must, however, be administrative flexibility within the agency to allocate its resources, for instance, when higher safety priorities demand. Even in such instances, the FAA is constrained by the statutory time limits for taking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In every case, regardless of the time taken for initiation, the FAA has been careful to distinguish the inherent authority of the Board, an adjudicative body, to consider whether delay in a particular case has unfairly prejudiced the opportunity of a respondent to defend against charges. The FAA fully supports the adoption by the Board, by rule, of an adjudicative policy favoring dismissal of a case or other appropriate action whenever a delay in initiating a particular case is shown to substantially diminish a respondent's ability to defend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Penalties Other Than Administrative Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13.15 contains the general procedures by which the FAA may seek a civil penalty, other than by the administrative assessment procedures in &sect;&sect;13.16 and 13.18. Under &sect;13.15, the FAA may compromise a penalty, but if no agreement is reached the FAA refers the case to the United States Attorney General to prosecute and collect the civil penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13.15 requires clarification. For instance, it indicates that all civil penalties in which the amount in controversy is over $50,000 must follow the procedures of that section. As discussed above, however, some civil penalties over $50,000 (such as hazardous materials violations) can be assessed administratively under &sect;13.16. The FAA proposes to clarify that &sect;13.15 applies to all civil penalty actions other than those in which the administrative procedures of &sect;&sect;13.16 and 13.18 are used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Change in Position Titles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a number of places in Part 13, authority to carry out various investigation and enforcement functions is delegated to the Assistant Chief Counsel for Regulations and Enforcement. The Regulations and Enforcement Division, however, has been split into two divisions_the Regulations Division and the Enforcement Division. The Assistant Chief Counsel for each division has the responsibility and authority to carry out various investigation and enforcement functions. Therefore, the FAA proposes to change the authority references in Part 13 to the Assistant Chief Counsel for Regulations and the Assistant Chief Counsel for Enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA believes that the proposed procedural changes and minor clarifications conform the existing procedural rules to amendments made in the CPAA Act, and clarify existing rules. The changes do not, in economic terms, alter the basic processes by which civil penalties are assessed within the agency. For this reason, a full Regulatory Evaluation is not warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulatory evaluation examines the potential costs and benefits of the proposed rule to amend Part 13. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objectives of the proposed rule are to make clarifying changes, and to disclose the procedures that implement the CPAA Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential benefits of this proposed rule include clarifying the rule and explaining in detail how portions of the CPAA Act would be implemented. These proposed changes would provide potentially impacted aviation parties (e.g., pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, and repairmen) with a better understanding of the civil penalty process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential costs of the proposed rule would be zero because it consists only of procedural and clarifying changes to Part 13. The proposed procedural changes would only explain how the requirements of the CPAA Act and other statutes are implemented. The changes would not impose new economic requirements on potentially impacted parties. The clarification changes would further enhance the public's comprehension of the civil penalty assessment process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

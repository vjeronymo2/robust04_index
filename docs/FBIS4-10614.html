			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Most Bolivian citizens who  listened to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's voluntary  testimony were discouraged and uncertain because he did not  dissipate doubts regarding alleged links between politics and  drug trafficking.    The public questioning by the Chamber of Deputies  Constitution Committee of former President Paz Zamora maintained  a very high audience during its six-hour broadcast, comparable  only to the rating obtained by broadcasts of the soccer matches  played by the Bolivian team to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.    Paz Zamora left citizens uncertain when he emphatically  denied any link by his family, party, or himself to drug  trafficking, yet at the same time admitted his personal  friendship with drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria.    The people's discouragement became worse when the high  degree  of dependency the country has on the United States was reflected  in the statements to Congress by former President Paz Zamora.  His words ratified similar statements by current President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.    Last weekend Sanchez de Lozada revealed something the  Bolivian people suspected but did not openly admit: "We have a  terrible dependency on the IMF, the U.S. Embassy, and the World  Bank, who tell us what to do."    Paz Zamora warned that the U.S. cooperation in the struggle  against drug trafficking may turn into interference. He added  that no one had informed him that his "good friend Chavarria"  was an alleged drug trafficker and that he, as president, was  informed about antinarcotics operations.    "Everyone obeys who pays him," Paz Zamora said, adding that  the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not only advised but  paid as well by the U.S. DEA.    The former president's statements seemed to be aimed at  rekindling the traditional anti-U.S. feelings of the Bolivian  people. He also roused a feeling of solidarity with his cause  when he stated that he had "pinned the national banner on his  chest" to implement "coca diplomacy," which hurt the feelings of  the U.S. Government.    Paz Zamora and George Bush in 1990 signed a drug enforcement  agreement that is still in force that regulates financial and  technical cooperation, the DEA's advising of FELCN, and the  substitution of coca crops.    Coca leaves, which are the raw material for cocaine, have  become a point of friction between Bolivia and the United  States. This Andean nation recognizes the need to eradicate  cocaine but also faces a serious social and economic problem  with the destruction of coca crops, which produce a living for  about 300,000 peasants.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY BOYS 4-A;  </P> <P> CAPERS IS DIFFERENCE AS MANUAL ARTS BEATS CRENSHAW  </P> <P> Two years ago, Manual Arts senior guard Marcell Capers was not good enough to  make Crenshaw High's varsity basketball team. But Friday night, he helped end  the Cougars' two-year City championship reign.  </P> <P> Behind Capers' 26 points, the Toilers won their first City 4-A Division title  since 1981 as they defeated Crenshaw, 84-72, before 8,177 at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Six-foot-6 senior center William Celestine scored 25 points and grabbed 12  rebounds to lead the Toilers. He scored 20 of his points in the second half.  </P> <P> "We expected them to play us hard, Capers said. "So we came out and went right  at them knowing that they would not back down.."  </P> <P> The first half was a defensive battle as both teams effectively took away the  other's strengths.  </P> <P> Manual Arts' concern was to stop Crenshaw's guards from penetrating and the  Cougars' goal was to prevent the Toilers from making easy baskets inside.  </P> <P> Manual Arts was more successful with its game plan as the Toilers shut down the  Cougars' high-scoring duo of Alex Scruggs, who made three of 18 shots, and  Kevin Ollie, who made eight of 22.  </P> <P> In the first quarter, Manual Arts was able to make an 8-0 run and take a 16-8  lead. Junior guard Dwain Bradberry scored eight points in the quarter for  Manual Arts.  </P> <P> However, Capers, scored 13 first half points as the Toilers took a 35-31  halftime lead.  </P> <P> In the second half, Celestine dominated as the Toilers pulled away from the  defending state champions.  </P> <P> Manual Arts (25-3) gets an automatic berth in the State Regional Tournament,  which begins Tuesday. Crenshaw (22-5) can only hope for an at-large bid.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Securitisation It is no coincidence that Barclays and National Westminster should launch asset-backed bond issues in the space of two weeks. The Accounting Standards Board was brought on side earlier in the year, clearing a potential obstacle to this method of taking loans off balance sheet. After a period of doubt prompted by the travails of issuers such as National Home Loans and Leyland Daf, investors have also recovered a thirst for bonds backed by mortgages and other loans. New issue spreads have narrowed as a result, presenting the banks with an opportunity to raise cheaper funds. Even so, clearing banks could still raise money more cheaply in other ways. The real gain arises from the transfer of risk to bond holders, which frees capital against which new loans can be made. Selling bonds backed by mortgages might allow the banks to continue building market share in the housing market, for example, without cramping their style elsewhere. Unsecured loans tie up even more capital than mortgages for regulatory purposes, so Barclays' issue of bonds backed by personal loans brings even greater benefits in this regard. While neither bank is under immediate pressure to raise capital, testing the water now might pay off later if loan demand recovers in line with the economy. Even if capital remains plentiful there is virtue in keeping the loan book balanced between different types of risk. Having expanded in commercial property lending in the 1980s, Barclays in particular will appreciate the danger of having too many eggs in one basket.</p>

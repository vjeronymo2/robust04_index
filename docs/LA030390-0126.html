Michel Aoun's troops gave up some ground gained in the latest savage  fighting with the Lebanese Forces militia as part of a withdrawal apparently  prompted by church and international pressure. The troops withdrew shortly  after Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Butros Sfeir threatened Christian  warlords and their men with excommunication unless they halted their month-old  war for control of Christian East Beirut. Both Aoun and Lebanese Forces leader  Samir Geagea vowed in separate statements to abide by the cease-fire called for  by Sfeir.  </P></p>

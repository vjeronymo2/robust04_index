			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries encouraged by inflation figures US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday morning after government figures on producer prices indicated a possible slowdown in inflationary pressures where economists had predicted an increase. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  9/16 at 93 23/32 , yielding 8.052 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 13/32 , to yield 6.977 per cent. Sparking the price gains was a labour department report that showed producer prices down 0.5 per cent for October, the same as in September. Most analysts had predicted that October prices would increase 0.1 per cent. 'I think it is very good as far as inflation is concerned, but it is not the end of the story,' said Ms Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. In spite of the figures, she maintained her opinion that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise its interest rate target by 50 basis points next week at its open market committee meeting. However, she said the inflation news lowered the chance that the Fed would move to raise rates by as much as 100 points. A strong showing by the dollar added to positive sentiment in the bond markets. In early trading, the dollar pushed up to Y98.06 against the Japanese yen and DM1.536 against the D-Mark. Europe's bond markets once again took their cues from Treasuries, and most of them posted moderate gains on the back of the US bond market's rise. However, turnover remained thin as market participants remained reluctant to increase their exposure ahead of Tuesday's FOMC meeting. German bonds rose about  1/3 point in moderate volume in largely technical dealings. The December bund futures contract on DTB ended at 90.31, 0.33 point on the day, but drifted lower in after-hours trading on Liffe. As expected, the Bundesbank's central bank council left official interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting and set another two rounds of securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 4.85 per cent. UK gilts had a lacklustre session, closing slightly lower as the Bank of England's tap issues kept a lid on prices. The December long gilt future closed around 101 11/32 , down  1/4 point. A Pounds 250m tranche of 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2005, one of four tap stocks announced on Friday, was exhausted in the afternoon, the Bank said. A Pounds 100m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2009 was exhausted on Wednesday. The others, a Pounds 100m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2024 and a Pounds 250m tranche of 8 3/4 per cent stock due 2017 have not been sold out. French bonds underperformed bunds, with their yield premium widening to 75 basis points from 69 on Wednesday. In addition to position-squaring ahead of today's national holiday, the weak franc weighed on bonds, dealers said. Although the market is likely to come under further pressure amid uncertainty over the May presidential elections, Mr Adrian James, bond market strategist at NatWest Markets recommends buying French bonds on weakness. However, 'you've got to be prepared to take a six-month view to see value in the French market,' he warned. Swedish bonds had another strong day, lifted by a poll indicating that the supporters of European Union membership might hold a majority after all. The yield on the benchmark 11-year bond fell 23 basis points to 11.20 per cent. With a large pool of voters still allegedly undecided, the outcome of Sunday's referendum remains unclear. The markets still appear to be slightly biased towards a 'yes' and are likely to experience only a brief rally should it materialise. However, a 'no' could put heavy pressure on Sweden's currency and bonds. Traders said Sweden's yield spread over bunds could return to this year's high of around 500 basis points, from 376 at present.</p>

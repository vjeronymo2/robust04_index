			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Farming lobby in US wieldsits power IN 1979, thousands of American farmers rode their tractors into Washington to protest about low farm prices. Their timing was unfortunate. The protest blocked traffic for hours during a Washington blizzard. The farmers' 'tractorcade' is still referred to with bitterness. Since then farm groups and their agribusiness colleagues have developed more effective methods of bringing Congress and the White House to heel. They have built strong coalitions with other farm groups and with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the administration. Their influence is reflected in letters signed by dozens of senators and congressmen, distributed to the media and dispatched to apply pressure on officials in the executive branch. Europeans are often bemused by the power of these lobbies. A breakthrough over agriculture in the Uruguay Round was all but achieved last week, when it was vetoed by Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, who telephoned Mr Ed Madigan the US agriculture secretary, during the negotiations. Well-placed political contributions buy access for adroit Washington representatives. Relationships are cemented in lunches and other social functions, bought by the lobbyists, who themselves are often former government officials. Direct financial backing is distributed through political action committees, (PACs) funded mostly by agribusiness, chemical and food companies, and related manufacturers. Among the PACs financing the congressional elections in 1990 were: the American Soyabean Association, the American Sugarbeet Growers, Dow Chemical Company, General Mills and Phillip Morris. The hard times in the farm belt have stretched the budgets of many farmer organisations. The populist American Agriculture Movement has little extra cash, but it helps farmers who come to Washington to lobby their Congressman. The American Soyabean Association - the group which filed the complaint over EC oilseeds subsidies, which the US brought to the Gatt and won - receives contributions from agribusiness and funding to promote exports of soyabeans from the proceeds of some soyabean sales and the US agriculture department. The group, which has strong ties all over Washington, has been urging the administration to take strong action against the EC for refusing to phase out its oilseeds subsidies since August. It has no illusions about the stakes. Mr Steve Yoder, president of the American Soyabean Association, says: 'I lay awake nights worrying about a trade war.' But he also worries about the shrinking EC market, and sees no alternative to sanctions.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN DRAWN UP FOR PURCHASE OF FRYMAN CANYON;  </P> <P> LAND: RUSTIC PROPERTY IN STUDIO CITY WOULD BECOME A PARK INSTEAD OF HOUSING  PROJECT IF STATE AGENCY AGREES. CITY WOULD PUT UP $2 MILLION OF THE  $10.9-MILLION PRICE.  </P> <P> City officials have reached an agreement with a developer for the purchase of  Fryman Canyon for $10.9 million to turn the rustic, steeply sloped Studio City  land into a park, saving it from development as a luxury housing project.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Michael Woo plan today to unveil the proposal,  which calls for the city to put up $2 million, private contributors to raise  $300,000 and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to kick in the final $8.6  million, according to conservancy Executive Director Joe Edmiston.  </P> <P> However, the city's agreement with developer Fred Sahadi must first be approved  by the state parks agency's seven-member board of directors before it can go  forward. Edmiston and Carole Stevens, chairman of the conservancy's board,  raised doubts Thursday night over whether the deal will be acceptable to the  conservancy.  </P> <P> The mayor's office said in a press release Thursday that the "city and the  developer have agreed upon the purchase price and the amount of funds the city  and private individuals will contribute to save Fryman Canyon."  </P> <P> City officials could not be reached for comment on what seemed to be the end to  a months-long controversy over the 63-acre canyon property, owned by Sahadi and  his wife, Helen.  </P> <P> Stevens said she has asked the state attorney general's office for a formal  opinion about the legality of purchasing a property for an amount in excess of  a state-sanctioned appraised value. The conservancy has said the canyon is  worth only $8.7 million, and Sahadi has had it appraised at $13.7 million.  </P> <P> Stevens said she has asked the state to conduct a new appraisal of the property  and Edmiston indicated that if it shows a higher value, the conservancy might  go ahead with the deal.  </P> <P> "I think there's zero chance the conservancy will go forward without a  (revised) state appraisal -- it would be such a great break from tradition,"  Edmiston said. "If we start buying land without appraisals then there's no end  to it. Then you, as a landowner, just go political if you don't like the  appraised price."  </P> <P> The canyon has been at the center of controversy since last March when Bradley  and Woo urged state and federal officials to intervene to block Sahadi's  project, claiming it would disturb a natural habitat surrounding a stream.  </P> <P> Within weeks, environmental activists -- with backing from Bradley's office --  urged the city to declare the canyon a cultural-historic landmark. The city's  Cultural Heritage Commission granted the designation, but city approval of that  status is still pending before the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> Environmentalists also staged protests at woodsy Fryman Canyon. In one  memorable incident last month, an activist used her Mercedes-Benz sedan to  block contractors from entering the canyon while she contacted city officials  by car phone.  </P> <P> Sahadi recently began posting no-trespassing signs and erecting a fence around  the property, which is crossed by a popular hiking trail that until recently  was believed to be firmly owned by the conservancy.  </P></p>

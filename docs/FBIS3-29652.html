			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 22  February carry editorials on the possible deployment of Patriot  missiles to the ROK.    The moderate CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries an 800-word  editorial entitled, "Dispute Over the Patriot Missile." The  editorial notes that it is understandable that "the deployment  of the Patriot missile will be helpful in maintaining security  on the Korean peninsula, but if the government is to purchase it  for a high price, it will have to examine its feasibility and  effectiveness." The editorial goes on to say that it seems that  "the Defense Ministry does not have a clear policy on this  matter." The editorial says that "if the Patriot missile is a  weapon that can effectively take countermeasures against North  Korea's airplanes and Scud missiles, it will be of help in  deterring war on the Korean peninsula." However, it notes that  the plan to deploy the Patriot missile is not purely to build up  defense capability and goes on to explain that the Patriot  missile is now "out-of-date," and stresses the need to make  "prudent" examinations before making a decision on introducing  the Patriot missile. The editorial then elaborates on the ROK  arms system which is dependent on the United States and notes  that the ROK must revise its system in introducing arms. The  editorial concludes by stressing the need to guarantee  transparency in the process of introducing arms, and that there  must be a device to effectively execute the defense budget in  its military capability.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on page 3 carries an  800-word  editorial entitled, "The Deployment of the Patriot Missile to  the U.S. Forces Stationed in the ROK." The editorial starts by  saying that "dispute over the deployment of Patriot missiles to  the ROK is divided." The editorial says that there is  disagreement regarding this matter between the ROK and the  United States but notes that it is not a big problem. It goes  on to explain that the examination of deploying the Patriot  missile is a just matter because "North Korea has already  reserved large amounts of chemical and biological weapons and  has succeeded in the test of its medium range missile which has  a range of 1,000 km." It notes that the deployment of the  Patriot missile is the best way to deal with North Korea's  missile development. The editorial continues to say that there  is no reason to oppose the deployment of the Patriot missile to  the ROK, and stresses that "the deployment of the Patriot  missile to the U.S. forces in the ROK and introducing it to the  ROK Army are different issues." The editorial concludes by  saying that "since there is no effective alternative," it hopes  that "regardless of North Korea's nuclear development, the  up-to-date Patriot missile can be deployed to U.S. forces  stationed in the ROK as soon as possible."</p>

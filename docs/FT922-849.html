			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hazards ahead for Charter's driver  -Political Notebook WHEN William Waldegrave hits a hold-up on the motorway his children have an awkward habit of complaining from the back seat of his car that he hasn't been doing his job. Everyone knows that the Citizen's Charter was supposed to clear the motorways of those infuriating cones. Driving along the M4 to his constituency, Mr Waldegrave is as conscious as anyone that they are still there. The charter, launched with great fanfare a year ago as the centrepiece of John Major's programme for the 1990s, has not lived up to its billing. It has yet to dispose of its reputation as a pre-election gimmick rather than the serious instrument of the promised revolution in the quality of public services. As cabinet ministers set out last week their contribution to the 19 charters published during the first year, there was plenty of evidence of Whitehall foot-dragging. Many of the charters have a distinct Sir Humphrey quality about them - repackaging old promises or setting targets for customer service so low as to be meaningless. Others have produced nothing. No-one could explain, for example, that a year after it promised to do so, the government has failed so far to set out a few basic rights for those on jury service. Many cabinet ministers have preferred to concentrate their efforts on the traditional annual battle with the Treasury over the size of their budgets. From their perspective ensuring money is efficiently spent - or delivers a measured quality of service - ranks a poor second to the figure on bottom line. Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, is aware that his political reputation depends on hitting the Treasury's global targets rather than on the value-for-money commitments he squeezes from individual departments. But it would be a mistake to conclude that the charter is destined to gather dust in Whitehall filing cabinets. Mr Major's sharp political skills are now widely appreciated, but colleagues say few have yet understood his painstaking persistence. He has said the charter will be at the centre of his programme - and he will mean it as much in five years' time as he does now. There is no echo from Downing Street of Westminster gossip that Mr Waldegrave has been given a non-job. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has still to prove himself a cabinet heavyweight. But Mr Major insists as vehemently in private as in public that Mr Waldegrave - a cleverer man than some of his backbench colleagues allow - will have his full backing. The prime minister has much more to lose if the charter flops. Mrs Sarah Hogg, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, ensures that message is heard across Whitehall. So far, however, the charter has done little more than raise expectations. In advertising terms it has an extremely high 'recognition' factor. And the concept is popular. A wave of customer charters in the private sector attests to a public mood in tune with Mr Major's championship of powerless Davids against bureaucratic Goliaths. People like information  - whether about the examinations performance of local schools or simply the name of the Inland Revenue official dealing with their tax affairs. Delivering on expectations will be harder than raising them - particularly amid the financial austerity which will follow the economic recession. There are two essential strands to the charter. The first is the drive for efficiency - primarily through 'market-testing', contracting-out and privatisation of many of the services now carried out by public-sector workers. The second - the new element - is the commitment to specific targets for standards of public-sector service. The two should naturally complement each other. Mr Waldegrave's equation is that more efficient inputs will equal higher quality output. But he is not be helped by the clumsy construction of his department. Much of the responsibility for the input side of the equation remains with Mr Portillo while Mr Waldegrave is charged with the output side. Mr Waldegrave's promised white paper in the autumn should indicate the extent to which the public-sector machine can make this link between efficiency and quality. But the important political point is that Mr Major is as anxious as his minister's children to get rid of those cones.</p>

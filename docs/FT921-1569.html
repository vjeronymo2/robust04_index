			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / ITC to advertise for Channel 5 licence bids THE Independent Television Commission said yesterday it plans to advertise the licence for Channel 5, the new television channel able to reach three quarters of the population. Channel 5 will cause interference on video recorders and home computers and the successful bidder will have to pay for the retuning of all the affected equipment. The plans were suspended while the commission looked at how potential bidders would cope with this. The ITC said yesterday comments from potential applicants 'indicated that the extent of the retuning problems is recognised and that serious consideration has been given to solving them'. The licence will now be advertised in early April. The aim is to award the licence by the end of October and the winner is expected to be on air by the end of 1994. The applicants will include Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest and FiveTV, a consortium supported by Canadian broadcaster Mr Moser Znaimer. Mr Stephen Castell, an information technology consultant who wants plans for Channel 5 to include options for a digital network for business, said the ITC would not rule out the use of digital transmission when the licence was advertised.</p>

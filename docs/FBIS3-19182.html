The visit is primarily  a political one, following the devaluation of the CFA franc.    In an interview given to LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the  Congolese  president wondered: "Who asked for the CFA to be devalued?  That was one of the conditions that had long been demanded by  the World Bank. I do not wish to get emotional. The  devaluation is a fact. I do not wish to manage the negative  aspects of this decision; this is an opportunity that I want to  seize. First, at the regional level, we must reinforce economic  and monetary integration. Next Monday, I will be in N'Djamena  in the company of other central African heads of state to debate  the prospects of an economic and monetary community."    Pascal Lissouba affirmed that after the devaluation of the  CFA franc, Congo and France found themselves confronted with  three types of problem: "First, the problem of the French  private sector which, if not supported, will face disaster.  Second, the problem of the social aspects which the structural  adjustment programs have always underestimated. France has made  proposals for aid to the program. The implementation of these  programs has yet to be determined. And third, investments in  the future will cost two or three times more than they do now,  and I do not have any funds for supporting investment."    Referring to his meeting with the leaders of the CNPF, the  Congolese president said that "French employers have a card to  play because they have experience in Africa. They have friends  in Africa, and they definitely have business to do, provided  that a minimum level of justice is respected. France itself  also has interests. French banks in Africa are suffering from  the lack of liquidity. For more than a century, we have had  links with France. We are blithely eliminating them out without  really realizing that we are sucking out the core too."    What is the purpose of Pascal Lissouba's visit to Paris? "I  did not come here to try and get myself liked, but to get myself  understood," he affirmed, "to explain our difficulties, our  limitations, and our expectations." Congo, which is facing a  foreign debt of some 15 billion French francs (more than 70  percent of which is owed to France as government debt and trade  debt), has experienced social and political unrest in recent  months. The country has what the IMF and World Bank feel is an  exorbitant number of civil servants. "Human dignity lies in  work, not unemployment. Should the choice be to die of hunger or  die from a bullet? The people who participate in riots do not  ask themselves that kind of question," the Congolese president  explained.</p>

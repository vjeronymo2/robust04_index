			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Japanese car sales up sharply Car sales in Japan showed their second successive month of growth in August, rising at a sharply increased pace which industry officials said was evidence demand was recovering, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. The 9.3 per cent year-on-year jump in unit sales of passenger cars, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association yesterday, compares with a 1.5 per cent upturn in July. Demand was strongest for new subcompact models, to which leading manufacturers have attached competitive price tags. The figures exclude the special category of mini-vehicles with an engine capacity below 660cc, sales of which have been on a rising trend for some months. Analysts said the improvement in the consumer market followed tax rebates provided as part of a government package to stimulate the economy. Sales of all vehicles except minicars and minivans rose 12 per cent, a third successive gain and the first double-digit increase since August 1990. This stemmed in part from an 18.6 per cent leap in truck sales. Many older commercial vehicles are being replaced because of tightened emission and load requirements. Toyota, the motor industry leader, sold 14.6 per cent more vehicles than a year ago, but the second-ranking Nissan remained out of favour, with a 3 per cent fall.</p>

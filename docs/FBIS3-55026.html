Parliament Chairman Juozas Bernatonis said Monday [3  January]  "it is rumored that Sajudis members collect signatures on blank  sheets of paper."    In a statement circulated Monday, the executive secretary of  Sajudis, Jurgis Razma, said the organization's board never even  discussed a possibility to start collecting signatures for a  referendum. Razma said regional branches of Sajudis have not  been authorized to deal with the matter either.</p>

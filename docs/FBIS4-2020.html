			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 4 KYODO -- China has postponed the  start of operations of its first interbank foreign exchange  system for two weeks from the originally set schedule from  Monday [4 April].    Informed sources said the postponement is due to a delay in  preparations.    The China foreign exchange trading center is the culmination  of China's ongoing unification of its dual track exchange rate  system.    It will enable the renminbi (Chinese yuan) to be freely  convertible with other currencies within six years.    The system has so far been given a test-run, and will now  formally start operations from April 18, the sources said.</p>

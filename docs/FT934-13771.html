			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Global bulls graze on familiar pastures The liquidity-driven global bull market in bonds and equities is still running strongly, refuelled recently by increased confidence that US monetary policy is not going to be tightened any time soon, some say not for another year. Meanwhile, of course, rates are still actually falling in Japan and Europe. Classic cyclical influences are at work. As deposit rates come down, resources are transferred from banks into the securities markets. This is reinforced by high savings rates because of the low confidence of consumers in difficult economic conditions, exacerbated by the problems faced by the personal sectors of several countries in coping with high debt levels inherited from the 1980s boom. Prices of financial assets are being bid up. A research note from Kleinwort Benson points out that deposits now account for just 19 per cent of US household financial assets, down from 26 per cent in 1985. Mutual funds have risen from 2 per cent to 6 per cent over the same period, and August net inflows hit a new peak, with Dollars 11.4bn going into equity funds and Dollars 14.4bn into bond funds. The aggregate net sales for the year could be over Dollars 250bn at this rate. An increasing part of these vast capital flows is being directed overseas. This impetus for the global markets is being reinforced by US pension funds, which are not revelling in new money flows to anything like the same extent, but which happen to have embarked on a diversification drive. When 1 per cent of US pension fund assets moves out of the country, that is Dollars 30bn on the rampage. In the context of such massive flows of capital, normal bases of stock market valuation go out of the window. Hong Kong has always been a 'cheap' market on fundamentals because the risks are high, but these quibbles cannot survive in the face of tidal waves of foreign capital. The last time it happened was in 1987, when the Hong Kong market rocketed 51 per cent in five months before the October crash. Hence the fears that bubbles are being generated. We know from the 1987 experience how modern financial markets can behave. History will not exactly repeat itself, but the faintest whisper of a rise in US interest rates is going to cause a lot of trouble in markets around the world. The attitude of professional investors is ambivalent. Booming markets attract business. US mutual funds do not turn money away because it is a bad time to invest, they eagerly rake it in and keep fully exposed. The risks can be passed on to the clients. All the same, one of the lessons learned at the time of the 1987 crash was of the potential value of tactical asset allocation models, which warn when the bond and equity markets have got out of line. You might not think that professional investment managers would need a computer model to tell them when this has happened, but people can get carried away with bull market euphoria in a way that microprocessor chips cannot. Those few that obeyed their TAA models in the summer of 1987 did well. It is not clear, however, that they will get a similar warning bell in future. The models they are using are generally quite happy with current yield ratios. The ratio of the long bond yield to the equity market dividend yield in the UK, for instance, is about 2, which is very comfortable in terms of the experience of the past 20 years. But interest rates, inflation and economic growth are all much lower than they were in the 1970s and 1980s. We need a model tailored to the 1990s. If the models cannot be trusted we are thrown back on traditional warning signs of an imminent stock market peak. One of these is that money tends to move into fringe areas in search of value that no longer exists in the mainstream. The Hong Kong market has risen by 54 per cent in the last seven months. Another is that naive private investor money tends to flood in at the peak. Does this sound at all familiar? Still another is that bond prices tend to top out several months before equities, although there is some evidence that the time lags have tended to shorten. Last Friday's new low for the US Treasury long bond yield was reassuring, but we must keep watching closely.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Brent Intl Pounds 24m sale as profits drop to Pounds 0.93m BRENT INTERNATIONAL, the speciality chemicals group, announced yesterday the sale of its electronics group for Pounds 24m as pre-tax profits dropped to Pounds 931,000 from a previous Pounds 6.4m. At the same time Mr Stephen Cuthbert, the chief executive since 1981, resigned by mutual agreement. His compensation is thought to be around Pounds 250,000. Mr Keith Hutchings, group finance director and acting chief executive, said Brent's performance had not been meeting either the company's or the shareholders' expectations for the last two years. The company is looking for a recruit with strong industrial experience. In May shares in the group fell 30p to 99p after Lord Lane, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that first half profits would be 'significantly below' those achieved in the first half of 1992. The shares closed 7p down at 116p. In spite of the warning analysts were surprised by the extent of the retreat. Operating profits tumbled to Pounds 1.8m after taking into account redundancy and reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.6m and a charge of Pounds 475,000 for costs related to abortive acquisitions. Operating profits were Pounds 6.2m last time. Mr Hutchings said the fall in operating profits reflected the downturn in the real volume of sales, a reduction of 20 per cent in gross margins, and a slight rise in overheads. Brent is selling its electronics division to Cookson. It will receive Pounds 20m cash and Cookson's Trafficair division, a maker of industrial cleaning products for the transport industry worth Pounds 4m. The electronics group, with net assets of Pounds 3.8m, had sales of Pounds 11.6m for 1992, and contributed Pounds 2m of the group's 1992 pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.5m. Mr Hutchings said the sale would realise a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m and reduce the group's debt from Pounds 21m to Pounds 1m. Tangible net worth would rise to Pounds 37m (Pounds 23m) after the disposal. Group interest payable soared to Pounds 857,000 compared with a receivable of Pounds 132,000 previously. Mr Hutchings attributed this to payments both for acquisitions made in 1991 and capital expenditure. After a high tax charge boosted by Pounds 450,000 of unrelieved ACT and the preference dividend payout of Pounds 540,000, the loss per share was 0.5p, compared with earnings per share of 5.3p last time. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p. While turnover was up at Pounds 63.5m (Pounds 59.9m), the group said it was down 4 per cent in real terms after taking out the exchange rate factor.</p>

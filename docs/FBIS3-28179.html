			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- South Korean  peasants and civic organisations including the National Council  of Peasants Organisations called a joint press conference in  Seoul on February 2 for "saving our agriculture" and strongly  demanded that the puppet authorities renegotiate the opening of  the market of farm products with the United States, according to  a radio report from Seoul.    The organisations shared the view that if impasse was solved  at the Uruguay Round talks, South Korean agriculture would be  driven to the hopeless doom of bankruptcy. They declared that  they would hold civic rallies in 10 areas of South Korea  including Seoul from February 5 to urge renegotiation on the  Uruguay Round of multi-lateral trade relations.</p>

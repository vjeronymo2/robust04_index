			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Observer: Tiny's challenge Lord King's well-trailed decision to call it a day at British Airways and hand over the control stick to Sir Colin Marshall raises the question of how much longer that other entrepreneurial 74-year-old - Lonrho's Tiny Rowland - is going to hang on. It is nearly 20 years ago since the late Sir Basil Smallpeice tried, and spectacularly failed, to unseat Tiny Rowland. Smallpeice, along with two Conservative MPs - Duncan Sandys and Edward du Cann - had been one of three non-executives appointed to the Lonrho board following growing City disquiet about its financial affairs. However, Sandys and du Cann soon sided with Rowland and although Smallpeice commanded a majority of Lonrho's directors - the so-called straight eight - he and his supporters were booted out at the next meeting. If the battle were to be fought again, Rowland could have a fight on his hands. Lonrho has cut its dividend and is selling UK assets to make ends meet. The other big difference now is that unlike British Airways, Lonrho does not have a sizeable cadre of non-executives to whom the chief executive can turn for advice.</p>

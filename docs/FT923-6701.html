			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Reducing PSBR would spur private rented sector Sir, Prof Gavin McCrone probably over-estimates the need for tax concessions to revitalise the private residential rented sector (August 17). A comparison between net rental yields at around 6 per cent and gilt yields at 9.5 per cent suggests investment in residential rental property is a poor option. Yet long-term rental payments and property values are inflation linked. A London flat with a current open market value of Pounds 75,000 could be let to produce a net rental yield of around Pounds 4,500 a year. With modest inflation and if interest rates fall, the value of the flat increases. If the rental income stream and the open market value of the flat increase by 3 per cent a year over 25 years, the net present value would be about Pounds 112,000, with a discount rate of only 6 per cent. This compares favourably with a Pounds 108,000 net present value of Pounds 75,000 of gilts yielding 9.5 per cent over 25 years with the same discount rate. It is only if the government eliminates inflation that gilts are a far better bet, and fully funding the PSBR 'crowds out' necessary institutional investment in residential rental property. But reducing government borrowing must be better than compensating tax concessions. Richard McManus, 44 Upham Park Road, London W4</p>

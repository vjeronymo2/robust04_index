			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (1): A time for celebration and reflection - After eight years of economic expansion, Portugal has plunged into a recession. It has exposed the dark side of a society where sleek office blocks rise in a capital city ringed by shanty towns Crowds waving red carnations will throng the streets of Lisbon this April in commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the 'Revolution of the Flowers' that ended 48 years of dictatorship and set western Europe's poorest country on the road to prosperity. The anniversary will be an occasion to celebrate the principal legacies of the revolution: a stable parliamentary democracy, membership of what is now the European Union and sustained economic growth that has improved living standards and moved Portugal past Greece in terms of output per capita. But the commemoration will also be a time for reflection on what has not yet been achieved and why. After eight years of economic expansion, Portugal has plunged into a recession that has exposed the unappealing underside of a society that the government has been describing as 'an oasis of growth in Europe' and a 'democracy of success'. Sleek office blocks are rising in a new financial centre in Lisbon but the city is still fringed with makeshift shanty towns, where thousands live in abject poverty. 'A country that launches its own satellites can't have people living in such conditions,' acknowledges Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and communications. The government has promised to spend Es300bn to wipe out shanty towns within five years. Many of those living in these 'bairros de lata' are destitute farm workers who have moved to the cities in search of work. Portugal's backward agricultural sector, which employs 12 per cent of the labour force, has proved unable to compete successfully within a single European market. Reduced earnings have left a majority of farm workers living at subsistence level on incomes only a third as big as those of their Spanish counterparts. Portuguese average wages as a whole are lower than in developing countries such as Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, let alone any other western European country. Industry is also suffering the effects of increasing competition. Traditional sectors such as textiles - which accounts for 30 per cent of exports - footwear, ceramics and metallurgy are undergoing a radical restructuring process that involves widespread closures and dismissals. Unemployment rose from 4.2 per cent of the labour force in 1992 to 6.2 per cent in 1993 and will climb significantly higher this year. Many more people have been given access to state health care and education since the revolution. But services are poorly organised and facilities are often rudimentary. Welfare payments such as unemployment pay and old-age pensions are barely sufficient to live on. 'The country is moving towards modernity; towards development; towards credibility, and towards having a voice within the European Union,' says Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister. 'But it will not be easy. The process involves changing mentalities. We cannot afford to support enterprises that are inefficient. We have to concentrate our resources on companies with the potential to compete at an international level.' Mr Cavaco Silva admits that the recession of 1993, when output fell 0.5 to 1 per cent, was the most difficult period for his centre-right government since he came to office in 1985. But the economic cycles that have served him so well in the past appear to be evolving in his favour again. Economists forecast that the slump will bottom out during the first half of 1994 and that gross domestic product growth for the year will reach 1 per cent. By the time of the next general election, in October 1995, the economy is likely to be expanding at a rate of 3 per cent a year. The EU, whose funds have contributed so much to Portugal's growth in recent years, will again play a crucial role in an economic pick-up that will boost Mr Cavaco Silva's chances of re-election at the head of what would be his third majority government. He says he will refuse to serve in a minority government. EU aid to Portugal for the period 1994-1999 is estimated at Es3,500bn, double that of the previous six-year period. The new funds will begin arriving this summer, stimulating public and private investment in industry and, particularly, transport and communications infrastructure. The beginnings of recovery in some of Portugal's main export markets will be an additional factor in launching a new cycle of growth. 'The slump here has been relatively light and short-lived,' says Mr Joao Freixa, assistant general manager of Barclays Bank in Portugal. 'This time, the authorities appear to have been right when they predicted Portugal would be the last to fall into recession and one of the first to move out.' The banking sector, in fact, emerged from last year's recession with an overall growth in profits of 11 per cent, slightly higher than in 1992. Banks offset shrinking margins with substantial increases in income from commissions and the cross-selling of the products of their financial subsidiaries. They also reaped important profits from trading in public debt securities and foreign exchange during the currency crises in Europe last year. Despite the recession, total credit advanced rose by about 10 per cent. This was partly due to the growth of new products such as consumer and house-purchase credit. But, according to Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, president of the Portuguese Bankers' Association, some banks also deliberately renewed bad credits to avoid provisioning for them. Total bad debt is believed to have risen from Es450bn in 1992 to more than Es650bn last year; about 8 per cent of total credit. The proportion of bad debt is almost certain to increase this year as the effects of the recession on industrial companies filter through to the banks. Another financial sector that has bucked the recessionary trend is the capital market. As short-term interest rates fell, investors turned to the stock market for more attractive returns. Liquidity drove share prices up more than 55 per cent in 1993, despite the poor prospects of many quoted companies. Total market capitalisation doubled. Recent reforms improving the technical and administrative functioning of the stock market also inspired greater confidence from investors and the listing of Portugal as an emerging market attracted investment from the steadily increasing number of emerging market funds. Another important step in the development of the capital market could be the proposed creation of a futures and options exchange in the northern city of Oporto. Restructuring and liberalisation have progressed considerably faster in the financial sector than in industry. The re-privatisation of banks and insurance companies nationalised after the revolution has been completed with the exception of one bank. A second attempt at privatising Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor will be made this year. The government rejected a bid made for the bank in 1993 as too low. In the heady days of 1975, communist-led governments hailed the nationalisations as 'conquests of the revolution'. Today, Portugal has a sharply different perspective on what the revolution achieved. . . and what has, as yet, been left undone.</p>

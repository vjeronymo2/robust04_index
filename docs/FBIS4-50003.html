			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren met with Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of  state, here today. They discussed bilateral relations between  China and the United States and some international issues.    Rong expressed his appreciation over former U.S. President  Nixon's efforts in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and  in pushing the normalization of formal relations between the two  countries.    Kissinger, as an assistant to the former U.S. president, has  also made great contributions in this aspect, Rong said.    China hopes to see a peaceful and stable international  environment and that differences between China and the U.S.  should be solved through discussions and consultations on an  equal footing, he stated.    Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be  improved and developed in a "constructive way", and the trade  between the two countries should also be separated from human  rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries  can cooperate in a still wider sphere.    The meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] Last night the 3-80 Northern Front decreed a  unilateral cease-fire in an attempt to stop the EPS [Sandinist  People's Army] military offensive and seek what could be the  last chance for a negotiated solution to the conflict.    The notification arrived at the CIAV-OAS [OAS International  Commission of Support and Verification], while Esteli Bishop  Abelardo Mata and writer Pablo Antonio Cuadra finalized the  details of the meeting to be held this morning with General  Ortega and Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta.    The handwritten communique, signed by "Esteban, Piloto,  Martin Negro, and Chacalin," is addressed to CIAV coordinator  Sergio Caramagna and Bishop Mata.    "We hereby officially report that as of 10 February 94 the  3-80 Northern Front halts or suspends its military operations  and (decrees) a cease-fire as a goodwill gesture for attaining  peace and seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict," says  the main part of the communique.    Bishop Mata said that this goodwill gesture from "the boys"  of the 3-80 should be answered with a similar gesture by  government authorities, who will meet this morning with the  bishop and Pablo Antonio Cuadra.  <H5>  EPS Reacts Favorably </H5>   EPS spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock reacted  positively to the announcement of the cease-fire by the  irregulars.    "We applaud any initiative that implies an immediate  disarming without political conditions," said the military  spokesman. Wheelock agreed in that mechanisms must be  implemented to protect those who surrender their weapons.    "This is the result of the EPS activity; two weeks ago the  members of the 3-80 spoke differently and their demands were  purely political. Now we see a radical change in their  positions," added Wheelock.    One of the most urgent demands from the members of the  Northern Front is the evacuation of an undetermined number of  wounded who, according to the bishop of Esteli, "could die or be  left disabled."  <H5>  Important Meeting Today </H5>   The military spokesman said the Army could collaborate in  the  evacuation, as he has been informed that there are many  irregulars wounded.    Today at 1100, the Commission of the Cardinal and the  CIAV-OAS will meet with Gen. Humberto Ortega and Government  Minister Alfredo Mendieta.    A high-ranking government source told BARRICADA that "at  that  meeting, important decisions will be made to attain peace in  that region."    On the other hand, the National Assembly ordered the Human  Rights Commission to implement the necessary initiatives in  order to make possible a conclusion of the conflict in the short  term.    Carlos Gallo, president of the Human Rights Commission, and  Deputy Anibal Martinez held a quick meeting with Bishop Mata and  the coordinator of the CIAV-OAS to learn of the positions of the  rearmed irregulars.    Gallo said it is possible that during the meeting with  Minister Mendieta the parliamentary commission may ask the  government to cease the Armed Forces' military operations.    "It would be a cease-fire that would become a lasting  disarmament, not an unending exchange of opinions as has  happened in previous months," added Gallo.    In the morning hours of 8 February, Bishop Mata had leveled  serious charges against the EPS, which he accused of human  rights violations against the peasant population during its  operations in persecution of the "recontras."</p>

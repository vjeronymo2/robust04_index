			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECOND-CLASS WATER, FIRST CLASS IDEA  </P> <P> Millions of gallons of water are literally washed down the drain and out to sea  in California every day -- in a California that is desperately short of water.  This wasted water is being recaptured, recycled and reclaimed -- in relatively  small amounts -- so that it can be used again.  </P> <P> The California Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian now have an opportunity  to encourage the large-scale reuse of treated sewage and other waste water by  approving a proposed $200-million bond issue for the 1990 election ballot. This  rather modest down payment, if approved by voters, will pay significant  dividends over the next 20 years in the form of greater water security for the  state.  </P> <P> There is nothing new about using reclaimed water. Treated sewage effluent has  been used for landscape irrigation in Southern California since the 1920s. But  only now is reclaimed waste water being viewed as a significant supply of "new"  water that can offset the shortages that face California. The California Assn.  of Reclamation Entities of Water says that proposed projects could generate  nearly 700,000 acre-feet of water a year if all were built. That amount would  meet the needs of nearly 3 million Californians annually.  </P> <P> Generally, reclaimed water is not intended for in-home consumption. The water  may be safe to drink, but health codes limit its use. Still, every gallon of  reclaimed water put to use watering a golf course or a park frees up a gallon  of drinkable water for homes, businesses and industry.  </P> <P> Several far-sighted sanitation districts already have active reclamation  projects. The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County generate up to  60,000 acre-feet a year for replenishment of ground-water aquifers. The Irvine  Ranch Water District in Orange County, a water reclamation pioneer, now is  experimenting with dual piping systems that will allow reclaimed water to be  used in toilets in new office buildings. An estimated 13% of San Diego County's  supply is expected to come from reclaimed water within 20 years.  </P> <P> There is a ready supply available: the output of public sewage-treatment  plants. But putting reclaimed water to use is costly. The most highly treated  effluent has the broadest application -- clean enough, for instance, to be  sprayed directly onto food crops. This degree of treatment requires expensive  facilities. Building the separate piping system is costly, too. The proposed  bond measure, establishing a revolving loan fund, can be critical in providing  the seed money needed to get projects off the planning tables. Tax incentives  were used in this fashion in the 1970s and 1980s to help fledgling alternative  energy projects.  </P> <P> There is nothing experimental about water reclamation, though. It works. The  supply is at hand. The need is apparent. With approval of the bond issue this  year, many local agencies will have the resources needed to complete the cycle.  </P></p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Business leaders support Lib Dems SIR PETER PARKER, chair-man of Evered Bardon, heads a group of 12 business leaders who declare their support for the Liberal Democrats in a letter to the Times today, Ivor Owen writes. They endorse the party's proposal for an extra 1p on the basic rate of income tax to finance investment in education, saying it is 'the necessary pre-condition of a high-skill, high-value-added economy'. They also emphasise that the Liberal Democrats are prepared to 'make the necessary investment now in public works to get a very sluggish economy moving again'. The letter states: 'After 40 years which have seen Britain's relative decline as a major industrial power continue under both Conservative and socialist governments, rational businessmen are bound to ask themselves whether there is not a better way forward.' The signatories include Mr Terry Maher, chairman of Pentos, the publisher, Lord Ezra, former chairman of the National Coal Board and a Liberal Democrat spokesman in the Lords, and Mr Peter Boizot, chairman and managing director of Pizza Express.</p>

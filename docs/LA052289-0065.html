			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The daughter of artist Willem de Kooning, who is said to have Alzheimer's  disease, asked a court in New York to declare him mentally incompetent to  manage property worth up to $150 million, according to ARTnews magazine. De  Kooning, 85, whose "Pink Lady" sold at a Sotheby's auction last year for $3.6  million, lives in East Hampton on Long Island, and continues to paint daily  with the violent, slashing strokes that have earned him fame as one of  America's most prominent living artists. His daughter, Lisa, and his attorney,  John Eastman, have filed a petition in state court in Mineola requesting they  be named co-conservators of the artist's assets, the magazine reported.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The leaders of the Group of  Seven industrial nations will likely discuss how to secure  growth and employment at their summit in Naples in July, a  Japanese Government source said Wednesday [6 April]. The topics  of growth and employment will be high on the agenda as the  number of people out of work in the G-7 nations stands at about  23 million, the source said.    Following the "jobs summit" held in Detroit in March, the  G-7  leaders are expected to agree on the need to take measures to  create jobs, the source said.    The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan  and the United States.    The U.S. is also pressing for discussion of labor issues  such as goods made by prison labor, the source said.    Also on the agenda will be financial support to Russia and  Ukraine, potentially unsafe nuclear reactors in Russia, and  trade and the environment, the source noted.    Personal representatives of the G-7 leaders, known as  Sherpa,  are to meet once or twice a month to discuss details of topics  to be on the agenda at the Naples summit before fine-tuning them  at a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development in June, the source added.</p>

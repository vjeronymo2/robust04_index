			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Eastman Kodak shares fall as new chief financial officer quits SHARES in Eastman Kodak, the US film products group, dropped 9 per cent yesterday following the announcement that Mr Christopher Steffen, the company's new chief financial officer, had resigned after only 11 weeks because of a management disagreement. Mr Steffen, formerly chief financial officer of Honeywell, came to Kodak with a reputation for turning around poorly-performing businesses and the company's shares had risen strongly following his appointment on hopes he would improve its lacklustre earnings record. Mr Kay Whitmore, Kodak's chairman, said Mr Steffen had been a 'positive and provocative contributor to our thinking'. He had left the company 'not because we disagreed on what needs to change, but because we could not agree on the process for making that change happen'. Mr Steffen, 51, said only that 'the company and I disagreed on the approach to solving its problems'. Wall Street speculated that he might now be approached by International Business Machines, whose new chief executive, Mr Lou Gerstner, is looking for a new chief financial officer. Mr Whitmore has a reputation for approaching change with great caution, and with an intense dislike of redundancies, while Mr Steffen has a history of a tough, rapid action to improve a company's performance. There had been hints that Mr Steffen wished to play a more central role in restructuring Kodak than Mr Whitmore was prepared to let him. The resignation intensifies the pressure on Mr Whitmore to shake up the conservative company. Wall Street analysts expressed surprise and dismay at Mr Steffen's departure and Kodak's shares dropped Dollars 4 7/8 to close on the New York Stock Exchange at Dollars 47 1/2 . The group said the resignation was unconnected with yesterday's announcement by Kodak of first quarter earnings of Dollars 149m, or 46 cents a share, before accounting changes, compared with the Dollars 145m, or 45 cents a share, recorded in the same period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars 4.44bn, up from Dollars 4.41bn. A change in methods of accounting for retirees health benefits turned the profits for the latest quarter into a net loss of Dollars 1.88bn, or Dollars 5.75 a share.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (6): A man with a message - Personality profile, Billy Payne, an Olympics altruist / It might be going a bit far to describe Billy Payne as an Olympic evangelist, but not too far When Billy Payne, the president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games discusses the centennial games to be held in Atlanta in 1996, he speaks with the passion of a preacher. When he steps out of his office on to his balcony with its view of downtown Atlanta, and spreads his arms wide to describe the planned layout for the new Olympic park, he looks as if he is ready to deliver a sermon to an assembled flock below. Seven years ago, Payne certainly needed a strong sense of belief in himself  -if not a higher being - when he came up with the idea of launching an Atlanta bid for the 1996 games. Most people at the time thought he was mad. Even three years later, when the city's highly professional bid had been submitted to the International Olympic Committee, few thought he stood much of a chance of succeeding. However, since that day in September 1990, when the IOC upset the odds and picked Atlanta over the sentimental favourite Athens, no one has made the mistake of under-estimating Payne again. A 46-year-old attorney and former star college American football player, Payne shares the lofty ideals and cheerful optimism of another Georgian who burst on to the world stage from relative obscurity - former president Jimmy Carter. And like Carter, Payne places a lot of faith in his ability to get people to trust and like him. The secret to Atlanta's successful bid in 1990, says Payne, was the fact that IOC members trusted and liked Payne and his team. They must have also liked what he had to say - that Atlanta would do more than just put on a highly efficient games - 'organisationally, logistically, technologically, we're going to be the best that the world has to offer. And yet, that's not a big enough goal. The Olympic movement is not about objective achievements, it's not about saying our venues were the best, or our transportation plan was the best. It's about whether or not we advance that which is good about the Olympic movement.' Furthermore, it is proof of the power of co-operation and friendship that Payne sees as the Olympics' lasting legacy. As he puts it: 'I am unaware of an international idea that has ever been articulated that has the potential and the power of the Olympic movement.' That potential, of course, has not always been realised in past games - boycotts in Moscow and Los Angeles, terrorism in Munich. So when Payne spoke to IOC members about Atlanta's bid, he said of the Olympic movement: 'It has often been abused and misused, and it's been 100 years boys, so let's get it straightened out now.' Today, the preparations certainly seem straightened out - most of the money for the games is raised, construction of the Olympic stadium and the athlete's village is well under way. In spite of having to overcome some early political hurdles, Payne says he was always confident that Atlanta could put on a good show. 'The second we were awarded the games, and the words came out of President Samaranch's mouth - 'The city of Atlanta' - the success of these games was absolutely assured. There is now way the United States of America would not do whatever it took to meet or exceed the expectations of the world.' Atlanta, of course, should benefit hugely from the Olympics in terms of the local economy and the region's image in the US and the wider world. For this, Payne is a hero to many Atlantans, and people say that after the summer of 1996 he could run for, and win, political office in Georgia. Billy Payne, however, is very much the altruist. Like another former president, he asks not what the Olympics can do for Atlanta, but what Atlanta can do for the Olympics - 'if success is measured only in what Atlanta gets out of it, then these games will have been a horrible failure. We have got to give something back to the Olympic movement.'</p>

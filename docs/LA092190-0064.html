			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SPEAKING SOFTLY ON DEMOCRATS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT AVOIDS TRYING TO BLAME THE GOP'S OPPONENTS FOR THE  BUDGET STALEMATE BECAUSE HE NEEDS A UNITED FRONT FOR HIS PERSIAN GULF POLICY.  </P> <P> In late July, about a week before Congress began its summer recess, President  Bush and Republican members of Congress decided at a breakfast meeting that for  one more week Bush would take the political "high road," particularly when  discussing the budget deficit.  </P> <P> After a week, if the budget summit produced no tangible results, all bets were  off. Bush would feel free to make partisan attacks, and in his political  appearances would use the White House bully pulpit to blame the Democrats for  the failure to agree on reducing the federal budget deficit.  </P> <P> But that plan was dynamited by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the massive  deployment of American GIs. Nearly two months later, even though he faces the  last, crucial weeks of the congressional election campaign, Bush is being  forced to tread lightly.  </P> <P> The White House has shown an ever greater sensitivity toward partisan rhetoric  that could divide the nation as Bush seeks a powerful display of national unity  for his Persian Gulf policy.  </P> <P> "What George Bush would risk in becoming too zealous a partisan would be the  unprecedented support he's getting in Congress" for Operation Desert Shield,  said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University in New  Jersey and an expert on the presidency and its relations with Congress.  </P> <P> The President's low-key approach was readily apparent this week on a Western  political swing, when he campaigned for Rep. Hank Brown, who is seeking to  represent Colorado in the U.S. Senate, and when he raised $4.4 million in  California for Sen. Pete Wilson's gubernatorial campaign and for the state  Republican Party.  </P> <P> Demonstrating his moderated tenor in San Francisco, Bush left the Democrats  alone and stressed Wilson's "brand of environmental activism." In that arena,  the President said, the candidate "holds a position of conviction, not  convenience."  </P> <P> It was a far cry from the George Bush who by many accounts slashed and burned  his way through much of the 1988 presidential campaign, hurling to crowds at  political rallies the red meat of angry attacks and trying to link his opponent  in the public mind with, for example, convicted killer Willie Horton.  </P> <P> "The sort of rhetoric available in 1988 is not really acceptable today," a  senior White House official said in explaining the difference in tone now.  </P> <P> The unresolved budget talks and the extremely uncertain situation in the  Persian Gulf have had "a tempering influence" on the President's political  message, he said.  </P> <P> "You're more aware of the need to keep things together, and so they tend to  mute the partisan rhetoric."  </P> <P> The decision about whether to stick with the more statesmanlike approach or to  reactivate partisan attacks is complicated by mixed signals from the  electorate. Voters in Massachusetts and Oklahoma have sent unmistakable signals  of strong anti-incumbent sentiments, yet a crisis on the international scene  generally tends to favor current officeholders.  </P> <P> For the time being, White House officials believe that they have little choice  but to follow an approach to the Nov. 6 elections that leaves little room for  sharp attacks on the Democrats, in exchange for cementing support behind the  Persian Gulf deployment.  </P> <P> Indeed, said one, "it's a very easy trade to not be able to slash and burn as  much" in exchange for a supportive electorate.  </P> <P> But the swap has come at a price.  </P> <P> For example, the Democrats have scored points with the public in the budget  battle in recent weeks. One Republican adviser lamented their success in  presenting what he described as the image of a President thwarting a solution  to the deficit problem "to bestow benefits on the rich" by insisting on a cut  in the capital gains tax.  </P> <P> "It was sound-bite massacre," said Mitch Daniels, a political adviser in the  Ronald Reagan White House.  </P> <P> But the toned-down approach will last only so long, some at the White House  say.  </P> <P> As Election Day nears and the President shifts his focus from well-heeled  fund-raising dinners to more public rallies, it is likely that he will develop  a tougher edge to his campaigning, one White House official said.  </P> <P> "That's the way we're going to go," said the official, speaking on condition of  anonymity. "Some things are going to change as we move along. This will evolve  and sharpen as we get closer to Nov. 6."  </P> <P> The "wild card" Persian Gulf situation, however, has made it "very difficult to  map out a seamless strategy" for Bush to follow in each of the weeks leading up  to the election, the aide said. At this point, he and other White House  insiders report, they have mapped out the days the President will travel -- and  to some extent the candidates for whom he will campaign. But the message he  will deliver, beyond exhorting the voters to turn out for Republicans, remains  up in the air.  </P></p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / 100,000 job losses feared at councils MORE THAN 100,000 redund-ancies are likely in local government in the next two years, say the compilers of a survey of council personnel directors released yesterday. The figure is about 10 per cent of the workforce. The estimate in a survey of 55 authorities by the CAMC Personnel Policy Research Unit was dismissed by Mr John Redwood, local government minister, as 'scaremongering'. Last week's Local Government Chronicle estimated that more than 33,000 full-time posts were at risk in England over the next 15 months. The government's marginal relaxation of local spending controls announced this week was welcomed by councils but the Association of County Councils suggested it was less generous than the Pounds 150m estimate. The move gives 17 councils 1.5 per cent more for their 'notional amount' - the basis for government calculations - but in only four is there a similar percentage rise in the capping limit.</p>

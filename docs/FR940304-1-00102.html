			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department decided a separate product class was not appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add-on heat pumps. Since this type of heat pump is always used with a storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank, there is no difference in the utility provided to the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No detailed information describing the location of electric water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters in existing houses was provided. Lacking better data, DOE assumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient volume of air circulation would be available to allow proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of heat pump water heaters. Most of the heat pump water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in this analysis are currently available. They are all equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with freeze protection and have backup resistance elements. This permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation under adverse conditions. Providing condensate drains was included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the installation costs for all heat pump water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department rejected the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment that heat pump water heaters not be considered in the analysis because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their low sales volume. The Department would agree with the Gas Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association if heat pump water heaters warranted a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class; however, since they are treated as a design option, DOE concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they warrant consideration. The effect on water heater manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels requiring heat pump water heaters was considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing impact analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The low heating rate of electric instantaneous water heaters presents a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantage with respect to their capability to provide a large quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hot water as rapidly as an electric resistance storage water heater. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference justified two product classes (instantaneous and all other) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric water heaters. There is little that can be done to improve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency of electric instantaneous water heaters. Therefore, standards were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not developed for electric instantaneous water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas-fired instantaneous water heaters can provide unlimited amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hot water, but at limited rates. The Department judged this to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant difference in utility to the consumer. Gas instantaneous water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters were, therefore, specified as a separate product class, and analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as such for standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. KOREANS BATTLE POLICE, DENOUNCE SPYING ON CIVILIANS  </P> <P> Thousands of protesters hurled firebombs and stones Saturday at riot police who  blocked a demonstration against government spying on civilians.  </P> <P> The police fired tear gas to drive back 20,000 students and dissidents who  tried to march downtown after an anti-government rally attended by more than  100,000 opposition supporters.  </P> <P> The health of opposition leader Kim Dae Jung, meanwhile, deteriorated as his  hunger strike against the government of President Roh Tae Woo entered its sixth  day. Aides said he may have to be hospitalized.  </P> <P> "Down with Roh Tae Woo!" yelled students hurling rocks and firebombs at police.  There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.  </P> <P> In southern Seoul, 15,000 students staged anti-government marches. Students  burned a U.S. flag at a street rally and dispersed peacefully while police  stayed at a distance, apparently to avert violence.  </P> <P> Protesters were demanding the dissolution of the Defense Security Command  military intelligence, which has conducted illegal and widespread espionage on  more than 1,300 civilians.  </P> <P> In an apparent effort to divert attention from the domestic political turmoil,  Roh on Saturday said he is launching a war on escalating crime and promised to  take extraordinary measures to crack down on criminals.  </P> <P> At the rally, thousands of people waving white Korean flags jabbed their fists  in the air while shouting anti-Roh slogans.  </P> <P> There was thunderous applause when about 200 dissidents, wearing numbers to  designate their alleged file number at military intelligence headquarters,  marched onto the stage.  </P></p>

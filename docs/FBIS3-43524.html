This was disclosed by  Brigade Commander Brigadier Joe Turay in an interview with SLENA  [SIERRA LEONE NEWS AGENCY]. Brig. Joe Turay gave the names of  the three commanders as Mohamed Barry, field commander; Joseph  Brown, the chief of personnel; and the said commando Mosquito.  He said the field commander, Mohamed Barry, and Joseph Brown,  the chief of personnel were killed three days ago during an  attack at Koidu when the rebels were repelled by government  troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Conte of  the 3d Battalion.    Brig. Joe Turay further stated that government troops also  recovered documents including a map of Guinea which the then  commanders were carrying, indicating a planned attack on Guinea.  He added that a large cache of arms and ammunition were also  discovered at (Tamapondo) village along the Sierra Leone-Guinea  border during their patrol. The arms and ammunition included  bazookas and anti-aircraft double-barrel guns, rocket-propelled  grenades, AK-47 and 57 rifles, Beretta rifles, and communication  sets.    Meanwhile, Brig. Joe Turay has assured all that with the  expiration of the cease-fire, government troops are now poised  to launch a full-scale offensive against Foday Sankoh's RUF  bandits.</p>

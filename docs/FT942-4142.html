			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Poll success for Irish Greens: Early estimates of European Parliament voting Austria referendum tomorrow The Greens achieved a breakthrough in Ireland, while anti-EU parties gained ground in Denmark, according to initial projections yesterday of the results of Thursday's European Parliament voting. Final results from the elections in Britain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark will not be known until tomorrow after the rest of the 12-nation EU has voted for the Strasbourg-based parliament. In the Netherlands, the main feature of Thursday's poll was a slump in voter turnout to an all-time low of 35 per cent, down sharply from 47 per cent five years ago. However, the Christian Democrats of outgoing Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers took heart from unofficial exit polls showing they emerged as the strongest party in the election. If confirmed, this would mean they would regain the position they lost to Labour in national elections in May. Exit polls showed that the Christian Democrats won 10 seats and Labour eight. This would equal both parties' current representation, but mean a relative decline, as the number of Dutch seats has been increased by six to 31. Dutch political analysts said the low turnout benefited the Christian Democrats and worked against Labour. In Ireland, an unofficial count pointed to the Greens winning at least one, and possibly two, of the 15 Irish seats. Overturning poll predictions that the Greens would be weak outsiders, Ms Pat McKenna, the party's candidate in the four-seat Dublin constituency, topped the poll, according to figures collected by the main parties at the counting station. The two coalition parties, Fianna Fail and Labour, both suffered a drop in first preference votes, although Fianna Fail looks set to achieve its target of winning seven seats. In Denmark, two anti-EU groups with no representation in Denmark's own parliament, the People's Anti-EU Movement and the June Movement, looked set to get five of the country's 16 Strasbourg seats, according to exit polls.</p>

"Jordan is doing all it can to achieve Arab reconciliation  and is ready to do anything for the sake of the Arab Nation,"  Dr. al-Majali said in an interview published in the United Arab  Emirate's (UAE) AL-ITTIHAD newspaper.    "A reconciliation should cover all types of cooperation,  including political, economic, cultural and social."    His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States, the  prime minisiter said, aims to give impetus to the peace process  which is now facing some difficulties. The King is also seeking  to bolster the Jordanian Armed Forces and will conduct a  comprehensive review of Jordanian-U.S. relations, he said.    In reply to a question, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan  appreciated  and supported UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahayan's  initiative to restore Arab solidarity.    The prime minister described Jordanian-UAR relations as  brotherly ties and noted that Jordanians working in the UAE have  always been treated on equal footing with the UAE people.    On Jordan's mediation to end the dispute among the leaders  of  Yemen, Dr. al-Majali said His Majesty King Husayn had delegated  Royal Court chief Sharif Zayd Bin Shakir to act as mediator  carrying royal messages to the Yemeni leaders.    "Jordan considers any sucess of any Arab unity as success  for  Jordan, which seeks a greater Arab unity," he said. "It is up  to the Yemeni brothers to resolve their problems amicably and  Jordan would spare no effort to help them do that."    Nothing that is was the Yemeni leaders who had requested the  King's mediation, Dr. al-Majali said that the unity in Yemen  concerns the whole Arab world and not Jordan and Yemen alone.    Commenting on coordination between Arab states involved in  the peace process, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan is committed to  that coordination, and it hopes that the Arab parties will  succeed in exchanging land for peace in implementation of U.N.  Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.    "A just durable peace in Jordan's view entails the return of  the usurped land and water rights and the end of suffering of  the people in the region," he said.    Commenting on the Oslo accord between Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), he said that the deal  was meant as a declaration of principles and Jordan has no  alternative but to support the Palestinians in their drive to  regain their rights.    "Any gains achieved by the Palestinians would reflect  positively on us because we are brothers and together form one  nation," Dr. al-Majali said.    On the future Palestinian-Jordanian relationship, he said  that the people on the two sides of the River Jordan would have  to decide on it and determine the nature of union between them  when the time is right.    Dr. al-Majali urged Arab states to join Western creditors in  rescheduling its debts to revive the economy, rocked by foreign  debt and a sharp decline in aid.    Dr. al-Majali said the domestic economy had started to  improve since Jordan launched reforms.    "We have overcome the most difficult stages and Jordan hopes  sisterly countries (Arabs) will show understanding as was done  by friendly countries, which have rescheduled our debts," he  said.    Dr. al-Majali did not name the Arab creditors nor give  figures.    According to official Arab figures, Jordan received around  $2.1 billion of $19.5 billion extended by Gulf states in loans,  and grants in the five years before the 1990 Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait.    It has also received more than 10 per cent of the total Arab  aid of nearly $100 billion provided between 1970 and 1992.</p>

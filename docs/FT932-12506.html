			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Heseltine's plans for industry fall short Sir, The general thrust of Michael Heseltine's plans to help British industry as reported by you on April 26 ('Heseltine's plan 'to help Britain win' ') is to be welcomed. Many of his proposals regarding innovation, exports, one-stop shops and competitiveness could have been drawn point by point from Labour's own plans for partnership between government and industry. As such, they are soundly based because these plans resulted from long and detailed discussions between members of the Labour party and industry. Some of these discussions were carried out by the Labour finance and industry group. Unfortunately Mr Heseltine ignores three important elements called for by industry and essential for success. To be charitable, this may be because he has little influence over his more hide-bound colleagues. First, education. Industry needs a well-trained and educated workforce to innovate, to export, to be competitive and to manage. Second, capital investment. Britain needs a modern and well-run infrastructure to enable industry to operate effectively and cheaply. Third, finance. The City must allow industry to invest in Mr Heseltine's plans, perhaps at the cost of lower dividends and greater risk. Simon Haskel, chairman, Sir Sigmund Sternberg, deputy chairman, Labour finance &amp; industry group, Star House, 104 Grafton Road, London NW5 4BD</p>

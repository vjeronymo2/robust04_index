			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Petrovac, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem  fighting continued on Saturday for the sixth consecutive day in  the Cazin Krajina, in the northwest of the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, local Moslem media reported.  Reports on the situation on the front are, however,  contradictory. According to Radio Velkaton based in Velika  Kladusa, the center of the Moslem Autonomous Province of West  Bosnia (APZB), APZB supporters have in the past 24 hours  captured a very important height near Cazin and have inflicted  huge casualties and losses in equipment on the forces loyal to  the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo. APZB forces have suffered,  as the radio said, minimum losses.    Radio Velkaton said that troops of the army loyal to the  Bosnian Moslem hardline leader, Alija Izetbegovic, are still  deserting in large numbers and joining the ranks of the  supporters of his moderate rival, Fikret Abdic. According to  Radio Cazin, a town under control of Izetbegovic's forces, the  forces loyal to Izetbegovic have managed to recapture an  important portion of the territories near Cazin in the past 24  hours.    Inter-Moslem fighting has been underway in the Cazin Krajina  since last October, when Abdic proclaimed the APZB opposing  Izetbegovic's belligerent policy. He also immediatelly  concluded peace agreements with Bosnian Serbs and Croats.</p>

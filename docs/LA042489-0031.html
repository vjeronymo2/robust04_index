			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Cineplex Session Expected: Directors of Cineplex Odeon Corp., the Canadian  movie-theater concern, are expected to hold a board meeting Thursday that could  prove tempestuous. The board has been urged by 49%-shareholder MCA to form an  independent committee to weigh the impact of Cineplex Chairman Garth H.  Drabinsky's plan to lead a group in buying a 30% stake controlled by the  Charles R. Bronfman family. MCA -- which has fought the private transaction --  could wind up dominating such a committee if seven directors directly involved  in the deal are eliminated. Of the remaining 9 Cineplex board seats, MCA holds  five.  </P></p>

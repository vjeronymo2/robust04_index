			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US rain-starved crops wilt in heat - Drought in America's south-east is untimely WHILE THE Midwest, America's agricultural heartland, is awash with flood waters, farmers in the south-east are struggling with severe drought and blistering heat. And, with little relief from the dryness and high temperatures in sight over the next few months, agricultural losses in the region are likely to mount. Georgia's governor, Mr Zell Miller, who toured drought-stricken parts of his state last week warned: 'All indications are that these conditions will continue to worsen'. The drought area stretches from Virginia southward through Georgia and westward across Alabama and Mississippi. In the worst hit states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, rainfall has been below normal for three months, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Temperatures in much of the area have recently been averaging around 38`C (100`F). 'Crops are being very severely stressed,' says one USDA meteorological official. It says conditions for poultry and livestock are adverse. The three worst-hit states are significant producers of maize, soyabeans, tobacco, cotton, and peanuts as well as poultry and livestock. The drought, considered the worst since 1986, combined with heat over the past month or so has worsened growing conditions at crucial times for crops. Soyabeans, for example, were at a critical moment for blooms in the second half of July, and cotton, which is normally at least knee high in July, was flowering just six inches off the ground. 'It is very definitely untimely,' says Mr Ray Motha, an official at the USDA. Agricultural losses have already risen to such calamitous levels that the governors of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia have requested that Washington declare part or all of their states federal disaster areas. The designation would allow farmers to receive low interest government loans and other emergency aid. The Dollars 4.3bn flood relief bill pending in congress would help drought victims and farmers affected by the floods. The drought has attracted attention of Farm Aid, a private group that provides relief donations to farmers. On July 30, country music star Mr Willie Nelson presented a Dollars 10,000 cheque to a federation of southern farming co-operatives. In South Carolina, especially suffering in the dryness and heat, estimates of agricultural losses are already running above Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m). The figure represents 17 per cent of the state's annual total Dollars 1.2bn in agricultural production, according to South Carolina's Department of Agriculture. One farmer in the western part of the state says his land had not seen rain between May 10 and July 20. Georgia estimates its losses at Dollars 500m and North Carolina puts its losses so far at Dollars 100m. Overall, maize and soyabeans are the most affected crops in the three states, followed by tobacco, cotton, peanuts, the forage crops of hay and pastures, chickens, hogs and cattle. In North Carolina 57 per cent of the maize crop is in poor or very poor condition, while in South Carolina and Georgia 95 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, of the maize crop is calculated to have been lost. In South Carolina, 58 per cent of the 505,000 acre soyabean crop is in poor or very poor shape, and in Georgia 48 per cent of the soyabean crop is in poor or very poor condition. A remarkable 75 per cent of the cotton crop in South Carolina is reported in poor or very poor condition, and a quarter of the Georgia crop is rated similarly, according to the USDA weekly crop report. The south-east, which is the largest US chicken-raising area, has not yet reported region-wide figures on birds lost. But some 1.8m birds have died in South Carolina and another 300,000 in Georgia. Ms Mary Clouse, editor of Poultry Grower News in Pittsboro, North Carolina, called the regional losses 'enormous'. The region is not expected to see much relief from the grueling heat and dryness in the coming weeks, according to the US National Weather Service. In its 90-day forecast, issued on July 30, the agency said the region had a 55 per cent probability of above normal temperatures. And it would only make a 50-50 guess that the area would see relatively normal rainfall over the next 30 days. For some crops, rain over the next month could bring recovery. A fresh measure of the losses will come on August 11 when the USDA's crop report is expected to indicate how adversely yields will have been affected.</p>

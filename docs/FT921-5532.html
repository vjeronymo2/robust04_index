His fear, and that of President Havel, is that 'even if we succeed in maintaining the federation it will consume our energy for a long time' and divert attention from reforming the political and economic system. The controversial shipment of 250 Slovak-made tanks to Syria illustrates the problem. 'If they had been made in Bohemia it would be a different matter. But in Slovakia, where former communists and the managers of military factories have been elected as mayors in cities dependent on the arms trade, for the federal government to prohibit their export just provides ammunition for Slovak nationalists.'

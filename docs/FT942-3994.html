			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Property: Life on the open water - Considering living afloat? James Fisher looks at London's range of moorings Life on the open water is an attractive and romantic notion - and there are places in London where it can be achieved. Splice the mainbrace, cast off, catch the tide and sail off into the sunset. Well, not quite: most houseboats no longer have engines, and the emphasis is definitely on the 'house' rather than the 'boat' - although the latter is needed to keep it afloat. There are roughly 200 moorings for houseboats on the tidal river, usually in small enclaves at places such as Chiswick, Twickenham, Isleworth and Kew. The largest of these is also the most familiar - off Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, there are 58 moorings. Boats are often sold privately, by word of mouth or through specialist publications. The market is thus fairly restricted. Ship brokers are more likely than estate agents to act for vendors. However, the Chelsea Yacht &amp; Boat Company, which owns and maintains the Cheyne Walk moorings, sells through estate agents Browett Taylor &amp; Co. There are up to half-a-dozen houseboats for sale at any one time in this narrow market. Michael Woolf, a partner at Browett Taylor, estimates that two or three are sold at Cheyne Walk every year. Woolf reckons that houseboats traditionally perform ahead of inflation, but they did not achieve the same dramatic price rises as properties on dry land. Equally, they have not been so adversely affected by the recession. Prices range from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 200,000. The larger houseboats, 85ft long or more, are spacious, well-appointed craft with three or four cabins, reception and dining room, kitchen and bathrooms. On the larger boats, a master cabin and a double bedroom with shower room are usually found aft. In the forward section there are often three bedrooms, a bathroom, reception room and kitchen/dining space. Currently, Browett's has the boat Broedertrouw II on the market at Pounds 75,000. Maintenance charges cost about Pounds 20 per foot per year. For this, the Chelsea Yacht &amp; Boat Company provides all the mains services, along with mail facilities, refuse collection and general maintenance of pontoons and moorings. The company will also carry out repairs. To live in a houseboat, you need a mooring licence, which can be bought annually, subject to agreement, or for nine years at Pounds 100 per foot, or 18 years at Pounds 150 per foot. And there are other overheads to take into account. The Chelsea Yacht &amp; Boat Company requires each boat to have a full marine survey in a dry dock every three years. Like any other domestic property, houseboats are subject to council tax, and are banded according to value. However, unlike other domestic property, it is not always possible to raise a mortgage on a houseboat. If the right property cannot be found in the chosen location, new moorings can be established. The Port of London Authority will usually grant permission for moorings in suitable sites. However, in the main, local authorities are not co-operative and, unfortunately, they hold sway over the River Works Licence, which is required to institute a development. The London Tideway Harbour Company is actively seeking locations for more moorings, but progress is slow, and success has been limited. British Waterways, the government agency, owns the water, and manages the sites for canals in and around London, including Little Venice. Pat Murray, customer services manager for British Waterways, was not prepared to talk about prices or fees, insisting that this was a private matter, but did say that there was a waiting list for moorings managed by the agency.

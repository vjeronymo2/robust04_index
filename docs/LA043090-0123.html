			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> $2-MILLION VIOLINS RECOVERED  </P> <P> Soviet ballerina Natalia Makarova and her husband have their 18th-Century  violins back, including the Stradivarius that was snatched in a daring burglary  at their house.  </P> <P> Police on Sunday evening arrested Robert Fisher, 27, of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The recovered Stradivarius was worth more than $1 million. The other violin, a  Guarnerius, was valued at about $1 million, police spokesman David Ambrose  said.  </P> <P> The violins, jewelry and a pair of Chinese enameled statuettes were among items  stolen Saturday from the home of Makarova and her husband, Edward Karkar.  Makarova, 49, recently retired from the American Ballet Theatre.  </P> <P> The couple's 1986 Mercedes-Benz was also stolen. Police said Fisher was  arrested as he walked away from the car after parking it about a mile from the  house. Most of the stolen items were in the car, Ambrose said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, he didn't realize what he had taken. For that we can be thankful,"  said Karkar. The violins are his, and he said he practices on them regularly.  </P></p>

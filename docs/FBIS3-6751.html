WASHINGTON TIMES said Seiji Yoshida, an officer of the old  Japanese Army, confessed that he, together with his men,  kidnapped more than 1,000 young Korean girls as "comfort women  fo the army" and threw them into a concentration camp, but he  had not been put to a trial after the war.    Noting that nearly 200,000 Korean women are said to have  been  drafted as "comfort women for the army", the paper said such  atrocities were committed on the instructions of the then top  authorities of Japan.    The Belgian paper SOLIDAIRE said the Japanese Army not only  forcibly drafted Korean women as sex slaves but also  unhesitatingly committed such beastly atrocities as murdering  "comfort women" by dismembering and burning them in groups after  satisfying their sexual desire.    The Malaysian paper SIN CHEW JIT POH said that the Japanese  "imperial Army's" history of rape and murder was a filthy  history, a history of ruining women.    Hiroshi Takeuchi, mayor of Handa, Japan, told a press  conference that truth is one, not two or three, however hard the  government may try to conceal facts. He demanded a clear probe  into the damages inflicted upon the Korean people and their  backgrounds.    Lidi Alajandro, general secretary of the New Progressive  Union of the Philippines, recalled that the Japanese  imperialists drafted a large number of women and forced them to  serve as "comfort women for the army" during the Second World  War. He said this is unpardonable and Japanese Government must  bear responsibility for this.    The AZAP News Agency of Zaire said the Japanese Government  could never evade its responsibility for the misfortunes and  sufferings inflicted upon the Korean people and human rights  abuses. It must make a proper apology and compensations to the  DPRK Government, urged the news agency.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NFL EXHIBITION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HOME FANS SEE WHY 49ERS WON THE TITLE  </P> <P> Backup fullback Harry Sydney ran for one touchdown and caught a pass from Joe  Montana for another as the San Francisco 49ers cruised to a 35-17 preseason  victory over the Broncos at Denver Saturday night.  </P> <P> Tailback Terrence Flagler keyed two scoring drives in his third consecutive  impressive showing for the 49ers (2-1), playing at home for the first time  since winning the Super Bowl last January.  </P> <P> John Elway, scheduled to start at quarterback for Denver (1-2), sat out the  game because his left knee brace was missing. He wears it as a precautionary  measure to protect the knee, which has been operated on three times since high  school.  </P> <P> Third-stringer Ken Karcher, who's vying with Gary Kubiak for the No. 2 job  behind Elway, directed the Broncos on a 72-yard drive in the first quarter for  the early lead. His 27-yard pass to Pat Kelly put Denver in scoring position  and Rafael Septien, the regular kicker in the absence of holdout Rich Karlis,  kicked a 26-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> The 49ers struck back behind Montana with touchdowns on their next three  possessions for a 21-3 lead. Montana completed 13 of 19 passes for 124 yards  and a touchdown in one half of action, and has now completed 67% in the  preseason.  </P> <P> Flagler's 74-yard kickoff return set the 49ers up for a short scoring drive,  capped by Roger Craig's one-yard sweep into the end zone for a 7-3 lead.  </P> <P> Flagler gained 35 yards in three carries on the 49ers' next possession before  Sydney raced over the left side for the score. Flagler, a 1987 first-round  draft pick limited by injury to nine career carries, rushed 10 times for 65  yards and is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt in the preseason.  </P> <P> Montana then went five for five to engineer a 61-yard march, with the last pass  to Sydney for a six-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> A dozen 49ers regulars from their Super Bowl team, including seven defensive  starters, did not play. Eight players remain holdouts and nose tackle Michael  Carter headed a list of four injured regulars.  </P> <P> New England 17, Seattle 12 -- Defensive back Jim Bowman returned a  third-quarter fumble 21 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a victory in  St. Louis' first NFL game since the Cardinals left for Phoenix after the 1987  season.  </P> <P> The Seahawks drove to the New England six-yard-line in the final minute, but  Jeff Kemp threw four incomplete passes to turn the ball over to the Patriots  with 16 seconds left.  </P> <P> Houston 26, Miami 10 -- Backup quarterback Cody Carlson threw two touchdown  passes and the Oilers held the Dolphins to 200 yards of total offense at  Jacksonville, Fla.  </P> <P> Miami (0-2) managed only 29 yards rushing and 171 passing. The Dolphins had 68  yards total offense in the second half, including five yards rushing.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 24, Cleveland 21 -- Dwight Stone caught a 43-yard touchdown pass and  ran 42 yards on a reverse late in the fourth quarter to set up the game-winning  touchdown and lead the Steelers at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Todd Blackledge, the Steelers' third quarterback, threw the winning touchdown  to Weegie Thompson on fourth-and-goal from the Cleveland 4 with 1:29 to play.  </P> <P> The game was a preview of the teams' regular-season opener Sept. 10 in  Pittsburgh.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Committed to reality rather than concepts Five Protagonists is a somewhat portentous title for what is, in the event, a long-overdue and salutary exercise in critical rehabilitation. Indeed, modest in scale though not in scope, it offers a gentle and timely rebuke to our curatorial masters for their enduring neglect of so many of our most distinguished artists, for no greater a crime than their failure to toe the official avant-garde line. Here is a show by its very nature more appropriate to a public institution than a private commercial gallery: and here are painters at least as serious in their address and rewarding in their accomplishment as any post-modern, neo-dada, carcass-celebrating conceptualist, still wet behind the ears. And would Euan Uglow ever be offered the British Pavilion at a Venice Biennale ahead of, shall we say, an Antony Gormley, or Patrick George be given a first retrospective at the Tate in place of Richard Hamilton's third, or Myles Murphy be asked to choose a show at the Serpentine instead of Damien Hirst? No comment. But Protagonist? Here perhaps lies the problem. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary gives protagonist first as 'the chief personage in a drama; the principal character . . . etc': its second, and more indefinite, meaning as 'a leading personage in any contest; a champion of any cause.' And here we have these five painters, all of whom were taught one way or another by William Coldstream - Patrick George and Anthony Eyton at Camberwell just after the war; Euan Uglow, Myles Murphy and Craigie Aitchison at the Slade in the early 1950s. All were friends, united by shared houses and common interests. Above all they maintained then, and retain now, their commitment, drawn from Coldstream, to the direct response to the visible world. Since then they have gone their several ways; Aitchison withdrawing into a private and idiosyncratic symbolism; Eyton moving towards a more directly gestural and expressive response; George developing a delicately measured impressionism; Murphy reconciling the monumental and descriptive to the painted flatness of the canvas; and Uglow ever measuring and looking, and measuring, looking again with preternatural precision. It is one of the delights of the show that we may follow such individual development by the examples shown, early, middle and late. But where is the drama of which even one of them should be chief personage, where the contest, where the common cause to champion? The short answer is that there never was one, and each artist was only ever the chief actor in his own play. Would their story have been different had they made common cause, issued manifestos, proselytised and campaigned - in short persuaded the powers that be they were a force to reckon with and take seriously? The Young post-art-school Turks of today hardly need the telling. The unconscious irony of Five Protagonists is that it is precisely because its heroes were never protagonists at all that they suffer their present comparative neglect. Successful they may be in the private and local market, but on the scale of international critical values they scarcely register at all. Better after all to have been hung together than to hang alone. And yet an artist such as Euan Uglow remains what he has manifestly been these 20 years, and always was in prospect, one of the best and most interesting artists of his time. His paintings take on the ambition not of current notoriety or fad, but rather of the great humanist tradition in western art of which he and his kind represent the enduring vigour. His work is important and, forgive the jargon, relevant to us now, not because it proposes some trivial conceit or intellectual by-play, not because it is about fashionable ideas of process or identity, not because it is about anything, but only because it is what it is, as it is achieved on the canvas. Here is the human figure, scrutinised long and hard in its physical reality, for us to contemplate in our turn, in the light of our own experience of the world. What may be said of Uglow may said as well for George, Murphy and the rest of them - and they are not alone. In the generation at least of artists now over 50, who had the luck to train before the study of the figure was abandoned for the study of ideas and concepts, there are any number of truly serious, figurative, modern painters, more and of a higher quality perhaps than anywhere else in the world. The only scandal is that we do not celebrate them as we should. Five Protagonists: Browse &amp; Darby, 19 Cork Street W1, until May 21.</p>

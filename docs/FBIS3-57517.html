In his words, the Supreme Soviet is now discussing the  points  that are out of line with the country's national interests.    In the meantime, Goryn says it is up to a new parliament, to  be elected on March 27, to consider the ratification of the  Moscow declaration because of inability by the Supreme Soviet to  take a measured resolution on the issue. He said the parliament  would adopt a resolution, but with some strings attached.    Last November, the parliament ratified the Start-I agreement  and the Lisbon protocol, but conditioned that to economic aid  and security guarantees to Ukraine. The Lisbon protocol was  ratified without its article 5 which provided for Kiev's  adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a nuclear  free state.    President Kravchuk on Tuesday called on parliament to  approve  the protocol in full, arguing that the tripartite Moscow  agreement met all of the parliament's stipulations for ratifying  the paper.    However, Goryn said the President's statement "goes beyond  the framework of the parliamentary resolution."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] By the middle of the current year, all oil  exporters will be determined by the Russian Government. This  matter was previously dealt with by the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations. This decision has been made by the  government commission on operational issues. In the opinion of  experts at the RIKA news agency, the government commission's  decision is connected with the fact that the state budget  received just $6.9 billion of the $8.5 billion revenue from  state oil export quotas. In order to prevent petrodollars  leaking abroad, a group of authorized banks will soon be  entrusted with the handling of oil exporters' accounts.</p>

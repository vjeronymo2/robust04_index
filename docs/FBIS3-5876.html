			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Tax reform should not be  made as an immediate and permanent measure simply to address the  Japan-U.S. trade dispute, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  indicated Friday [11 March].    The government and the ruling coalition parties are to  decide  on a "full-fledged" tax reform by the year-end while mindful of  the effects of already-decided income tax cuts worth some 6  trillion yen for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, Fujii told a  regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    "That's how it should be done," Fujii said, rejecting calls  for an immediate decision on a permanent income tax cut as a  measure to boost domestic demand to help reduce Japan's trade  imbalance.    In a press meeting in Tokyo on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher said keeping tax cuts to a single year  is not enough to stimulate the economy.    Fujii has been stressing that Japan will decide by the  year-end on permanent tax reform with a "balanced system in  income, assets, and consumption" to cope with the aging society.    Asked about views being expressed within the ruling  coalition  about the need to show some direction in the tax plan together  with a "voluntary" market-access package to be decided by the  end of the month, Fujii said, "that's the coalition parties'  problem."    On the market-access package, Fujii said, "I haven't heard  of  any clear talks" of compiling it in two stages -- this month and  before the summit of the Group of Seven major nations in Italy  in July.    "But realistically speaking," he said, "I think it will come  that way, although I will have to say no to any reference as a  two-stage plan."    The package will be decided by the end of the month, but  details, including those in priority fields, will be discussed  later, Fujii said.    Christopher, at a news conference after meeting Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata,  said Thursday that the United States would assess the  possibility of reviving the trade framework talks after  reviewing the package.    Meanwhile, Fujii said he has no plan yet to ask for a  bilateral meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen  when finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum meet in Hawaii on March 18 to 19.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (9): Red dragon campaign is gathering pace - Food and Drink THE red dragon of Wales, long familiar at Cardiff Arms Park and other sporting venues, is being seen increasingly in shops and supermarkets as the campaign to promote Welsh food and drink gathers pace. There are more than 40 organisations with varying degrees of responsibility for the development or promotion of Welsh foods and the scale of the fragmentation was a big factor in the creation of the government-backed Welsh Food Promotions company two years ago to act as an umbrella organisation. 'Our chief aim is to put Welsh food on the UK, European and international map by developing and co-ordinating all food-related activities,' says Mr Peter Budd, chief executive. 'What we are trying to do is create a Welsh food brand so that when people see the Red Dragon they equate it with a quality product.' The company, funded by the Welsh Development Agency, Wales Tourist Board and the Development Board for Rural Wales has a brief that spans the entire industry from the farmer and primary producer through processing, marketing, retailing or catering, to the table. One of the first actions was to develop a brand image in the form of the dragon logo. Its use is being increased at displays of Welsh food so that it can develop into a widely-recognised symbol of quality. Until recently, Wales had a reputation as something of a culinary desert, with recognition limited to lamb, leeks and laver bread. There is now a growing number of international-class restaurants and a lengthy list of specialist-quality products such as cheeses, mineral waters, confectionery and even wines. The challenge remains to get them better used within Wales, particularly at catering establishments, and better known outside Wales, in the rest of the UK and internationally. Hence the growing list of promotions and exhibitions. Wales, more than other parts of the UK, is typified by the large number of tiny producers throughout the food sector. Many are too small to market their products effectively in a retail environment dominated by supermarkets. The next big move is likely to be the launch of a retail shop for Welsh food products in Cardiff. Test-marketing is under way and the shop could be open later this year. Although there has been an emphasis on finding new products to promote, great progress has been made in marketing one of the country's traditional products, lamb. As Mr Budd says: 'We are very good in Wales at producing grass and this means we produce the best lamb.' Seven years ago, exports of Welsh lamb were negligible, whereas now exports to Europe are worth Pounds 50m a year and it is a rapidly-expanding market. Welsh Lamb Enterprise, now part of Welsh Food Promotions, reckons demand from overseas could more than double in five years. Exports this year are already up by 40 per cent on those of 1992. More than 600,000 carcasses will be exported to Spain this year and the success of this campaign will form the basis of assaults on other European Community countries, including Greece and Germany, both potentially big markets. The small, lean Welsh lamb carcasses are particularly popular in Mediterranean countries and special cuts are also being developed for France, where sales are held back because of the limited attraction of the larger local product. Spanish preference is for loins of lamb, while consumers in Portugal and Greece demand the shoulder and the French and Italians prefer leg. A new factory, due to be commissioned next year, will process local lamb into a range of oven-ready products for the UK retail trade, thus opening up substantial new markets at home. Other important niche markets being increasingly exploited because of the high added-value are spring water, speciality cheeses, organic vegetables and even Welsh wine and whisky. There are at least 15 Welsh bottled-water producers jostling in a competitive but growing market, including Ty Nant in its distinctive blue bottle, Prysg, Decantae and Brecon Beacons water. A dedicated handfull of wine-makers across south and east Wales grow grapes in fickle weather conditions but only one, Llanerch vineyard in the Vale of Glamorgan, makes its own wine on the premises. Peter and Diana Andrews, formerly pharmacists, produce more than 10,000 bottles of Cariad wine a year. Half is sold through the farm shop and the other half to restaurants, hotels and for hospitality and corporate events. There are a large number of cheese producers, many of whom make small quantities of high-quality produce such as farmhouse Caerphilly, Pencarreg and Llanboidy. However, individual marketing has led to limited success beyond the borders of Wales because of the high cost. Mr Tony Craske, founder of Abergavenny Fine Foods which makes a number of specialist cheeses, believes there is a value in promoting Welsh food as a brand. 'It can raise people's perception of Welsh produce, particularly in the media, but ultimately we all stand or fall on the quality of our individual products.'</p>

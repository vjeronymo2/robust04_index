			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["GGD/MJN" report: "Air Force To `Armor' Cockpit of C-130 </F> Aircraft"]    [Text] Brussels, 24 May (BELGA) -- The Air Force, which has  been facing growing threats posed by light weapons to its  transport aircraft, has decided to enhance the safety of the  crew in the cockpit of the C-130 aircraft, said a military  source on Tuesday [24 May].    The Air Force will thus purchase four sets of kevlar plates,  a light and resistant material, which will be used to protect  the crew of the "Hercules" C-130 aircraft of the 15th Airborne  Transport Division when overflying zones from where they may be  fired at with light weapons. In addition, all aircraft will be  equipped with anchor points so that the plates can be easily  fitted if necessary.    Military sources remind that three C-130 were hit by bullets  during the "Silver Back" and "Blue Safari" operations  [evacuation of Belgian nationals and UN troops from Rwanda] last  month. Moreover, the Belgian planes that sometimes fly to  Sarajevo are the only ones not to be equipped with a protection  system, said a pilot.    Several countries like the United States and Great Britain  have been using different systems to protect the aircraft crews.    The Belgian Air Force has thus decided to acquire a similar  protection. It earmarked 25 million Belgian francs to purchase  four kits and to have anchor points installed on its 12  aircraft. "Still, we will have to find the means to equip more  planes," said General Major Wilfried de Brouwer, deputy Air  Force chief of staff.    The procurement request has been made and the first  deliveries are expected before the end of this year.    In addition, the Air Force is implementing the last phase of  the modernization of its C-130 aircraft, which should make it  possible for them to remain operational until the year 2010,  i.e., 30 years after they were introduced. A new avionics  system (electronic navigation system) is to replace the  traditional navigation instruments which were designed in the  sixties. Military sources said that the aircraft prototype is  being transformed in the Sabena workshops at Brussels National  Airport. It should be ready to fly by the fall to perform the  necessary tests before it can be put into service.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Paolo Biondi; place and date not given: "Fini: No Disagreement  Among Us; We All Support the Government" -- first paragraph is  L'INFORMAZIONE introduction]    [Text] He won 100,000 more votes than Berlusconi in the  South. That was enough to make AN [National Alliance leader]  Fini the Knight [Berlusconi's nickname] of the South. And in  order to show that he too has now become a knight, with his own  sword, he immediately issued messages of war to those within his  party (sorry, movement) who want to wage war on him: "Let there  by all means be a policy debate, but once a decision has been  made.... It must be remembered that we are now a government  force and every vote must be used for the policy deliberately  adopted by us all."    [Biondi] Pino Rauti has reaffirmed the need to differentiate  the National Alliance from the Italian Social Movement [MSI].  Do you agree?    [Fini] The AN is a confederation of elements including the  MSI, which is not the only one. I see no need for major  differences, partly because hitherto the AN line has been backed  by 99 percent of the movement and 90 percent of the MSI.    [Biondi] What are the prospects for the 10 percent that  disagrees?    [Fini] It will try to make its arguments prevail. I see no  problems of any kind.    [Biondi] Is there room for a right-wing opposition within  the  AN?    [Fini] I hope that within our movement there is no room for  a  government and an opposition. In a movement it is policy that  counts, and once that has been adopted, it must be the same for  everyone.    [Biondi] But since there is no longer a right-wing  opposition  in Italy, will anyone be able to occupy that space?    [Fini] I see no such danger. People engage in opposition in  order to defend rights that are being trampled, not as a  preconceived stance. If, as I hope, the AN succeeds in having  the government implement the policies that we advocated when we  were in opposition, there will be no reason to occupy the  "space" you mention.    [Biondi] [Interior Minister] Maroni has talked about the  possibility of coordination between the government forces. Do  you consider it possible?    [Fini] I found that statement by Maroni interesting, but I  did not fully understand it. Local cooperation is certainly  possible when you vote for a mayor backed by a coalition of  forces. If there is an electoral reform in the direction of a  first-past-the-post system featuring a single round, then  obviously cooperation will be facilitated. But that does not  mean unification.    [Biondi] [Prime Minister] Berlusconi said that there could  be  an election in the fall. What do you think?    [Fini] I do not think there will be an election. I neither  hope for nor fear an election. Having said that, I see no  chance of one, unless the opposition forces in the Senate  continue their stubborn attitude and prevent the government from  governing, against the will again expressed by the voters. It  all depends on what the Popular Party does in the Senate, but I  think that it is not in their interest to continue stubbornly  opposing the government.    [Biondi] What stance will you adopt in Europe?    [Fini] I have already initiated contacts with other European  politicians. I would rather not discuss them at present.  Certainly, we will not be either with the European left-wing  forces or with the European right-wing forces of the outgoing  European Parliament, so we will not be with [French National  Front leader] Le Pen, for instance.    [Biondi] At public rallies importance has been attached to  ideological issues...    [Fini] I have no intention of returning to the past and to  old polemics. In any case, the Italian people have shown that  they are not interested in this nonsense but in specifics.  Berlusconi's great result is reflected in his occupying the  prime ministership and by his promise to resolve the economic  crisis. All the rest is nonsense.</p>

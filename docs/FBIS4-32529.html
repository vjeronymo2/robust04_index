			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, June 25 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem forces  continued firing on positions of the Bosnian Serb army in the  past 24 hours in the northern, western, central and other parts  of the Bosnian Serb republic. This is a flagrant violation of  the agreement reached in Geneva by the two warring sides to  refrain from military activity and which entered into force on  June 10. The Moslem forces strongly attacked with all kinds of  weapons including heavy artillery the area of Srbobran (former  Donji Vakuf) and Mt Vlasic in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG  learns from Serb military sources.    A number of attacks were also registered in the area of  Teslic, Doboj, Ozren, Gradacac, Orasje and Trebava, in  northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moslem armed action was also  registered in other northeastern parts of Bosnia -- in the  Olovo-Kladanj direction, in the area of Mt Majevica and in the  Zvornik area. Moslems launched artillery and mortar attacks on  the town of Teslic without inflicting any casualties but causing  considerable material damages on civilian facilities.    Joint forces of the Croat Defense Council (HVO) and the  regular Croatian troops use anti-aircraft guns in their attacks  on the Orasje front. The Moslems tried to inflitrate a  sabotage-terrorist group in the Orasje part of the front  Saturday morning but the group was routed, the press center of  the First Krajina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army reports.    Moslem action did not stop along the Bihac-Krupa  confrontation line in western Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serb military  sources state. Moslems also continued attacks on Serb territory  from the direction of Gorazde, Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia  which has been declared a safe area by the United Nations.</p>

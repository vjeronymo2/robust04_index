			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 9  March publishes an approximately 4,000-word report on a  four-hour seminar held by the newspaper on the health situation  in Iraq and the performance of the Iraqi Ministry of Health.  The date of the seminar is not given. The seminar, which is  moderated by AL-JUMHURIYAH Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar, hosts  Dr. Shawqi Murqus, senior under secretary of the Iraqi Ministry  of Health, several Health Ministry officials, and a number of  specialist physicians.    The moderator opens the seminar by stating that the Ministry  of Health has become the subject of criticism, as people have  continued to air their grievances regarding the health services  rendered to citizens. He adds that some of these grievances are  justified, while others lack accuracy. He acknowledges that  there are some loopholes that need to be plugged, and that some  individual practices need to be corrected. He maintains that  those voicing criticism have forgotten that Iraq is subjected to  a medicine embargo that is denying Iraq free access to medical  requirements. He then invites the AL-JUMHURIYAH press team to  ask their questions and voice their remarks regarding the health  situation in the country.    One reporter complains of uncleanliness and malnutrition in  state-owned hospitals. Another reporter notes the scarcity of  children vaccines and medicine shortages at these hospitals. He  adds that some medical employees are asking for, and obtaining  bribes. He also notes the deterioration in the performance of  some high tech medical equipment. Furthermore, he charges that  private medical institutions are charging high prices. To  corroborate their arguments, reporters cite grievances contained  in letters received by the paper.    Respsonding to these grievances, Dr. Shawqi Murqus, senior  under secretary of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, pays tribute to  the Iraqi medical institutions and personnel for protecting Iraq  against epidemics in war conditions. Had it not been for the  conscientiousness, honesty, and personal integrity of Iraqi  medical personnel, epidemics would have spread in Iraq in the  aftermath of the Gulf war, Dr. Murqus adds.    Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 14 March continues to  report on the seminar held by the paper on the health situation  in Iraq. It publishes on page seven an approximately 4,500-word  report on the seminar prepared by Nu'man Sirt and Asma' Muhammad  Mustafa.    In this report, Dr. Murqus notes the "criminal economic  embargo" clamped on Iraq, and its repercussions on the health  situation in the country. To show how difficult it is for the  Iraqi Ministry of Health to purchase medicines, he cites  Britain's "inhumanity", as illustrated by its failure to  authorize the shipment to Iraq of medicines for angina pectoris,  although Iraq had concluded agreements in this regard with  British medicine manufacturers.    Dr. Murqus adds: "The British Government has banned the  shipment of Angised, a product of Bruce Wellcome, although the  British manufacturer had received the cost of the purchases,  which totaled $150,000. The British are well aware that this  medicine is used by angina pectoris victims, and that the  failure to supply patients with it could lead to death."    When pressed further, citing Iraq's need for this medicine,  the British Government replied that the medicine in question  contains small granules of a material called glyceryl  trinitrate, and contended that trinitrate is used in the  production of explosives.    With regard to the services the Iraqi Ministry of Health is  rendering to the population, Dr. Murqus says: "The Ministry of  Health provides 250,000 patients suffering from chronic  illnesses with the necessary medicines throughout the year,  without interruption. A one-month or two-month interruption in  the supplies of these medicines means inevitable death. These  medicines are dispensed to patients through government outlets,  namely, popular clinics."    Dr. Murqus adds that the ability to provide these patients  with medicines throughout the year since the enforcement of the  UN sanctions is a "great accomplishment."    The Health Ministry official admits that some ministry  medicines are sold on the black market. Nevertheless, he claims  that Iraqi physicians are conscientious and creative, and that  they are conducting sophisticated brain and heart surgery under  the tough embargo circumstances. He also commends the efforts  made by Iraqi preventive medicine personnel, who have protected  Iraq from malaria and cholera. He says that cholera surfaced in  the country in 1991 only to disappear in 1992. He also notes  the services offered by the private medical institutions in the  country, and admits that they charge high prices to patients.  He expresses hope that the medical system in Iraq will be  refurbished and developed once the embargo is lifted.    Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 21 March continues to  report on the seminar held by the paper on the health situation  in the country. It publishes on page 7 an approximately  4,000-word report on the seminar.    Dr. Murqus comments on remarks made by the reporters  regarding the need for a police report before accident victims  are admitted to hospital. The moderator cites examples of  doctors in state-owned health clinics prescribing medicines  without examining patients, underscoring the seriousness of the  problem. A Health Ministry official replies by saying that  there will be stricter monitoring of medical practice. The  moderator argues that the media should assist health  institutions by monitoring the health situation in the country,  enlightening citizens, and reporting problems and grievances.    Concluding the seminar, the moderator says that  AL-JUMHURIYAH  is ready to dedicate a weekly column to clarifications from the  Ministry of Health in order to help the ministry enlighten  people and clarify some matters which might have been  misunderstood by the public.    This appears to be the final report on the seminar, as the  paper's 21 March edition does not promise any further reportage.    Jordan Bureau does not plan any further processing of the  Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOME' IS ALL ALONE IN FIRST PLACE  </P> <P> Kid stars dramatically upstaged superstars Robert Redford and Cher at the  weekend box office, as a trio of youth-oriented titles led by the runaway hit  "Home Alone" topped the charts with combined ticket sales of more than $27  million. (See box-office chart, F2.)  </P> <P> "Mermaids," the first film from Cher since her '87 Academy Award-winning  performance in "Moonstruck," drew opening weekend ticket sales of $3.5 million  on 920 screens, for a weak per-screen average of $3,820, and sixth place.  </P> <P> "Havana," which marks the seventh teaming of Redford and director Sydney  Pollack -- following the 1985 Oscar winner "Out of Africa" -- had opening  weekend receipts of $2.2 million on 824 screens, for a disappointing per-screen  average of $2,640, and ninth place.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, first place again went to 20th Century Fox's family comedy "Home  Alone." Starring Macaulay Culkin as a plucky 8-year-old who must defend the  homestead when he's inadvertently left home alone for the holidays, the film  earned $11.6 million on 2,017 screens for a per-screen average of $5,760. After  five weeks' release, it has now grossed $99.3 million.  </P> <P> Tri-Star Pictures' "Look Who's Talking Too" grabbed second place with receipts  of $8.1 million. The sequel to last year's fall sleeper, this one about a trio  of wise-cracking toddlers who "speak" via voice-overs by Bruce Willis, Roseanne  Barr and Damon Wayans, opened at 1,576 theaters where it averaged $5,140 per  screen.  </P> <P> Fox's comedy-drama "Edward Scissorhands," directed by Tim Burton  ("Beetlejuice," "Batman") and starring Johnny Depp as an extraordinary young  man with scissors for hands, was third with ticket sales of $6.3 million. In  its first week of wide release on 1,023 screens, the film had a per-screen  average of $6,183.  </P> <P> Elsewhere among the Top 10: "Dances With Wolves" (Orion Pictures) was fourth  with $4.5 million; "Misery" (Columbia Pictures), fifth, $4 million; "The  Rookie" (Warner Bros.), seventh, $3.5 million; "Three Men and a Little Lady"  (Buena Vista), eighth, $2.7 million; "Predator II" (Fox), tenth, $1.2 million.  </P></p>

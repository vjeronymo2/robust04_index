			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lilia Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The international conference  on problems of refugees and displaced persons on the territory  of the former USSR, which opened here today, is to discuss the  reasons and consequences of forced migration, the legal status  of refugees, and the role of public organisations in the effort  to alleviate the lot of Russian citizens, who are compelled to  seek asylum in Russia.    In his greetings to the participants of the conference,  President Boris Yeltsin noted that "a tight knot of  contradictions" was created by the problem of refugees, and that  it could be resolved only "on the basis of common sense, good  will, sense of responsibility to the current and future  generations, and through corresponding state agreements".  Expressing the conviction that Russia's efforts in this  direction would be crowned with success, the president wished  the forum successful and fruitful work.    The speakers, who took the floor during the conference, drew  attention to the problem of guaranteeing human rights and  liberties, to the lot of national minorities in Russia, in the  CIS countries, and in the Baltic states. They focused on the  need to ensure the property rights of refugees, to settle their  housing problems, to provide them with jobs, and to help them  adapt themselves to the new places of residence.    The importance of the problem is borne out by the figures  contained in the report delivered by head of the Russian Federal  Migration Service Tatyana Regent. She said that there were  already 500,000 refugees on the territory of Russia, in addition  to one million displaced persons and half a million economic  migrants, who are not of Russian origin. Four hundred thousand  more people will arrive shortly from Transcaucasia,  approximately the same number from the Baltic states, and about  three million migrants from central Asia and Kazakhstan,  provided the situation in Russia developed "smoothly".    "They can be accommodated in Russia," Regent believes, "only  if the state, the public organisations, and the rank-and-file  Russians pool their efforts to achieve this end." This view is  shared by representatives from the national peace foundations of  14 CIS countries and Baltic states, the Russian Federal  Migration Service, the Department of the U.N. High Commission  for Refugee Affairs, the International Migration Organisation,  the Commission for Problems of Citizenship under the Russian  president, the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian Orthodox  Church, and other organisations taking part in the conference.</p>

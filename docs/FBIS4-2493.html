			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- There are now more  than 5,000 overseas agencies in Beijing, posing pressure on the  supply of office space.    Local officials said that the number of business agencies of  internationally-known companies keeps rising in the Chinese  capital. Most of the existing office buildings have been rented  out.    The China World Trade Center, for instance, harbors more  than  300 offices of overseas companies from over 20 countries and  regions, including Japan, the United States and Germany.    All of the center's office accommodation has been occupied  continuously in the past two years.    Overseas investors have been flocking to Beijing. Renovation  projects of major commercial facilities in Beijing's Wangfujing,  Xidan and other golden areas have incorporated overseas  investment.    At present, construction of several more office buildings in  the city is in full swing.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Observer: Forked tongue Over years of being bombarded with management jargon, such as 'Soft-S fronted structure initiating', Observer has developed a rule of thumb. The only thing more dangerous than deciding that such gobbledegook can't have any meaning is to assume you know what it is. Take for instance an upcoming phrase increasingly apt to be overheard in trendy executive suites: people being referred to as what sounds like 'Hi Macs'. It would be totally mistaken to leap to the conclusion that those so described are either Americans with a cheerful hail-fellow-well-met disposition, or Scottish aristocrats. Nor are they being insultingly likened to putrid hamburgers. Even seeing the phrase in its correct spelling - 'High Machs' - can raise confusion, since it could be taken to mean folk apt to rush around at supersonic speeds. But the real reference is to people who are highly Machiavellian in deceptively manipulating those around them. Psychologists test this characteristic by asking how far people agree with statements such as: 'Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it's useful to do so.' Oh, and just in case anyone doesn't already know it, 'Soft-S fronted structure initiating' means much the same thing: conning people into behaving as you wish.</p>

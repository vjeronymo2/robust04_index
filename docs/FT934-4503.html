			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Heavenly encounter - Karen Fricker hails the Broadway production of Tony Kushner's epic play 'Angels in America' Six months ago Tony Kushner's Millennium Approaches, the Pulitzer Prize winning first half of his epic play Angels in America, took Broadway by storm, sweeping the Tony Awards and playing to sell-out houses. Perestroika, the second half of Angels, which joined Millennium at the Walter Kerr Theatre last week, both directed by George C. Wolfe, not only completes the theatrical journey that Millennium began but is a complete dramatic experience of pathos, humour, and insight. The running time for the two plays is a total of seven hours; a different production of Perestroika, directed by Declan Donnelan, opened at London's National Theatre last week. In Millennium, Kushner sets in motion several interweaving plots that illustrate the identity crisis of 1980s America: a gay couple split apart by Aids; a Mormon couple similarly disintegrating when the husband begins to question his sexuality; and the arch-evil Roy Cohn on his own downward spiral, infected with Aids and embodying the nation's greed and self-interest. Kushner traffics in fantasy in Millennium, but the play grabs the audience's imagination and its heart because the unreal world he creates seems more like life than finely detailed naturalism. In Perestroika, the first play's stories untangle, settle, and resolve with bracing pace and crackling dialogue which is even funnier than that in Millennium. Yet it is a darker play than the first; Kushner seems to be reeling the audience in after Millennium's blast of adrenalin. While in Millennium the Mormon wife Harper takes a Valium trip to Antarctica, in Perestroika she only makes it as far as the Brooklyn Bridge. In Millennium, Harper and Prior, the gay man with Aids, meet in his jewel-encrusted drag fantasy; in Perestroika, they meet in a grotty Mormon visitors' centre. Prior's heavenly encounter in Millennium is that play's coup de theatre: a gorgeous white-winged angel crashes through his ceiling and calls him a prophet. Prior makes it to heaven in Perestroika, but it is a dark and mournful place, with a backdrop of broken columns and a bevy of black-gowned, silent angels; little wonder he rejects their offer of immortality and returns to the flawed earth. The most surprising thing about Perestroika is its uplifted ending. There are those who will be unwilling to accept that a writer who lays out what is wrong with the world could, in the same (extended) dramatic breath, embrace the world despite its flaws. Yet Kushner's resolution of the play's plots and themes cannot be faulted on a dramatic level; it is intellectually and emotionally logical and, yes, uplifting: wrong is punished, the good get another chance, and even the most hardened show the capacity for change. In the epilogue, the arc of the play that rises during Millennium and descends throughout Perestroika completes its journey. Prior closes the play by speaking to the audience the words the angel gave him at the end of Millennium: 'the great work begins'. It is a challenge, and an act of benediction. The work for us may be just beginning, but for Kushner it is finally complete. He has turned Perestroika around since its world premiere in Los Angeles last November, when it appeared as a deeply flawed attempt to tie up Millennium's strands. Kushner transformed Perestroika not by adding new material but by cutting and reshaping. While director Wolfe's work on Millennium was sketchy and tentative, he directs Perestroika with subtlety, verve, and intelligence. Millennium dragged, but Perestroika clips along, its comic timing acute, scenes intersecting and overlapping in a contained explosion of energy. While Robin Wagner's set of revolving walls and sliding panels, which both plays share, seemed an unhappy compromise in Millennium, the design is put to livelier use in Perestroika. Wolfe's excellent cast has only improved since Millennium. Stephen Spinella, who has played Prior since Angels' first production in San Francisco in 1991, is still breathtakingly fresh in the role. Kathleen Chalfant moves between roles, from the 'world's oldest living Bolshevik' in the prologue to the tight-lipped Mormon mother, to Ethel Rosenberg, with extraordinary ease. In Wolfe's Millennium, Ron Leibman had every look of an actor out of control as Roy Cohn - all spitting, gasping intensity; here it keeps that fierceness in check and his deathbed rantings are both harrowing and hilarious. Marcia Gay Harden's Harper is a revelation: she combines childish petulance and womanly longing to make what previously seemed an unplayable character one of the play's central figures.</p>

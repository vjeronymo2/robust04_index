			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Uncertain prospects for a world recovery: Peter Norman on the latest mixed outlook for economic growth - World economic outlook THE world economy will register its fourth successive year of inadequate growth in 1993 and the prospects for recovery next year are uncertain, the latest World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund makes clear. The Fund expects economic growth in the industrialised countries to weaken this year to 1.1 per cent, from an already modest 1.7 per cent in 1992. Although the IMF forecasts that growth in the industrialised world will recover to 2.2 per cent next year, it warns that the strength and timing of the pick-up remain unclear. It is only because of strong growth in the developing world that the IMF has left its 1993 forecast for world economic growth unchanged, at 2.2 per cent, since its last Economic Outlook at the end of April. It has revised down by just 0.2 percentage points, to 3.2 per cent, its forecast for global growth next year, reflecting expectations of continued robust growth in Asia, parts of the Middle East and much of Latin America. But the Fund is now far gloomier about economic prospects in Japan and France than it was five months ago. In Japan, recent indicators suggest that recovery stalled in the spring. In Europe, recovery is unlikely to begin before late 1993 or early 1994, while growth in north America is weaker than expected. Unemployment has risen to 'intolerable levels' in industrial countries, the IMF says. At over 32m, the number of jobless in the industrial countries this year will be equivalent to the working-age populations of Sweden and Spain combined. Excess capacity in all Group of Seven countries except the US is higher than in the recession of the early 1980s. The upshot is likely to be moderate inflation but higher unemployment, especially in Europe, and increased protectionist pressures. However, the IMF has scaled up its expectations of growth in the developing world by one percentage point this year and 0.4 points in 1994 to 6.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. Growth in Asia is forecast to be 8.7 per cent this year (some two percentage points higher than forecast in May) and 7.1 per cent in 1994. The IMF expects developing country imports will increase by 9 per cent in both this year and next after 10 per cent a year in 1991 and 1992. Those developing countries with successful, market-oriented economic policies and high domestic savings tend to be growing more than others. The Fund says two factors lie behind the feeble recovery in the industrialised world. There has been a painful adjustment to the asset price inflation of the late 1980s in North America, the UK, Australia and now Japan. In Europe, the consequences of German unification and the slow progress on cutting interest rates by countries in the exchange rate mechanism have delayed recovery. But the IMF believes there is some reason for cautious optimism that the world economy will gradually strengthen. It hopes countries will pursue policies to reduce their fiscal deficits, providing scope for monetary policy to be relaxed and give temporary support to activity, especially in Europe. The three Japanese fiscal packages since December last year should help support activity in Japan over the rest of this year and in 1994, it says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           OVERVIEW OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK PROJECTIONS             (Annual per cent change unless otherwise noted)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             Differences                                                   Current   from May 93                                               projections   projections                                 1991   1992   1993   1994   1993   1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World output                     0.6    1.7    2.2    3.2      -   -0.2 Industrial countries             0.5    1.7    1.1    2.2   -0.6   -0.7 United States                   -0.7    2.6    2.7    2.6   -0.6   -0.7 Japan                            4.0    1.3   -0.1    2.0   -1.4   -1.5 Germany                          1.7    1.9   -1.6    1.2   -0.3   -0.4 France                           0.7    1.4   -1.0    1.1   -1.0   -1.1 Italy                            1.3    0.9    0.3    1.7      -   -0.2 United Kingdom                  -2.2   -0.5    1.8    2.8    0.3   -0.3 Canada                          -1.7    0.7    2.6    3.8   -0.6   -0.6 Seven countries above            0.4    1.8    1.3    2.3   -0.6   -0.8 Other industrial countries       0.8    0.9   -1.7   -0.5   -0.4 European Community               0.8    1.1   -0.2    1.6   -0.3   -0.5 West Germany                     4.5    1.6   -2.2    0.8   -0.3   -0.3 Developing countries             4.5    5.8    6.1    5.5    1.0    0.4 Africa                           1.6    0.4    1.6    2.6   -1.1   -1.3 Asia                             6.1    7.8    8.7    7.1    2.0    0.4 Middle East and Europe           2.4    7.8    3.4    4.6   -1.6    1.1 Western hemisphere               3.3    2.5    3.4    3.5    1.1    0.8 Countries in transition        -12.0  -15.4  -10.2   -1.1   -1.4    0.5 Central Europe                  12.6   -9.1   -1.8    1.9   -0.3   -0.8 Former USSR                    -11.8  -17.8  -13.7   -2.4   -1.9    1.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source IMF  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

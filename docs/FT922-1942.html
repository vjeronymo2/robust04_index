			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Asian Bank launches Dollars 500m Eurodollar deal THE Asian Development Bank yesterday launched its first Eurodollar bond issue for four years, raising Dollars 500m 10-year funding in a deal lead-managed by Goldman Sachs. The 7 1/2 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.492, where the yield was 27 basis points more than US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. Most participants in the deal commented that the pricing was aggressive. On Monday, OKB, the Austrian state-backed financial institution which is one of the most admired names in the Euromarket, launched 10-year paper on a yield spread of 26 basis points. Eurodollar yield spreads have generally widened this week as institutional investors liquidated holdings of dollar bonds as the US currency weakened on the foreign exchange markets. The OKB bonds, for example, were yesterday trading on a yield spread of around 30 basis points over Treasur-ies. However, despite the tight pricing and lacklustre market conditions, the deal sold quickly. Syndicate officials reported buying in equal amounts by institutional investors in the Asia and Europe, including central banks. 'ADB's absence from the Eurodollar market gave this issue a scarcity value,' commented one syndicate official. 'Investors are tired of buying World Bank and EIB paper.' Like these other supra-national institutions the ADB carries a top triple-A credit rating. However, the EIB and World Bank can both sell bonds at artificially tight yield spreads because their securities are exempt from withholding tax in Italy. While EIB and World Bank bond issues are supported by a core of tax-driven Italian demand, the ADB issue was supported by buying from the Far East. The bonds traded at a yield spread between 26 and 28 basis points through the day, closing in London in the middle of this range. The deal was scheduled to be launched early next week, however the market is expecting additional Eurodollar issuance. City of Kobe thought to be the first borrower in the market. Elsewhere, the ADB also raised Fl 300m 10-year funding yesterday from an issue lead managed by ABN Amro. Syndicate officials reported a warm response from European institutional investors. General Electric Capital Corporation, the funding arm of the US manufacturer, became the latest borrower to make an underwritten bond issue under the legal documentation of its medium term note programme. The company launched CDollars 100m five-year paper, underwritten by a syndicate of banks led by Kidder Peabody. The deal carried traditional Eurobond fees of 1 7/8 per cent. Bankers said that the only difference between the issue and a conven-tional Eurobond was the documentation. China has issued a set of rules to govern the public issue of shares by state industries, Reuter reports from Beijing. Joint-stock regulations, drawn up by the State Planning Commission, are the first to specify which sections of China's massive state sector will be allowed to turn to private investors for money. The new rules are part of Beijing's attempt to give more structure to the 'stock market fever' which is sweeping China. Chinese stock markets have been opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.</p>

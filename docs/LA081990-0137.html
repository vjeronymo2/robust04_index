			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS  </P> <P> Those in the mood for another kind of festival could head over to the Hsi Lai  Temple in Hacienda Heights, which on Saturday is presenting its annual  celebration of Sangha, a Buddhist holiday honoring monks and nuns.  </P> <P> Temple members will cook a feast to honor the monastics.  </P> <P> The meal brings good luck to the food preparers and onlookers, but only the  monks and nuns get to eat. Sangha, one of the most important days of the year  in the Buddhist faith, is considered auspicious because it falls on the 15th  day of the seventh month, according to the lunar calendar.  </P> <P> Hsi Lai Temple members and the public are encouraged to bring contributions of  rice and vegetables and to help prepare the vegetarian meal.  </P> <P> Participants must arrive by 10 a.m. A chanting ceremony will be held at 10:30  a.m., with the meal served to monks and nuns at 11 a.m. During the feast,  temple members will perform Buddhist and Chinese folk songs and dances.  </P> <P> The free festival will take place at the temple, at 3456 S. Glenmark Drive in  Hacienda Heights. For more information, call (818) 961-9697. MARY ANN SWISSLER  </P></p>

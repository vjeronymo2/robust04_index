			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / New market indices launched NEW UK stock market indices have been launched by the Financial Times, the London Stock Exchange and the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries. The indices will cast more light on the performance of the stock market, particularly of second-rank UK companies. They will also allow investors to monitor the performance of individual industry sectors minute-by-minute during the day. The indices complement the FT-SE 100 index and the FT-Actuaries All-Share index, which are expected to remain the UK market's principal real-time index and the main end-of-day performance benchmark, respectively. The new indices, publicly available from Monday, are: The FT-SE Mid 250, covering the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100 in size. This is a real-time index, containing companies with market capitalisations of roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn. These are typically substantial national companies, rather than the UK-based international companies in the FT-SE 100. The FT-SE Actuaries 350, the top 350 UK shares (the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE Mid 250). Industry baskets based on these 350 stocks will be calculated minute-by-minute throughout the day. The sector classification is that used in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. The FT-Actuaries All-Share index will from January be extended by about 200 shares, to cover a higher proportion of the market. A third new index will also be added, the FT-SE Small Cap, covering All-Share members that rank below the FT-SE Mid 250 in size. The 30-share FT Ordinary index is unaffected.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov: "Indexation of Bank Defects"] </F>   [Text] Judging from the reaction of bankers, the decision  of the Russian Federation Central Bank effective 1 March to  raise the minimum amount of authorized capital of commercial  banks from 100 million rubles [R] to R2 billion was unexpected  not only by the mass media. The true motivation behind the  20-fold indexation of the most important banking standard is not  apparent either to the overwhelming majority of bankers or to  Central Bank personnel themselves, although from the official  point of view the actions of the Central Bank constitute a  normal step on the path to achieving convergence of the Russian  monetary system with international standards.    These include: mandatory increase of the minimum amount of  authorized capital to 5 million ECU ($5.6 million) by 1 January  1999; registration of new banks, effective 1 March 1994, with  minimum amount of capital not less than 1 million ECU; and  establishment of the norm for including material assets  (building, equipment, etc.) within authorized capital--their  share must not exceed 20 percent during the first year of the  bank's operation, and cannot be less than 10 percent  subsequently.    All these measures are directed, in the words of Dmitriy  Tulin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank, towards "enhancing  the responsibility of banks for services afforded" and  overcoming "the absurd situation existing when it is easier to  open up a commercial bank than a booth."    According to data as of 1 January 1994, 28 banks had  ownership capital amounting to more than R5 billion; that of 138  banks ranged from R1 to R5 billion. Thus, not more than 7  percent of all Russian banks have any real prospect of falling  within the norm established in accordance with recommendations  of the European Community. With a more stringent valuation of  fixed capital (factoring out translation gain/loss and  undistributed profits, for example), their number is limited to  just 100. The overwhelming majority of banks (about 1,500) have  capital ranging from R100 million to R1 billion, and 272 of  them--less than R100 million overall.    The flea-sized dimensions of many banks reflect the fact of  the shortage of capital, so deplorable for the Russian economy,  while the main problem in the poor quality of banking services  is still the consequence of unmanageability of the banking  system on the part of the Central Bank. This unmanageability is  explained primarily through appreciable criminalization of the  most profitable sector of the economy today, and therefore the  indexation of capital in and of itself will not force banks that  are violating legislation to alter their behavior.    Nevertheless, the increase in minimum amount of bank capital  could be characterized as a first step of the Central Bank to  improve the banking system if it is incapable of taking other,  more radical steps, or if these are impossible by virtue of the  system's high propensity for crime. However, another decision of  Viktor Gerashchenko adopted several days earlier--on the virtual  reconstruction of a very large special bank in the form of "the  holding company Promstroybank"--is somehow too closely related  to his telegram of yesterday to appear coincidental.    If this theory is confirmed, then the resoluteness with  which  Mr. Gerashchenko is pursuing European standards will indeed rid  the newborn special institutions of tiny competitors, and will  rid Russia--not suffering from an overaccumulation of capital as  things are--of 95 percent of its banks.</p>

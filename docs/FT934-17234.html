			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (6): Move enabled expansion / Profile of Dawnfresh Seafoods THE biggest new industrial employer to start operations in Lanarkshire since the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks is probably Dawnfresh Seafoods. It produces breaded cold water prawns and other seafood products in a large new plant at Bothwell Park near Motherwell and employs more than 200 people. At first sight it might appear odd that a seafood maker would locate itself on an inland site in an area where the main manufacturing tradition is engineering. On second glance it seems not only logical, but also that it could be a harbinger of things to come. Dawnfresh, a privately-owned company, relocated to Bothwell from two plants in England. Its main plant was at Whitehaven in Cumbria but it also had a facility at Ipswich. It decided it needed to move in order to expand and to anticipate the requirements of current and future health and hygiene regulations. 'This is an ideal location,' says Mr Alastair Salvesen, the company's chairman. 'Most of our scampi comes from Scottish fishing ports. We are right on the motorway network which enables us to distribute to supermarkets all over Britain within a day. 'From Whitehaven it took two days. 'When we want to fly to buy foreign shellfish from Scandinavia we have Glasgow and Edinburgh airports both within less than an hour's drive. We're at the centre of an excellent hub.' Dawnfresh is among the top four UK producers of prawns and scampi, with an annual turnover of Pounds 20m. It decided to buy its own land and build its own factory after being unable to find space large enough on the Motherwell Food Park, which is a dedicated area developed by the Scottish Development Agency, and after being asked 'ridiculous rents' on another local site. It owns an eight acre site on which it has built a 45,000 square foot state of the art plant, which includes temperature controlled production facilities, cold stores, laboratories, a product development kitchen and offices. From acquiring the site in March 1992 it produced its first output in November and the plant was completed in February 1993. The site gives it further room for expansion. Dawnfresh also has a seafood processing plant at Campbeltown in the Mull of Kintyre. The company, which has been profitable since it was bought out by its management in 1983, concentrates on breaded products and fresh or chilled products such as langoustine, scallops and crevettes. About 75 per cent of its output goes to the retail market, and the rest to the food service and catering sector.</p>

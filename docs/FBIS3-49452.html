			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jerzy Milewski, chief of National Security </F> Bureau and deputy defense minister, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at  the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet"  program -- live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] How should we, Poles, feel after  yesterday's NATO summit?    [Milewski] We should feel that our duty is well performed  because the recent political campaign headed by Foreign Minister  Olechowski and Lech Walesa made the American-devised  "Partnership for Peace" proposal, approved by the summit, more  far-reaching than was expected several months ago.    [Woyciechowski] In other words, we have won at least  something. Does this not mean that the previous governments  could do more than they actually did?    [Milewski] No, they couldn't do anything more. Now we can  see what caused our major problems and where the main resistance  was. The 16 states that make up the bloc should be convinced  that the expansion will be beneficial for them in the first  place, and not just for somebody in Central Europe. In addition  to government leaders, this also applies to governments,  legislatures, and societies of those countries.    [Woyciechowski] So where was the highest resistance?    [Milewski] I think all 16 members lacked a full  understanding  as to why NATO should be expanded at all. However, the main  opposition was mounted by the southern countries because they  receive NATO aid in the form of weapons. They know that with  new members entering the bloc, the assistance provided to them  will be substantially slashed. Another source of resistance  came from political circles in the United States that have  basically Russia in the focus of their attention and are  preoccupied with a dialog with Moscow politicians. The most  understanding was exhibited by our neighbors -- Germany,  Denmark, and Norway.    [Woyciechowski] What you are saying about the southern  states  receiving substantial assistance is very interesting. You  probably have in mind Spain, Portugal, and Greece.    [Milewski] Yes. On the other hand, Turkey, which is located  in the eastern direction, absolutely supports us. Obviously,  with Russia within a stone's throw, it knows very well what it  means to be on the edge.    [Woyciechowski] As a matter of fact, we don't know what this  "Partnership for Peace" is all about. Could you tell us exactly  what it means?    [Milewski] The "Partnership for Peace" is a program intended  to make possible cooperation and rapprochement of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council members with NATO countries in  military, political, and other spheres, such as environmental  protection and economic matters.    [Woyciechowski] If I understand correctly, the Partnership  is  a very broad formula that will be implemented only after  subsequent conclusions of bilateral agreements on military and  political cooperation. Is that correct?    [Milewski] To the best of our knowledge...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And we don't know all the  details yet, right?    [Milewski] Yes...    [Woyciechowski] When will we know all the details?    [Milewski] Probably tomorrow.    [Woyciechowski] In Prague.    [Milewski] Yes, in Prague or in Warsaw when we know the full  contents of the document approved by the NATO summit yesterday.  This is a complex program providing for many types of  cooperation among countries seeking integration with NATO. And  the scope of this cooperation is to be determined by the target  countries and not by the plan's authors. It's a strange  proposal, but this is what it looks like.    [Woyciechowski] Does this mean that those bilateral  agreements on military and political cooperation will be  different depending on which country signs them?    [Milewski] The framework cooperation agreement should be the  same. Western leaders declare that there will be no  differentiation among post-communist countries, including  Russia, and neutral states -- Austria, Finland, and Sweden. On  the other hand, specific implementation of those agreements may  be different for each state. Some of them, for example, might  choose between looser or closer military cooperation with NATO  countries.    [Woyciechowski] What kind of cooperation will Poland  propose?    [Milewski] I believe we would opt for the broadest possible  cooperation as long as our budget will sustain it.    [Woyciechowski] One of the Partnership's provisions speaks  about cooperation in drafting the defense budget. How will NATO  cooperate with Poland whose military spendings account for 2.1  percent of the budget? Is it possible at all?    [Milewski] That provision is about technical assistance in  crafting the budget in order to meet Western standards with  regard to the so-called budget transparence. The budget  transparence is regarded throughout the world as proof of the  openness of the country it belongs to. This makes it impossible  for a country to conceal preparations for a possible attack  against its neighbors. This provision is not about financial  assistance that NATO could offer us. We count more on  technological openness and access to modern armaments available  in the West. We also anticipate closer contacts among our  servicemen starting from highest staff officers and finishing  with rank and file soldiers.    [Woyciechowski] In other words, joint military exercises?    [Milewski] Both theoretical military exercises involving  only  maps and the teamwork of our detachments in the field.    [Woyciechowski] If everything goes well and Poland signs a  military cooperation agreement, when do you think the first  U.S.-Polish exercise could take place?    [Milewski] General Shalikashvili said that it may -- and it  should -- happen already in 1994. Should these exercise take  place on our territory and the Western troops cover the costs of  their arrival and stationing here, the scope of our teamwork  could be even broader. We can't move our troops there solely  because of financial problems, which may become a major setback  in developing such cooperation.    [Woyciechowski] When do you think Poland can become a full  NATO member? In 2000, 2010..? When will we eventually get what  we want?    [Milewski] I would not like to tell fortunes here. However,  there are two things that I can tell you. First, the Polish  strategic plan is to achieve NATO membership in the 1990's.  Given the present situation in those countries, the waiting  time could be from two to four years. Two years because that is  the time left until the next summit of the bloc. Assuming that  NATO countries accept our membership, the process of formal  admission and approval by their governments and parliaments  might take quite a long time yet.    [Woyciechowski] You, however, seem to be optimistic about  the  NATO issue?    [Milewski] Well, as far back as two years ago, it didn't  seem  the right thing to even mention our intention of joining the  bloc as the West perceived the idea as being provocative toward  Russia. The West has always been very anxious not to anger  Russia. Since we are neighbors, we don't want to provoke  Russia, either. We seek to establish good-neighborly relations  with that country. On the other hand, we are absolutely  convinced that Russia should not be provoked by saber-rattling  and weakness as well. And leaving Poland and other Central and  East European countries in the gray zone means exactly what we  call provoking Russia with our weakness and exposing us as a  potential target for Russia's expansionist policies, still  popular among many Russian politicians.    [Woyciechowski] Is it essential to Polish interests that  there still be some Russian troops on the territory of the  former German Democratic Republic? Does this fact have any  significance for us?    [Milewski] Russian troops in Germany as well as those  heavily concentrated in the Kaliningrad zone are of great  significance to us; we would like these troops to be  deconcentrated. However, the most important thing for us is the  policy pursued by Moscow, because we do not think that there is  a threat of putting these units into action by their local  commanders without authorization. The disintegration of Russian  state structures has not reached that stage when such events may  be expected.    [Woyciechowski] There are different rumors about the Russian  concentration in Kaliningrad... What are those troops doing  there?    [Milewski] For the time being, those troops are just  stationing there since their withdrawal from Germany and Poland.  We can only approve the fact that these troops are withdrawn  and deployed on Russian territory. However, in the long run, we  think it is absolutely improper and unnecessary for Russia to  maintain such a big concentration of its military force...    [Woyciechowski] How heavy is this concentration?    [Milewski] Well, comparable to the military force of entire  Poland. The Russian Navy concentrated in the port of Baltiysk  near Kaliningrad is larger than the entire Polish Navy. The air  forces are comparable, too. As for the ground forces, I guess  they are smaller...    [Woyciechowski] ... on this small scrap of land?    [Milewski] Yes, on this small scrap. It is, perhaps, the  strongest fortress in the world, not only in Europe.    [Woyciechowski] Is the Polish Defense Ministry preparing new  offices for new coalition deputy ministers?    [Milewski] I do not know anything about it. I have not seen  any special groups of painters busy at the ministry. The  concept approved by President Walesa and Prime Minister Pawlak  some time ago called for reducing the hired civilian personnel  of the Defense Ministry. It also provided for the reduction of  three deputy minister offices to two.    [Woyciechowski] Thus, there are two deputy ministers by now?    [Milewski] This is correct.    [Woyciechowski] Is there any need for more? Do you feel  overworked?    [Milewski] In my opinion, we do not need more. Those  changes in the organizational structure, which we hope to  implement soon, can be controlled by two deputy ministers alone.  It will do, especially now that the General Staff has its own  head in the position of a deputy minister or even higher. De  facto, the minister of national defense has three close aides,  two of whom are civilians.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Technology: An economic infection - On World Aids Day, Clive Cookson analyses the disease's grim cost Each day, Aids costs the world an estimated Dollars 250m. This alarming figure includes the direct costs of treatment, prevention and research and the more substantial indirect costs from loss of earnings. Only now, 11 years after Aids was first recognised as a new disease, are analysts starting to make systematic estimates of its worldwide economic impact. Figures emerging from work at the Harvard School of Public Heath in the US, Cambridge University in the UK, the World Health Organisation in Geneva, and elsewhere suggest that the total costs of Aids and HIV infection are now running at about Dollars 90bn a year: Dollars 10bn direct and Dollars 80bn indirect. According to Andrew Cliff and colleagues at Cambridge University Department of Geography, the cumulative cost of Aids over the first decade of the epidemic (1981-91) was Dollars 240bn. Projections for the next 10 years are more speculative, since no one knows how quickly HIV will spread nor how successful medical researchers and the pharmaceutical industry will be in developing better treatments for Aids. WHO estimates that 13m people have been infected so far. Forecasts for the year 2000 range from 30m to 120m people with HIV. Global costs could then be running as high as Dollars 500bn per year - equivalent to more than 1 per cent of world GNP. Such alarming figures lie behind WHO's message for World Aids Day: that spending on prevention of HIV infection in developing countries must be increased at least 20-fold 'in order to have any real hope of slowing the spread of the epidemic' and its attendant human suffering and economic impact. Developing countries spent only Dollars 120m on Aids prevention in 1991, WHO says. Yet the minimum required for an effective prevention programme is Dollars 2.5bn a year. This would include campaigns to promote safer sex through schools and the mass media, education of prostitutes and measures to eradicate HIV from blood supplies. But the two biggest elements of WHO's proposed prevention package are large-scale distribution of condoms and better treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases. WHO advocates spending Dollars 790m distributing 8bn condoms a year to sexually active people in developing countries - at present the total world production of condoms is only 6bn a year. And it says Dollars 1bn a year should be devoted to treating the diseases; much of this would be spent on modern antibiotics to kill the bacteria more effectively than the cheap resistance-prone drugs used in the third world today. 'We know what approaches work to prevent transmission,' says Michael Merson, director of the WHO Global Programme on Aids. 'Compared to the cost of caring for someone who becomes infected, these interventions are very good value. Every hundred dollars spent now will save millions later.' Although more than 80 per cent of those infected are in developing countries, the absolute costs of HIV and Aids are far higher in Europe and North America (see table) because healthcare expenses and lost earnings per patient are so much greater. The direct cost of caring for an average Aids patient is Dollars 32,000 per year in the US and Dollars 400 per year in Africa, according to Daniel Tarantola of the Harvard School of Public Health. Fred Hellinger of the US Agency for Health Policy and Research says the average cost of treating an American patient from diagnosis to death has almost doubled in four years, from Dollars 57,000 in 1989 to Dollars 102,000 in 1992. (Comparable lifetime treatment costs are Dollars 20,000 for lung cancer, Dollars 52,000 for breast cancer and Dollars 175,000 for kidney failure.) Medical costs are rising because US doctors are treating patients more aggressively at an earlier stage in the progression of Aids. Although there are still very few drugs to treat HIV directly, many are becoming available to fight the secondary infections associated with Aids or to boost the immune system. Yesterday, for example, Wellcome announced that it had received approval to market Mepron in the US and Canada for early treatment of PCP, a form of pneumonia that is common among Aids patients. Some patients are taking as many as 10 drugs at once, each costing several hundred dollars a week. 'Drug costs account for 15 per cent of the total cost and will get higher as time goes by,' Hellinger said. According to Cliff's projections, the cumulative cost of Aids in San Francisco, one of the worst affected US cities, will amount to Dollars 13.38bn over the period 1981-99 - Dollars 1.72bn direct and Dollars 11.66bn indirect (loss of earnings). That is equivalent to 8.6 per cent of the total income of the San Franciscan population over the same period. The cumulative cost of Aids for the country of Uganda over the same 19-year period is likely to be about Dollars 2bn, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of GDP. In the case of Uganda, however, the costs will rise sharply during the 1990s, reaching 12 per cent of GDP from 1995 to 1999. 'While inter-regional shifts of economic resources will undoubtedly ensure that western cities such as San Francisco survive the economic onslaught of Aids, the future outlook for countries like Uganda is bleak,' Cliff says. 'Aids has the potential to strip away the value equivalent of the country's modern manufacturing sector by the end of the century.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE COSTS OF AIDS 1981-1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Projected         Cost per Aids patient (Dlrs)                      Aids cases          Direct            Indirect  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa                  575,002             850              15,300 Latin America           155,000          13,300             115,700 US                      270,000          80,000             541,000 Europe                   69,000          80,000             541,000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Total costs (Dlrs bn)                          Direct        Indirect      Total (Dlrs bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa                      0.5             8.8                 9.3 Latin America               2.1            17.9                20.0 US                         22.0           146.0               168.0 Europe                      5.5            37.3                42.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                      30.1           210.0               240.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Atlas of Aids, Blackwell Reference 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

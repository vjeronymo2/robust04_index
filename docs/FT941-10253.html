			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Hard core or soft centre: A look at the role of extensive cross-shareholdings in French industry Like a spider spinning an intricate web, France's privatisation programme is forging a series of links between some of the country's most powerful financial and industrial companies. The group of long-term shareholders in Elf Aquitaine, the oil company in the final stages of privatisation, is a case in point. Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurer, Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the biggest banks, and Renault, the car group, are among those that will hold a combined 10 per cent of the oil group's shares and form a core of stable investors, dubbed a noyau dur. Elf should return the favour in several state sell-offs. It has already stumped up almost FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) to become part of the noyau dur of BNP. Renault and UAP are also likely to find the oil group near the top of their share registers when they step up to the auction block later this year. Cross-shareholdings and noyaux durs are already common between French financial and industrial groups. But the government's plan to privatise 21 of the country's largest companies, with a market value of more than FFr300bn, creates the potential for a substantial expansion of the system. In so doing, it raises several important questions, from the motives behind the expanding web of cross-shareholdings, to its strength and efficiency. The answers will help determine how French capitalism evolves from its current position between the German and Japanese models - of substantial equity and management links between industry, banks and insurance companies  -and the liberal, market-based model of Anglo-Saxon economies. There is a broad agreement on the reasons behind the rise of the noyaux durs and their role in the current round of privatisations. 'The system is designed to provide a minimum of stability and protection for companies moving into the private sector,' says Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, which was privatised at the end of last year. In the absence of powerful institutional investors, the duty falls to banks, insurance companies and industrial groups. 'We have no heavy investors, such as pension funds,' says Mr Elie Cohen, head of research at CNRS, the economic and social research centre in Paris. 'So we had to invent something, and we invented cross-shareholdings. It is the problem of developing capitalism without capital.' The weakness of pension funds is a result of France's concentration on pay-as-you-earn contributions that provide benefits for retired employees. There is less agreement, however, on the merits of the noyau dur system. 'This kind of set-up grates with some international investors,' says one US fund manager. 'By reducing the discipline of the market, and maybe the threat of takeover, it raises the risk of inefficiencies creeping into a company.' Such concerns, however, have not prevented US investors participating strongly in the three privatisations undertaken so far. Mr Francois Morin, director of Lerep, the economic and industrial research centre, criticises the blurred responsibility of company directors. 'Is their responsibility to their partners in their cross-shareholdings or to all shareholders?' he asks. For Mr Cohen, there is the additional problem of the efficiency of the allocation of financial resources. 'It is clearly not the best system for an industrial company like Rhone Poulenc or St Gobain to spend scarce capital on buying a stake in a bank,' he says. 'They should be investing in their core businesses.' Not surprisingly, the government's political opponents go further. Mr Laurent Fabius, the former Socialist prime minister, last week attacked what he described as 'armchair capitalism' in which appointees of the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, such as Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of UAP, were forming a club of financial and industrial companies. 'The heads of the companies being privatised are each on the boards of the other, they exchange capital and are all close to the prime minister,' said Mr Fabius. 'This poses a problem to the development of French industry.' Industrialists accept that there are drawbacks to the system, including the diversion of capital from their core activities. But they argue that the powers of the noyaux durs are relatively limited, and reject the notion that cross-shareholdings create inefficiencies by providing protection. 'What would be the reaction of my so-called friends if they were offered four times the market price for Rhone Poulenc shares?' asks Mr Fourtou, rhetorically. 'A group of core shareholders is no guarantee of security,' says Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks. For Mr Vienot and many others within the world of French finance and industry, the power and the permanence of the noyau dur and the pattern of cross-shareholdings is overstated. 'Our core shareholders do not play a significant role in the strategy of the group. They regard it as more of a financial investment and I would expect some of them to leave or reduce their shareholdings over the next few years,' says one chief executive. In the case of privatisation issues, core investors are usually subject to a commitment to hold the majority of their shares for a set period, often about 18 months. Within that period they can sell shares to other core investors who also retain a pre-emption right on noyau dur share sales for the next few years. 'It is not a very serious or permanent constraint in the grand order of things,' says one French merchant banker, who adds that the large number of core investors, and the relatively small level of their stakes, limits their influence. There are advocates of a shift towards a German-style system of more powerful ties between banks and industrial companies cemented by substantial shareholdings. Mr Michel Albert, for example, former chairman of the AGF insurance group and now a member of the Bank of France monetary policy committee, argues such a system allows companies to develop long-term strategies, secure from the short-term pressures of the market. There are also practical examples. Credit Lyonnais took stakes of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in a number of groups including Pinault-Printemps, the retail company, and Usinor-Sacilor, the steel group. 'Credit Lyonnais under Jean Yves Haberer (its chairman until last December) was trying to be a sort of French Deutsche Bank,' says Mr Cohen. Few other banks have sought to copy its strategy. Instead, many industrialists see an evolution, albeit gradual, towards a more Anglo-Saxon model. 'It is true that the lack of big institutional investors has pushed the system towards one of cross-participations between the main industrial and financial actors as in Japan or Germany,' says Mr Fourtou of Rhone Poulenc. 'But I don't see it as a permanent arrangement because French industrial solidarity is not so strong.' 'My desire is that the system of noyau dur is a system of transition and that we move towards the Anglo-Saxon model,' says Mr Vienot of Societe Generale. The German system has its weaknesses, he says, pointing to last month's near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the metals group, despite the presence of several of Germany's biggest banks and financial companies on its board. Whether Mr Vienot's desire is satisfied will depend in particular on the development of French pension funds and the expansion of long-term savings. Both processes are under way. Faced with a state pension system with a deficit of almost FFr20bn and approaching breaking point, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, is preparing a draft bill on pension reform to be presented to parliament this spring. Tax incentives for money market savings funds have already been reduced in favour of longer-term deposits. Creating pension funds will, however, take time. 'It will happen, but not overnight,' says Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director of J. P. Morgan, the US bank, in Paris. Most industry observers estimate it could take 15 to 20 years to build pension funds capable of playing a substantial role in industrial investment and able to alleviate the need for cross-shareholdings.</p>

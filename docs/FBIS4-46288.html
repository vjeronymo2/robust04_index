			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi and al-Amin </F> Fuhaymah, by AL-BALAGH Editor; place and date not given;  translated and summarized by Mufti Muhammad Hasam-Allah Sharifi;  ]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] These two persons  ['Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi and al-Amin Fuhaymah] are under heavy  security now, and people are not allowed to see them. If someone  wants to meet them, he is investigated at several levels.    Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, editor of the Libyan newspaper  AL-BALAGH,  is the first person who had a lengthy talk with them and got  information from them about the crash so that a way could be  found to relieve Libya of the problems it is facing because of  these two persons. The goal was to satisfy the United States so  it would lift the restrictions it has imposed on Libya. However,  these two persons did not cooperate with him during this  interview and kept talking to him about other things. Later,  al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit sent a message to Mr. Ibrahim, the  editor, unexpectedly and told him that they were both very  perturbed and wanted to meet with him immediately. They said  that they wanted to meet with him to resolve this issue with his  help. The editor told him to wait for a few days as there might  be a better solution. Mr. al-Amin's mother died during those  days and she could not bear to be separated from her son.  Finally, Mr. Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, editor of AL-BALAGH, went to  meet 'Abd-al-Basit in his home in Tripoli. He was waiting for  him at the door of his house and smiled when he saw him. He told  the editor that he was used to sufferings, but he did not know  why he was accused of this crime. He said that he had faith in  God and that He will protect him and watch over him. The whole  story is clear to God like a bright day.    'Abd-al-Basit is about 41 years old and al-Amin is the same  age. 'Abd-al-Basit said that God had arranged for people to be  kind to each other in this world. Some people spend their lives  in happiness and in the end they leave all their desires and  plans and enter the valley of death. Some leave this world early  and some spend a lot of time here; however, all their wishes are  not fulfilled. One's life is never long enough for one's desires  and plans to be fulfilled. Ibrahim taped the whole interview.    During tea, 'Abd-al-Basit's younger son 'Abd-al-[name  incomplete as published] came into the room and said that his  daddy and uncle al-Amin were falsely accused of these crimes.  They have forced these two to spend their lives like nomads.  They cannot live peacefully and quietly. Both of them suggested  during this interview that they would present their case in the  Libyan Supreme Court so that "we can explain our side to the  world and the people can decide what is wrong and what is right.  Who is following the right path and who is wrong?"    Whenever these two talk, the first thing they say is that  the  real criminal is being ignored and they are being made  scapegoats. They are very depressed and look very sad.    Their wives say that Tripoli with its breadth and length has  become very cramped for them. "Ever since our husbands were  accused of this crime, we have been carrying this heavy burden  in our minds. We are in a strange situation. We can be  considered neither dead nor alive. We feel great vexation.  Whenever we meet each other, we ask why we are living? In which  world are we living? What is the use of leading a life full of  fear? At times, there are articles about us in newspapers,  magazines, and journals. Some encourage us and some deflate our  fortitude."    'Abd-al-Basit has been a student of science in prestigious  American universities and also has higher education in  geography. When he returned home after finishing his education,  he was appointed chief administrator of the education  department. Mr. al-Amin worked for Libyan Airlines. He receives  a stipend from Libyan Airlines now.    They were asked in this detailed interview why did they  refuse to go to the United States or Great Britain if they claim  to be innocent and consider themselves wrongly accused? They  answered that truth has its place. "We are being accused  falsely; there is not truth in it. We are innocent. However, how  can we trust them to be our well-wishers and make a just  decision and not spite us. The United States and Britain have  already declared that they do not need any court to make a  decision about us. All they want is al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit.  They will not be satisfied with anything less. They do not want  to get advice from lawyers and follow up on the facts as these  surface. They have already given their verdict on their  televisions. How can we expect justice from them?"    At the end of this interview, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl emphasized  to them that the accusation being levied against them about  destroying the Pan Am airplane by the United States and Britain  appears to be true, because these two countries do not trust  their own legal systems and do not want another impartial nation  to investigate this case and give a decision. Meanwhile these  two declare themselves to be innocent and refuse to accept any  blame. In such a situation no one can be a criminal just because  someone calls them so.    Some people say that these two are living like kings and  enjoying themselves. I have visited them and observed them  closely. In my opinion, no other person is so sacred and in  danger in Tripoli as are these two. Al-Amin's home is on one  corner of Tripoli where he lives like a bird in a cage. He  cannot go anywhere openly and spends his time within a limited  sphere. The situation of 'Abd-al-Basit is not any different.    They both said that this accusation has influenced their  family lives greatly. "We are totally cut off from society, and  our wives and children are also suffering because of this crime.  We are suffering mentally because of it. Perhaps this will not  end even after we are dead. We are suffering from the crime of  innocence. We pray to God all the time to bring the real  criminal in front of the world so that the facts--the identities  of those people who have accused them and the facts about those  who have been accused--are revealed."    Both of them emphasized that they will not bow down to the  unfair demands of the United States and continue to call the  U.S. accusation wrong. "How the United States always has double  standards about everything is clear from this example. It  attacked an Iranian airplane and downed it. It admitted to this  action; however, no punishment was given to it, and it is not  even willing to be punished for being involved in this crime. A  similar situation has occurred in many countries, but no action  was taken against other countries. What reason can there be for  this attitude, other than that the people who live in Libya are  Muslims and the Unites States is a strong enemy of Muslims and  Islam."    Al-Amin Fuhaymah described a personal sorrow and said, "What  has bothered me the most all this time is that my beloved mother  died during this period. Her eyes were open even at the time of  her death waiting for me. Alas, I could not see my mother  because of the barriers created by the U.S. efforts. I am  spending my life like a nomad. I am here today and will be  hiding in another place tomorrow. Some time here and some time  there. I spend the day here and night in another place. I could  not even fulfill her last desire. I will be greatly repentant  all my life about it. This shock is very difficult for me to  bear."    Both al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit expressed great happiness at  meeting with the editor. This was the first time that an Arabic  language journalist had paid attention to them and considered  them worth interviewing. "We are glad that we could share our  inner thoughts with you and explain our side of the Lockerbie  accident in details. This is a great honor for us and it makes  us happy. We have a lot of experience with journalists, and we  have learned a lot during our meeting with journalists. We also  know how to answer journalists' questions. Meeting with  journalists is an interesting experience, and now they seem to  be members of our own family. Our hearts beat for each other and  they understand us even when we do not say anything. Anyhow, in  order to get the facts about the airplane crash and to put this  thing aside, we want to join our voice with the voice of other  people, and declare forcefully to the whole world that the  United States should give up its stubborn attitude. It should  allow a third and neutral nation to investigate this affair.  That country should listen to both sides and make a decision.  The United States is not willing to do that. It shows that it is  not sure of its stand and knows about its weakness. However,  since the United States is the world's greatest power now, it  wants to make its mistake to change into truth. That is why it  is pressuring Libya and accusing two of its citizens. It wants  Libya to extradite these two citizens and send them to the  United States so that they can be hanged. The Americans should  pay attention to their government's style of operation and how  it is destroying their nation's prestige. We do not want to  accuse anyone. We do not even want to say anything in our  defense at this time. All we want to say is that we should be  treated fairly."    "Five years have passed since the airplane crash. We have  spent this whole time like being impaled on a stake. We do not  have the words to describe the pain and agony we have gone  through. Our time of being tested has not passed yet, and we do  now know how this suffering will continue. Many airplane  accidents took place before this one, and many more accidents  will take place in the future also. However, it never happened  before that someone was accused without any investigation. The  whole world knows the U.S. method of operation. The action that  the United States took in its arrogance as a powerful nation  after the Pan Am crash was just to pressure Libya. It used some  tricks and imposed economic sanctions against it so that Libya  would kneel down in front of it in submission. However, bravo to  Libya! It is standing firm and is not willing to bow down to the  United States. You tell us with your hand on your heart if this  is the standard of U.S. justice and fairness? What will the  United States do if another nation treats it like this?"    "Our position in this whole situation is like another side.  We know what we did, what we did not do, and what wrong  allegations are against us. We are not willing to allow the  United States, Britain, and Scotland to make any decision they  want and impose it on us. We are willing to accept the decision  made by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and Tunisia."</p>

The spokesman said:  Though the IAEA will exercise long term monitoring of the Iraqi  nuclear installations, Iraq is a big country and it might have  some center which have not been discovered so far.    In this connection a UN team is expected to begin a nine day  visit to Iraq today in order to arrange a program for  controlling Iraq's military industries and stop the production  of long-range missiles. During its stay in Iraq, the UN team is  also expected to select a suitable place for installing the  surveillance cameras and other such equipment.    Despite the UN concern many political experts think it is  quite difficult and inconceivable that Iraq can become nuclear  now, or in the future, specially when its last recognized  consignment of nuclear material was moved to Russia last  February 12. This is beside the economic weakness and  vulnerability that has afflicted Iraq following the Persian Gulf  war. According to certain experts this very issue may, to a  large extent, adversely affect Iraq's nuclear program.    At any rate a major part of the pressures being brought by  the UN may be the result of the activities and influence of the  Israeli lobby in the White House. In fact in the opinion of  Zionists any Iraqi threats to the security of the Qods occupier  regime are not to be ignored. On this basis many political  observers consider Washington's pressures on the UN for  controlling Iraq's military industries and also for continuing  the existing economic sanctions against Baghdad to be related to  this very issue.    These sanctions remain in place under the conditions when  Iraq's ailing economy is going through difficult phases with a  threat of famine and hunger, as well as grave health conditions  of the vast majority of the Iraqis is looming large. This issue  may focus the Iraqi people's attention on the Baghdad regime.  Naturally this is not the objective desired by the White House  ringleaders.</p>

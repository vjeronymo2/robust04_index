			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev, 1 June -- Leonid Kravchuk, president of  Ukraine made a speech on the current situation in Crimea at a  session of the Ukrainian parliament. [passage omitted]    Touching on problems of the Black Sea Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk  noted that there are two tasks which must be tackled first: To  resolve the problem of the deployment of both fleets at various  bases and to clearly define the status of the Russian fleet  which is based on Ukrainian territory. The problem of the Black  Sea Fleet should, in the president's view, meet Ukraine's  national interests and should guarantee Russia's security on its  foreign borders.    However, the president considers that in the future the  Russian fleet should be based exclusively at bases on Russian  territory.    At the end, Leonid Kravchuk stressed that the regulation of  the "Crimean problem" is of vital importance for Ukraine,  Crimea, Europe and the world.    Leonid Kravchuk answered questions from journalists.</p>

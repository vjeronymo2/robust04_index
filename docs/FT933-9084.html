			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Mercedes-Benz plans to launch city car MERCEDES-BENZ, one of the world's leading luxury carmakers, is planning to launch a city car in the second half of the 1990s that would be smaller than a Ford Fiesta or a Rover Metro, writes Kevin Done. Called the Vision A 93, it will be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show next month. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, car division head, said the concept car would 'influence the development of a future Mercedes-Benz A-class car'. At only 3.35 metres long, the vehicle is evidence of the upheaval in the German luxury carmaker's product planning for the 1990s. It also reflects the intense interest of the world's leading manufacturers in developing new designs for small cars. The Mercedes would be a four-seat, five-door model, suitable also for longer journeys.</p>

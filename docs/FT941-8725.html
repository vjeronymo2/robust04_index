			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Acquittal ruling fails to ease wariness in City Investment analysts are thought unlikely to become any less wary of infringing the laws on insider dealing than they have been since last year's conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie, a Scottish investment analyst, in spite of the quashing on Wednesday of the conviction. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh also cancelled Mr Mackie's Pounds 25,000 fine. Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General of Scotland, said the trial judge had misdirected the jury.

He said the circumstantial evidence was also entirely consistent with Mr Mackie's innocent version of events. 'In my opinion there was a miscarriage of justice because there was insufficient evidence in law for a conviction.'</p>

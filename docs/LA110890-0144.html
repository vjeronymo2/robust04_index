			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> JAIL PROPOSAL APPROVED  </P> <P> Prisoners sentenced to county jail may soon be able to pay Pasadena $75 a day  to serve their time in the city's new $3-million jail under a proposal approved  Tuesday by the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> The proposal allows for lower payments for those who can't afford $75 a day.  </P> <P> But directors were reluctant to approve a similar proposal that would enable  the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to house convicted illegal  aliens in the city jail. Directors felt that objections might be raised to city  participation in INS activities, and the matter was referred to a  police-resident advisory committee.  </P> <P> The two programs would bring the city an estimated $85,000 annually.  </P> <P> Under the proposal approved by the board, individuals convicted of misdemeanors  and who are nonviolent offenders without medical problems can spend their  sentence in Pasadena for periods ranging from 48 hours to several months. Up to  seven beds in the 70-bed jail would be allocated for these prisoners.  </P></p>

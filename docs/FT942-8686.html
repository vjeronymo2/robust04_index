			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Privatise the Post Office Even Baroness Thatcher baulked at the idea in the 1980s, yet the case for privatising the UK Post Office is now overwhelming. Sensitive social and political issues are at stake. But by comparison with those involved in transferring the water and telecommunications industries into the private sector, they are far from difficult to resolve, while the potential benefits are considerable. By international standards the Royal Mail has an impressive performance record. It none the less suffers from the worst afflictions of the old nationalised industries. Its capital spending and pricing are subject to detailed ministerial control. It is milked as a cash cow by the government with little regard to the long-term health of the business. This year it has been set an arbitrary target to pay the government Pounds 230m, a sum higher than the Post Office's current post-tax profit and nearly twice as much as a reasonable dividend payment. Meanwhile, capital investment languishes and the price of stamps is higher than it need otherwise have been. Restrictions on the Post Office competing with the private sector, and engaging in overseas ventures, threaten its future as anything more than a house-to-house deliverer of paper protected by monopoly. The Dutch postal service is about to be privatised; it is at the forefront of new communications technologies and is selling hard in the UK, alongside a host of private operators. The distinction between mail, telecoms and computing is already blurred; within a few years it will be archaic. Commercial freedom To flourish, the Post Office needs entrepreneurial and commercial freedom. In theory, that could be guaranteed within the state sector; in practice the UK has never managed to make such a half-way house habitable. Privatisation is the sensible way forward - accompanied by an obligation to deliver letters daily across the country; by a continued monopoly over deliveries up to a certain weight or value; by a regulator to protect consumer interests; and by accounting separation to prevent the Post Office subsidising non-monopoly operations from monopoly revenues. To reassure consumers, the government might retain a 51 per cent stake in the company and nominate a number of directors. The crucial decision is to proceed to market; the proportion of the share capital to be floated is of secondary importance. If the privatisation of BT is any guide, consumers will soon be better off, not worse off. And not just as a result of technology: there are nearly twice as many pay phones as a decade ago, and they now work. Understandable concern That leaves the thorny issue of post offices - the 'counters' division of the Royal Mail. There is understandable concern at the prospect of wholesale closures among the UK's 20,000 post offices, the bulk of them sub-post offices run as subsidised private businesses under contract. Sub-post offices remain vital for rural communities and for benefits recipients without bank accounts. In the short term, therefore, subsidies should continue - both those in the form of cash paid to the franchisees, and those in the form of agency work protected by the government (notably benefits payments). Yet the point of principle is clear: post offices should service social needs. As ever more pensioners and benefits recipients come to possess their own bank accounts, the losers from a decision not to credit payments directly into bank accounts will be taxpayers and the recipients themselves. However, only the faint-hearted should suppose that small post offices can survive by subsidy alone. With privatisation should go a bonfire of the senseless controls which forbid post offices from offering banking and other private sector services under contract. In partnership with a bank, the Dutch post office's outlets transact mortgages, offer banking, travel and recruitment services, and more besides. Britain's post offices could do a thriving private trade, particularly in rural areas without banks or other services. If supermarkets are free to sell stamps bearing the Queen's head, there is no earthly reason why post offices should not be able to sell concert tickets and issue cash from bank accounts.</p>

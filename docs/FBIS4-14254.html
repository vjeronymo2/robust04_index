It is not Iraq that has shared Lebanon's occupation with  "Israel" for almost 20 years.    It is not Iraq that imposes on Lebanon its presidents,  ministers, and Arab and international policies.    It was not Iraq that bombed the Lebanese Presidential Palace  at Ba'abda with its military aircraft, nor did it use its heavy  artillery to shell the Lebanese Defense Ministry at al-Yarzah.    Iraq did not abduct anyone in Lebanon, nor did it  assassinate  Kamal Junblatt and scores of other prominent politicians,  journalists, and intellectuals.    The history of the Iraqi Army is not tarnished by the crimes  of the invasion and occupation of Lebanon or by the crimes of  annihilating Lebanese. On the contrary, it is a history which  is proud of the Iraqi Army's participation in confronting the  Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 1978.    Iraq's relations with official and popular Lebanon are well  known and very clean. They have always been based on respecting  Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and independent options. These  relations have never been of the type that foster the division  of the land and the people. This is well understood by all  Lebanese Muslims and Christians, as well as all politicians,  both the traditional ones and the leaders of the nationalist  parties.    Iraq did not make a big of issue of the incident in which  the  enemies of Lebanon's unity and sovereignty blew up the Iraqi  Embassy in Beirut in an unprecedented crime during which the  Iraqi ambassador to Lebanon, several diplomats, and scores of  other martyrs fell victims, although the protection of Iraqi  diplomats accredited to Lebanon was the full responsibility of  the Lebanese authority. Before the embassy explosion, several  Iraqi officials also fell as martyrs through assassinations in  Beirut in 1980 and 1981.    It is not the Iraqi armies that have occupied Lebanese  territory since 1976 following an invasion blessed by Washington  and Tel Aviv and in which Muslims, Christians, and Palestinians  were massacred not in any clashes with the Zionist occupier, but  under coexistence and full coordination with that occupier.    Iranian guards did not enter Lebanon with all their weapons  and funds through Iraq and with its blessing and protection, nor  did these guards set up their authority, banks, and  establishments through coordination and suspicious deals with  Iraq.    It was not Iraq that turned Lebanese territory into a den  for  terrorism, kidnapping, and blackmail operations to split a few  dollars with the gangs of kidnappers who were charged with this  temporary role according to certain policies and timings and for  purposes which were known to the Lebanese authority which stood  by like a spectator.    Are the present official Lebanese claims, measures, and  accusations sufficient to hide all these facts?!    Will the smart ones in Lebanon succeed in diverting the  Lebanese people's attention from the true enemies of their  sovereignty and unity in Damascus and Tel Aviv, from those who  are responsible for the death of the sons of Lebanon in the  South, Beirut, Jabal Lubnan, the North, and al-Biqa'?!!    Lebanese shrewdness, inspired by the Damascus leaders, will  not change facts. Iraq is busy with very well-known enemies,  the enemies of all Arabs. Everyone has his known position and  objectives.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.B.: "Unions Dissatisfied With Minimum Wage of </F> 20 Super Dinars"]    [Text] Belgrade -- The Serbian Government's decree to  guarantee a minimum wage of 20 "super dinars" (20 German marks  [DM]) to every employee was adopted without the consensus of the  trade union negotiating team. Union representatives reminded the  public on Wednesday that unions were again excluded from such an  important matter as the agreement on minimum pay. At the same  time they denied all responsibility for renewed protests by  workers.    That there will be new strikes is evident from the data that  20 dinars are not even enough to buy a liter of milk and 600  gram of bread a day. The cost of the daily consumer basket is  equal to the minimum monthly pay. To buy just bread and milk, a  worker would need 39 "super dinars" a month, twice the minimum  wage.    As a result, 800 IMT workers blocked Tosin Bunar Street in  front of their factory in Novi Belgrade on Tuesday. They  demanded from the government an immediate one-time payment of  DM100 per employee, a regular supply of food and other  necessities, and a guaranteed monthly income to enable their  families "to survive and not to starve."    More than 600 Zastava workers from Kragujevac announced a  general strike on Wednesday. These are the employees of the  defense plant, which is the only one still in operation. The  Kragujevac "gunsmiths" demand pay of DM20 a week as well as the  resignation of Director Vukasin Filipovic, whom they accuse of  numerous abuses. The Kragujevac workers announced: "No appeals  or pressures from Belgrade will stop our strike. It is easier  for us to sit hungry than to work hungry."</p>

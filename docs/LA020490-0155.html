			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE BELIEVING IN THE LEAFS  </P> <P> These days in Toronto they're talking about reviving the tradition of the Maple  Leafs, one of the NHL's proudest franchises.  </P> <P> On the ice, the Maple Leafs are doing it more directly: They're winning games  with one of the most dramatic one-year turnarounds in league history.  </P> <P> "I guess everybody is surprised but us," says Gary Leeman, the Maple Leaf right  wing who is in the middle of the resurgence. "We always knew we had a lot of  talent. We've got so much confidence right now, we feel we can win every game."  </P> <P> The muscular Maple Leafs haven't backed down from many this season -- quite a  change for a team that had lapsed into a 10-year losing streak. This is a team  that virtually wrote off the eighties. That's when the Maple Leafs became  widely known as the "Maple Laughs" or the "Make Beliefs", finishing with the  overall 20th record in the league and giving up the most goals for the decade.  </P> <P> They're still giving up a lot of goals -- but they're scoring more, too, with  one of the league's most potent offensives. At the All-Star break, they led the  NHL in that department.  </P> <P> "We do get into the firewagon style some nights," said coach Doug Carpenter.  "But what am I going to do -- restrict my players' assets?"  </P> <P> Carpenter, a refugee from the New Jersey Devils, is generally regarded as a  defensive coach, as are his assistants. But you'd never know it by the Maple  Leafs' high-powered offensive style.  </P> <P> "Obviously, offense is our strength," Leeman said, "and we've never been told  not to play offense. But I think we can play better defensively when we have  to. I think we'll be able to adjust to it, because we've been able to adjust to  different styles of play so far -- a rough game or a fast game.  </P> <P> "We seem to have different characteristics that make this team happen."  </P> <P> Last year, the Maple Leafs didn't happen at all. They finished out of the  playoffs with a 28-46-6 record, which was a distant 20th in the league.  </P> <P> This year, they not only have a legitimate shot at a playoff berth but also  first place in the Norris Division and a chance to break the team record for  most wins in a season (41). After their first 51 games, they had a 27-23-1  record and could finish a season above .500 for the first time since 1978-79.  </P> <P> "There seems to be stability and we have a coach who knows his game," veteran  left wing Mark Osborne said. "Carpenter coming here was a big thing. He knows  hockey. A lot of us are impressed.  </P> <P> "He comes into each game and practice really prepared. He has everybody playing  within themselves. We're playing sound, systematic hockey and each player has a  defined role. For the first time since I've been here, there is a positive  approach to getting the most out of the team and getting the players to play to  their best abilities."  </P> <P> Carpenter, who coached for nearly four years in New Jersey before taking over  the Maple Leafs this year, wasn't the only fresh breeze in Toronto.  </P> <P> Maple Leaf owner Harold Ballard, before his recent illness, hired Floyd Smith,  a former Toronto player, as general manager and approved changes such as the  appointment of a captain -- Rob Ramage. The moves helped bring a sense of  respect to the team and a sense of passion to Maple Leaf Gardens that had been  absent since the glory years of the 1960s.  </P> <P> The Maple Leafs have 13 Stanley Cup championships to their credit, second only  to the Montreal Canadiens, but none since 1967.  </P> <P> Ramage, along with Lou Franceschetti, are among recently-acquired players who  are generally credited with adding elan to the Maple Leafs. Brad Marsh, who  came over from Philadelphia last year, is another one.  </P> <P> "These people are all from organizations that were team-oriented," Carpenter  said. "Ramage played in Calgary, Marsh in Philadelphia, Franceschetti in  Washington. These people have really added character."  </P> <P> And physical presence. Franceschetti, especially, has given the Maple Leafs the  kind of hitting that has long been absent from their game.  </P> <P> "Franceschetti," said Carpenter, "has been superb, a real spark."  </P> <P> Osborne said the newcomers have nurtured a strong team atmosphere and a Three  Musketeers mentally.  </P> <P> "The leadership of some of the older players has put pride back into the  dressing room," Osborne said. "Rob has demanded respect -- and he's gotten it.  We've had some sour apples pulling in the wrong direction, but they've brought  them over to their side."  </P> <P> With Ballard critically ill in a hospital, a board of directors is running the  team these days. They've given carte blanche to Smith and Carpenter. Off the  ice, they're trying to recapture some of the old team pride which Ballard had  slowly stripped away over the years.  </P> <P> If anything, Ballard was never accused of sentimentality. Outspoken and  sometimes irreverent and profane, Ballard consistently flew in the face of  tradition since taking over controlling interest in the hockey club in 1972.  </P> <P> Showing little regard for history, Ballard didn't see any reason to have any of  the team's Stanley Cup flags hanging in Maple Leaf Gardens, or for some of the  old photographs to hang in the Gardens' hallowed halls.  </P> <P> He was vindictive enough to rip some photos off the wall when they included  players he didn't get along with -- such as Darryl Sittler, a Hall of Famer who  was one of the most popular in Maple Leafs' history.  </P> <P> But now with Ballard out of touch, the board of directors has decided to bring  back some memories, including those championship banners.  </P> <P> "We're going ahead with the banners," said board chairman Paul McNamara. "We've  heard from a few companies that make them."  </P> <P> The board of directors has also decided that some restoration is in order.  Board members have decided to start an alumni club for former players, put in a  game room for them in Maple Leaf Gardens and make improvements in the dingy  wives' lounge for players.  </P> <P> These improvements have just happened to coincide with the improvements of the  current team on the ice.  </P> <P> And winning has made it all the sweeter for Al Iafrate, one of the NHL's top,  young defensemen.  </P> <P> "It used to be frustrating going to the rink," Iafrate said. "Even if we won,  they used to say we were lucky. Now the fans are rallying behind us, and they  think we can win every game."  </P> <P> More importantly, so do the Maple Leafs themselves.  </P></p>

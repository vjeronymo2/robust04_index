			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / BSkyB and BBC confirm FA deal BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, and the BBC yesterday agreed a Pounds 75m deal with the Football Association for coverage of FA Cup matches and England's home internationals, Raymond Snoddy writes. The two broadcasting organisation are three years into a Pounds 30m four-year agreement with the FA. Yesterday's deal is for a further four years. The agreement yesterday follows the Pounds 304m deal last month between BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, and the BBC for five years' coverage of the new Premier League's matches. The BBC will continue to have access under the agreement to one live game for each round of the Cup as well as the semi-finals and the final. BSkyB will have rights to one live game and one recorded game from each round and exclusive coverage of any semi-final replays. The deal is likely to arouse more anger from ITV, which says its bid for the BBC package alone was close to the combined BSkyB-BBC total. ITV is now left with an Pounds 8m-a-year agreement to cover the Football League, without the Premier League or the Rumbelows Cup.</p>

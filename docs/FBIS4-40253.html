			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ivan Plyushch, Ukraine's people's deputy and </F> presidential candidate: "My Program as Ukrainian President"]    [Text] After an objective assessment of the situation that  has taken shape in our state's political, economic, and social  spheres, I am deeply convinced that Ukraine has every  possibility to stabilize the situation in the near future and  gradually raise the standard of living to a level worthy of man.    My experience that I gained in life, work, and politics and  my professional knowledge enable me to determine those  priorities which are essential for overcoming the difficulties  and crisis phenomena that have befallen us during this difficult  transitional period and, finally, change the situation for the  better and inspire people with hope and confidence in the future.    The first and main priority from which I will proceed  concerns the needs and interests of the independent state and of  the people, as well as interests of the individual.  <H8>  Strategic and Tactical Trends in My Program </H8> <H5>  In the Economic Sphere </H5>   1. Economic Reforms -- only for the benefit of the people  and  not at the people's expense. I will not be guided by utopian  programs, but by absolutely specific matters:    -- Reform in the banking, finance, and taxation systems;    -- The creation of reliable guarantees for a free  development  of civilized entrepreneurship;    -- Struggle against price-fixing extortion and inflation;    -- Balancing of prices and incomes.    2. An improvement of the course of economic reforms in such  a  way as to make it possible to put an end to the vulgar  enrichment of some individuals at the expense of the  impoverishment of the majority of people.    3. Ukraine's economic revival -- The building of a strong,  efficient, and socially-oriented economy by way of its  restructuring and implementation of up-to-date technologies.    4. Fair privatization by the people and the creation of  reasonably equal starting conditions for every person  participating in the privatization and the provision of equality  of all forms of ownership and economic activity, so that every  person would feel himself as a master of the means of production  and of the results of his labor.    5. Comprehensive development of the agro-industrial complex,  state support for both collective and individual farms,  repayment of debts to peasants, and the establishment of a  stable parity of prices of agricultural and industrial products.  <H5>  In the Social Sphere </H5>   1. Promotion of the spiritual revival of the Ukrainian  people, the development of culture and language, the  strengthening of the material and technological base of national  education, of communal services, physical culture and sports;  recognition of the role of religion in the rebirth of society;  the maintenance of conditions for the development of fundamental  science.    2. Consistent adherence in Ukraine to the principles of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as of other legal  acts that guarantee free and comprehensive development of the  individual and his reliable social protection.    3. Gradual improvement of peoples' standard of living based  on an increase in the remuneration for labor worthy of the  working people and a reduction of prices of goods. The latter  may be achieved with the help of reducing taxes, price additions  for intermediate trade, and production expenses.    4. Avoidance of mass unemployment, creation of the system of  guaranteed protection for the low-income strata of the  population -- war and labor veterans, pensioners, families with  many children, handicapped people, single elderly people,  students, and also those who have remained without a  breadwinner; establishment of pensions and scholarships that  would not be lower than the living wage.    5. True compensation for the population's savings, lost as a  result of inflation, at the level of the purchasing power which  prevailed in 1990.    6. An increase in the production of goods for children and a  better care about women, young families, and young people.    7. Creation of healthy conditions of life, provision of a  clean environment, the development of forestry, national parks,  and ecological preserves.    8. Ecologically-oriented approach to the planning and  building of towns, villages, and settlements; curtailment of the  building of new and reconstruction of existing atomic plants and  hazardous industries, introduction of ecologically friendly and  waste-free technologies; particular attention to the improvement  of the ecological situation in those areas that have been  affected by the Chernobyl catastrophe.  <H5>  In the Sphere of State Building </H5>   1. Building of a humane and democratic civil society,  achievement of well-being and spiritual freedom for the people;  establishment of Ukraine's true state-political and economic  sovereignty.    2. Adoption of a new Ukrainian Constitution with a distinct  statement of the principle of the division of powers and the  most suitable mechanisms for interaction among legislative,  executive, and judicial power for building a law-governed state  having the following main characteristics:    -- Recognition of the Ukrainian people as the only source of  power and of the individual, his life, rights, and freedoms --  as the greatest values;    -- Cultural, linguistic, and religious uniqueness of the  people of all nationalities residing in Ukraine.    3. Elaboration, taking into account the national  characteristics and experience of advanced democratic countries,  of such a legislation as would promote the formation of a  territorial structure capable of harmoniously combining general  state, regional, and local interests.    4. Improvement of the representative power bodies in the  form  of councils as organs of people's power and their reform based  on the principles of local government and creation of a  necessary legal and financial and economic foundation for their  activity.    5. Maintenance of civic peace and harmony in Ukraine,  strengthening of law and order, intensification of the struggle  against organized crime and corruption, and a reliable  protection of human honor, dignity, life, and health.    6. Building of Ukraine's Armed Forces and constant concern  about the well-being of servicemen and their families.  <H5>  In External Policy </H5>   1. Extensive economic integration of Ukraine's national  economic complex, first and foremost with CIS countries and also  with other states, gradual merging into the European and world  economic community, and the creation of a corresponding legal  base and practical conditions for that.    2. Strengthening of Ukraine's international prestige as a  great peace-loving and civilized European power, preservation of  its territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders.    3. Preservation of peace, prevention of armed conflicts, no  matter where they might flare up, and establishment of Ukraine's  status as a peace-loving, nonaligned, and nonnuclear power.    I will do everything in order that our young independent  state could occupy a worthy position among advanced European and  world countries as soon as possible.</p>

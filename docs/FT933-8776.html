			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: StanChart advances to Pounds 169m SHARES IN Standard Chartered, the international banking group, leapt 51p yesterday to close at 949p after it disclosed a sharp rise in first half profits helped by buoyant Asia Pacific operations, and eased fears that it would need a rights issue. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 168.8m, against Pounds 59.3m, with Pounds 121m contributed from Hong Kong. The provision for bad and doubtful debts increased to Pounds 127m, against Pounds 117.6m, after charges for UK corporate lending rose from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 113.7m. Fears of a rights issue to strengthen capital eased after its ratio of core tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was disclosed to have strengthened to 5.4 per cent, against 4.9 per cent, helped by retained profits of Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 10.9m losses). The interim dividend is raised to 7.5p (7p), with earnings per share rising from 2.4p to 37.3p. Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said Standard was starting to solve 'years of inconsistent and generally low earnings'. Standard has suffered from upsets, such as its involvement in the Bombay securities trading scandal last year, which have given it an accident-prone image. However, the shares have risen this year on optimism about its Asia Pacific franchise. Mr Gillam said the company had strengthened its senior management and was now trying to focus businesses in OECD countries to support the Far East operations. Mr Peter Wood, the finance and risk director who joined the bank earlier this year from Barclays, said the bank wanted to raise post-tax return on equity above the 17 per cent in the first half to cover some inevitable earnings volatility. The bank's overall ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 10.7 per cent, against 9.7 per cent. It has a further Pounds 372m (Pounds 443m) in 'surplus' tier 2 capital which it can count towards the ratio as core capital increases. Net interest income rose 41 per cent to Pounds 457m, against Pounds 323m. Dealing and exchange profits, including foreign currency and metals trading, rose to Pounds 106.5m (Pounds 48.9m). The bank is thought to be concerned about the volatility of its share price caused by illiquidity. Some 38 per cent of its shares are held in six blocks, including Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, a Singapore investor who holds 14.94 per cent. See Lex</p>

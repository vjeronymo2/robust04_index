			<p>BFN     [Text] The death toll in yesterday's attack on ANC election  canvassers at Ulundi has risen to three.    A spokesman for the KwaZulu Police says the latest victim  was  among the 10 canvassers who had sought refuge at the police  station. He said he died after being shot, apparently as the  refugees were being taken to safety. A search for eight ANC  supporters missing since the incident has so far proved  fruitless. It's still unclear what exactly happened at the  police station after the arrival of IFP leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi to deal with the problem. One of the ANC members who  escaped to the police station said he was rescued by white  policemen from almost certain death. ANC provincial election  candidate, Welcome Mthimkulu, alleges that the KwaZulu policemen  were ready to hand the ANC members over to the mob outside.    He said a number of white policemen, however, had taken them  in armored vehicles to a place of safety until they could be  transferred to Eshowe.</p>

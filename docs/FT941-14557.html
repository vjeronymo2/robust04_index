			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Japan's move over bidding hailed by US Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday hailed Japanese plans to reform its bidding process in its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn) a year public sector construction market as 'an historic step forward' and abandoned plans to impose sanctions in the dispute. 'I hope that this positive step sets the stage for concluding meaningful framework agreements prior to the February 11 meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa,' he said. The US and Japan had agreed at the Tokyo summit to reach agreements, using 'quantitative and qualitative indicators' to measure results, in time for the bilateral meeting. However, administration officials have been warning of slow progress. In a speech this week in Frankfurt, Mr Jeffrey Garten, commerce department undersecretary, said little progress had been made on issues, such as government procurement in telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance and automotive trade. 'We are not seeking to 'manage' our trade,' he said. 'It is more accurate to say that we are trying to open the Japanese market by seeking to have it 'un-managed'.' The construction pact contains agreement to track foreign participation using 'indicators' such as the number of overseas contracts granted and the value of the contracts. The two sides will have regular annual meetings to evaluate progress. In the framework talks, Japanese negotiators have been reluctant to agree to any supposition about imports on the grounds that 'expectations' agreed in past semiconductor and car parts pacts have been interpreted by the US side as market share commitments. The 'action plan' Tokyo devised gives the US most of what it has demanded during the years of frustration over the inability of US companies to win Japanese government construction contracts. Mr Kantor said there would be 'a lag time' before the contracts won by foreign companies is felt in their home economies. But he saw this as a boost for foreign participation in a Dollars 1,000bn infrastructure market planned in Asia. Reuter adds from Beijing: US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen plans to meet Mr Hosokawa in Tokyo on Sunday to discuss economic framework talks, a US Treasury Department spokeswoman said yesterday.</p>

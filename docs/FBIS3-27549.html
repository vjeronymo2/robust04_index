			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji said today that China will scrap its foreign exchange  swap market before April following the recent unification of its  dual-track foreign exchange system.    Zhu, also governor of the People's Bank of China, made the  announcement in a question-and-answer session after delivering a  speech on China's economic reforms in a downtown Tokyo hotel.    He explained that instead, the government will establish a  unified inter-bank foreign-exchange market to transact money.    The new unitary and controlled floating exchange-rate  system,  based on market supply and demand, was introduced on January 1.    Zhu said his government will soon announce details of  regulations on foreign currency for foreign-funded firms, adding  that they will find no inconvenience in purchasing hard  currencies as long as they adhere to deals already struck.    On the transaction of renminbi by foreign banks, he said it  is still too early to allow them to begin such business in China  since the country's banks have not yet transformed to full blown  commercial activities.    "If we say yes over the renminbi deal now, the Chinese banks  will cease to exist," he said.    He added that the government plans to change the present  banking system and restructure all the banks, except the central  bank and other specially designated banks.    "This will be done along with the ongoing reforms of  state-owned enterprises," he added.    The vice premier made a cautious reference to the listing of  stocks by domestic firms due to insufficient regulations and  said his government is currently not considering allowing  foreign firms to list their shares in China.    Zhu arrived here Wednesday for a nine-day visit and is  scheduled to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and hold  talks with Foreign Minister Isutomu Hata later in the day. He  will also travel to western and southwestern Japan to take a  personal look at corporate activities there.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Italy faces threat of big rise in unemployment: The worsening jobs outlook has jumped to the top of the political agenda UNEMPLOYMENT has jumped to the top of the Italian political agenda with warnings from the Bank of Italy and Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of big rises to come. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro took the unprecedented step of writing to the prime minister urging him to tackle unemployment, which had reached levels 'an industrial democracy could not tolerate in the long term'. Then yesterday the theme was taken up by Mr Bruno Trentin, head of the CGIL, the largest trade union confederation. Figures vary of the number of jobs at risk. According to Censis, the social research institute, at least 700,000 jobs may go this year. The government has talked of 500,000 potential job losses. Concern is increasingly evident in the near daily worker protests over job cuts. Last week brought a two-hour stoppage in all Pirelli plants, a march through Naples by employees of the troubled state aerospace group Alenia, and a rally in Rome by 5,000 workers of Enichem, the lossmaking state chemicals group. The unemployment rate is estimated at 11.2 per cent. Although this is similar to that of Britain and nearly a point higher than France, economists say Italian unemployment is increasing rapidly. Industrial production is falling sharply (down 3.7 per cent this month compared to January 1992). Public and private sector companies are struggling to remain competitive amid a growing burden of debt. Hard decisions about job cuts in steel, defence and chemicals have yet to be made. Added to this, civil service recruitment is frozen and the public administration is about to be overhauled. The latest figures for heavy industry show that in October employment was 6.8 per cent down on the same period in 1991. At the same time, the services sector has ceased to play its traditional role, absorbing excess labour from industry: employment here is stagnant. The real unemployment picture, however, is obscured by the employers' ability to lay off workers for up two years on near-full pay largely subsidised by the government. Use of this lay-off facility increased 10.9 per cent in 1992 and now embraces 327,000 workers. Many of those industrial concerns in the north of the country resorted to this mechanism in mid-1991 at the onset of the economic downturn, and the time limit will be up this year. In early 1991, the government introduced a variant to subsidised lay-offs - funding a job mobility scheme. Those on this waiting list, held open for two years, also are excluded from the unemployment figures. On February 7, the first 70,000 on this scheme who have not found jobs become formally unemployed and then have no formal support from the state. But the most disturbing aspect of the figures is both the high proportion of youth unemployment and the disproportionate number of jobless in the south. Those aged between 14 (the school-leaving age) and 29 represent on average 29 per cent of the total unemployed. In the south of Italy, youth unemployment represents 42 per cent of the total against 15 per cent in the centre and north. Last week, the government announced that close to L50,000bn (Dollars 36bn) was available, part in unspent previous budget allocations, to stimulate and sustain employment. Of this L10,000bn was earmarked for public works, L10,000bn for transport, and L10,000bn for the south. But yesterday the CGIL's Mr Trentin dismissed this kind of assistance as being of limited use in promoting real economic growth and sustaining real jobs. He warned that entire regions in Italy risked being de-industrialised and said it was essential for the government, unions and employers to consider measures which brought longer-term economic benefit.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Trapped by a formula - From Lingotto, William Packer takes American Art to task With the millennium now in immediate prospect, an urge to look back across the several phases and developments of the 20th century is hardly perverse. American Art 1930-1970, sponsored by Fiat at Lingotto, its former factory complex on the outskirts of Turin (until March 31), thus takes the century's middle 40 years, and a national school as important as any in the up-and-down, in-and-out history of modern art. The importance of American Art in the second half of our century is manifest, mainly for the commercial and critical power it has commanded and the influence it has enjoyed. Any exhibition that marks its transition from provincial and insignificant backwaters to world power must be important, and all the more so for being well-chosen, installed and documented. But whatever the fond hopes of scholars and curators, it does not follow that every such exhibition will necessarily be a celebration of its subject. The recent Pop Art show at the Royal Academy was a useful if inadvertent beginning, and now here at Lingotto, with an ever deepening scepticism, we again confront the critical claims made for later 20th century American Art. Ever since abstract expressionism burst on an astonished world shortly after the Second World War, these claims have been extraordinary, both in their critical extravagance and the reward they have brought at least some of their perpetrators. We may not accept that Jasper Johns or de Kooning, for example, are quite the peers of Degas or Velasquez in terms of talent or achievement, but the market has been saying no less of them these many years. Such claims may still pass unchallenged, yet, the moment we pause to think before the work itself, they fall away. The practical test is simple enough. Walk slowly through the Lingotto exhibition, following natural curiosity rather than supposed duty, and note where one is detained the longer. We find that the earlier spaces, smaller in themselves and accounting for no more than a quarter of the space overall, require time and close attention in inverse proportion to the wider spaces beyond. They contain the work of the 1930s and 40s, principally figurative and comparatively small in scale, conscientiously made. What do we find beyond? Why, the abstract expressionism of Still and Motherwell, the Pop Art of Rosenquist and Wesselman, the minimalism of Andre, Stella, Ryman, Marden, the conceptualism of Kossuth and Baldessari, the neon tubes of Flavin and Sonnier, the twisted pipes of Serra, the celebrated junk of Rauschenberg and Johns: in short the sum of American genius after 1950. 'It is incredible', says Attilio Codognato in his catalogue introduction, 'how much our garbage can reveal about our lives.' To come round to Philip Pearlstein at the very end of the show, and he no master of the nude figure, is to feel a real relief at something attempted, struggled with, something to look at. But it is with the long disregarded provincials, the realists and symbolists of the first period, Hart Benton, Hopper, Sheeler, Reginald Marsh and Isobel Bishop, that the real pleasure and interest of this exhibition lie. It is not that the later developments are without critical interest and even beauty. The parallel currents of abstraction and figuration, in the 1940s especially, are fascinating to trace, as much in the early work of Rothko and Gorky as of Hopper and Marsh. What is both astonishing and unforgiveable is the extraordinary critical totalitarianism by which suddenly, around 1950, the new order was imposed, what had gone before deemed trivial and irrelevant to the great task and future that lay ahead. The effects upon the world at large, that more or less swallowed this humbug whole, are another matter. Here the havoc wrought on American Art itself is enough. We have only to consider the later work of true talents such as Philip Guston and Mark Rothko, even de Kooning, shown alongside the earlier, to sense real desperation and despair. Commercial interest was put before any complexity or inconsistency in the artist's imaginative development. Consistency and predicability were all, a mere matter of style, to be recognised and presented to the world at large. Trapped by a formula, Rothko killed himself: Guston escaped into a vigorously cynical symbolism: de Kooning's fierce figurative expressionism simply drained away. And for the rest, was there ever anything serious to say of Rosenquist, as inept a painter ever to achieve an international reputation, or Clyfford Still, or Barnett Newman, or Rauschenberg? By such heroes as these is the claim, sustained, that the American School is most significant of our time. What is ultimately so depressing is not so much the over-vaunted claim, as the its acceptance by so many of the artists themselves. By 1960 there had developed that curious aesthetic and moral arrogance which is perhaps America's truer contribution in the history of art. The artist no longer struggles, does not look and learn from the world about his own abilities and perceptions. The artist is always right. Such is the patronising cynicism, or naivety perhaps, of a Rauschenberg with his paint-daubed bric-a-brac, a Johns who nails a broom to his canvas, a Lewitt who simply tells the gallery assistant to draw lines in pencil on the wall, a Baldessari who paints the banal text from the painter's manual, a Robert Morris who would wrap his brain in dollar bills? The conceptual artist would tell us what to think, would limit our experience of his work to what he would tell us. And he must forgive us if we yawn and turn away. American aesthetic correctness, as opposed to its sometime art, is to be resisted.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Big US companies give welcome but fear extra cost BIG US companies gave a subdued welcome to the Clinton plan yesterday, expressing support for an overhaul of the health care system but concern about the extra bureaucracy and cost that it might bring. Xerox, which was singled out by President Bill Clinton in his speech to Congress on Wednesday night for bringing down the cost of health coverage for its employees, was among those to express caution about the reforms. 'We think there could be extra costs for a company like us, just in keeping the government informed of what we are doing,' Xerox said. Under the Clinton plan, companies which operate their own managed care arrangements, and which have more than 5,000 employees, will be able to offer health care as now. However, they will have to show they meet certain standards and report regularly to state regulators. Like other big companies, Xerox said it was too early to assess the impact of the president's proposed payroll tax on companies which continued to offer their own health plans, outside the 'health alliances'. However, the proposed tax, yet to be quantified, was one of the main reasons for the muted reaction from big business yesterday. Companies in industries likely to benefit from the changes, meanwhile, were more forthcoming with their praise for the plan. The big three US car companies, among those expected to benefit most, all issued statements supporting the plan. 'Credit should be given to President Clinton for finally forcing the issue - his six-principle plan is the most comprehensive and far-reaching ever offered,' said Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of Ford. Chrysler added that, by controlling overall health care spending and spreading the costs among businesses more evenly, the plan would 'stimulate the economy and promote job growth.' The big car companies would benefit from the proposal to shift some of the health care costs of early retirees to the state, and from the planned ceiling on health care costs for employees, put at 7.9 per cent of total payroll costs. Small business representatives continued to oppose the requirement that all employers meet at least 80 per cent of their employees' health care costs. Mr Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said small businesses were 'appreciative' of the president's efforts in tackling one of their biggest and most troubling costs. However, he added: 'Forcing employers to pay for health insurance is nothing more than a hidden, regressive tax on jobs. It falls most heavily on those who can least afford it - smaller, marginal businesses and their lower-wage employees.' Mr Faris also warned that the new arrangements could turn out to be more costly than projected in the Clinton plan. 'Small business owners will have few options to contain costs if the system fails or is slow to get started,' Mr Faris said.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: KINGDOM TIES FOSTER'S WORLD INDOOR RECORD  </P> <P> Roger Kingdom tied the world indoor record for the 60-meter hurdles with a time  of 7.36 seconds Wednesday in a meet at Piraeus, Greece.  </P> <P> Greg Foster had the same time in a 1987 meet at the Sports Arena, but there was  some controversy about the validity of the record. Some athletes and officials  contended that Foster and others in the race jumped the gun.  </P> <P> "With this race, I made the time official in the eyes of the IAAF  (International Amateur Athletic Federation)," Kingdom said. "(Foster)  false-started.  </P> <P> "I was one of the people in the race behind him and I false-started, so truly I  believe in my heart that I have the world record."  </P> <P> Jack Pierce and Arthur Blake finished second and third with times of 7.63 and  7.65, respectively.  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Panamanian leader pleads not guilty Former President Manuel Sols Palma, Panama's figurehead leader while General Manuel Noriega called the shots as defence chief, has pleaded not guilty to charges of abusing his authority, AP reports from Panama City. Mr Sols Palma fled to Venezuela and is not attending the trial. He is accused of using paramilitary groups to help suppress street protests. He and three men already in jail - Arturo Marguines, Enrique Thompson and Benjamin Colamarco - are charged with attempting to undermine state security and Panama's standing in the world. If convicted, each faces up to three years' imprisonment on the first count and three to six years' on the second.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Oleynikov report: "The Duma Is Concerned Over the </F> Right to Life]    [Text] Yesterday parliamentary hearings were held in the  State Duma, subject: "The Right to Life: the Safety of Consumer  Goods and Services." Apart from representatives of the  ministries and departments concerned, delegates from consumer  societies from various Russian cities took part.    Not only medics are concerned about the noticeably growing  mortality of Russians as a result of injuries and poisoning: up  2.35 times over the past six years. For instance, in 1993,  51,000 people died of alcohol poisoning -- 4.3 times more than  in 1987. Many consumer goods are becoming rather a menace. Our  country is turning into a dump where foodstuffs, consumer goods,  and household electronics are being brought from all over the  world which do not meet accepted safety standards, with expired  shelf life dates. Our own producers are also notorious enough.  Many departmental laboratories have been closed "for economic  reasons." If a traditional wholesale merchandiser refuses to  take a dubious lot, it can be disposed of through small  distributors. Cunning entrepreneurs have found ways around bans  and obstacles put up by standardization and quality control  bodies.    What is to be done? Experts with organizations and  establishments concerned, primarily the Russian Consumers'  Union, consider it necessary to draft a federal program for  three years and under this program create a state system to  monitor the quality and safety of goods and services, based on a  package of laws and government resolutions establishing safety  norms for goods and services....    The project proposed by experts is good in all respects,  even  the idea of financing the federal program from an insurance fund  with contributions from suppliers of potentially hazardous  goods. Of course, money from the treasury is also needed....  But the main thing is clear: If Duma deputies like the draft,  they will put it into action without a second's hesitation,  taking a major step towards consumers' aspirations. And will  thus justify this parliament's right to exist.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilmer Murillo] </F>   [Excerpts] Mexico City -- Mexican President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari and Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon  yesterday signed a treaty that establishes a free trade zone  between the two countries. [passage omitted]    The Free Trade Agreement [FTA] covers issues such as access  to markets, norms of origin, agriculture, technical hours,  phytosanitary issues, protection measures, disloyal actions,  government purchases, investments, services, intellectual  copyright, and settlement of controversies. The agreement will  allow a better flow of trade and investments, and it will entail  growth and welfare for the two countries.    According to political and business leaders, this is the  most  advanced agreement signed to date between two Latin American  nations; and it will have particularly beneficial effects for  Costa Rica, whose trade balance with Mexico has a 90-million  colones deficit.    Certain Mexican newspapers said the treaty was not timely  and  prompted by the two countries' political interests.  Nevertheless, the deep emotion that prevailed during the  ceremony where the document was signed proved the need to  reassert historical and cultural ties with Latin America after  joining the great northern trade bloc -- NAFTA with Canada and  the United States.    Samuel Yankelewitz, president of the Chamber of Industries,  emphasized the treaty is very technical and includes all the  necessary elements for things to work correctly. Although he  admitted it was certainly necessary to hasten things because the  current administration is about to end, he warned that things  were done correctly despite the haste. This resulted in a fair  and balanced treaty for the two nations.    Doris Osterlof, executive director of the Chamber of  Exporters, referred to this issue and said businessmen are ready  to face the challenge of competing with the Mexicans. "We have  an industry that is ready because we have experimented and  competed in the Central American market for 30 years. Now our  industry will expand its limits to the Mexican market," she said.    According to Costa Rican businessmen's estimates, the  country  may quintuple its current exports to Mexico in five years --  from 60 million colones to 250 million colones.    Carlos Alvarado, president of the Chamber of Commerce,  announced that businessmen began their contacts this week to  attract foreign investments from Costa Rica to Mexico.    The Mexican and Costa Rican stock exchanges signed an  agreement after the FTA was signed, opening the market to new  financial opportunities; and the International Bank of Costa  Rica (BICSA) announced it will open a new support office in  Guatemala to study the possibility of going to Mexico. This way  the bank can continue to support everything dealing with foreign  trade, BICSA Vice President Arturo Cuevillas noted.    According to official sources, the FTA signed yesterday will  allow investments in Costa Rica to increase by approximately 10  billion colones. The possibility is a result of the attraction  Costa Rica will have as a point of access to a market of 90  million people. Mexican businessmen will be able to install  their factories here and export to their country. Currently 80  billion colones, approximately 8 percent of the GDP, in Mexican  capital has been invested here.    Meanwhile, businessmen from other countries who are seeking  access to the Mexican market through the tariff advantages that  the agreement grants products manufactured in Costa Rica, will  be able to do so. Hitachi, National Batteries, Ticatex, Cocoa  Products, and Salas Lizano are included in that category.    The agreement foresees the immediate elimination of tariffs  for 70 percent of the Mexican exports; for 20 percent in five  years; and for 10 percent in 10 years. Also, 75 percent of  national exports will be cleared immidiately; 15 percent will be  cleared in five years; and 10 percent will be cleared in 10  years.  <H5>  [Box, p 12A] </H5>   The Mexican authorities accepted last minute changes to the  FTA, allowing Costa Rica the possibility of exporting 5,000 tons  of powdered milk per year to that country." Meanwhile, "Mexico  will be able to freely export condensed and evaporated milk to  Costa Rica.</p>

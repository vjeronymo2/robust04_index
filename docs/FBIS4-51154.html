			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The second meeting of  the Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade, Scientific  and Technological Cooperation was held here this afternoon.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and visiting Russian Deputy  Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin co-chaired the meeting and they  exchanged opinions on issues of furthering bilateral economic,  trade, scientific and technological cooperation in a  constructive way.    Li said that Sino-Russian economic and trade relations have  made much progress, with bilateral trade volume last year  reaching 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, nearly twice the highest  figure between China and the former Soviet Union.    He noted that there is vast potential for bilateral economic  and trade cooperation, for bilateral trade volume last year only  made up less than 4 percent of China's total foreign trade  volume.    Both countries agreed that their two highly complementary  economies and their location provide a good base for furthering  bilateral economic and trade relations.    Although the Sino-Russian trade volume is not very big, Li  said he believes that Russia will become an important trade  partner of China.    They also exchanged opinions on existing problems in  bilateral economic, trade, scientific and technological  cooperation.</p>

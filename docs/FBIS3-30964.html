			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic </F> of Srpska, by unidentified correspondent; date and place not  given -- recorded; in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian]    [Text] [Correspondent] Would you please be so kind as to  comment on Lord Owen's statement to the effect that you have  agreed to the new proposal on the Bosnian union? According to  that proposal, the Serbs would not have the right to leave the  Bosnian union.    [Karadzic] No, we have accepted the Bosnian union, but  according to the Muslim-Serbian declaration, we have the right  to leave it whenever we wish. We may be within the union or  outside it. If at any given moment this is easier for reaching  peace, we are going to accept the union as well.    [Correspondent] Do you think that the danger of air strikes  is greater or smaller as compared to the situation two days ago?    [Karadzic] This has never depended on our behavior. This is  an internal problem of the NATO pact.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Octavian Paler editorial: "Searching for Explanations"] </F>   [Text] It is obvious that the opposition has decided to  leave aside the nebulous sphere of principles and to take the  practical and decisive step of holding out its hand to the  current power, with a view to taking the country out of the  crisis. The representatives of the Democratic Convention [CDR]  overcame their doubts and went to the meeting at Cotroceni  [presidential palace] with the offer to form a new governmental  coalition. The only nonnegotiable condition they put forward  was that the coalition should distance itself from the extremist  parties. It became equally obvious that this hand was turned  down in more or less polite terms. Probably surprised by such  an unequivocal offer, Ion Iliescu found no better solution than  to repeat his vague remarks about the "political pact" to which  he is inviting the parties, thus proving that he does not really  want a solution to the crisis through sharing power with the  opposition, but rather a political "hora" [Romanian folk dance]  around the crisis. The end of the Cotroceni meeting looked like  a display of all cards out on the table, with the recognition of  the fact that the negotiations were a bluff.    Less clear is why Ion Iliescu does not want to hear anything  about the current suffering of the Romanians and the poor  administration of the country in the years that have elapsed  since the revolution. Does he really believe that everything is  linked to some fatalistic notions and the hardships of  transition? Now, when we are much worse off, not only compared  to the Poles, Czechs, or Hungarians, but also to the Bulgarians,  who are also in a transition process, we cannot find another  explanation for such beliefs -- without feeling offended -- than  that the president has lost all contact with reality. Then, it  is also not at all clear why Ion Iliescu stubbornly ignores the  disastrous opinion of the majority of the population about  Vacaroiu's government and why he still does not fear an alliance  of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] with the  extremist parties, in the light of the international uproar  around Zhirinovskiy's circus. Is is possible that nothing  matters -- not even the country being brought to ruin by an  incompetent and corrupt government and not even the reticence of  the outside world -- when the interests of personal power are at  stake? Ion Iliescu has let us understand that all he wanted was  a pact through which all the political forces would side with  those who are administering the catastrophe. His secret dream  seems to be to turn political pluralism into a kind of  ideological federation or national symposium, where everybody  comes up with his ideas and throws them together into the pile,  after which they pledge to no longer have any other objections.  He seems to dismiss the fact that the role of political  pluralism in the democratic world is to ensure a governing  alternative and a competition of programs, not an amalgam of  strategies. But then, we want to be original at all costs,  don't we? Here comes up, in a new version, the old idea of a  "front," within which one can argue over details, as long as the  minority subordinates itself to the majority.    At the level of the end results, things are rather clear. It  is the cause that is more unclear. How can one explain the  negative answer that came from Cotroceni? It is not easy to  find an explanation to that, since there might be several.    1. Ion Iliescu is the spokesman (some say "the prisoner") of  certain forces that do not want a change, but rather the  consolidation of the restoration; this should be done quietly,  and if one can no longer have the graveyard quiet of Ceausescu's  days, at least it should be the quiet of resignation.    2. Ion Iliescu is convinced that he has become master of the  situation and can now afford to ignore all suffering and  discontent.    3. Ion Iliescu feels more secure amid the insults and  flattery coming from the extremist parties than alongside  certain parties that talk too much about truth, reform, and  Europe.    4. Ion Iliescu cannot overcome his resentment toward the CDR  leaders, who have often criticized him. Consequently, anything  the Convention offers him, except applause, should be rejected.    5. Ion Iliescu cannot escape the limits of his  Gorbachev-like thinking.    In the end, regardless of what the cause may be, to defend  the morass into which we are sinking is a dangerous game.</p>

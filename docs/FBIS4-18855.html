			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrew Marshal report: "Europe Divided on Single Currency"] </F>   [Text] Athens -- Britain's view of monetary union is  prevailing, Kenneth Clarke [Chancellor of the Exchequer] said  yesterday, as fresh splits emerged over Europe's path to a  single currency.    Finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in  Athens clashed over how the European Monetary System [EMS]  should be put back on track, and how to progress towards  European Monetary Union [EMU]. "I think I am in the mainstream  of finance ministers from the bigger countries who make the  running," the Chancellor told BBC radio afterwards.    Germany and France oppose moving rapidly back to narrow  bands  in the EMS after last year's crisis which nearly destroyed the  system. Belgium and Denmark have led some of the smaller  countries in pushing for a return to the tighter disciplines of  the EMS. But Mr Clarke said "I don't think they were major  players here today."    French sources said a return to narrow bands would have to  await lower inflation in Germany. Hans Tietmeyer, the  Bundesbank president, said that inflation was still too high at  3.2 per cent.    The Chancellor said that despite Britain's recent European  problems, opinion on monetary matters was moving in the  Government's favour. "The whole tenor of the discussion has  changed," he said. "I am totally in the mainstream of discussion  here."    Britain's scepticism about the timetabled path to a single  currency through the disciplines of the EMS is now shared by  France and Germany, but opposed by other smaller states. The  dispute is likely to intensify as the year goes on and public  discussion on monetary union and the EMS resumes.    Alexandre Lamfalussy, head of the European Monetary  Institute, wants the convergence of Europe's economies to be  given pre-eminence rather than a timetabled approach. But the  smaller states want to push the pace by giving Europe's  embryonic central bank new powers over monetary policy and  tightening co-ordination.    Officials in Athens said there had been tough talking  including a mini-revolt by the governors of the larger central  banks, especially Mr Tietmeyer. The Bundesbank president  underlined that countries were responsible for their own  monetary policy, reaffirmed the German central bank's  independence and resisted pressure for interest rate cuts.    The Chancellor also announced that the Channel tunnel rail  link will be one of the first schemes to be funded under new  European Union [EU] transport plans. It is one of lO projects  to be given priority in the construction of Trans-European  Networks, large-scale infrastructure connections.    Ministers discussed how the EU could work with private  capital for these projects, with estimates that a total of ECU20  billion (15 billion pounds) a year will be needed from European  funds. Of this, ECU8 billion has yet to be found.    However, Mr Clarke continued to resist the idea of allowing  the European Commission to borrow money so that it could lend  cash itself. "There was", he said, "continued doubt about the  need for any new financial instrument and for the union to raise  extra money through bonds." But Britain's resistance to the  Commission's infrastructure plans, contained in a white paper  presented last year by Jacques Delors, is much reduced. "Now  we've got down to the detail, we're making more sensible  decisions," Mr Clarke said.    The informal meeting was meant to discuss measures to  promote  European growth through infrastructure projects, funding for  Central and East Europe, as well as the new European monetary  institute. But debate over monetary and interest rate matters,  including behind the scenes discussion about how to resurrect  the EMS, dominated the gathering.    In the past few weeks there has been increasing debate about  what steps need to be taken to put Europe back on track for a  single currency by 1997. But the monetary disasters of the past  two years have instilled caution in Europe's biggest monetary  players, France and Germany, and views about the Maastricht  treaty's route to a single currency have shifted.</p>

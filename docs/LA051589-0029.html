			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TEACHERS STRIKE AS TALKS WITH DISTRICT FAIL  </P> <P> Teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District began their first strike in  19 years today, as the district's 594,000 students faced a day of upheaval and  confusion.  </P> <P> Last-minute maneuvering by district and teacher union leaders failed to avert  the walkout, even though representatives of both sides were in telephone  contact into the night Sunday.  </P> <P> Picketing is set to begin at schools at 7 a.m. today and a flurry of other  activity is expected in the streets and courtrooms of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The union estimates that 20,000 of the 32,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and  counselors in the district will not work. But the district pledges to keep  schools open and urged parents to send their children to school.  </P> <P> In an interview, Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said  of the informal negotiations Sunday: "We are talking back and forth all the  time and proposing 'what if, what if.' I think we will keep pushing . . . but  it may take more time than we've got."  </P> <P> Johnson said the strike might last only a day or two if talks prove fruitful.  But he said political divisions on the school board were complicating matters.  </P> <P> Los Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub told a press conference  Sunday: "There is nothing dramatically new. The lines on this issue have been  clearly drawn and the ball is in the union's court."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school board remained on call but had no plans to meet again in  formal session until Wednesday, district officials said.  </P> <P> Board member Julie Korenstein said Sunday that she and board members Warren  Furutani and Jackie Goldberg favor raising the current offer of a 21.5% raise  over three years based on assurances by several state legislators that the  district will probably receive about $34 million in extra state money for the  fall term.  </P> <P> But those three members could not persuade the board majority during Saturday's  closed-door board meeting to increase the district offer, Korenstein said. She  described the session as "very tense, very uncomfortable . . . there were hard  feelings."  </P> <P> The union said that the unanticipated surplus in state revenue should be used  for a 10% retroactive raise this year, between 5.5% and 9% in the upcoming year  and 8% the following year.  </P> <P> Union representatives were planning to picket as early as 2 a.m. at food and  supply warehouses that service the schools, in hopes that drivers would not  make deliveries. "We just don't want to miss any opportunity to stop the  system. Maybe it will take that to get the school board to pay attention," said  Catherine Carey, a union spokeswoman.  </P> <P> At 9 a.m., the union is expected to sponsor eight large rallies in parks  throughout the Los Angeles area. The union also prepared strike headquarters,  mainly at other unions' offices, for each of the administrative regions within  the district.  </P> <P> District officials conceded that they cannot staff every classroom in a strike.  About 500 new substitute teachers have been hired and 500 administrators with  teaching credentials will be assigned to classrooms, in addition to the regular  substitute teachers willing to cross picket lines, they said.  </P> <P> Irene Yamahara, district associate superintendent for personnel, said Sunday  that substitutes fearful of driving their cars to their assignments can show up  at regional offices and be transported in district buses to the schools. To  prevent vandalism, their cars will be left in fenced and guarded parking lots,  she said.  </P> <P> Teachers plan to picket at those assignment spots, in hopes that the bus  drivers will not transport the substitutes. However, the drivers may be  independent contractors, without union allegiance, said union sources.  </P> <P> Associate Supt. Gabriel Cortina said principals will have the toughest jobs  today. "They're going to have to make some very quick judgments in the morning  and work with whatever staff they have . . . to sort kids out properly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Kids on Other Side'  </P> <P> "We are calling out for parents and volunteers to come to school and remember  that it is the kids on the other side of the picket line," Cortina said. "If  they cross the line . . . they're helping the kids. I hope people can find it  in their consciences that they will be helping the kids and not take sides with  the district or the union."  </P> <P> Jay Roth, one of the attorneys representing the union, said he would go to the  state Court of Appeal today to seek an emergency injunction suspending district  Supt. Leonard Britton's order that teachers must hand in grades by today or  face withholding of pay for the month ended last Friday. In February, a  Superior Court judge ruled on a similar order that the matter should be  reviewed by the state Public Employment Relations Board, not the courts.  </P> <P> Asked what the union would do if it won such an injunction, union President  Johnson said that would depend on whether there were progress in the  negotiations. "We'd have to do some quick rethinking. We might conceivably call  off the strike and go back to the original strike date of the 30th." The union  moved up the strike by two weeks in response to Britton's grade order.  </P> <P> Weintraub, speaking for the board majority, praised the district's current  offer, calling it "the best in the nation" among the country's largest school  districts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Budget Cuts Promised  </P> <P> The board has agreed to make about $120 million in budget cuts over the next  two years but, Weintraub said, a board majority is unwilling to make deeper  budget cuts for salaries.  </P> <P> District officials said that teachers by the end of a one-week strike will lose  about 2.5% of their annual pay, the same percentage that separates the  district's offer from the union's demand.  </P> <P> Weintraub, who urged parents to send their children to school today,  acknowledged that there will be some confusion at many schools.  </P> <P> "It will be difficult," Weintraub said. "Schools will range from no teachers  out to all teachers out; student attendance will definitely and decidedly be  down."  </P> <P> Helen Bernstein, a teachers union vice president, said her members were being  reminded of last-minute details and duties for a strike through a telephone  network on Sunday. Teachers were being assigned picketing duties at various  sites around the school district at different times of the day," she said.  </P> <P> "We're telling everybody it's a go," said John Fernandez, the union chairman at  Roosevelt High School.  </P> <P> District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said school police officers have been  asked to work 12-hour shifts to avert trouble on the 600 campuses of the  nation's second-largest school district, which struggled through a strike of  nearly three weeks in 1970. In addition, the district may hire off-duty  officers from other local jurisdictions.  </P> <P> "We don't expect any problems maintaining security, but you never know how  things can flare up," Munatones said.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the Los Angeles Police Department and county Sheriff's Department  said they had no plans for extra security measures in preparation for the  strike.  </P> <P> However, Lt. Frank Valdez, watch commander in the Police Department's  gang-plagued 77th Division, said he was concerned about security both on and  off campus during the strike.  </P> <P> "The problem kids . . . are not going to go to school and it's going to create  problems all over, not just on campus," Valdez said. "What I'm mainly concerned  about is basically the safety of the other people with all these little  predators out on the street."  </P> <P> About 20 parents and children demonstrated outside the union headquarters on  West 3rd Street Sunday afternoon. Chanting "UTLA, NO WAY" and carrying signs  with slogans such as "Holding Our Students' Grades Is Criminal," they placed  most of the blame for the current impasse on the union and said they feared  that the withholding of students' grades by teachers could harm the students,  especially those heading off to college.  </P> <P> Among them was Annie Richardson, who ran unsuccessfully two years ago for the  district's South-Central area seat held by Rita Walters. "UTLA is about the  business of taking control of the district," she said, referring to the union's  election push for friendly candidates on the board and its desire for teachers  to have a majority voice on proposed school governing councils.  </P> <P> By striking before a state fact-finder's report is issued, and thus possibly  breaking the law, teachers are setting "a poor example for telling our children  to obey rules," she said.  </P> <P> The fact-finder's report is expected to be issued on Wednesday and labor law  experts said the district could ask that the union be fined, and its leaders  possibly jailed, for striking before receiving the report. The union, however,  says that Britton's order about the grades was itself an unfair labor practice  and a provocation to strike.  </P> <P> No one from the union was at the rally to talk to the parents. Union  spokeswoman Carey said in a telephone interview that the parents should have  demonstrated in front of the district's offices instead. "Those parents are  blaming the wrong people," she said.  </P> <P> Confusion remains on the issue of health insurance coverage for striking  teachers. The union says federal law requires district coverage to continue for  60 days, but the district disputes that. Contrary to comments by union  President Johnson on Saturday, the district still insists that teachers send in  checks for their own premium by today. However, the district has told health  care providers not to refuse to treat any teacher, although the providers may  ask teachers to sign a waiver agreeing to possibly pay for the services later.  </P> <P> Contributing to this article was Times education writer Elaine Woo.  </P> <P> THE DISTRICT, THE UNION AND THE LABOR DISPUTE  </P> <P> THE DISTRICT: FACTS AND FIGURES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District has 594,802 students in kindergarten  through the 12th grade. The last day of classes for most students is June 23;  the last day for teachers is June 26. District enrollment includes:  </P> <P> 321,220 elementary students at 410 schools  </P> <P> 117,447 junior high students at 73 schools  </P> <P> 119,904 senior high students at 49 schools  </P> <P> 27,094 magnet school students at 85 schools  </P> <P> 5,022 opportunity and continuation school students at 55 schools  </P> <P> 4,115 students at 18 schools for the disabled  </P> <P> The district also operates:  </P> <P> 90 children centers  </P> <P> 16 latchkey after-school programs  </P> <P> 10 after-school enrichment programs  </P> <P> 4 infant centers  </P> <P> The district has 32,000 employees, of whom 22,000 belong to United Teachers-Los  Angeles. About 17,000 union members voted in favor of a strike. The district  has 2,800 credentialed substitute teachers and 1,900 administrators with  teaching credentials.  </P> <P> THE TEACHERS' BARGAINING UNIT: FACTS AND FIGURES  </P> <P> The bargaining unit covered by the teachers' union contract is made up of union  and non-union employees. There is not a closed shop, so not all members of the  bargaining unit belong to the union:  </P> <P> 27,000 classroom teachers  </P> <P> 2,800 substitute teachers  </P> <P> 500 children's center teachers  </P> <P> 525 secondary counselors (junior and senior high school)  </P> <P> 186 school attendance and adjustment services counselors  </P> <P> 450 nurses  </P> <P> 373 school psychologists  </P> <P> 123 librarians  </P> <P> THE ISSUES  </P> <P> The teachers' union is asking for a 21% pay increase over two years; the  district is offering 21.5% over three years. The union's salary demand for next  year exceeds the district's offer by an average of about $900 per teacher -- or  about $4 per workday. The average annual salary for district teachers is  $36,000.  </P> <P> The two sides also disagree on non-monetary issues such as a preparation period  for elementary teachers and how to expand teachers' authority to make school  decisions.  </P> <P> PLANS DURING STRIKE  </P> <P> The district has said it will keep all schools open with the help of  substitutes and administrators, and will continue to operate after-school  programs such as sporting events and day care. The district says coaches, drama  and music teachers and others may direct students and sports teams in the  afternoons and evenings, even if they participate on the picket lines during  the day. But the union has asked teachers and coaches not to participate in any  school activities. The district said no important end-of-the-year events would  be canceled. Parents would act as prom chaperones, and administrators and  substitute teachers would lead graduation ceremonies. But without final grades  submitted by teachers, the awarding of diplomas might be delayed.  </P> <P> TELEPHONE HOT LINES  </P> <P> The district is operating telephone hot lines between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday  through Friday:  </P> <P> General strike information: 213-625-KIDS  </P> <P> High school information: 213-345-GRAD  </P> <P> Adult education information: 213-62-LEARN  </P> <P> It also has a 24-hour recorded telephone hot line updated daily:  </P> <P> English: 213-625-4000  </P> <P> Spanish: 213-625-4643  </P> <P> The union has a hot line for teachers only, which is not made public.  </P> <P>  Compiled by Times researcher Tracy Thomas.

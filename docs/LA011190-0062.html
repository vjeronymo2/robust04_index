			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> GOLF FEES WILL INCREASE  </P> <P> Teeing off at the Alhambra Golf Course is going to be a little more expensive  beginning Feb. 1.  </P> <P> To help pay for general maintenance and improvements at the 18-hole course, the  City Council on Monday voted to raise fees by amounts ranging from 50 cents to  $2, depending on when the rounds are played. Under the new formula, for  example, playing 18 holes on a weekend would cost $14, up from $12.  </P> <P> The proposed increases have been posted at the city golf course since early  December, and there have been no complaints from players, said Jerry Wisz, a  golf professional who manages the course.  </P></p>

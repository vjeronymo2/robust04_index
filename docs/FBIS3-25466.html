This measure,  which bans all public demonstrations, is accompanied by a curfew  that will be in force from 2200 to 0530. The decision was made  yesterday at an extraordinary cabinet meeting following violent  incidents that occurred in Libreville at the beginning of the  strike launched yesterday by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions  Federation to demand salary increases after the devaluation of  the CFA franc. The strike quickly turned into riots.  Demonstrators of imprecise political or trade union  affiliations took to the streets, stoning taxis and erecting  barricades in working class districts. For the Gabonese  Government, this represents a takeover of the strike action by  opposition parties. Here are more details with Patrice  Nziengui, communication minister and government spokesman :    [Begin Nziengui recording] The cabinet, while recognizing  the  right of trade unions' to go on strike -- a right that is  essentially aimed at defending workers' rights and industrial  interests -- deeply regrets the political maneuvers underlying  these demonstrations. The Gabonese people have witnessed,  notably in Libreville, the magnitude of the pernicious  consequences of this political manipulation by the opposition.  Barricades were erected in various streets of the capital thus  preventing people from circulating in the city and, consquently,  preventing Gabonese from going to their work places. Vehicles  were burned in various areas and public buildings were set on  fire, notably police stations. People were abducted and detained  against their will. Violence and all sorts of exactions were  perpetrated against them. Firearms were used against security  agents and other citizens.    Therefore, in order to put an end to this situation, which  Gabon does not need because of the negative international and  national economic and political crisis, the government has  decided to reestablish the state of warning as of tonight, 21  February from 2200 to 0530. [end recording]    The state of warning includes a number of practical  dispositions, notably, the imposition of a curfew and the  restriction of certain liberties. These additional measures are  given here by Defense Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga:    [Begin Magnaga recording] First, all people who will be  considered a threat to public order will be arrested. Second,  restrictions have been placed on certain rights, including  freedom of gathering and freedom of movement of property and  people. Theaters, bars, and places of meeting of all sorts are  ordered closed. Finally, a curfew has been imposed and firm  directives have been given to the security forces to strictly  enforce these measures. [end recording]</p>

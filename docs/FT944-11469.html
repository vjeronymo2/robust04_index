			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Superbuyers flex their muscles - Wine When J. Sainsbury, the leading UK supermarket, decided some years ago to launch an own-label armagnac, the size of its initial order was such that, instantly, it became the world's largest single customer for the fiery Gascon brandy. This was just one of hundreds of examples of the power exercised by British supermarket buyers. In drinks' buying, at least, British chains tend to be more innovative, centralised and rapacious than their counterparts on the European mainland - and their American equivalents have no such hold on the heavily-regulated US alcoholic beverage market. Only the Scandinavian and Canadian state drinks monopolies can rival UK supermarkets but, whereas the influence of the former is waning, the British seem ever keener to buy their wines and spirits in the brightly-lit aisles of Sainsbury and its rivals - Tesco, Safeway, Asda and Somerfield. Between them, these five chains sell well over 50 per cent of all wine retailed in the UK. While more and more British wine-drinkers seem to love the supermarkets, the supermarkets themselves love wine. 'The wine department is seen as one of the recruiting departments for the rest of the supermarket,' says Elizabeth Robertson, of Safeway. Because much of the wine is bought at Christmas, the supermarkets view their promotions for this time of year as their annual chance to lure new customers - hence the heavy advertising. Last year's juicy morsel from Safeway was its most successful ever: Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon at Pounds 1.99. Robertson says it was not a loss leader although, certainly, it was not a revenue generator, either. The quantities involved - believed to be about 200,000 cases (well over 100 container lorries) - were so great that two quite different sorts of wines were supplied. No one complained. Safeway invests its three buyers with enormous individual buying power (up to Pounds 50m each a year), and requires them also to be responsible for selling the stuff. Market leader Sainsbury has made its buyers responsible for the less glamorous task of shipping it in the right quantity at the right time. It is at this point that suppliers, some of them tiny peasant enterprises, tend to lose such illusions as remain about the value of one large order. Goliath Stores does not forgive Domaine David his problems with cork suppliers or label printers, any more than it is prepared to pay a sou more than it can get away with. The one thing on which suppliers and supermarkets agree is that the most important factor in the buying equation is price. There is much hot air and waffle about upgrading quality and broadening range; but if a new line cannot be sold with the specified margin (usually considerably higher than its continental equivalent) at, say, Pounds 2.99, Pounds 3.49 or Pounds 3.99, then the deal is usually off. Although, in general terms, the modern wine market is buyer-driven, there have been times when buyers' muscle alone has not been enough to clinch the deal. Widespread frosts in 1991 greatly reduced the quantities of French wine so that, for once, the supermarket buyers had to sell their employers to their suppliers rather than vice-versa. Safeway's Sarah Kynoch says: 'It was really, really hard work, especially with growers who thought 'I've just lost half my crop so I'm certainly not going to sell the other half cheaply'. As a result, we had to drop some suppliers who wouldn't co-operate on price.' The two important brewery-owned multiples, Allied's Victoria Wine and Whitbread's Thresher / Bottoms Up / Wine Rack group, tend to insist just as much on price 'co-operation' in spite of their relative trickle of customers compared with the supermarkets. Tesco's aim is to offer more choice than arch-rival Sainsbury: 785 wines at the last count compared with just over 500 at Sainsbury, including such delights as a brace from Brazil made by a Ukrainian-Australian based in England. But, increasingly, Sainsbury is wedded to exclusivity on individual lines. In spite of its stately approach ('we may not be as quick or whacky as some other supermarkets,' says the company's Claire Gordon-Brown), it has been voted Supermarket of the Year in the 1994 international wine challenge organised by Wine magazine. One thing on which all supermarket wine buyers agree is the need to keep constant tabs on the competition. They are often to be found snooping round their rivals' shelves collecting samples. 'I've often bumped into various suppliers in the wrong supermarket,' admits Gordon-Brown, who once ordered Pounds 1m worth of champagne with a single phone call.</p>

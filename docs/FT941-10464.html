			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Heiton declines to IPounds 750,000 Depressed consumer spending and increased competition cut pre-tax profits at Heiton Holdings, the Dublin-based steel stockholder,builders' merchant and DIY retailer, in the six months to October 31, writes Gerard Baker. Despite a rise in turnover from IPounds 30.1m to IPounds 31.6m, pre-tax profits dropped 20 per cent from IPounds 945,000 to IPounds 753,000 (Pounds 722,000). Mr Diarmuid Quirke, chief executive, said that while the steel stockholding and builders' merchant division, which accounts for the bulk of the group's business, saw profits rise, the DIY side had had a more difficult six months. Weak consumer demand, the growth of capacity in the market and start-up costs associated with the Galway branch of Atlantic Homecare, the main DIY subsidiary, had reduced profits. Earnings per share were 1.74p (1.9p). The interim dividend is held at 0.65p. Mr Quirke said that growing consumer confidence, lower interest rates and new public building projects gave good grounds for optimism.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Disabled quota not being met ONLY ONE government department out of a total of 29 is meeting a quota of 3 per cent for the employment of registered disabled people, official figures published yesterday show. The Civil Service is not bound by the same law that requires other employers to meet the quota but says it tries to meet the standard voluntarily. About 22 per cent of employers overall are estimated to meet the quota. The figures show that 3.2 per cent of the Department of Employment's workforce is registered disabled. The overall average for government departments is 1.4 per cent. The analysis, published by the Department of Employment in Employment Gazette, also shows that only 12 district councils in England and Wales out of 366, and none of 47 county councils or 33 London boroughs, meet the quota. In Scotland, two districts out of 53, but none of the nine regional or three island councils meet the 3 per cent figure. Other nationalised and public authorities not meeting the quota, according to the figures are the BBC, BR, the Civil Aviation Authority, British Coal and the Post Office. The government says the figures are distorted because many disabled people prefer not to register. It added that the number of disabled people had declined and it was no longer possible for organisations to meet the 3 per cent quota.</p>

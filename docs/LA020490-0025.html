			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NEW LAWNDALE BUILDING RULES TO FAVOR CONDOS  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council has tentatively approved building regulations  designed to encourage the construction of condominiums rather than apartments.  </P> <P> The regulations would give builders the option of putting condominiums on lots  where the only alternative now is apartments or single-family dwellings and  eliminate the requirement that condominiums only be built on lots of at least  10,000 square feet.  </P> <P> The 3-2 vote Thursday was taken after little discussion. Councilmen Larry  Rudolph, Dan McKenzie and Harold Hofmann voted for the regulations, while Mayor  Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman opposed them. The regulations will  become law March 17 if the council approves them in a final vote Feb. 15.  </P> <P> Kruse and Norman criticized the proposal in previous meetings, saying it would  increase density and parking problems. They suggested that voters be allowed to  determine what the regulations should be.  </P> <P> Rudolph has maintained that the changes would not increase density.  </P></p>

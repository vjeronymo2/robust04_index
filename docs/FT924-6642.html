			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Action urged over timeshare group THE LABOUR Party has urged the government to protect customers from the activities of Club Riviera, a timeshare company that had its credit licences revoked by the Office of Fair Trading last July. In an early day motion Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, and Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, allege that - like Land Travel, the coach company which collapsed last July - Club Riviera has failed to file accounts within the legal timescale. The motion adds that Club Riviera's records at Companies House 'do not reveal the principals' of its various companies. They include Club Tenerife, Canary Islands Holiday Club, Regency Palms, Marbella Beach Club, Vacation Management Services, Olympus Resources and Mackintosh Associates. The motion says that in spite the OFT's revocation of Club Riviera's credit licences for seriously misleading and deceptive conduct, 'the Department of Trade and Industry has permitted those responsible for such conduct, Laurence Werner, Simon Clarke and others, to continue to run the company'. It adds that Club Riviera and its associated companies 'intimidate consumers they have cheated, repossess thousands of properties resulting from high maintenance charge disputes (and) tricked consumers by offering a buy-back guarantee which was not honoured'. The motion says the company is being investigated 'by the Fraud Office' and calls on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to investigate those who control the companies. It also calls on Mr Heseltine 'to protect existing customers and the public from malpractices'. Club Riviera declined to comment on the motion.</p>

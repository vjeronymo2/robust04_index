			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The U.S. President, in his last statements on the  situation in Bosnia has proposed the plan on safe regions in  Bosnia to cover the surrounding areas, too.    While the international community witnessed how Gorazde was  occupied by the aggressive Serbs as a safe city in Bosnia  against the international organization's indifference, the U.S.  President's statements are more a reaction to public opinion in  the United States and the world.    Gorazde was occupied by the invading Serb Army when the  international community had called for a decisive measure to put  an end to Serbian attacks against Gorazde, with its expression  of disgust toward crimes committed by the Serbs.    The West not only did not show any reaction to this Serb's  invasion of Gorazde but with its silence against these crimes  expressed its pleasure, too.    In the thick of the collapse of Gorazde and the atrocities  by  the Serbs in this Muslim inhabited city, political observers  predicted that the West's silence would place a new dilemma in  front of the western statesmen.    The same observers expressly said that the Serb's victory in  dominating Gorazde will put this question to the western  statesmen as to how they want to prevent Serbs later invasions  in the future.    In response to this question the U.S. President has proposed  to extend NATO air force operation region to the vicinity of  safe regions in Bosnia in a way to cover Serb supply and  ammunition depots.    The U.S. secretary of defense in explaining the failure or  success of the plan on the extension of safe regions to the  vicinity of these region has said: Even if the U.S. presence  plan is confirmed by the NATO military experts it cannot  guarantee the security of the safe regions.    The U.S. President proposed the said plan while political  observers in the United States warned the U.S. statesmen by  saying the Serbs victory in occupying Gorazde has explicitly  endangered U.S. strategic interests and has brought up this  possibility that the Serbs extend their invasion as far as  Croatia and Macedonia.    The situation in the tragic collapse of the Muslim-inhabited  city of Gorazde along with the massacre of human beings in this  city, has made the world people realize this fact that the West  shows serious reaction to aggressors only when its strategic  interests are exposed to threats.    In other words, Gorazde collapsed because the collapse of  this Muslim-inhabited city was not against the West's strategic  interest.    Expansion of Serb invasions against Croatia, in view of  independence-seeking inclinations among the Serbs in [word  indistinct] region, will give this chance to the Serb invaders  to threaten the creation of a confederation of Croatia Republic  and Muslim-Croat Federation which has been agreed upon.    In the meantime, the expansion of Serb aggression against  Macedonia will [word indistinct] the creation of the greater  Serbia.    Expansion of the Serb invasion has placed the UN before the  reality that if it had showed serious and decisive reaction  against violation of the first UN Security Council resolution by  the Serbs, the Bosnian nation would not be the subject of such  atrocities today, and the credibility of this world  organizations would never be harmed as such.</p>

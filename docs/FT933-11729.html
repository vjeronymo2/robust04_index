			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: Of course, we never watch it . . . - Television Every few years we are treated to a dramatic report which purports to show that television viewing is on the decrease. The most recent comes from the Henley Centre For Forecasting, but the source never seems to make much difference. The story, as interpreted by newspapers anyway, is always the same: interest has peaked and television is on the skids. The funny thing is that each successive report begins its scare story of tumbling figures from a larger audience base, higher viewing hours and a bigger total advertising income. What on earth is going on? Several things, perhaps. First, like is not necessarily being compared with like, because television keeps changing. The short history of the medium has been a story of improvement in home reception and changed technology in delivery systems. When the standard scare story of shrinking viewing figures hit the US a few years ago it turned out that while the ratings share of the big three networks had indeed slipped, the reason was not that people were watching less television but that a larger share was being taken by cable and video. Viewers were spending as long or longer than ever in front of their sets. Second, newspapers are, naturally enough, keen to play up any hint that the advance of the new, and worryingly competitive, mass medium has been halted. After all, total newspaper sales really have been slipping ever since the arrival of television. Third, though probably most important in Britain, is The Au Pair Syndrome. This is the habit of the middle class intelligentsia of pretending not to watch television at all. In the 1950s and 1960s the claim was 'We only have a set to help the au pair with her English'. Today the claim varies - we only have it for the news, only for watching opera cassettes, only to help the Filipinos with their English - but the snobbery is unchanged. On the whole people in socio-economic groups A and B do watch less than those in groups C, D and E. This scarcely seems surprising: doctors and businessmen often have jobs which keep them out late, and compared with nurses or centre lathe turners they are better able to afford seats at the opera or dinner in a restaurant. The fact remains that though they may watch less, they still watch a lot - and experience suggests that they are ashamed of this. When, like so many, they switch on to watch the Six O'Clock News and then stay for Top Of The Pops they blame television for its triviality rather than themselves for lack of will power or discrimination. The result is that every time a report such as Henley's appears it is announced with headlines that ring with glee. This one claims, moreover, that the 'decline' is largely among the middle classes. The implication is that television is turning into a yob medium, watched only by the socially inadequate; just what the au pair employing classes always said. But is it not also similar to what this column has been saying for the past two or three years? Have there not been numerous warnings here that the new Thatcherite broadcasting legislation would lead to more tabloid television, more intense ratings contests and a consequent lowering of standards? But there is, surely, a huge difference between trying to hold the line against an expected decline and condemning the medium out of hand. On the rare occasions when somebody stands up for television they are invariably challenged: go on then, name something worth watching, especially at this time of the year. Yet the fact is that even in the murkiest depths of a repeat-laden summer there is (so far, anyway; the full effects of that Thatcherite legislation are yet to be seen) still more of quality to watch on British television than any normal person could find time for, particularly anyone using a video recorder. In drama BBC2 has just finished screening one of the greatest works of television ever created, and probably one of the most important pieces of fiction of the second half of the 20th century: A Second Heimat (extensively reviewed in this column on April 14 and last Wednesday). It lasted 26 hours and was enthralling and almost embarrassingly involving. Watching it all took dedication, but the rewards were tremendous. ITV has shown the first three episodes in Frank Stubbs Promotes which is no Heimat, but is more enjoyable, funnier, and a better reflector of its period than 75 per cent of today's novels. So far it has trodden a little too determinedly in the footsteps of Minder but Timothy Spall is giving a delightful performance in the central role of an over-ambitious ticket tout. In documentaries ITV is showing Kinnock: The Inside Story, a four-part account of the political life of the former Labour leader. The first two episodes have been extraordinarily powerful examples of the type of modern history which causes increasing jealousy and petulance among the sort of academic book historians who would have us believe they only ever catch a glimpse of the television in the JCR. From Orgreave Coke Depot to the night of the 1985 election, these programmes have brought history vividly to life. More valuable still has been Kinnock's voice-over description of his thoughts or reactions to the crises seen before us, from the leadership contest to the Militant showdown. But what makes the series truly compelling is Kinnock's devastating honesty about his own mistakes and failures. BBC2 meanwhile is showing a documentary series made with American co-producers about the development of the oil industry, The Prize, which, as well as being highly informative, is often more exciting and entertaining than Dallas (reviewed here on July 3). Parliament's - or perhaps John Major's - handling of the Maastricht affair may be judged by posterity as shameful and inept, but television's current affairs departments delivered the crucial moments into our homes last week in a manner that was gripping enough to keep some of us out of bed until 3.00am. Jeremy Paxman handled the real-time coverage of bedlam in the House of Commons with all the professionalism you would expect (though the rule about a single static camera angle from behind the bar of the House as the tellers go through must surely be changed) but it was Vincent Hanna who took the honours. No doubt his late night job on Channel 4, of marshalling instant comment, was easier than that of Paxman who had to fly the Newsnight studio by the seat of his pants. Nevertheless Hanna triumphed not only because of his political knowledge and insight but because he brought a steady flow of wit to the proceedings. Invaluable. Last week also brought one of those programmes which can shift your entire perception of the world. I remember clearly, not long after joining the FT 20 years ago, watching a programme about the technical and social implications of a new invention called the microchip. At the time its revelations seemed truly staggering though today, of course, they would be mundane. David Lomax's report in last Thursday's Business Matters on BBC2 about the development of Guangdong province in southern China had a similarly mind-blowing effect. Most of us had already heard, no doubt, about economic strides in China but the detail in this report - there are now 17,000 part-time Avon reps in Guangdong; so far most factories may be primitive, but the staff work 10 hours a day, six days a week, perhaps for 12; they are buying Panasonic televisions and fashionable clothes; drug trafficking, bribery and traffic jams are rocketing - suddenly made you realise where countries like the UK and even the US may stand in, say, 2003. Last month we had Wimbledon from the BBC, this month the Tour de France from Channel 4. On Sunday BBC2 began a season of Summer Dance with Ballanchine's 'Serenade' and 'Western Symphony'. Of course more would be even better, and of course some evenings at present seem like deserts unless you plan ahead and create oases with your video recorder. But, so far, the familiar claim that there is nothing on the box for the more demanding or intelligent viewer is still hooey. And although there may one day be a collapse in television viewing, personal experience suggests it has not happened yet. Average viewing per head of the population in the third week of June this year, according to BARB, was 22 hours 39 minutes. Last year it was 22 hours 38 minutes. Ten years ago the figure was 16 hours 54 minutes. Some slide.</p>

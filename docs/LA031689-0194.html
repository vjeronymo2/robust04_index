			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA LIFTS BAN ON NEWS ON CATHOLIC STATION  </P> <P> The government on Wednesday lifted an eight-month-old ban on news broadcasts by  Nicaragua's Roman Catholic radio station, the only news medium still affected  by last year's sweeping Sandinista crackdown on dissent.  </P> <P> President Daniel Ortega announced the measure after meeting with Cardinal  Miguel Obando y Bravo, the country's senior prelate. Ortega said it is meant to  "create a better climate in our country for strengthening the trend toward a  total and definitive peace" with the U.S.-backed Contras.  </P> <P> He also authorized the return of 10 foreign priests who were expelled from  Nicaragua in recent years and the reopening of the Catholic Social Promotion  Commission, which was closed in 1985 for publishing a bulletin of news and  political commentary without government permission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Intentions a Concern  </P> <P> The moves to ease censorship come as the Bush Administration is preparing to  ask Congress for at least $45 million in non-military aid to keep the rebel  army together in Honduran base camps for another year. Ortega said Wednesday  that he is "concerned" about the Administration's intentions because they "go  against" a peace agreement signed by the five Central American presidents last  month.  </P> <P> Under the accord, the countries of the region are to devise a plan by mid-May  to close the rebel camps in Honduras, and Nicaragua is to take steps to  guarantee open and fair elections by next February.  </P> <P> Government officials said Ortega is preparing a proposal for reforming the laws  that regulate elections and the news media and will unveil them to opposition  parties Friday.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders have demanded that the government abolish its censorship  powers. After peace talks with the Contras broke down last June, the government  used those powers in a wide-ranging crackdown.  </P> <P> Catholic Radio was ordered off the air July 11 for its on-the-scene reporting  of a violent clash between riot police and anti-Sandinista demonstrators. It  was allowed back on the air five weeks later, but only for religious  programming.  </P> <P> Alberto Carballo, general manager of the station, said it will resume news  broadcasts Monday.  </P> <P> Cardinal Obando, an outspoken critic of Sandinista rule, said after meeting  Ortega that he is "pleased that rough spots between the church and state are  being smoothed out." But he refused to join Ortega in opposing further  non-lethal U.S. aid to the Contras.  </P> <P> Noting that the rebel army has been mostly idled in its camps since the  suspension of U.S. military aid a year ago, Obando said: "I told the president  that if he keeps taking steps toward democratization, any new aid to the  Contras will oblige them to stay in Honduras playing volleyball and baseball."  </P></p>

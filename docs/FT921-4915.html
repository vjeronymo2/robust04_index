			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Motorola in Japanese joint venture MOTOROLA of the US and Alps Electric of Japan have reached an agreement seen as a possible forerunner to other collaborative deals between Japanese and western companies. The arrangement means that products based on the two companies' joint semiconductor research in Europe can be brought to world markets this year. Alps, an electronic components manufacturer, is the world's largest independent maker of tuner modules used in television sets and video cassette recorders (VCRs). The US semiconductor and communications group will supply Alps with an integrated circuit (IC) that the two companies designed and developed at their research facilities in Switzerland and the UK. The IC, which significantly reduces the size of the tuner module, is already being manufactured at Motorola's semiconductor plant in Toulouse, France. It will be used in Alps's next generation tuner modules to be manufactured at the Japanese group's plant in the UK and Japan and supplied to television and VCR manufacturers worldwide. For Motorola, the deal, worth in excess of Pounds 25m over the next five years, represents a significant step forward in winning over the Japanese. The US group has often been critical in the past of the closed nature of the Japanese market. But Japanese consumption of semiconductors is growing, in Europe and worldwide. 'Semiconductor manufacturers have to learn to support Japanese customers because, if you don't, you miss out on a huge market,' says Mr Barry Waite, senior vice-president and general manager of Motorola's European semiconductor group. Motorola already supplies Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Sony, in Japan. For Alps, the agreement with Motorola brings it close to achieving a self-imposed target to buy 20 per cent of its domestic semiconductor requirements from overseas manufacturers, says Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing director of Alps UK. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), under pressure from the US, has asked leading corporations to buy 20 per cent of their semiconductor consumption from foreign manufacturers. With increasinginternationalisation of industry, 'what you are seeingfrom Alps is not untypical of what you will be seeing from other (Japanese) companies,' Mr Waite says.</p>

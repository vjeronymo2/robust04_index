Both sides have called for the JLG to speed up its work.    The Government's International Law Division warns that it  will run out of time to seal extradition treaties and other  equally important international agreements.    The legal sub-group of the Beijing-appointed Preliminary  Working Committee (PWC) has found that some of Hong Kong's  legislation that involves international treaties to which China  is not a signatory will not be applicable after 1997 unless the  JLG localises the laws.    A PWC member, Maria Tam Wai-chu said she hoped the JLG could  speed up its work to facilitate discussion in the PWC or whether  the existing British related laws complied with the Basic Law.  China must grant approval before Hong Kong authorities can  enter into lengthy negotiations with another country about  treaties or agreements. Several rounds of talks are necessary  before a deal can be tentatively struck and it must then be put  before the Executive Council and the Chinese side in the JLG for  final approval.    "We have reached the stage where all the programmes simply  cannot be done in the remaining period of time," said the  International Law Division's head, David Edwards. "It's simply  not possible to do all the programmes in the time remaining and  wouldn't be even if we poured in more resources.    "We are now beyond the point where, even if [the Chinese  side] approved it all, we could finish." Mr Edwards said his  division could possibly complete the extradition agreements if  there was a breakthrough in co-operation with Chinese  authorities at all levels of the negotiating process. "But it  would have to be complete co- operation and I think it's pretty  unlikely," said Mr Edwards, legal adviser in the JLG talks. "If  the extradition treaties are not in force in 1997 there will be  a gap in the law. In the area of extraditions, the SAR (Special  Administrative Region) will not be able to return criminals from  where they came, meaning Hong Kong could become a haven for  undesirables.    "Extraditions are only one of the number of things we have  to  do. It will certainly not be possible now to finish off  programmes that haven't even begun, such as reciprocal  enforcement of judgments and mutual legal assistance, which are  equally important."    The Government decided agreements with 18 to 20 countries in  the region, North America and Europe would be essential for the  territory to maintain international respectability and  credibility. Mr Edwards predicted that necessary extradition  agreements with at least six countries, or about one third of  the total, would be left unresolved in 1997 at the present rate  of progress.    In the area of extraditions the Government has not been able  to even begin talks with 10 of these targeted countries,  representing half the number on the priority list, because the  Chinese side has not given the green light. Only three  bi-lateral agreements for the surrender of fugitive offenders  have been sealed -- with the Netherlands, Canada and Australia  -- since the division began direct negotiations with Chinese  approval in 1990. The agreements, binding under international  law, will survive the territory's handover.    Until 1997, the territory will continue to exchange  fugitives  with about 90 countries under a legal framework tied to the  British system. More than 30 suspected murderers, drug  traffickers and organised criminals were last year extradited  between Hong Kong and the United States, Sweden, Canada, New  Zealand and Macao in what the Legal Department called "a banner  year for international co- operation in fighting crime".    The other important international agreements even further  behind schedule include reciprocal enforcement of judgments in  law; the abolition of visas to streamline visits by Hong Kong  businessmen and tourists to participating countries; mutual  legal assistance, and investment promotion and protection.  Senior government sources have blamed "the excruciatingly slow  pace" of the Chinese side in the JLG for the lack of progress.  Sources said that in some cases, requests to begin talks with  other countries have been on the negotiating table for three  years. "One can only assume [the Chinese] are connecting it  with the Governor's constitutional reform proposals," said a  government official. "But they can't possibly hurt the British  by this. It can only hurt Hong Kong and its people."    The legal representative on the Legislative Council, Simon  Ip  Sik-on, said yesterday Hong Kong would be harmed by a failure to  seal extradition agreements by 1997, but he believed there was  still enough time. "Hong Kong could become a refuge for  fugitives. Do we want to be a receptacle for fugitives? Of  course not. If there is no agreement, the ends of justice will  be defeated for both sides."    In Beijing, PWC member Ms Tam said she hoped the JLG could  speed up its work on localisation of laws. She said the PWC  legal sub- group had spent the weekend going over some of the  Hong Kong laws to bring them in line with the Basic Law. One  difficulty they encountered was how to localise those  British-related laws to the future SAR since some involved  international treaties in which Britain, but not China, was a  signatory. One example was the Supreme Court Ordinance which  had involved the Reine International Treaty in which China was  not a signatory.    Ordinances which were at present extended from the United  Kingdom acts, such as the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, had to be  localised, she said. There were at least 100 similar cases  which were under the discussion of the JLG. Ms Tam said she  hoped that the diplomatic body could speed up its works. "As  long as these problems remain unresolved, it will leave a  crevice. It will become uncertain for us whether to wait for a  conclusion from the JLG or go it alone by ourselves."</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KORYU KABUKI PERFORMS AT ROYCE HALL  </P> <P> In the last decade, Grand Kabuki tours of America became almost commonplace --  with another due this summer. During the same period, smaller groups such as  the Koryu Kabuki Dance Company helped heighten our appreciation of this  classic, interdisciplinary Japanese theater idiom by concentrating on a central  component: formal movement expression.  </P> <P> At Royce Hall, UCLA, over the weekend, Koryu Kabuki's fine dancers and finer  musicians presented dance-drama from the Grand Kabuki repertory as well as  concert-dance in Kabuki style. The Saturday program proved rich in dance-mime:  choreography rooted in realistic gesture.  </P> <P> Indeed, "Ayatsuri Sanbaso" provided a Japanese equivalent of the imitative  doll-dancing familiar from such European ballets as "Coppelia," "Petrushka" and  "The Nutcracker."  </P> <P> Worked by invisible strings, and eventually snarled in them, Seizaburo Saruwaka  superbly suggested the weightless, drifting motion of a marionette, and the way  he shook bells or flipped sleeves also looked exactly like a puppeteer's clever  manipulations.  </P> <P> In "Samidare," Sumi Hanayagi created an artful character portrait from  rainy-day behavior: holding and opening an umbrella, adjusting her clothes and  hair, wearing or removing wooden clogs.  </P> <P> A depiction of rain also turned up in "Shigure Saigyo," but this time  abstracted to merely a delicately shimmering fan held overhead by Kichiyu  Wakayagi. Otherwise this severely formal duet for Wakayagi and Setsuho Azuma  proved spare in imagery, but powerful in the concentration of the dancers --  and dominated by its intense score for a 12-member ensemble (chanters, samisen,  flute and drums).  </P> <P> Befitting its ascetic theme, "Shigure Saigyo" largely banished the world from  its movement vocabulary. In contrast, the trio "Genroku Furyu Odori" embraced  the pleasures of that world with great vivacity, showing us samurai on the town  with a young maiden -- all dressed in incandescent colors.  </P> <P> Marked by a startling switch in character, costume and scenery, the solo  "Oharame" depended even more on Mitsujiro Bando's virtuosic ability to play  both a jolly peasant woman and a forceful footman. The most obvious tour de  force in an evening of consistent excellence. LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

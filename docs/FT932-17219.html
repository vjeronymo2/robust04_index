			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gains trimmed but rally continues A PROMISING attempt to extend the recovery in UK equities, prompted by the success of the government bond auction, was checked yesterday by the suspension of trading in shares of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group. However, late dealings saw the market in good form again, encouraged by stock index futures, where the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index regained the 2,900 mark as the last day of the third quarter drew to its close. The suspension of Queens Moat Houses, 'pending clarification of the company's financial position', was a serious blow to confidence in a market now pinning its faith on the prospects of economic recovery. At least three leading UK securities houses have recommended Queens Moat stock to clients, and market firms and some banks are likely to suffer losses if next week's trading statement from the hotel group brings further bad news. Other hotel and leisure shares gave ground and the rest of the market was severely, albeit temporarily, shaken. The bad news on the hotels front temporarily reversed a strong start in the equity market. Shares opened well, after buying of pharmaceutical stocks towards the Wall Street close overnight reflected reports that the Clinton administration might be wavering over restraining drug prices. Concern over the implications for the pharmaceuticals industry of the Clinton welfare policies have hurt drug shares. With some UK houses talking confidently of a 5 to 15 per cent recovery by the leading drug issues, whose losses have led the London market lower, Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham moved sharply ahead. However, a leading London institutional broking house remained bearish on the sector, and on Glaxo in particular. The strongest factor behind an early Footsie gain of 25.3 in equities was the successful outcome of the auction of Pounds 3bn of Treasury 8 per cent bonds, which passed off significantly better than some had predicted. With UK bond prices nearly one point higher on the auction news, equities set aside fears over the government funding programme, for the time being at least, and advanced strongly. The day's peak on the Footsie of 2,886.3 came early, however, and was quickly lost. In the second half of the session the expected New York demand for drug stocks in London materialised on only a limited scale, and Wall Street was itself a slow performer, shedding 1.90 Dow points in UK hours. London traders will watch Wall Street overnight for signs that buyers have returned for the pharmaceutical leaders. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,878.7, up 17.7 points. Market strategists perceived this as a successful recovery from the 2,850 range and believed that the 2,900 mark might be tested soon were it not for the Queens Moat shock. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index rose 11.5 to 3,107.8 as investors in the second line stocks took heart at the recovery in the blue chip issues. Seaq volume rose to 821.6m shares from Tuesday's 735.8m. Yesterday's total was swollen by the last of the tax-related deals, including a 112m-share trade in Ticketing Group, where a large stake changed hands last week. Non-Footsie business made up around 65 per cent of the day's total.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed and untitled report under the rubric "Official </F> Chronicle"]    [Text] As the parliament's press center has reported, the  Republic of Armenia Supreme Council held an expanded meeting of  the commission on issues of economic development and economic  independence at which the results of an investigation conducted  by its working group in the system of the Ministry of Light  Industry were discussed.    In addition to commission members and experts, the working  group included representatives of the procuracy, tax  inspectorate, and jurists' union. The working group recorded a  number of violations in the area of personnel policy,  fulfillment of the 1993 social-political program, budget  appropriations, and the use of centralized credits made  available last year.    In the process of discussion it was noted in particular that  the tasks and measures envisaged by the 1993 social-economic  program have not been fully accomplished. The amount of credit  emission for this sector's enterprises has not been used  properly, and the terms of repayment and interest rates have  been violated.    Having noted the need to further study the problem, the  commission found it advisable to postpone the conclusions until  a later date.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: BAT Brazilian unit falls in third term Companhia Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of British American Tobacco, announced a fall in third-quarter accumulated profits after tax to RDollars 52.14m (Dollars 61m), from RDollars 139.12m for the same period last year, writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo. Much of the profit was due to a sister company, Aracruz Celulose, which contributed RDollars 32.85m. This was a result of the effect of the overvalued local currency on Aracruz's dollar debt and a recovery in world pulp prices. Souza Cruz's profit from cigarettes and tobacco was RDollars 15.24m, mainly due to exports, compared with RDollars 137.45m last year. The company, which has an 80 per cent share of the local cigarette market, blamed the fall in profits on a 10.9 per cent reduction in the cigarette market, 'significant' levels of contraband cigarettes and a reduction in tax payment periods. During the nine-month period net sales were RDollars 740.8m compared with RDollars 945.7m.</p>

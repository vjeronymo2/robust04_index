			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Grachev remarks are recorded; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held a news  conference in Moscow today at which he spoke of the problems of  organizational development in the Russian Army. According to  him, the Army today cannot be provided with new military  equipment as needed because defense enterprises are in a  catastrophic state, i.e, in a state of forced conversion. The  Ministry of Defense owes them a huge sum of money.    However, Pavel Grachev stated publicly for the first time  that the Army is being financed at such a low level that there  would be a complete breakdown if it is any lower.    [Grachev] That is what the budget which, unfortunately, the  Ministry of Finance is offering us, could lead to; the Ministry  of Finance, which, you see, knows all about how to maintain the  army and on what budget.    As to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel Grachev  believes it should be settled in accordance with the Massandra  Agreement between Ukraine and Russia, according to which the  Ukrainian part of the fleet, after an appropriate inventory,  would be passed over to Russia.    [Grachev] Russia will pay suitably for leasing this part of  the fleet, and the fleet stays unified and indivisible, as at  present. But this is being done with a lot of difficulties.    Pavel Grachev read the journalists a message from Admiral  Baltin which reports continuing acts of the Ukrainian powers  that use special purpose troops and OMON [Special Purpose  Militia Detachment] forces with the aim of forcing the personnel  of the fleet to take the oath of allegiance to Ukraine.</p>

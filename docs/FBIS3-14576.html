			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Yesterday Dr. 'Adeli, chief of the Central Bank,  gave a talk in which he announced the main reasons for the  increase in the foreign exchange rate on the free market.    He said the main reason for the increase in the foreign  exchange on the free market is the demand for foreign exchange.  He said: Recently the market demand for foreign exchange by  certain groups has increased dramatically, and this has caused  an increase in its rate.    Dr. 'Adeli said the main groups are importers and merchants.  He said: This group has put pressure on the foreign exchange  market, and as a result of this demand, the corresponding rate  of foreign currencies has increased.    He said: Factories and industrial units, which are mostly  government-owned, have brought heavy demand to the foreign  exchange market, and this has caused an increase in its rate,  and this increase has also been accelerated by brokers and  speculators.    Dr. 'Adeli said: Another factor, which has been very  effective in the value of foreign exchange, is increases in the  prices of products from some government factories, where this  group mainly uses the bank's floating foreign exchange rate of  1,750 rials [R].    In explaining this matter, he said: These factories have  raised the prices of their goods so much that importers of goods  are using dollars that cost more than R2,000.    He noted that another factor in the increase in the foreign  exchange rate is psychological, which must not be overlooked. He  said: The method of reporting on changes in the foreign exchange  rate by some publications is such that not only does it not  serve to calm the economic atmosphere, it severely heats up the  rumor market.    He added: At this time Iran's enemies, by decreasing the  price of oil, are trying to stop Iran's growing economy. Thus  the nation's various economic agents must join hands and prevent  damage by the enemy.    Dr. 'Adeli said: To prevent plots like this, the various  sectors must not increase demand on the foreign exchange market  and cause the rate to rise.    He emphasized: All agents must work together to protect and  stabilize the nation's money. One cannot expect to guide all the  agents in the commercial, guild and financial sectors in the  proper direction through Central Bank sales of foreign exchange.    Dr. 'Adeli said: Various studies have been done following  the  recent changes on the foreign exchange market. After views were  exchanged on the Economic Council and in the Council of  Ministers, the proposals studied were considered in the  Paragraph 3 Committee. To bring about the necessary cuts in this  year's foreign exchange costs, in view of the reduced pressure  from the nation's foreign exchange commitments as the result of  the current financial negotiations with our trading partners,  and also in view of the reduced foreign exchange expenditures  for next year as the result of investments and the  self-sufficiency achieved in some economic sectors, the  Paragraph 3, Note 29 Committee presented the following decisions  to the president of the republic aimed at reducing the existing  demand for foreign exchange on the free market and on the  foreign exchange market and to answer that demand through the  banking system:    1. The foreign exchange required to register the orders  remaining in the Central Bank will be allocated in the form of  drafts by the Central Bank, and the necessary steps will be  taken concerning this amount by the end of the current year.    2. The Central Bank will allocate the foreign exchange  required to register priority orders that are now in the banks,  and will pay it in the form of drafts by the end of the current  year.    3.- As of the beginning of the year 1373 [21 March 1994] the  Central Bank will take steps to meet the demand for foreign  exchange to register all orders that have been made through  ordinary procedures such as the opening of credit documents by  the commercial banks.    In view of the measures that have been taken, these kinds of  credit documents will be paid when they are due. Thus all those  seeking to import raw materials and parts will be able to get  the foreign exchange they need at the bank's floating rate by  opening credit documents payable on sight or payable at maturity  at one of the commercial banks, after registering their orders  at the Ministry of Commerce.    4. In view of the fact that the import of any kind of  merchandise can be done only by registering the order at the  Ministry of Commerce and through the lawful executive officer,  the relevant organizations are therefore required to intensify  the campaign against smugglers and to deal with violators.    5. When necessary, the Central Bank will intervene in the  foreign exchange market in the manner required.    6. Increases in the prices of the products from government  factories and companies and factories and companies affiliated  with the government without the approval of the Economic Council  has been prohibited. The Ministry of Commerce and the Consumer  and Producer Protection Organization are required to take the  steps necessary to set prices, in accordance with regulations.  At the same time, government organizations and companies and  organizations and companies affiliated with the government are  not authorized under any circumstances to procure the foreign  exchange they need on the free market. They are required to  procure the foreign exchange they need exclusively through the  lawful executive officer.    Dr. 'Adeli then advised the owners of industry, producers,  and importers not to rush to buy the raw materials for the  products they produce and not to obtain the goods they need on  the free market, but rather to do their work at the proper time,  calmly and gradually through normal bank procedures and using  the banking system.    He said: The Central Bank's studies show that the market  foreign exchange rate is not justifiable, and the Central Bank  has decided not to increase the floating foreign exchange rate.  It believes that with the cooperation with the other agents  previously named, this rate can even be decreased.    Dr. 'Adeli said: Next year credit accounts will be opened in  the normal way, and those registering orders should not rush to  obtain their goods.    Decisions have also been made in the area of import  procedures using the foreign exchange from exports, to be  announced later by the Ministry of Commerce.    Dr. 'Adeli was then asked for his opinion about a rumor on  the foreign exchange market that the government is increasing  the foreign exchange rate to make up its budget deficit. He  answered: This rumor is completely unfounded, because the  government has no need to make up its budget deficit in this way.    He explained: Rial credits have been allocated to the same  extent that we have revenues, and the Plan and Budget  Organization has exercised great economy in its rial  expenditures. Revenues are therefore entirely in line with  expenditures, and for some costs 70 percent has been trimmed  from the amount expected.    A second point is that this year foreign exchange costs have  been sharply cut, so that the eight-month statistics for the  nation's imports show savings of 35 to 40 percent on foreign  exchange costs and reductions in the nation's imports, which is  a striking figure.    Dr. 'Adeli said: The government and the bank favor a lower  foreign exchange rate. If the bank decides to intervene in the  market sometimes, this intervention will be to control prices.    Dr. 'Adeli was asked about the effects of the recent drop in  the price of oil on recent events. He said: Decreased oil  revenues affect the amount of foreign exchange the government  sells, but several other things have also happened, which  compensate for this drop in price to a great extent.    These events include the fact that in the year 1372 [21  March  1993-20 March 1994] heavy cuts were made in foreign exchange  expenditures, and this was accomplished by controlling imports  of certain goods, controls on imports and increased tariffs.    He said: The result of these steps was a reduction in the  amount of goods imported into the country compared to the  previous year. At the same time the nation's foreign exchange  needs were reduced by self-sufficiency and investments in some  sectors.    Dr. 'Adeli was asked about the effect of currency in  circulation on the demand for foreign exchange. He said:  Currency in circulation and its growth is an important factor in  the excessive demand for foreign exchange. The people know that  in the first half of the current year [21 March-23 September  1993] the Central Bank made striking efforts to control currency  in circulation.    In this regard 'Adeli asked the government factories and  companies to manage their finances efficiently in order to  minimize their need for currency in circulation, and to refrain  from buying foreign exchange on the free market.    In conclusion he said: To control the foreign exchange rate,  cooperation is necessary from all those involved.</p>

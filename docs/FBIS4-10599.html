			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Bishop Samuel Ruiz, from Cuautitlan, today talked  about the peace negotiations in Chiapas. The bishop said that  these negotiations are not bogged down. The bishop said that  the conditions exist for continuing the pacification process in  southeastern Mexico. In addition, he said that the rebel groups  will not participate in Mexico's electoral process because they  consider it an opportunity to achieve the transition to  democracy.    During the first working day of the Mexican Episcopal  Conference's 56th full assembly, the bishop of San Cristobal de  las Casas in a news conference, together with Archbishop of  Chihuahua Jose Fernandez Artiaga, and Bishop Luis Reynoso  Cervantez of Cuernavaca, and [word indistinct] Altamirano Raul  Vera Lopez, indicated that the Mexican Catholic Church agrees  that peace, justice, and reconciliation in Mexico have priority.  Many of the demands made in Chiapas have a national bearing,  particularly in reference to Indian dignity and perfection of  the democratic process in Mexico.    Samuel Ruiz said that Camacho Solis, as representative of  the  federal government, and the members of the EZLN [Zapatista  National Liberation Army] are very willing to continue the peace  dialogue. In this regard, there are broad hopes, Samuel Ruiz  said, for peace with justice to be achieved in Chiapas. To  conclude, he made reference to the dialogues that have been set  up between cattle men and businessmen of Chiapas to do away with  divisions; particularly dangerous bellicose attitudes that  prevent social peace in that southeastern Mexican state. Here  is Juan Carlos Antoyo reporting from San Cristobal de las Cases:    [Antoyo] Good afternoon, I would like to clarify that we are  in Tuxctla Gutierrez. In our opinion, the bishop from San  Cristobal does not seem to have knowledge of the last statements  made with reference to this peace process by the EZLN, more  specifically by Subcommander Marcos. Those reporters who have  had access to the jungle, to the marking of the 75 anniversary  of Emiliano Zapata's death, are under the impression, and Marcos  assured, that currently, the necessary conditions do not exist  for the dialogue to be resumed in Chiapas. They also said that  while the EZLN remains on full alert it is not willing to carry  out the internal consultation; therefore this is one more  obstacle. One must recall that the EZLN had decided that to  arrive at a decision on a second encounter, the internal  consultation must take place first. This consultation has been  suspended, this suspension has been in effect for approximately  20 days.    Meanwhile I will tell you that the [word indistinct] Chiapas  Governor Javier Lopez Moreno asked the National Commission on  Human Rights [CNDH] to issue a recommendation on the  investigations on the 21 persons under arrest. Twenty of these  individuals who are at the [word indistinct] penitentiary have  been on a hunger strike for 12 days. After visiting this  penitentiary where these 20 persons, accused of belonging to and  supporting the EZLN are incarcerated, the governor said that the  recommendations made by the CNDH are very important for one who  attempts to govern with social justice and to reestablish an  agreement among the Chiapas residents.    In a letter addressed to CNDH President Jorge Madrazo  Cuellar, Governor Lopez Moreno indicated there are no doubts  that the judicial system and the Attorney General's Office in  general have acted in good faith and in keeping with the law.  In order to clear up or eliminate any doubt, the CNDH  resolution is therefore important.    At the same time Marcos Arturo Lazar Villa, president of the  Supreme Court of Justice of Chiapas, talked about the legal  procedure that could be applied in the case of those 21 persons,  among whom 20 are on a hunger strike.    [Begin recording] [Antoyo] What is the legal situation they  are facing? What can be done so they can obtain their freedom  at some time?    [Lazar] The defense attorney always tries to look for the  alternatives for liberty. Currently, the alternatives  prevailing are those that I have mentioned: the dropping of the  charges, this corresponds to the Attorney General's Office. The  amparo filed is another alternative; this is also being taken  into consideration. There is also the possibility of [words  indistinct] data. There are many possibilities available but  everything depends on what the federal authorities will resolve.  [end recording]    To conclude, we want to report something that drew a great  deal of attention. Today, during an interview with Milton  Morales Arroyo, president of the local Congress, he said that  the municipal presidents are partially responsible for the  situation in Chiapas as they have forgotten a basic principle in  politics, that is to respond to the people's demands. They have  devoted their time to constructing public works, and in many of  these mishandling of public funds has been detected.</p>

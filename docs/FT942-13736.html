			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Bank lending surges ahead of expectations Strong private-sector lending figures published yesterday provide evidence that companies are beginning to take on more debt. Bank of England data showed that lending by banks and building societies to the private sector - M4 lending - was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.3bn last month. This was well ahead of expectations of Pounds 1.5bn and compares with a revised figure of Pounds 1.2bn in February. This took the year-on-year growth rate of M4 lending, which is a good indicator of consumer and company confidence, to 3.5 per cent from 3.0 per cent in the year to February. The broad money supply measure, M4, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent last month compared with the previous month, slightly below the growth rate in February but in line with expectations. It was up 5.9 per cent in the year to March, unchanged from February's rate. Separate figures yesterday from the British Bankers' Association showed a large increase in lending by the UK's main banks in March. Lending by the nine banking groups - which covers only a proportion of the overall M4 bank and building society sector - rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.05bn, the largest rise for four years, and compares with a rise of Pounds 935m in February. After substantial repayment of corporate debt in recent months, there were signs of renewed borrowing by manufacturers. Banks lent Pounds 386m to manufacturing industry in March after repayments of Pounds 890m in the previous two months. The construction sector, however, continued to repay debt and the demand for consumer credit remained very weak. The BBA's figures also showed that Pounds 1.86bn of the increase was due to lending to the financial sector, in particular to building societies and securities dealers. 'Although lending in March was strong, it followed two months of very modest rises,' said Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA. 'Consequently, when we look at the figures over the quarter as a whole, there is little difference from the fourth quarter of last year.' Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'A strong lending number this month obviously adds weight to the evidence arguing against interest rate cuts. 'But the extent to which this month's lending figure was due to finance companies suggests that M4 lending will not remain at this relatively high level.' The BBA said that banks' mortgage lending seemed to be slowing down, but that this possibly reflected some loss of market share rather than declining activity in the housing market. Analysts said that the weak personal borrowing figures, along with other recent evidence of falling consumer confidence, contradicted buoyant official retail sales data.</p>

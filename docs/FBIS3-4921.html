The Council of the Union of Communist Parties-the Communist  Party of the Soviet Union adopted a statement at its plenary  meeting held on February 12 and 13.    The statement expressed support and solidarity for the  principled stand made clear by a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign  Ministry in a statement and the sincere efforts of the DPRK  Government for the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula. The statement vehemently condemned the U.S.  Administration and reactionaries for creating tensions in the  Korean peninsula and the world.    Chairman of the National Liberation War Veterans Committee  of  Zimbabwe Charles Hongwe said in a statement on February 12 that  the United States must take a sincere stance for a solution to  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through negotiation  and immediately stop scheming to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    The Political Department of the Palestine Liberation  Organisation in a statement on February 14 said that the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula is not a matter to be solved by  force. "If the United States is really willing to resolve the  nuclear issue, it should show a right position toward dialogue  first of all," it said.    Chairman of the Butwal Peace Action Committee Soorya Laleit  in a statement demand that the United States immediately drop  its provocative scheme to deploy Patriot missiles and withdraw  its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea without delay.    Members of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and the  "Labouring Russia" Movement and Moscow citizens held a  demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on February  6. The protesters staged a sit-down against the U.S.  interference and aggressive moves in Korea in front of the U.S.  Embassy, holding slogan boards reading "United States, take  hands off socialist Korea", "Glory to the heroic Korean people"  and so on.    They handed over to the U.S. Embassy a "letter of protest  against the U.S. moves of aggression against the DPRK" in the  name of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and the "Labouring  Russia" Movement.</p>

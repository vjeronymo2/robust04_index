			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WEST HOLLYWOOD TO STUDY FORMATION OF POLICE DEPT.  </P> <P> In a surprise move, the West Hollywood City Council has authorized a study to  determine how much it would cost to establish its own police department.  </P> <P> City Manager Paul Brotzman cautioned that the study by the city's  administrative staff does not mean that West Hollywood is interested in forming  its own police force.  </P> <P> Instead, he and other officials said they expect the study to show that West  Hollywood's arrangement with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for  law enforcement protection is a bargain.  </P> <P> "It's basically a documentation exercise," Brotzman said. "It shouldn't be  interpreted by the Sheriff's Department or anyone else as a first step in  establishing a municipal police force."  </P> <P> Some gay activists, who have been critical of the Sheriff's Department and have  demanded that the city explore the possibility of establishing its own force,  were skeptical.  </P> <P> "Instead of a feasibility study, it sounds more like a mechanism to justify a  decision that's already been made," said Jean Conger, executive director of  Southern California Women for Understanding, a lesbian rights group.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department provides service to West Hollywood, where an estimated  35% of the 37,000 residents are gay, under an $8.5-million annual contract that  expires next year. About 120 deputies are assigned to the city.  </P> <P> Although West Hollywood officials have praised the department for its  crime-fighting abilities, gays have frequently complained of being harassed by  deputies. Gay rights activists have also complained that there are no  acknowledged gays among the department's 7,000 deputies.  </P> <P> About 50 gay activists have endorsed a petition circulated by City Councilman  Steve Schulte demanding that the department recruit openly gay men and women.  </P> <P> The petition dismisses as inadequate a February agreement between West  Hollywood and the Sheriff's Department aimed at recruiting gays as deputies.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COAST PANEL GIVES OK FOR 'MINI-CITY'  </P> <P> The state Coastal Commission on Wednesday approved changes in the local coastal  plan that will allow developers to erect a "mini-city" on the site of the old  Pike amusement park in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The mixed-use development of offices, shops, hotels and residences will  eventually employ 8,000 workers and provide homes for 2,000 people. Scheduled  for ground-breaking next year, the $1-billion project will be built in phases  over a 13-year period by the development team of The Ratkovich Co. and  Enterprise Development West Inc., a subsidiary of a James Rouse Co.  </P> <P> While the commissioners unanimously approved coastal plan amendments to permit  a much larger development than previously envisioned for the 13-acre waterfront  site, they expressed concerns about traffic congestion and air pollution  associated with the massive project.  </P> <P> Commissioner Charles Warren also expressed doubt that people who worked in the  complex's offices and shops would also live there -- a scenario that the  developers have been painting as a way of cutting down on commuter traffic.  </P> <P> "We are doing this, assured of results each of us knows will not be attained.  I'm troubled by this, but I'm not sure what we can do about it," Warren said.  </P></p>

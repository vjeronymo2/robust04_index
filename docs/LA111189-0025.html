			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. POLICE NAB BETTING BOWLERS  </P> <P> We have double locks on our doors and an alarm system. There is a mercury vapor  light that illuminates the front of our house at night. We have a 12-gauge  shotgun at the ready. My wife and daughter rarely venture out of the house at  night by themselves.  </P> <P> After reading about the "bust" of the Granada Hills women bowlers, I know I am  paranoid. If our law enforcement people have the crime situation so under  control that assets can be used to break up the threats to society that side  bets in bowling can create, I know that I must reassess my feelings about crime  in Los Angeles. Certainly there should be no reason for my family not to sleep  soundly at night!  </P> <P> CHARLES T. OSTERMEYER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally leaves shares just ahead THE STOCK market success-fully resisted another bout of downside pressure yesterday, as it clawed its way back from an unhappy opening, with the upturn fuelled by a general advance by international stock markets. The early weakness in London stemmed from a steep decline on Wall Street overnight, following on the US market's poor performance last Friday, some disappointing results from high street retailer Dixons, and yet more worries about cash calls on the market. Wall Street's 34-point Dow drop overnight was said to have been caused by worries that the US Federal Reserve may move to tighten monetary policy in response to growing worries about rising inflation in the US. Adding to the market's discomfort was the latest upsurge in the bullion price, which launched another attempt at piercing the Dollars 400 an ounce level before backing off. Ris-ing gold prices are tradition-ally linked with inflationary pressures. The US market's sharp decline on Tuesday set the tone for London, with the FT-SE 100 Index opening 6.5 lower at 2,841.6 and moving down to the day's lowest point of 2,829.2 in mid-morning. Dealers insisted, however, that there had been no heavy downward pressure on the cash market and that the real pressure was being felt in the FT-SE future, which traded at a discount during the morning. A rally in the future set in just before Wall Street opened, dragging the underlying market with it. The Dow Industrial Average opened on a firm note and gradually moved up to stand around 19 Dow points higher as London closed. Another bullish factor for London was the sharp turnround by the leading European bourses, notably in Germany where equities and bonds made rapid progress in the afternoon, responding to persistent hints that a further German interest rate cut is possible before the autumn. The encouraging news on international trade emerging from the G7 meeting in Tokyo was seen as a helpful factor in the rebound by world markets. The FT-SE 100 nudged into positive territory only minutes before the close of trading, ending a net 0.2 higher at 2,848.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fared less well, finishing a generally depressing session 12.2 lower at 3,219.9. Turnover in equities was a respectable 586.2m shares, ahead of Tuesday's 554.3m and well up from Monday's meagre 384m shares. Yesterday's total included 318.7m non-FT-SE 100 shares. The big pharmaceutical stocks continued to attract strong support, on the view that the sector has been heavily oversold in recent months. SmithKline Beecham featured after being granted permission to sell its anti-ulcer Tagamet drug over the counter. Wellcome was well supported, as was Glaxo, although the latter lagged behind the other two drugs leaders after reports of renewed selling from the US. Utilities raced higher with the exception of the English generators, which were affected by switching into the regional electricity stocks. BT edged higher; the final stage of the BT3 share offer gets under way this morning with the opening of the Global Book for the international offer.</p>

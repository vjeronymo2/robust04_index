			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDINISTA BACKERS HERE STILL ARE LOYAL;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: SUPPORTERS OF THE OUSTED PARTY IN THE SOUTHLAND REFUSE TO CALL IT  QUITS. SOME ARE SHIFTING THEIR ATTENTION TO OTHER NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY, WHILE  OTHERS INTEND TO ACT AS 'WATCHDOGS.'  </P> <P> As Nicaragua's Sandinista government officially came to an end Wednesday, its  Southern California-based sympathizers were refusing to call it quits.  </P> <P> For those who remain loyal to la revolucion, the initial shock at the  Sandinistas' loss in elections two months ago has now been replaced by a sad  resignation and a new resolve to find ways to carry on their work in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> A Topanga-based group that has built homes and schools in Nicaragua for the  last six years will shift its attention to towns that voted for the  Sandinistas. A Los Angeles organization that ushers "fact-finding" delegations  to Managua will take on a mission, serving as "watchdogs" of the pro-American  government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  </P> <P> Some activists said they remain afraid of what the U.S.-backed Contra rebels,  most of whom have not yet disarmed, will do. Still other groups report interest  in Nicaragua is waning.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has a relatively small Nicaraguan community, made up of those who  supported the Sandinista government and those who fled it. Despite the small  size of the community, Los Angeles -- fueled in part by the money and influence  of the Hollywood crowd -- has served as a major center for political activism  dedicated to fighting U.S. government policy in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Thousands of Sandinista supporters from the United States and Europe have made  regular pilgrimages to Nicaragua over the years. Whether they have a future in  the new Nicaragua remains a question.  </P> <P> Many of the hundreds of pro-Sandinista activists who live in Southern  California "had tied up their entire identity" with the Sandinista cause, said  Lydia Brazon, an activist who works for a Hollywood advertising agency. They  took the loss personally, she said.  </P> <P> "The solidarity (movement) will have to readjust to the reality that exists  down there now," Brazon added. "Everything will be more difficult, no doubt,  but to what degree, we don't know yet."  </P> <P> Many Sandinista supporters, taking their cues from the Sandinista Front itself,  have found ways to explain the dramatic and decisive loss of former President  Daniel Ortega to Chamorro. They blame nearly 10 years of economic and military  pressure from the U.S. government for turning voters against the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> "The people voted with a gun to their head," said Blase Bonpane, who heads the  Office of Americas, a Los Angeles-based organization that opposes U.S. policies  in Central America. "They thought, 'How do you end the war?' You vote for  Bush's candidate."  </P> <P> Bonpane's organization shepherds delegations to Nicaragua regularly and will  continue to do so, he said. Now, however, their task will be to "balance" the  right-wing forces among Chamorro's supporters and safeguard Sandinista programs  in health, education and land reform if the new government tries to dismantle  them.  </P> <P> Stephen Kerpen, director of Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua,  said his Topanga-based organization, which started building houses and other  projects in Nicaragua in 1984, will not work with the new government. Instead,  the group is turning to new foundations set up by Sandinistas and planning  projects for towns, such as the city of Leon, that the Sandinista Front carried  in the election.  </P> <P> Kerpen said he does not believe that the new government has the interests of  Nicaragua's poor at heart. He spoke by telephone from Managua as he and  associates watched Chamorro's inauguration on television Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It's hard," Kerpen said. "You sort of hide behind the intellectual event and  keep working."  </P> <P> Witness for Peace, a national organization that monitored the Contras, plans to  continue working in Nicaragua to document whether the rebels demobilize and how  future installments of U.S. aid are handled. But, said Donald Kagan, director  of the Los Angeles regional office, it is getting tougher to get people  interested in going to Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Kagan said several delegations from other parts of the country have been  canceled; the next group from Los Angeles is scheduled to go down in August.  Without a revolution to watch, people are less interested, he said.  </P> <P> "I think you'll see a shift in interest to Guatemala and El Salvador in the  solidarity movement as a whole," he said.  </P></p>

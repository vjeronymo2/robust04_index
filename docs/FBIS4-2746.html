			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (XINHUA) -- South Korean National  Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop today expressed appreciation for  China's achievements made since the implementation of the  open-door policy.    Yi made the statement when meeting with Wu Xueqian,  vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (PPCC).    Yi said China's success is attributable not only to the  resolute determination of the Chinese Government to carry out  the open-door policy but also to the support of the Chinese  people. Yi visited China in January.    Both sides said they are satisfied with the development of  bilateral relations since the diplomatic relations were  established in August 1992.    They hold that fuller cooperation between the two sides will  be conducive to mutual prosperity.    South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) Leader  Kim Chong-pil will host a dinner in honor of Wu later today.    Wu arrived here Sunday for an eight-day goodwill visit at  the  invitation of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu.</p>

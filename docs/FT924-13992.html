			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bratislava to set up options and futures exchange SWEDEN'S OM group has agreed with a consortium of Slovak companies to set up a futures and options exchange in Bratislava, the first of its type in eastern Europe. The move is being made to help domestic funds and private investors manage the risks associated with equity investments as Slovakia embarks on an extensive privatisation process. As eastern European countries rush to buy 'off-the-peg' stock markets, Slovakia is the first to buy a ready-built derivatives market. Yesterday's announcement prompted questions from derivatives experts about whether such a market could succeed. Slovakia does not yet have a formal stock exchange, let alone the liquid stock exchange normally considered a pre-requisite for a successful derivatives market. 'Having your own derivatives exchange - or even your own stock market - is getting to be like having your own airline. Everyone wants one, but they can't all survive,' one expert said. Mr Bjorn Unger, president of OM Systems International AB, said the options market was being established first because current Slovak legislation prohibited the sale of shares for the first year they are held. 'This has created a need, mainly among institutional investors, to manage the risks inherent in their investments,' he stated. The exchange will be called the Bratislava Options Exchange, and OM hopes it will be operating by the middle of next year. The Swedish group will deliver the system and know-how for the exchange. At the same time, it will take 30 per cent of the exchange's initial Kcs60m (Dollars 2.2m) capital, with the balance being held by leading companies from Slovak industry. Trading will be conducted by telephone and clearing will be handled centrally on the exchange. Mr Unger expects that the participants will be confined to domestic mutual funds and private investors at first, although he believes foreign groups may eventually take part. Initially, dealing will take place in up to 10 privatised companies. The privatisation process is already underway in Slovakia, with coupons being purchased by private investors and institutions. But the first wave of Slovak companies is not expected to be in the private sector before the end of this year. Mr Unger dismissed suggestions that investors in Slovakia would be too unsophisticated to make use of the exchange, saying 'education is a problem we meet almost everywhere'. Slovakia is currently break ing away from the Czech lands, but this had had no impact on the exchange project, Mr Unger said. OM, which conducts exchange and clearing operations in Sweden and the UK, has previously delivered systems and know-how to futures and options markets in Finland, France, Norway, Spain and Austria.</p>

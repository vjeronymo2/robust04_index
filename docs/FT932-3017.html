			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Warburg seeks cash dealing in BT shares THE London Stock Exchange, at the request of merchant bank SG Warburg, is asking marketmakers in British Telecommunications shares to take the unprecedented step of accepting dealings in the shares on a cash settlement basis. The move would allow Warburg, the global co-ordinator in the sale of the third tranche of the government's stake in BT, to learn who had bought or sold BT shares before share allocations were announced. Dealings for cash settlement are known within 48 hours while under the account settlement system, it takes two weeks. Thus, sellers of shares will be identified. Those judged by BT's advisers to have sold in an effort to depress the price will be allocated fewer shares in the BT3 issue. In a letter dated June 11 to marketmakers in BT shares, the stock exchange said it is asking for their co-operation 'to ensure that the existing Fully Paid register is as up to date as possible'. 'Warburgs have requested that the Exchange recommend dealings in the two trading accounts prior to the close of the offer (in mid July) take place on a Cash Settlement basis. The Exchange are prepared to support this in principle.' The stock exchange has told marketmakers that those who do not respond by today will be assumed to agree. Last night, the exchange said it did not know the results of its poll of marketmakers. However, a Warburg official said: 'The feedback we've had has not been negative.' News of the Warburg move has led to strong protests from some institutional shareholders and marketmakers. They argued that such disclosure will discourage sellers, thereby tending to support the BT share price during the bidding process for the BT3 shares. They say the move stops them selling shares, normal practice in the run-up to a new issue. The absence of this selling will tend to support the BT share price before the bidding process for BT3 shares. But Warburg insists its request is not intended to uncover sellers, only buyers, so that it may reward them with higher allocations of new shares. Lex, Page 20</p>

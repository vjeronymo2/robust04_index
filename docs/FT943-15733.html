			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (1): What Berlusconi needs to do now - In Naples tomorrow the Group of Seven summit will be hosted by a prime minister whose policy moves do not yet match his PR skills Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician, is patently full of good intentions. He wants to reform Italy's cumbrous bureaucracy, place the state at the service of its citizens, and liberalise what is still one of Europe's most regulated economies. He also wants to please. Among Italy's 53 postwar prime ministers, he is the first to use opinion polls systematically, and he takes great trouble to discover what concerns the public. His decision to approach politics as if it were a marketing exercise played a large part in his remarkable electoral performance. Entering the arena only this January, he became prime minister four months later at the head of his Forza Italia movement. Yet two months after taking office with his right-wing coalition, Mr Berlusconi's performance has been slow, indecisive and disappointing. Faced with an opposition which is split between the left and centre and still coming to terms with the Berlusconi phenomenon, the prime minister has been weak on policy and strong on public relations. His popularity is uncontested, with approval ratings of more than 70 per cent, and he received another clear endorsement from the electorate in last month's elections for the European parliament. People like his uncomplicated language, his engaging smile, his business success and the hint of showbiz in his style. The public at large seems to regard it as irrelevant that his brother Paolo has been arrested on corruption charges; that his Fininvest empire is being scrutinised by Milan magistrates; that Mr Berlusconi was a prime beneficiary of the much-discredited system of parties that his new government is seeking to bury. Outside Italy, Mr Berlusconi has yet to dispel considerable reservations both about the conflict of interest with his Fininvest business empire and the nature of his government. No other European democracy has allowed a man who owned the second largest private business group with a virtual monopoly of commercial television to enter politics without first distancing himself from these business interests. The provisions he has made in this respect are far from impartial. He still retains ownership of Fininvest and has merely appointed three lawyers, at least one of whom has previous links to Fininvest, to draw up proposals by September on how to avoid a conflict of interest. Such conflicts are bound to arise when he is obliged to deal with a range of issues from the introduction of pension funds to telecommunications privatisation and the reorganisation of broadcasting. Mr Berlusconi also underestimated the negative impact of including in his government five ministers from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. He did not want them as allies; but having failed to find supporters in the centre among the former Christian Democrats, Mr Berlusconi had to turn to the MSI, which is well-entrenched in the south. The new premier genuinely believes that through its inclusion in government, the MSI will be sucked towards the mainstream of politics. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and the other main partner in government, shares that view; and already Mr Gianfranco Fini, the MSI leader, has distanced himself from the more ugly elements in his party, which has changed its name to the National Alliance. Nevertheless, Mr Fini has done the government a serious disservice through a series of public declarations that show his admiration for Mussolini and much of what he stood for. This runs counter to the spirit of the postwar republic, which has tried to bury the Mussolini experience. For the time being, the MSI in government will limit Mr Berlusconi's ability to expand the base of his parliamentary support to groups in the centre. It is worth stressing that the government coalition is unusually heterogeneous. Forza Italia is still no more than a Berlusconi supporters' club run by former Fininvest employees claiming to be free marketeers; the League is federalist and rooted only in the industrialised north; the MSI calls itself 'post-fascist', supporting a strong unitary state and continued state control of strategic economic activity. In their different ways, each appeals to the large Italian middle class, which felt alienated from the discredited traditional parties and wanted a change. But there was no prior policy co-ordination between them. Indeed, Forza Italia, the League and the MSI never formed a proper electoral alliance. Mr Berlusconi made separate deals to support candidates with each of the two leaders. Now that they have agreed to work together in government, both the League and the MSI risk losing their identities under the aura of Mr Berlusconi and the dominance of Forza Italia. Thus the League, in a vociferous manner, and the MSI more subtly, continually assert themselves, making the coalition inherently unstable. Mr Bossi's party, which commands the largest number of deputies in the coalition, can play on the government's weakness in the senate where it lacks a clear majority. It would not be difficult to sabotage legislation there. Mr Berlusconi knows this and on several occasions has used the threat of fresh elections to keep the League in line. Mr Bossi will be loyal while he sees the government advancing down the road to federalism and so long as fresh elections appear against the League's best interests. Sorting out a balance within the government and trying to establish new rules with an almost wholly new set of players has meant that the government has only just begun to function as a policy-making body. The slow start has been compounded by poor co-ordination among ministers and a general lack of experience. Of the 23 ministers, all but two are novices, many both to government and parliament. Co-ordination will be vital if the government is to manage its ambitious agenda of modernising the state. Mr Berlusconi says he will embrace extensive privatisation, move towards a more federal structure of the state, reform the public administration, deregulate extensively, rework social benefits and overhaul the inefficient tax system. So far, the most serious error has been the failure to communicate the right signals on economic policy to the financial markets. Mr Berlusconi has appeared over-anxious to ride on the benefits of having inherited an economy pulling out of recession and set to grow 1.5 per cent this year. His instincts have been to stimulate the recovery and make good his campaign promise of creating 1m jobs to reduce the 11.5 per cent jobless figure. The first measures have been in this direction  - tax breaks on investment and new jobs, unfreezing public works contracts blocked by the corruption scandals, ending a temporary ban on local government recruitment. Laudable in themselves, these measures have raised fears about inflation and deflected attention from the public accounts which were rightly top of the agenda of the previous Ciampi and Amato governments. With the public sector deficit at more than 10 per cent of GDP and the stock of debt now equivalent to a staggering 120 per cent of GDP, Italy is well out of line with the rest of Europe. It was not surprising, therefore, that the post-electoral euphoria over a business-friendly government should be wiped from the Milan bourse and the lira weaken at the first sign of bad news. This was last month's constitutional court decision obliging the government to pay L32,000bn in pension arrears. The need to find this money, though probably not until next year, was a brutal reminder of just how little room for manoeuvre any Italian government has while the budget deficit is so large and the mountain of debt keeps rising. It was all the more important for the new government to give the right signals since the 1994 budget deficit is likely to be closer to L160,000bn than the projected L144,000bn due to overruns on social security spending and lower tax receipts. The government can recover the confidence of the markets - providing a convincing outline of the 1995 budget is produced quickly. But the 1995 budget plans, due out this month, will be the litmus test of Mr Berlusconi's credibility in more ways than one. The budget will demonstrate whether he is willing to act tough, cutting health and especially pension benefits. His style has been to avoid confrontation, to seek to please. But if Mr Berlusconi wishes to reform Italy and usher in the Second Republic, it would be a pity if the opportunity is squandered in facile populism.</p>

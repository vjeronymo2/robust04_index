			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Hang Seng hit by reform go-ahead Hong Kong stock prices tumbled yesterday after Governor Chris Patten told legislators he would press forward with electoral reform against China's opposition, Reuter reports. The Hang Seng index fell 331.21 points, or 3.08 per cent in thin trading, to 10,432.02. But more than half the loss came before Mr Patten made his announcement that he would publish the final and most controversial portion of his reform package today. Investors have been hanging on to every twist and turn in Sino-British relations leading up to the colony's return to China in July 1997. The Hang Seng index is now more than double its level of late 1992.</p>

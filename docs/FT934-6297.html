			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Michael Jackson in EMI deal Mr Michael Jackson, the American pop singer facing legal and personal difficulties, has agreed an estimated Dollars 250m deal under which EMI would administer his music-publishing empire. Mr Jackson's music-publishing operation, ATV, owns the rights to more than 4,000 songs. Under the terms of agreement announced yesterday, EMI Music Publishing would pay Dollars 100m in cash to Mr Jackson for the right to manage the song catalogue for five years. Over that period, the singer is expected to accrue an additional Dollars 150m in royalties, which are generated when recordings of the songs are sold or played on radio and television. Mr Jackson would receive 92.5 per cent of all proceeds, with the remainder allotted to EMI, part of Thorn-EMI, the London-based entertainment group. EMI is expected to raise Dollars 200m to fund copyright acquisitions for ATV, according to Mr John Branca, an lawyer who represents Mr Jackson. Mr Jackson faces allegations that he sexually molested a 13-year-old boy. Last week, he cancelled the remainder of a world tour and admitted he was addicted to pain killers. The EMI deal represents a reprise for the company, which administered the catalogue when the singer acquired it in 1985. For the past five years, the business was managed by MCA. A separate company, Mijac Music, owns the rights to Mr Jackson's own compositions and is not included in the EMI deal.</p>

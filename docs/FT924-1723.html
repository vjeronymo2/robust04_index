			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Scottish tourism suffers 1% fall THE Scottish tourist industry suffered a 1 per cent fall in turnover in real terms in the 1992 season, the Scottish Tourist Board said yesterday. The industry's turnover was Pounds 1.7bn. Spending by visitors from England was down 9 per cent at Pounds 740m, while spending by visitors from overseas was up 6 per cent at Pounds 540m. Scots spent Pounds 370m on tourism in their own country, an increase of 2 per cent in real terms. Mr Ian Grant, the board's chairman, said Scotland had suffered from the effect of the recession on English people, who may have been taking fewer holidays. He believed Scotland would receive more visitors from the US next year after the recovery in the value of the dollar against sterling.</p>

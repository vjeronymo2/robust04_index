			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN AT DRUG RAID  </P> <P> I'm really steamed!  </P> <P> What a photo opportunity; Nancy Reagan in South-Central Los Angeles at one of  Police Chief Daryl Gates' famous drug raids (Metro, April 7-8).  </P> <P> In an interview she uttered the standard platitudes about "empty lives," and a  real corker, "Maybe they could have been helped years ago." Yeah, maybe at  about the time that her husband was sacking and burning federal aid to  education. Or maybe when he cut the job training programs. Better yet, I'll  wager they could really have been helped when he was cutting funds to fight  drugs.  </P> <P> Nancy, stay in Beverly Hills, or go down to Reagan country in Orange County.  The big drug money is spent by the rich and famous who don't have to worry  about police raids.  </P> <P> Tell them to just say no.  </P> <P> HELEN G. TALLEY  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

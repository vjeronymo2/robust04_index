			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The planned construction of the Gunung Muria  Nuclear Power Plant in Central Java will continue despite strong  public reaction, particularly those from environmentalists.  Jali Ahimsa, director general of the National Atomic Energy  Agency [BATAN], said this to reporters after opening a meeting  of a working group of Asia-Pacific atomic experts in Kuta, Bali.  According to the BATAN director general, a lack of funds is the  main obstacle in the construction of the Gunung Muria Nuclear  Power Plant. However, he attached great importance to the use  of nuclear power because Indonesia will need huge electricity  supplies, particularly in Java and Bali, in the future.</p>

The LDLP faction has an absolute majority in the Lithuanian  parliament - 72 seats out of 140. On Monday [7 March], the  faction began a series of closed meetings to analyze its own  activities, as well as the work of the government and the  opposition. The faction also intends to hold elections of its  chairman.    Although the meetings are closed, the leftist TIESA  newspaper  reported several details from a speech made by Justinas Karosas,  the faction's current chairman.    Karosas reportedly said that although the LDLP is a social  democratic party in a post communist country, it must also  fulfil non-social democratic tasks because such is the reality.    The return to power is both an aim and a means for the  opposition, he said. In Karosas' opinion, the opposition is  weak and must be stimulated to make its activities more  constructive.    Discussing the faction's relations with the government,  Karosas said they are difficult because the government does not  always want to be controlled by the faction.</p>

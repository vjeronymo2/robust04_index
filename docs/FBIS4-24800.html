			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- Passengers who use  China's civil air service please take note: According to a  circular issued recently by the Civil Aviation Administration of  China [CAAC], no unit or individual is allowed to coerce  passengers to buy flight insurance of any kind.    For some time, some civic aviation departments or ticket  offices have insisted that passengers buy various insurances in  violation of the principle of voluntary participation. The  passengers complained bitterly about this. The CAAC circular  pointed out that it is strictly forbidden to refuse to sell  tickets or handle passenger check-in or cargo shipping  procedures for passengers or shippers who have not bought  personal, luggage, or cargo insurance. Ticketing departments  (including agents) must, on principle, have separate windows for  handling regular ticket sales and for insurance sales. If they  are sold at the same window, the words "passenger insurance  voluntary" and the insurance premium should be written on the  window in plain sight. Violation of the aforementioned  stipulations is punishable by a fine of 20,000 yuan in pursuance  with relevant regulations and the violator will be criticized in  the form of a circular.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bi Quanzhong (3968 0356 </F> 1813) and XINHUA reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yin  Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376): "Shoulder the Heavy Task of  Educational Reform and Development"]    [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The party Central  Committee and the State Council are holding the second national  education conference to mobilize the whole party and all of  society to implement seriously "the outline of the reform for  and development of education in China." The conference is  another milestone in the development of the education of the  Chinese nation.    At the first national education conference in 1985, Deng  Xiaoping delivered an important speech which established a  strategic position for China's educational work. A great  historic leap was made from 1985 to 1994.    "The hope of revitalizing the nation lies in education, and  the hope of revitalizing education depends on teachers." After  hearing General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important speech and  Premier Li Peng's keynote report, the delegates have been  greatly inspired. The main topic for discussion during the  conference is how to face the development opportunity and  challenge in the 21st century, to deepen further the educational  reform, to accelerate the development of education, to improve  the overall quality of the Chinese nation, and to train  qualified personnel who span this century and the next. A  salient feature of the conference is that the principal  responsible comrades of all provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions are present discussing education and pledging  to take the initiative in improving educational work.  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Attach Strategic Importance to Education </H5>   The delegates hold that the party Central Committee, the  State Council, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have always attached  importance to education in the overall development strategy of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang  Zemin has pointed out in his speech to the conference the need  to always treat education as a fundamental issue linked with the  socialist modernization drive and with the historic fate of  socialism. We should treat education as something of strategic  importance and pay attention to the development of education.    Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju linked education with the strategic  task of concentrating on the development and opening of the  Pudong area and making Shanghai an international economic,  financial, and trade center as soon as possible. He pointed  out: "Marching toward the 21st century, Shanghai should have  first-rate education commensurate with its status as a  first-rate city." In education, Shanghai should play the role  of a training base and train a large number of qualified  personnel for the whole country. At the same time, it should  open up more channels of international cooperation and turn  itself into one of the bridges spanning China and other parts of  the world in education. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said: In the  Beijing region, there are 67 universities and colleges, of which  24 are national key institutes of higher learning. We can and  should develop education in the capital and make it the best  education of the highest standard in China.    The conference is a mobilization meeting for the  implementation of the "outline." The delegates say that the  speeches of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng  have inspired them, while also giving them a sense of urgency  and pressure. Yan Haiwang, secretary of the Gansu provincial  party committee, said: In order to attain the objectives set  out in the "outline," it is crucial to have a strategic vision  and to put the development of education above everything else.  From now on, all provinces should make efforts to truly enhance  understanding and step up publicity so that the whole party, all  of society, and particularly the number one party and government  leaders will firmly establish the notion of giving the highest  priority to the development of education and perform actual  deeds, and the leaders at all levels will fulfill their duties.  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Deepen Reform and Promote the Development </H5> of Education    The delegates consider the keynote report made by Premier Li  Peng on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State  Council to be in conformity with reality and to be practical and  feasible, because it contains both the general concept and  specific measures for implementing the "outline." It is  necessary to seize the opportunity, deepen reform in an  all-around way, and promote the development of education in our  country.    In China, the degree of economic and social development  varies from place to place, and the educational development  situation similarly varies. In the light of their region's  educational priorities and problems, leaders from various  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions made efforts  to explore new ways to expedite educational development. Hebei  Governor Ye Liansong said in his speech that, to accelerate  reform and development of vocational education in rural areas,  the construction of county-level vocational education centers  must be intensified. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region CPC Committee, stressed that the most  important way to help impoverished areas was to help them  develop their education. Yunnan Provincial Party Committee  Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out that, to popularize nine-year  compulsory education as the "outline" required, the need to  expedite educational reform and development must be fully  understood, and there should be effective leadership, financial  investment, support from the media, and the involvement of  various social sectors.  <H5>  More Essential Work Must Be Done for Education and Teachers </H5>   The representatives maintained that, to firmly expedite  educational reform and development, efforts must be made to  provide education and teachers with essential support.    Representatives from Guangdong proposed that increasing  educational investment was the fundamental measure for  reaffirming education's strategic role and achieving educational  development. They said: As the economy develops, we should,  while increasing educational investment, appropriate and use  educational budgets according to the principle of "underscoring  the need for priority and urgent projects, taking into account  the need for routine and less urgent projects, and devising a  consolidated plan to be carried out step by step."    Jiangxi Governor Wu Guanzheng indicated that educational  work  must have adequate logistic support and more essential support  must be available for education and teachers. Those in charge  in Shaanxi's maintained that increasing teachers' pay and  solving their housing problems were essential to stabilize the  ranks of teachers and for educational development generally.  They said Shaanxi had come up with many ways to solve teachers'  housing problems and the province had achieved remarkable  success in this area.    In recent years, Shandong has given priority to popularizing  nine-year compulsory education and eliminating illiteracy among  adults. Shandong Governor Zhao Zhihao said that, to succeed in  these two areas, stronger contingents of teachers must be built.  He added that improving teachers' overall quality was essential  to revitalize educational development.    Achieving the objectives stated in the "Outline of the  Reform  and Development of China's Education" is a formidable but  glorious historical task.    Revitalizing education and rejuvenating the Chinese nation  are jobs that must be done as we approach the 21st century.</p>

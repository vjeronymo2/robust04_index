In his recent visit to the Beijing New Technology  Development  and Experiment Zone, he said that the zone is a far-sighted  project. He added that, in the initial stage of its  development, the zone has made remarkable progress.    He said that in the past four decades, a great number of  technological achievements turned out in the educational and  scientific fields have failed to find practical application.    He said that the industrialization of high technology is one  of the effective ways for turning technology into production  force.    He said that the experiment zone should enhance the training  of personnel in the sectors of international trade, finance, law  and accounting.    He noted that the talents in the above sectors are now badly  needed for the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure in the country.    He urged the Chinese inventors to timely apply for patent  rights at home and abroad so as to strengthen their competitive  strength in making use of scientific and technological  achievements.    Located in the Zhongguancun district, the experiment zone  was  China's first new and high technology development park.    Over the past five years, 112 high-technology enterprises in  the zone have achieved an annual income exceeding 10 million  yuan each.    Last year, the total income of the zone exceeded more than  10  billion yuan.</p>

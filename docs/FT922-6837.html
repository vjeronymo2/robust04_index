			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Technology: Self-help on open systems An initiative to promote 'open' computer systems among UK small- and medium-sized businesses is being orchestrated by the Department of Trade and Industry as its Pounds 12m open systems technology transfer programme ends this month. The DTI has already held meetings with a number of large computer suppliers who have pledged their support for a broad programme of measures to disseminate information about open systems and their benefits. The list includes ICL, IBM, Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard, AT&amp;T, Easylink, Unisys and Uniplex. While details of the initiative remain to be settled, it seems likely it will include a 'hotline' number which companies will be able to call for independent advice. It is also likely to develop guidelines which will define a set of attributes for openness which could be compared with suppliers' offerings. Open systems are based on commonly accepted industry standards and usually imply computers that can easily be connected together and run software from any supplier following open systems rules. Open systems offer significant possibilities for cutting costs once the move from proprietary designs has been made, but DTI studies show that while the message is well understood among very large companies - BP, Marks &amp; Spencer and Lucas are enthusiastic supporters of the initiative  - medium-sized and small companies are frequently confused by differing messages from suppliers and have difficulty obtaining independent information on which to base decisions. They are often too small to be able to afford to join one of the big league self-help organisations such as the Butler Cox Foundation. The DTI intends to inject some Pounds 2m in pump priming funds over the next two years but otherwise will confine itself to acting as 'honest broker' among the various factions and suppliers which make up the open systems movement. The idea is for the industry to take the lead in speaking to customers with a single, unambiguous voice about open systems. The DTI initiative is backed by lobby groups including X/Open, Uniforum UK, Unix International and the National Computing Centre.</p>

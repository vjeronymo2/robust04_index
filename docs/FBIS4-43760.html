			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that the  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is desperate and for this  reason they are attempting bombings in cities. On a study tour  in Yalova, Mentese discussed the issue of terrorism at a meeting  he held with citizens.    [Begin Mentese recording] PKK leader Apo [Abdullah Ocalan]  is continuously inciting his followers and his men. He is  inciting them on the radio with his messages. He is saying: Go  and plant bombs at tourist sites. Go and cause disturbances in  Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara. Aim at big cities. Apo is  avoiding engagement because he is losing considerably in the  southeast. We are taking every measure necessary. We are ready  and thanks to our intelligence we are capable of capturing the  terrorists. As you can see we capture terrorists everyday but  our people should also assist us and they should also be  careful. [end recording]</p>

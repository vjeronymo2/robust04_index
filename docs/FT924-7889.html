			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dark days at Hong Kong's Hutchison - Reasons for a decline in the company's esteem THESE are dark days for Hutchison Whampoa, Hong Kong's oldest company and one which, until recently, could hold its own with the likes of Swire and Jardine Matheson. Hutchison has been in the doldrums for the past 18 months. Its share price has under-performed the local stock market by 30 per cent - a poor performance which has been aggravated by a constant stream of bad news about its 49 per cent owned Canadian energy company, Husky Oil, and more latterly by the poor prospects for near-term returns on its investment in UK telecommunications. Hutchison has done nothing to make matters better. It produces one of the most opaque balance sheets of any important company in Hong Kong. Its senior executives have been in purdah since the summer, giving interviews only to a tame local media and avoiding stock analysts altogether. Little wonder, then, that two leading securities houses have recently produced reports on the company which project profit growth within a narrow margin of each other but which come to completely different conclusions about Hutchison's prospects. Warburg Securities - which has a 'sell' recommendation on the stock - estimated in a recent report on the company that the combined effect of Hutchison's foray into Canadian energy and UK telecommunications would, over the period 1988 to 1995, cost shareholders HKDollars 4.5bn (calculated in 1992 dollars) in profits foregone. It forecasts profits this year of around HKDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 323m), rising in 1993 to HKDollars 5.25bn. Credit Lyonnais - which recommends buying the stock - estimates profits this year of HKDollars 2.87bn, rising next year to HKDollars 5.5bn. Its view of Hutchison's telecommunications venture in the UK is that it is risky, but that rewards are large and will safeguard its future into the next century. Unlike Warburg, it thinks Hutchison could pull it off. To date, the market seems to be inclining to the Warburg view. A report last month that Hutchison has decided at a board meeting to pull out of its UK telecommunications venture saw strong buying of the stock. Two subsequent denials of a pull-out by Hutchison have not convinced the market; it expects the company to announce it has sold its UK telecommunications business by the late spring of next year. This view has been strengthened by the actions of Hutchison itself. The head office staff of Hutchison Telecoms has been cut from 45 to 40. The company's plans for expansion in India, Bangladesh, Taiwan and South Korea have been shelved, and it has pulled out of the race to introduce personal communications networks (PCN) in Australia and Germany. A survey of fund managers published last month revealed the extent of Hutchison's decline in the esteem of investors. Hutchison has slipped sharply since 1991 in a field of Hong Kong companies, in terms of quality of management and in financial soundness. At present, it is clear that the board of Hutchison is seriously divided, although there are signs that a management reshuffle is in the offing. Evidence of senior management division comes from the company's two most senior executives - the wily Mr Li Ka-shing, its chairman, and Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison's usually chipper managing director. They seem unable to tell the same story to the investing public about the company's business prospects, especially its UK telecoms operations. In the summer, Mr Murray was saying the UK telecommunications market was buoyant and that prospects for Hutchison 'excellent'. In June, Mr Li attributed the company's cut in dividend to the need to preserve cash in view of the UK business's funding requirements - more than HKDollars 7bn over the next few years - and forecast losses in the UK. In a recent newspaper interview, Mr Li said that for the past few months he had been spending 70 to 80 per cent of his time on Hutchison. He called on investors to be patient 'because, frankly speaking, Hutchison has a few problems'. The market, being the market, knows the outcome of any friction between Mr Li and Mr Murray. If talk doing the rounds in the colony's financial community is true, and few doubt it is, then Mr Murray is on the way out and Mr Richard Siemens, the head of Hutchison Telecommunications, could be soon following him. Face will, however, be saved. If Mr Murray goes - and the market is speculating that it could be as early as the new year - then Mr Li - whose flagship, Cheung Kong, owns 40 per cent of Hutchison - is likely to soften the blow by investing in Mr Murray's new business venture. Whatever Mr Murray's future holds, analysts say that Hutchison is undergoing a change in strategic direction. This will see greater emphasis placed in the company's Hong Kong operations and its investments in China, the latest example of which is its joint-venture with Shanghai's Port Authority to develop a container port for the city. The company is also gearing up to develop property on the mainland and to participate in telecommunications developments in China. While investors would welcome Hutchison's retreat from overseas investments and its reorientation towards China, one large concern still remains. If Mr Murray is not going to head Hutchison and foreigners are out of favour at the company, who is in? The appointment in August of Mr Richard Li, Mr Li Ka-shing's 25-year-old son, as an executive director of Hutchison has caused anxiety in investment circles. This was heightened when Mr Li said in the recent interview: 'One day I hope that my boys (his other son, Victor, is managing director of Cheung Kong) and the team of people can run the businesses themselves.' Mr Richard Li is seen as being too young to run a company of the complexity of Hutchison.</p>

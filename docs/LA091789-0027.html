			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN SMEAR CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> I would like to know the meaning of two stories that ran in The Times Sept. 1  and 2 regarding the alleged relationship between Michael Milken and Ivan  Boesky.  </P> <P> Just how did almost-2-year-old "confidential" Securities and Exchange  Commission memos based on gossip by unnamed sources find their way into the  hands of the news media? Who is responsible for this hideously unethical  behavior by a government agency that is "supposed" to be serving and protecting  the investment community?  </P> <P> These stories are another example of what appears to be a maliciously  orchestrated scheme of leaks and innuendoes generated to create a public smear  campaign against Milken.  </P> <P> He has been unwavering in declaring his innocence and deserves a fair trial.  Somewhere -- behind government doors, it seems -- there is a deliberate attempt  being made to sabotage that process.  </P> <P> When the press is being used as a courtroom, we the people of the United States  should be scared to death.  </P> <P> JUDITH SHERMAN WOLIN  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

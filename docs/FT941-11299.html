			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slide as fears mount over Fed rate US Treasury bonds retreated amid speculation that the Federal Reserve would boost short-term interest rates after the release of today's January employment data. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at 99 3/16 , with the yield rising to 6.306 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  5/32 to 99 15/32 , to yield 4.265 per cent. Although the timing of a move by the Fed remained uncertain, some traders were convinced that action would come soon. Suspicion mounted after the central bank did not intervene in the market to push the Fed Funds rate down to its 3 per cent target. For many, this was a signal that a move to the 3.25 per cent level was already under way. Earlier, bond prices edged higher after the Labor Department said claims for unemployment benefit had jumped by 59,000 last week. The contraction, however, largely reflected frigid weather and the impact the Los Angeles earthquake. Separately, a 1.2 per cent increase in December factory orders was strong, but in line with the consensus forecast of 1.4 per cent. During morning trade, bonds reversed course, falling steadily as traders warily turned their attention to today's payroll figures. Forecasts range from a gain of 165,000 to one of 200,000. A figure on the high end could give the Fed's policy-making arm - the Federal Open Market Committee - sufficient reason to recommend a tighter policy during its meeting today. The Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates unchanged after its fortnightly council meeting, and fears that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise US interest rates weighed heavily on European government bonds markets yesterday. Trading was active across Europe, and several exchanges reported record volume in government bond futures contracts. Following the publication of worse-than-expected German M3 data for December yesterday morning, few participants in the German government bond market believed the Bundesbank would put its credibility at risk by cutting interest rates. Nevertheless, they expressed their disappointment by driving bond prices lower, with short-dated maturities suffering the most. Yields on four-year paper rose eight basis points to 5.20 per cent, while yields on 10-year paper rose four basis points to 5.75 per cent. Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the German government bond market found some comfort in the Bundesbank's decision to return to its normal practice of announcing the terms of repo tenders on Tuesdays. The news raised hopes that the central bank could return to variable rate pacts as early as next week. This would enable the market to nudge the repo rate lower. The March bund future on Liffe dropped from the day's best level of 100.45 in heavy trading, to trade at 99.67, down 0.68 on the day. UK government bonds fell more than a point at the long end as the Bundesbank's decision to keep rates steady and worries about a rise in US rates dashed hopes of an early rate cut in the UK. On Liffe, the March long gilt future plunged  31/32 to close at 117 21/32 . In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent gilt due 2013 dropped 1 1/8 point to 114 1/4 . Japanese government bonds and futures eased further in London following the news in Tokyo of a delay in the economic stimulus package due to opposition from the socialists, the largest bloc in the coalition government. The March government bond future on Liffe traded at 113.79, down 0.61 on the day, and compared with a close of 113.85 in Tokyo.</p>

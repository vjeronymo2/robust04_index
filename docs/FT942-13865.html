			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Cariplo aims to raise L2,000bn Cariplo, Italy's biggest savings bank, is to place up to 22 per cent of its capital on the stock market, in a move which could eventually raise between L2,000bn (Dollars 1.23bn) and L3,000bn for the bank. The bank - formally known as Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde - announced last night it wanted to launch the first tranche of a two-stage capital increase and flotation before the year-end. Bank officials said the operation would give Milan-based Cariplo, which has belonged to a public-sector charitable foundation since 1816, the same flexibility to expand as its quoted competitors in Italy and Europe. The foundation's shareholders will be asked to approve the operation on April 29. The total amount raised by Cariplo will almost certainly top the L1,525bn flotation of 20 per cent of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group, in 1992. Both flotations have been prompted by the 1990 reforms of the Italian banking system, allowing public-sector banks to restructure and seek share quotations. Cariplo plans to issue up to 600m new shares before the end of this year. The bank said the price would be based on the book value of the bank's equity, discounted for expected dividends, following comparisons with the value of other Italian and European bank stock. In the second stage, Cariplo intends to issue 400m subordinated bonds by June 30, 1995, with warrants for the same number of new shares attached. Holders will be able to exercise the warrants, at a price based on the average quoted value of the shares before the offer, after January 1, 1996. This will spread the impact of the flotation over several years. The Cariplo board said it would seek authorisation to quote the shares, bonds and warrants on the domestic and foreign markets. Cariplo came under the judicial spotlight in February when Mr Roberto Mazzotta, the group's chairman, resigned after being charged with corruption. The charges related to allegedly phoney property transactions by Cariplo's substantial pension fund, and alleged illicit funding of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, which were the bank's main political influence.</p>

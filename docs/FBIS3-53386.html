They told AFP that the withdrawal from the Makhmur region  near the main Kurdish town of Irbil took place on Wednesday,  with the army pulling back four kilometres (two miles).    There was no immediate explanation for the pull-back in  Makhmur, where the Iraqi army shelled farms during the harvest  last summer.    The region is close to the 36th parallel, north of which the  Gulf war allies have imposed a no-fly zone for Iraqi aircraft.  The declared aim of the zone is to protect the Kurds, who  control northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad.    Kurdish military officials also said that Turkish gunners  shelled the border regions of Narwah and Rikan, without causing  damage or casualties. Turkish troops were concentrated on the  other side of the border.    In Ankara, the ANATOLIA news agency reported Wednesday that  Turkish army commando units had crossed into northern Iraq in  pursuit of Kurdish rebels who attacked a police post in  southeast Turkey killing two officers.    Thirteen rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were  also killed during the attack Tuesday evening in Cukurca, near  the Turkish border with Iran and Iraq.    It said the commando unit had crossed at least five  kilometres (three miles) into Iraq on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government is reluctant to accept a  U.S. Government demand to further open Japan's markets to U.S.  products in the automobile and auto parts and semiconductors  sectors, in addition to the mobile telephones (portable and car  telephones) sector. It says this would constitute "excessive  intervention in the private sector."    Private businesses, too, are all reacting strongly against  the United States, bewildered at its hard-line attitude. The  Japanese automobile industry has made firm its plan to set up a  consultative body together with the U.S. Big Three automakers to  discuss ways to increase Japanese procurement of American  automobiles. The government, thus, plans to emphasize these  points to gain U.S. understanding.    The United States is seeking a new action program aimed at  maintaining the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor  market at a 20-percent level. In this regard, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] stresses that "a  20-percent share was never a commitment, to begin with." Even  if the United States should formally ask Japan to work out an  action program at bilateral consultations to be held in Hawaii  next week, MITI officials plan to tell U.S. negotiators that  Japan "cannot accept share-based targets."    Meanwhile, the Japanese semiconductor industry has reacted  to  the situation in a relatively calm manner, saying that its  "relations with the U.S. semiconductor industry are not in a  critical state," (as stated by an executive official at a major  electronics maker). The reason is that although the foreign  share of the domestic semiconductor market has indeed shown a  downward trend, sales of foreign semiconductors have steadily  increased.    According to the Users' Committee of Foreign Semiconductors  (UCOM), which has been organized by domestic electronics  businesses, the sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan in the  first half (April-September) of fiscal year 1993 increased by 25  percent over the same period in the previous fiscal year. As a  result, hardly any U.S. maker has voiced dissatisfaction, even  though the share of foreign semiconductors in the Japanese  market has dropped.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has asked the  Japanese Government to guarantee further opening its markets to  American automobiles and auto parts. In this regard, MITI has  expressed strong objection, saying that "the automobiles sector  is a free market since access is not limited in terms of  locality, in contrast to the case of mobile telephones," (as  stated by MITI Deputy Vice Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu).    In the case of mobile telephones, the government has the  authority over issuing licenses regarding such matters as the  use of certain frequencies. MITI, however, stresses "the  automobile sector is a matter of private business, and  intervention in this sector would run contrary to a principle in  the framework trade talks that efforts would be made to increase  market access in areas which the government is capable of  handling," (as stated by a senior MITI official).    Japanese automakers, which have given consideration to U.S.  demands and are currently working on a new plan for purchasing  American auto parts, have also begun to stiffen their attitudes.  They maintain that "since the purchase plan is purely a  voluntary target, it would definitely lead to managed trade if  government guarantees were to be included," (as stated by a  senior official at a major automaker).    The Honda Motor Co., Ltd., which plans to purchase  approximately $4.9 billion worth of American auto parts in  fiscal year 1994, finds it difficult to fulfill its plan due to  dropping sales in its passenger vehicles department.  Consequently, the company "is considering plans to hammer out  cooperation with U.S. firms again on a medium- and long-term  basis," (as stated by a company executive).</p>

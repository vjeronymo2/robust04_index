			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia falls to 7-month low on job package worries With the exception of Hong Kong and Bombay the region's markets were easier, partly affected by the overnight fall on Wall Street. Tokyo remained closed for Golden Week - the market reopens today - while Seoul and Bangkok were also on holiday. AUSTRALIA fell as investors worried over what the government might do to finance its ADollars 6.5bn job creation programme. The All Ordinaries index declined 30.3 to 1,988.1, its lowest close since October 1993. Turnover was ADollars 581.6m. The market has fallen 15.4 per cent from its all-time high of 2,350.1 set on February 3. News Corp, which lifted its nine-month net profits by 54 per cent to ADollars 991.6m, retreated 29 cents to ADollars 9.22. Brokers remarked that the result was within expectations and that profits had been taken after the stock's recently strong performance. Speculation that Leighton Holdings could win the bid for Sydney's ADollars 800m casino, to be announced today, left the shares 10 cents up at ADollars 2.30. The golds index declined 40.5 to 2,001.0, with Newcrest shedding 25 cents to ADollars 5.35. HONG KONG staged a late technical rebound to finish modestly higher, the Hang Seng index gaining a net 43.44 at 8,412.88 after hitting an intraday low for the year of 8,249.20 in morning trade. Sentiment remained weak, with the poor health of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, among factors overhanging the market. Properties, regarded as oversold in recent sessions, rose 220.05, or 1.6 per cent, to 14,405.71. Among smaller stocks, Sum Cheong jumped 26 per cent, or HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 5.90 on rumours, later denied, that its application for a Singaporean listing was being reconsidered. MANILA saw profit-taking after Wednesday's 4.3 per cent rise, with Philippine Long Distance Telephone leading the sell-off. The composite index dipped 84.05 to 2,980.00 in turnover of 1.4bn pesos. PLDT receded 3.5 per cent to 1,925 pesos, largely on arbitrage related activity, although a 13 per cent fall in its first-quarter net profits affected sentiment. KUALA LUMPUR recorded its largest single-day fall since April 4, the composite index dropping 21.24, or 2 per cent, to 1,007.01. Volume eased from 146.8m shares to 139.6m. Golden Plus, an investment holding group, relinquished 60 cents to MDollars 11.40 on profit-taking following a sharp rise last week on suggestions that it might establish a gaming venture in China. SINGAPORE fell on light selling by foreign funds which, said brokers, could be switching into the cheaper Hong Kong stock market. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 23.34 lower at 2,277.74. Volume stayed thin, at 121.9m shares. DBS Land eased 2 cents to SDollars 4.68, although it denied that it was planning a share placing. Seapower Asia Investment, to be taken over by Richard Li, son of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Kah-shing, fell 31 cents to SDollars 2.03, with investors disappointed by a poor offer price, SDollars 1.45, and a weak 1994 outlook. TAIPEI saw late profit-taking and, after a high of 5,993.03, the weighted index ended just 9.23 up at 5,916.77. Turnover was TDollars 89.8bn (TDollars 84.29bn). Plastics attracted late buying on expectations for the industry's improving profits. Formosa Chemical Fibres surged TDollars 1.90 to TDollars 38.40 and China Petrochemical moved ahead 60 cents to TDollars 27.60. The textile sector led early gains on reports that Hualon Corp, a leading textile company, had been granted British loans for its investment in Northern Ireland. A Hualon spokesman declined to confirm the reports. Hualon ended 40 cents higher at TDollars 26.80. BOMBAY recovered from the day's lows on buying by Indian mutual funds and brokers on expectations that the carry forward or badla trading system would be reintroduced in the near future. The BSE index rose 13.76 to 3,614.24. There was no immediate confirmation from the government of the rumour. The ban had been introduced by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on the grounds that the local system of forward trading had been leading to excessive speculation. WELLINGTON tumbled 2.9 per cent to a 1994 closing low of 2,012.82, with the bearish tone set by Telecom, weaker in the US overnight and shedding 28 cents to NZDollars 4.65. Telecom reports annual results on May 13. Weakness in Telecom flowed through into the other leaders, but their falls were not nearly as pronounced. Turnover, at NZDollars 60m, was at its highest level so far this week. KARACHI closed higher on institutional support which erased early losses and took the KSE index up 23.65 to 2,405.37. COLOMBO put in a recovery after a bear run, the CSE all-share index improving 26.09 to 1,017.17 after a 12 per cent fall in the previous four trading days. Turnover rose from Rs142.8m to Rs191m.</p>

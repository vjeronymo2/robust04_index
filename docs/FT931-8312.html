			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soar at long end amid heavy buying THE US Treasury market responded enthusiastically to President Clinton's economic plan yesterday, with prices soaring at the long end of the maturity range amid heavy buying. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 3/16 at 101 3/8 , yielding 7.010 per cent, a record low for the issue. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/16 at 100 19/32 , to yield 3.913 per cent. The State of the Union address on Wednesday night was well received by bond investors, who believe that the deficit-cutting part of the president's economic plan stands a reasonable chance of passing through Congress almost intact. Before the speech some investors had worried that the package would lack credibility, but bond market analysts said that Mr Clinton's forthright account of the economic troubles facing the country, and his outline of the solutions, convinced investors that deficit reduction can work, and that the planned tax increases will be implemented. The latter is doubly positive for the Treasury market because higher taxes could slow the rate of economic growth and subdue inflation. Bond prices rose strongly despite economic news that was bearish for the market. The day's statistics included a 19,000 drop in weekly jobless claims, a larger-than-expected 0.5 per cent increase in January consumer prices, and a 0.4 per cent rise in January industrial output. BETTER-than-expected UK jobs data prompted little enthusiasm in the gilts market yesterday, where prices ended virtually unchanged. The number of unemployed rose by 22,100 in January, keeping the seasonally adjusted total just below the 3m level. The Bank of England's first inflation report earlier this week has also deflated sentiment by suggesting that an early interest cut is not on the cards, dealers said. On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the long gilt future ended at 102-27, down  3/16 from Wednesday's close, and off earlier highs. However, the two tap stocks announced on Tuesday afternoon were partly sold yesterday, dealers said. GERMAN government bonds firmed slightly yesterday, on market speculation that money supply data due early next week will be positive for the bond market. This would mean improved prospects for further interest rate cuts. JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally on strong investor demand, but came off the highs of the day as investors took profits. The recent rally in Japanese government bonds has been helped by the strengthening of the yen against the US dollar. The June futures contract opened at 109.94 and traded up to a high of 110.15 before ending at 109.96. ITALIAN bonds ended lower due to further political uncertainty, after the Liberal party threatened to leave the coalition government. On Liffe, the March BTP ended 19 basis points lower at 95.93 and was poised to test the next support level at 95.70, some said.</p>

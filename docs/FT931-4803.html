			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / LDP seeks to distance itself from Kanemaru MR SHIN KANEMARU, until last autumn the most powerful man in Japanese politics, is to be detained in the Tokyo detention centre for 10 days for questioning over alleged tax evasion involving Y1.2bn (Pounds 7m) bank bonds. The ruling Liberal Democratic party's leadership was yesterday struggling to distance itself from the affair which threatens to embroil the government in another damaging scandal. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and senior LDP officials have argued that the tax evasion charges are a personal rather than a political issue. The arrest has nevertheless led them to promise to pursue plans for the reform of political funding and the electoral system. Opposition parties plan to exploit the affair to embarrass the government, which is only just recovering from the debilitating Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. They will allege that Mr Kanemaru's tax evasion was closely linked to his political activities, in particular the financial backing he helped to organise for Mr Noboru Takeshita, former prime minister. Mr Kanemaru, who resigned from the Japanese parliament last October after admitting receiving a Y500m illegal donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, and Mr Masahisa Haibara, his private secretary, are thought to hold about Y2.8bn of discount bonds issued by the Nippon Credit Bank. Such bonds do not have to be registered by name. The tax authorities believe Mr Kanemaru and Mr Haibara bought some of the bonds between 1987 and 1989 using about Y1.2bn of undeclared income. The timing of the arrests was highly political. The two men were arrested on Saturday evening, just hours after the Japanese parliament's lower house had passed the budget for 1993. The prospect of the arrests seemed to have accelerated agreement on the budget after the LDP unexpectedly agreed to examine opposition proposals for income tax cuts. For their part, the prosecutors seem to have held off until the budget was approved. Had the arrests been made before the budget had been passed, the opposition would have forced a delay in the budget process to debate Mr Kanemaru's arrest. Such a delay would have threatened to undermine confidence on the Tokyo stock market.</p>

Fifty-six percent of respondents, on the other hand, think  Slovakia's economic performance internationally has been  unsuccessful.    The activity of Slovak embassies abroad is judged as a  disappointment by 42 percent. Twenty-nine percent think there  are still too few embassies and consulates abroad, while 12  percent reckon there are too many.    Slovaks are most satisfied with the performance of Slovak  sportsmen abroad and the representation of Slovak culture, with  two-thirds rating it positively.</p>

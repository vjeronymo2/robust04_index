			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Umberto Brindani, Stefano Brusadelli, and Renzo </F> Rosati: "How Strong Is the Right?"]    [Text] This is a report on an expanding area of the  political scene: the area represented by Berlusconi, Bossi, and  Fini. Many things--such as the use of the term "right"--serve to  divide them, but united they could win the elections.    At 1230 hours sharp on Sunday 6 February, Silvio  Berlusconi--attired in a presidential double-breasted jacket  with a Forza Italia rosette in the lapel--began to speak from  the stage of the Palafiera in Rome. He was delivering the  official preamble of the Forza Italia movement and his speech  was a "call to arms" in opposition to the front of the Left. At  the same time, at the Augusteo Theater in Naples, National  Alliance [AN] leader Gianfranco Fini--with Alessandra Mussolini  at his side and 2,000 fans [preceding word in English] in the  audience--was concluding the speech that opened the election  campaign in the South with an attack on the center and the left.  Also at 1230 hours, in a room at the Hotel Tre Vecchi in  Bologna, Umberto Bossi was waking up with sleep-filled eyes.  Always several hours late even for his appointments with  history, it was not until around 1700 hours that the Lombard  warrior would fire his broadsides against the "communists," in a  triumphant speech at the party convention that opened "the year  of the Samurai, the year in which the League's enemies will have  their throats cut from ear to ear."    These three snapshots--taken within minutes of each  other--record a historic moment in Italian politics: the birth  of the Italian Right. Or rather, of an area that is  conventionally referred to as the Right: an area that on the  political map is distinct both from the Center and from the Left  and that for the first time in Italy will be able to fight a  leftist coalition on equal terms. In other western countries  this area is already established and is called variously  moderate, conservative, Tory, Republican, Giscardian, Reaganism,  Thatcherite, and so forth. In Italy the first steps are being  taken today, on the basis of two assumptions: the sharing of  certain values and interests (ranging from free enterprise to a  less burdensome tax structure) and the mutual desire to prevent  an election victory of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  and its allies.    The three leaders are certainly as different--in terms of  language, culture, and social origin--as one can possibly  imagine. Their respectives staffs [preceding word in English]  and rank-and-file activists fight each other, and not just  metaphorically. Their traditions, customs, and myths seem to  belong to separate worlds. And just as in some science fiction  novels, these three political areas were until yesterday  orbiting side by side without coming into contact, as if they  were three parallel universes. At 1230 hours on Sunday 6  February, a window was opened among the three galaxies: a window  through which a torrent of votes could pour on 27 and 28 March.  The most recent poll taken by the CIRM [Italian Center for  Market Research] for TMC [expansion not given] gives Forza  Italia 24 percent, the League 10 percent, and AN 10 percent for  a total of 44 percent, compared to 34 percent for the  progressive coalition. The survey conducted by Diakron (which  works for Berlusconi's party) gives Forza Italia approximately  30 percent--a virtual absolute majority under the single-member  system, which rewards a party that has a well-established  presence in a given area, such as the League in the north and  the AN in many parts of the center-south.    Despite the technical sleight of hand that the leaders are  using in an effort to gloss over their reciprocal vetoes, the  extent to which the three pillars of this new right are  compatible remains to be seen. Three representatives of PANORAMA  accordingly made an incursion into the three universes, which  they describe in an unusual way--the only way possible in the  case of three services that function in parallel. Their aim was  to discover whether the generals, strategies, and armies of the  neoconservatives will ultimately be able to get along in a  single universe.  <H6>  Style of the Leaders: </H6> <H5>  Silvio Berlusconi </H5>   The lights are dimmed, the background music begins, and  spokesman Antonio Tajani announces that "in a few moments Silvio  Berlusconi will be here!" When he arrives, the party's anthem  bursts forth ("Forza Italia, it is time to believe...."), the  stage lights up, and the leader's first words are: "How could  anyone not be moved?" Then he seizes the microphone and begins  to pace back and forth "in the Frank Sinatra manner." Rome, 6  February: Smiling, attired in a double-breasted jacket with a  Forza Italia rosette in the lapel and a megascreen that  multiplies him by sixteen, Berlusconi displays his style in  public. He does not hold conventional political meetings; the  scenography is too involved, the alternation between the pacing  and the pauses at the podium too studied. The great communicator  knows that the scene has to be changed every 10 or 15 minutes.  He never indulges in show [previous word in English], however:  he expounds a program and delivers clear political signals.    Berlusconi speaks extemporaneously, after memorizing the  outline and key points of his speech. He does not gesticulate:  his hands are anchored to the podium, and when he walks they are  clutching the microphone. His left hand slips fleetingly into  his jacket pocket, and during the solemn passages his right hand  is placed over his heart. Supported even by the Doxa [polling  agency] ("He is the best equipped to solve the nation's  problems"), Berlusconi uses the pronoun "we" unabashedly. "We  know how to revive Italy," he says. "No one can make this  promise with more credibility and prestige." But he also strives  for simplicity. "Do not be shy," he says, "we are now singing in  unison." He looks first one way and then another, without moving  his shoulders; it is a habit that perhaps comes from too much  familiarity with the friendly television cameras.    He has agreed to face-to-face confrontations but only under  definite conditions: he says no to noisy audiences and to  moderators who are mediocre or who are too cunning. Bob Lasagna,  the public relations consultant with the picturesque last name,  explains. "What is so shocking about that?" he asks. "In the  United States, such confrontations are few and are regulated  down to the smallest detail."  <H5>  Umberto Bossi </H5>   "Our concept of freedom does not come from Hegel, but from  Fichte." But who says this? Rocco Buttiglione, the philosopher  who has lent his services to politics? No, sir; it is Umberto  Bossi, speaking from the platform of the convention center in  Bologna on Sunday 6 February. It is inevitable: every time a  sprinkling of culture issues from his mouth, the League's people  do not understand but applaud anyway, and the journalists--who  even though they too may not understand--smile as they are  thinking: "Miglio told him that half an hour ago." This is  because Bossi is that fellow from the Radio Elettra School, the  bogus student of medicine, and the coarse, vulgar, and ignorant  head of the coarsest, most vulgar, and most ignorant political  movement that has ever been seen in Italy.    True. Unfortunately, this is also the person who by dint of  dubious allegations and repeated extravagant posturing is  attempting--with a fair chance of success--to take over the  national government, even if in cohabitation with the slick  postyuppie [preceding word in English] Forza Italia. Bossi also  pleases his followers because of the fact that he has not  changed his style since the days when he personally pasted up  his homemade manifestos. Although the League has gone  middle-class, its leader has not. He lives in a little house  that appears to have been furnished with factory rejects from a  big furniture supermarket. He dresses like an employee at a  company dinner. He is unable to fasten the bottom button on his  shirt, because it restricts him. He does not care about the look  [preceding word in English] but rather--in his own words--"the  substance of things," so that even though oratory is his strong  point, he sometimes takes off on improbable mental tangents. He  then appears to rouse himself from his catalepsy, after which he  fires a cannonade that excites the crowd.    Careless and instinctive, apocalyptic and macho,  heavy-handed  and assertive: this is the Bossi the public sees. If he has been  successful until now, it is because underneath the mask of a ham  actor there is a genuine politician who is as cold as a computer.  <H5>  Gianfranco Fini </H5>   "Fini has been tempered by the solitude of the rejected, of  the outcast. By dint of finding himself opposed to everyone, he  has learned how to demand respect. He is at his best in  difficult confrontations with an adversary, because he strikes  first and strikes harder." The person depicted thus by Luciano  Cavalli, an expert on political charisma, is a typical leader of  the right. Fini is a leader who is tough, cold, accustomed to  unpopularity, devoid of timidity, and in no way inclined toward  sentimentality. "He is a Giorgio Almirante," Cavalli adds, "who  is even more secure in his beliefs, because the MSI [Italian  Social Movement] no longer has any guilt complexes to expiate."  Giuliana, Gianfranco Fini's nine-year-old daughter, is the only  person he will allow to make fun of him. She mimics to  perfection her father's performance on the speakers' platform:  the way he points his index finger horizontally toward his face  and twirls it--the only demagogic variation he will make in a  speaking style that is otherwise dry, rational, and unemotional.  Fini speaks in the style of the traditional political meeting,  but without the progressions and modulations of voice  characteristic of Almirante or Bossi. He speaks with a distinct  Bolognese accent, drinks a lot of water, keeps his head and  shoulders steady, and--as a rule--uses a handwritten outline. He  has the habit of resuming his speech before the applause has  ceased, and he likes to fill his speeches with disdainful quips  at the expense of his adversaries.    Communications expert Bruna Pustetto attributes Fini's  persuasiveness to his degree in teaching. There are other  secrets, however: Fini always strikes first, never loses his  calm, and has an extraordinary memory. We also know that he has  never cried in public, tells jokes, and can imitate all the  dialects; his rendition of Bossi's Lombard dialect is especially  successful and amusing. He is 42 years of age, is a practicing  Catholic (although married to a divorcee), eats dinner alone, is  a fan of the Bologna and Latium soccer teams, lives in Boville  at the gates of Rome, and has his wife Daniela select his suits  for him.  <H6>  The Platforms: </H6> <H5>  Forza Italia </H5>   The slogan--"I promise you a new economic miracle"--had been  ready for weeks. Rather than a miracle, however, the platform of  Forza Italia--45 points on 100 pages--is the classic free  enterprise formula: reduction of taxes and government spending,  and elimination of the restraints on the labor market. It  promises "a tax schedule consisting of a single rate that is no  higher than 30 percent, with progressivity ensured by  deductions. The poor would be completely exempt from payment of  the IRPEF [personal income tax]. Taxes would be cut from the  present 200 to no more than 10. Spending would be reduced, and  the state would perform only those services not provided by the  market. Debt would be rescheduled under a system whereby those  who are able would pay for the services they receive--by their  choice--from the public or the private sector, contributing in  either case to social solidarity. Employment would be stimulated  by removing taxes on hiring, apprenticeships, adapting education  to the requirements of business, and eliminating--by offering  legal and flexible forms of employment--what today is illegal  labor."    Nor is the social aspect overlooked: it ranges from a  proposal to lower taxes for large families to offering women  part-time work and company-sponsored day care.  <H5>  The League </H5>   The platform that Bossi got approved at the party convention  in Bologna is approximately nine pages long. The last five and a  half lines of the document are devoted to the plan for  governing: "The federal congress shall order the federal  secretary to prepare a plan for governing the country: a plan  that will take into account the necessity of increasing freedom  at the institutional level until federalism is achieved, and  increasing freedom in the economy until a market economy is  achieved." End of program. Whoever says he votes "in accordance  with the platform" is well served, for what you have here is a  nonprogram that meets one very simple requirement: that Bossi be  given a free hand, in accordance with the usual League system of  giving a blank check "to the only person who knows how to use  it."    Federalism has become a "should be"; in the document, Bossi  even allows the word "potential" to slip by him. One thing is  certain, however: The League regards the coming legislature as a  constituent assembly. What are the key words in the Lombard  lexicon? Free enterprise, lower taxes, wage caps, and  privatization. In short--as Bossi said in Bologna--"let the  state get out of the way." As for the media, Marco Formentini  adds, "we will not accept any information monopoly, and we will  defend Berlusconi against the attack by the RAI [Italian  Broadcasting Corporation]."  <H5>  National Alliance </H5>   "Tax breaks for investments that create jobs," was Fini's  somewhat generic response on TV when asked where he would begin  if he headed the government. Perhaps because not even the MSI  people believe such a scenario is possible, no real scale of  priorities exists. One has to search the MSI platform, which  presents a strange mix of pro-efficiency and pro-solidarity  advocacy. For the economy, the platform recommends  privatization, provided it does not give an advantage to foreign  corporate groups. For the League it offers bureaucratic and  fiscal decentralization through the creation of macroprovinces  of the Polesine or Cadore type. For Berlusconi it offers a  promise not to dismantle his TV empire, together with a package  of measures designed to reassure moderate voters. The platform  calls for a five-year moratorium on non-EC immigration into  Italy; abolition of the concept of "small quantities" as applied  to narcotics; a sterner attitude toward prostitution; a pro-life  position on abortion; and laws to prohibit genetic engineering  experiments.    In the area of politics, if the coalition of the Right is  victorious, the MSI will resume its harassment of Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro--who is accused of being a hostage of Achille  Occhetto--and will reopen the campaign for the direct election  of the head of state or--at least--of the head of government.  <H6>  What Each Says About the Other Two: </H6> <H5>  Forza Italia </H5>   A CIRM poll conducted for PANORAMA shows that the Forza  Italia voters--with zero representing the center of the  political spectrum--place themselves 19.5 points to the right,  compared to 28.5 for the League and 63 for the MSI. These  samples, moreover, show that the supporters of Berlusconi's  party regard the League as being closer to them politically but  socially inferior, and they place little trust in Bossi. They  believe they are politically more distant from the MSI, but  regard Fini as a competent and sincere interlocutor.  <H5>  The League </H5>   What about an alliance with Berlusconi? "Like chewing on a  nettle," says Erminio Boso of Trent. "It would be like a  confirmed bachelor who gets a proposal from a woman," adds Uber  Anghinoni of Mantua. "He risks a heart attack. Better to  continue to live alone." As for an alliance with the MSI, "no"  in any case. "Never! Never! Never!" Bossi thundered in Bologna.  "We will never have anything to do with the fascists!" On the  other hand, "Berlusca"--according to Bossi--"is a Milanese with  whom it would be easy to reach an agreement."  <H5>  National Alliance </H5>   The Fini people have said no: 52 percent of them do not want  an alliance with Bossi, and not just because he insists on  calling them fascists. "That fellow," says MSI partisan Teodoro  Buontempo, "intends to form an institutional government with the  PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], or even to bring about the  secession of the north." Relations with Berlusconi are better.  "The Knight," Fini explains, "has a national image, and within  an anticommunist coalition he could serve as a bridge between  north and south."  <H6>  Anthropology of the Party Members </H6> <H5>  Silvio Berlusconi's People </H5>   Homo berlusconianus made his initial appearance in a  Fininvest uniform: blazer [preceding word in English], gray  pants, shoes the color of brierwood. The only exemptions are for  external luxuries: General Luigi Caligaris in tweed and  sleeveless sweater, and the economist Antonio Martino in the  vest of a liberal gentleman of the south. And the blue soldiers  have begun to wear civilian garb, but without making any  concessions to the slovenliness of League types.    The Forza Italia partisan is self-confident; drives a  medium-  to high-powered car; and often is self-employed. Thirty percent  are professionals; 12 percent are owners of small or midsized  businesses; 10 percent are university instructors; 15 percent  are merchants or craftsmen; and 4 percent are public employees.  "We should not ask for anything; we are not paid politicians,"  Stefano Podesta, professor at Bocconi University, proudly  states. Politics is viewed as a mission, as a mass transposition  of Berlusconi's "bitter cup."    The values of the Forza Italia activists are the family and  private enterprise. "I view Italy as a nation of respectable  people," their leader says. Their key words are honesty,  competence, and optimism. Partyocracy, consociativism, and  statism are proscribed. Communism is the great enemy. Their  bible is Praise of Folly by Erasmus of Rotterdam,  often quoted by Berlusconi, as for example the passage: "The  most courageous decisions do not derive from reasoning but from  farsighted, visionary folly." For them, the party represents  politics in the office, in the living room: just like Berlusconi  in his Arcore villa. It represents the rediscovery of the  national anthem, the fatherland, holding hands, the Christmas  tree. Paolo Garimberti, manager of Tg-2 [TV news], calls it "the  culture of Beautiful [preceding word in English] and  Mike Bongiorno." But Gad Lerner, assistant editor of LA STAMPA,  disagrees. "It represents an individualistic Italy," he says,  "that is kept on the fringes of the establishment [preceding  word in English], just outside the protection of political  patronage, the circles of big business, and the financial  sanctuaries. It is an Italy that is conservative, hard-working,  and roguish: an Italy that is intuitive and--above  all--self-confident."  <H5>  Umberto Bossi's People </H5>   It is one o'clock in the morning on Saturday, 5 February, at  the Holiday Inn hotel, in the faded gray outskirts of Bologna.  In the dining room, 100 or so happy League partisans--their eyes  blurred with fataigue--are beginning to leave. A few people are  still dancing. Gipo Farassino, the Piedmontese leader [preceding  word in English] and cabaret singer, who is slightly  intoxicated, attacks his final two numbers: Besame  mucho and--unexpectedly--Roma nun fa' la stupida  stasera. Umberto Bossi is sitting in a corner. Is he  talking politics? Hardly. He is surrounded by half a dozen  female admirers and is dispensing predatory smiles. Shortly  thereafter he bids farewell to the assembled guests, and the  mood turns gloomy.    These are the League's people--the same ones who the next  day  were hurling catcalls and insults at the mayor of Bologna, who  dared to speak that dirty word, "solidarity." They are the same  ones who buy undershorts imprinted with a caricature of Rosy  Bindi and the gentlemanly caption, "Make me a Lega [League]."  The same ones who rush to buy the videocassettes of their  leader's wedding (20,000 lire), the aiguillettes bearing  Miglio's likeness (5,000 lire), and the Bossi brand of red wine  (3,500 lire). The same ones who listen enraptured to the new  League anthem, which is a cross between the Marcia  trionfale from Aida and the sound track from  Freccia nera. And then there is the latest model of  League supporters, who are gathering up everything and packing  it away, because, they feel they are grownups now and should  avoid the appearance of being just a bunch of hotheads. These  are the League people, in their Sunday best, with their  medium-powered sedans and L'INDIPENDENTE under their arm  (although they read it somewhat apprehensively ever since Bossi  said that "at times it reads like the newspaper of the  fascists"). These are the League people, with the serialized  encyclopedia in the Alazzone living room, and the wives with  their cult of the fur coat.    Their key words: federalism, free enterprise,  self-government, "the common people," and "of the people." Their  hated words: journalists, the government, welfarism, and  solidarity. The word "solidarity" has in fact been struck from  the official documents of the Municipality of Milan.  <H5>  Gianfranco Fini's People </H5>   Although at the MSI party congress in Rome in late January  the word "comrade" was never heard and scarcely a dozen Roman  salutes were given, the political scientist Piero Ignazi, the  leading Italian expert on the Right, does not believe such a  miraculous transfiguration has taken place. "In my opinion," he  insists, "the former ideological position has changed only  slightly. Convincing evidence of the acceptance of capitalism  and the free market is lacking. As for the liquidation of  fascism, I have not yet heard anyone speak the word error,'  which the PDS has used in reference to communism."    The MSI people--the only ones who have been willing to  define  themselves as rightists--are suspended between nostalgia for an  identity that has not been renounced and the temptations of a  virtuous and attractive modernism. Blue has replaced black as  the official color; the feminist group "The Bees" has been  formed; and there are also two new plush mascots, Fiammino and  Fiammetta, that will even have their own comic books. There are  fewer gray or blue suits, more slacks, and more sports jackets.  The impression is one of a machismo that has been  abandonend--without too many regrets--to the Bossi zealots. The  party spirit remains strong, however: the nomenklatura on the  speakers' platform, sections, a central committee, and party  membership cards, together with a radicalism that is primarily  of the lower middle class and the middle middle class.    According to data gathered by Ignazi, 26 percent of the  delegates at the MSI party congress were professionals, 18  percent white-collar workers, and 12 percent teachers. They were  molded--still according to the survey--by the following authors,  listed in the order of their importance: Evola, Mussolini,  Codreanu, Gentile, Spirito, and Nietzsche. Something is  changing, however: Fini has introduced the economic liberalism  of Bobbio into the MSI pantheon. And Adolfo Urso, the moving  spirit of the AN--which was born of a meeting between the MSI  and moderate elements outside that party--recommends Prezzolini  and Albert Michel, popularizer of the Rhineland model of a  corporate market economy.  <H6>  Where the Leader Commands </H6> <H5>  Forza Italia </H5>   If Forza Italia is to change its policy line, elect new  leaders, and deal with internal dissent, it will perhaps not be  a party convention or a national executive council that will do  the job. The creation of the party, the entry into politics, the  alliances, and the platform: Berlusconi did it all either  entirely by himself or with a few trusted advisers. The  Fininvest and Pubitalia organization created the movement. The  outsiders--the experts--developed the platform: Giuliano Urbani,  Martino, Caligaris, the constitutional expert Gianfranco  Ciaurro, the judge Tiziana Parenti, and the attorney Raffaele  Della Valle. It is a kind of crown council--a club [preceding  word in English] of patricians who are often installed at the  highest levels of the state but are not defiled by contact with  active politics.    Berlusconi assembles them araound the dining room table at  Villa San Martino in Arcore. In Forza Italia, oval tables are de  rigueur. You will find them in the Milan headquarters on Viale  Isonzo and in the luxurious headquarters on Via dell'Umilta in  Rome. And what of the rank-and-file? The clubs [preceding word  in English] number approximately 7,000, located principally in  Lombardy, Latium, Campania, and Sicily. After the elections a  streamlined organization will be retained, modeled after the  American political committee. For the time being Berlusconi is  the titular president of Forza Italia, but when the movement has  a parliamentary group, it will appoint its leadership just as  the traditional parties do.  <H5>  The League </H5>   Bossi's party, amid the proclamations of the various  movements, is the only one of the three parties to be rigidly  structured in the Leninist manner. Here are its numbers: 79  members of Parliament (there were 80, but one was lost along the  way); 130 mayors; 700 headquarters in the north; 4,000 members  of municipal councils; 120,000 party members; 3.4 million votes  in the parliamentary elections of 1992; and one leader. Yes, one  leader, because Bossi is master in his own house, just like the  boss of an ironworks. He has absolute control over his  followers, and is not afraid to banish them or to destroy their  credibility. And he does not accord special treatment to the  faithful. Bossi is always reelected by acclamation, and arranged  for the grandfather of the League--Luigi Rossi, the "pianist"  who voted as his proxy in the Chamber of Deputies--to be elected  honorary president, also by acclamation. "Like Caligula with his  horse," said one League member, rubbing his hands together. The  decisionmaking process, in short, is quite simple. It operates  as follows: Bossi thinks it over, listens to a few people,  selects the policy line, convenes a party congress or a federal  council, and arranges for a rather generic document to be  approved--one that will allow him, if necessary, to change his  mind. The document approved in Bologna orders--in a threatening  manner--the secretary "to ascertain whether there are any  independence-minded factions within the League." Translation:  someone will soon have to leave.  <H5>  National Alliance </H5>   In the case of the incautious Alessandra Mussolini, who had  publicly accused him of the crime of "defascistization," Fini  undertook--behind closed doors--a bantering but very stern  historical examination of fascism. Soon thereafter, the  Granddaughter was tamed. In dealing with the case of Pino  Rauti--an opponent with a following--he invented a more subtle  treatment. When the "Black Ingrao" challenged him for the  leadership of the AN, Fini was completely unruffled; but the  Rauti supporters were threatened, one by one, with the loss of  their places on the electoral lists. Having weighed the risk of  being left alone, even Rauti fell into line. Fini has cracked  down. His MSI now resembles Craxi's PSI [Italian Socialist  Party]; its leadership meets only rarely. Whoever objects is  invited to get out. The various factions have been de facto  dissolved. "Fini," his spokesman Francesco Storace says,  "learned his lesson during his first secretaryship, from 1987 to  1990, when he was forced out precisely by the maneuverings of  such groups." In making decisions Fini listens to only four  people--"the summit," as it is called within the party--namely,  Giuseppe Tatarella, leader of the bloc of deputies; Francesco  Servello, the coordinator; Mirko Tremaglie, in charge of foreign  relations; and Altero Matteoli, in charge of organization. One  also senses the beginnings of a personality cult: there are Fini  watches, paid cruises with Fini, and books on Fini, one of which  consists of interviews and another--just published--of letters  to the party secretary.</p>

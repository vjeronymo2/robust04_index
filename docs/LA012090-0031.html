			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS WINS IN 2 OVERTIMES  </P> <P> All the ingredients were there. Fervent fans trading taunt for taunt across the  gymnasium at one another. Rival cheerleaders matching leaping routine for  leaping routine. Several near-melees between students during the game and  another afterward.  </P> <P> Throw in a double-overtime white-knuckler, and what have you got?  </P> <P> The Kennedy-Granada Hills high school rivalry, of course.  </P> <P> Friday night at Granada Hills, the basketball more than matched the hoopla as  the Highlanders defeated Kennedy, 77-73, in double overtime in a North Valley  League game.  </P> <P> "It was a great game for a spectator," a disconsolate Kennedy Coach Yutaka  Shimizu said. "I've been through a lot of these."  </P> <P> None more hotly contested than this one.  </P> <P> Kennedy (10-7, 3-2 in league play) looked like a sure winner when the  Highlanders' Jermoine Brantley, not realizing that his team was out of  timeouts, called one with nine seconds to play and the score tied, 62-62. A  technical foul was assessed, and Kennedy's Juan Segura hit the second of two  free throws to give the Golden Cougars a 63-62 lead.  </P> <P> Kennedy also got the ball out of bounds, and Garret Anderson (a game-high 36  points and 10 rebounds) increased the lead to 65-62 by sinking two free throws  with seven seconds left.  </P> <P> Brantley (30 points, five steals) redeemed himself by hitting a long  three-point shot with two seconds remaining, sending the game into overtime.  </P> <P> Brantley scored four points in the first overtime, including a short jump shot  that gave Granada Hills (13-7, 4-1) a 71-69 lead with less than 30 seconds to  play.  </P> <P> But Brantley and teammate Aaron Lattimore (14 points, 10 rebounds) both missed  the front end of one-and-one situations in the final seconds and Anderson, who  scored all six Kennedy points in the first overtime, sank an 18-foot shot at  the buzzer to send the game into a second three-minute period.  </P> <P> Kennedy failed to score another basket. Brantley put Granada Hills ahead for  good, 75-73, with his third three-point shot of the game, and reserve forward  Jevon Lee sank two free throws with 13 seconds left to clinch the win.  </P> <P> "Brantley's our guy. We kind of live and die by him," Granada Hills Coach Bob  Johnson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KEITH CLARK MAKES HIS PACIFIC SYMPHONY FAREWELL  </P> <P> Keith Clark's tenure as music director of the Pacific Symphony -- the orchestra  he founded in 1979 -- came to a bitter, poignant, perhaps humiliating end this  week at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Clark returned to the stage after conducting Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 on  Wednesday, and in response to audience applause led the orchestra and the  Pacific Chorale in a hushed account of Mozart's "Ave, verum corpus" as an  encore.  </P> <P> He took a solo bow acknowledging many in the audience who were standing, then  turned and applauded the orchestra.  </P> <P> The orchestra did not applaud back.  </P> <P> The issue of retaining Clark may at one time have divided the orchestra's board  of directors. Some long-term subscribers may have been ruffled. Critics may  have disagreed. Some orchestra members early on may have protested. But at the  close the musicians spoke with unanimous voice and it was not a favorable one.  </P> <P> Under such circumstances, discussion of the actual music-making might be a bit  extraneous were it not for the superb, songful playing of cellist Lynn Harrell.  </P> <P> Harrell was soloist in Joan Tower's attractive, post-modern impressionistic  "Music for Cello and Orchestra" and Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme.  </P> <P> Harrell negotiated Tower's many demanding double- and triple-stops with  apparent ease. He traversed Tchaikovsky's variations with delicacy, warmth and  poise. He was a master of evenness in dynamics and color throughout the compass  of the instrument -- the 1673 Jacqueline Du Pre Stradivarius, according to the  program.  </P> <P> Clark accompanied with care and attention, and the orchestra responded  supportively.  </P> <P> But when it came to Beethoven's Ninth, Clark gave a typically unfocused,  dispiriting interpretation, workmanlike at best and pedantic and insensitive at  worst.  </P> <P> The orchestra followed gamely. The Pacific Chorale sang with strength if not  much clarity.  </P> <P> The solo quartet, harried by Clark's hurried tempos, consisted of soprano  Janice Yoes, mezzo-soprano Jacalyn Bower, tenor William Lewis and bass James  Patterson (who came to grief in his opening statement).  </P> <P> The program was scheduled for a repeat on Thursday.

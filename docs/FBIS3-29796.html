Sen. Evans told parliament the  government has given in principle agreement to an inquiry that  will look into the operation and management of ASIS. There have  been calls for such an investigation following allegations which  two former ASIS spies made on a documentary screened earlier  this week on the ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation]  program, Four Corners.    Among the allegations was that ASIS kept files on thousands  of Australian citizens, that agents spied for Britain in the  Middle East, and that secret payments were made to rebel army  officers in the Philippines who had tried to overthrow the  Aquino government. But Sen. Evans said the inquiry had been  under active consideration for some time well before the latest  allegations.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISS BUENA PARK STRIPPED OF CROWN OVER HER SCHOOL ATTENDANCE  </P> <P> Local pageant officials announced Monday that the reigning Miss Buena Park,  crowned only two months ago, will be stripped of her title because of a breach  of contract.  </P> <P> State officials, who concurred with the decision, said the 26-year-old winner  apparently provided misleading information about her school attendance.  </P> <P> Merlyn Lans, executive director of the Miss Buena Park Scholarship Pageant,  made the announcement during a press conference but refused to say why April  Lynch of Huntington Beach had been disqualified.  </P> <P> After making her announcement, Lans officially handed over the title to first  runner-up Deborah Donnelly, 25, of La Palma, who will now receive the $1,000  scholarship originally set aside for Lynch.  </P> <P> Later, after conferring hastily by conference calls, officials of the Miss  California Pageant said they had to go along with Lans' decision.  </P> <P> Robert Arnhym, president of the Miss California Pageant, said Lans presented  them with enough evidence to show that, while Lynch had registered as a student  at Cypress College, she had not been attending classes. Pageant rules say  contestants must live or attend an accredited school in the cities of Buena  Park, La Palma, Cypress or Fullerton in order to be eligible. The winner enters  the Miss California Pageant.  </P> <P> "We do not have any information to the contrary to the information provided by  Mrs. Lans," Arnhym said.  </P> <P> "It is a tremendous disappointment to us," he said, adding that Lynch had  entered local beauty pageants before. "She has never qualified to the state  finals until this year. Unfortunately, we don't have any alternative."  </P> <P> One of the pageant contestants said that after Lynch won the crown in February,  some of the other contestants and their parents told Lans that they suspected  Lynch was not actually a student at Cypress College.  </P> <P> The Miss Buena Park Pageant is a preliminary to the Miss California and Miss  America pageants. Up until three years ago, the pageant was sponsored by the  Buena Park Chamber of Commerce. It is now a privately run, nonprofit franchise  that was started by Lans in December of 1989.  </P> <P> Lynch said Monday night that Lans was aware that she was not actually attending  classes.  </P> <P> "From day one, Merlyn was aware of every situation. She told me I could enroll  full time and later drop the classes," Lynch said tearfully.  </P> <P> She said if she had known that she wasn't eligible to be Miss Buena Park, she  would have gone to another pageant where she was eligible. Lynch said she has a  bachelor's degree from the University of California at San Diego, and that she  will begin classes at UCLA in September to get a certificate in radio and  television broadcasting.  </P> <P> "This was my dream," she said. She has competed for six years in a variety of  local pageants, taking first runner-up five times, "This was my only  opportunity to go to Miss California."  </P> <P> Because she is 26, she is not eligible next year.  </P> <P> It is not the first time that trouble has visited the Miss Buena Park pageant.  Last year several contestants threatened to take then-executive director Maria  Sorensen to court because they said they did not receive their scholarship  money.  </P> <P> Sorensen, who now resides in San Diego, said one of the contestants failed to  attend the annual Silverado Days festivities as stipulated in her contract, so  she was not entitled to the money. The other contestant, she said, did not fill  out her paper work correctly for the scholarship funds. Sorensen said the  contestants have since received their money.  </P></p>

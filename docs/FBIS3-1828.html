			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The China-appointed Preliminary Working Committee  said yesterday the Hong Kong Government's latest financing  arrangements on the Chek Lap Kok airport and its associated rail  link failed to address their concerns.    Speaking after a two-day session, Hong Kong co-convenor  Nellie Fong Wong Kut-man said they were unhappy with the size of  borrowings, since the level of $23 billion had gone beyond the  threshold of $5 billion as stated in the Memorandum of  Understanding on the airport projects. They urged the  Government to count borrowings for the airport body and the  airport railway as government debts.    Members also insisted that the land grant of the sites along  the airport railway should be included in the annual land  disposal programme, and a monitoring body to control  construction costs should be set up, Mrs. Fong said.    Although the financing package failed to address their  concerns, Mrs. Fong declined to say whether they had found the  proposal unacceptable. She said they would like to see an early  resumption of the airport experts' talks. Mrs. Fong said if the  British/Hong Kong side maintained that debts for the airport  body and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation should not be  taken as government borrowings, it would not be possible for  both sides to make any progress on the issue.    Another working committee member, Tam Yiu-chung, said they  were worried that the Government might borrow another $5 billion  on top of the $23 billion loans for airport and rail link if  they were not taken as government debts. The Hong Kong  Government has said that the $5 billion ceiling only applied to  government borrowings and should not include borrowings by the  two bodies.    The Chinese side co-convenor, Gao Shangquan, added that if  the total amount of debts exceeded $5 billion, it should then be  subject to negotiations between both sides.    A source close to the Chinese side said Beijing would like  to  see Britain make clear the size of debts which had gone beyond  the $5 billion level and then formally seek Chinese approval for  the extra borrowings.    Mr. Tam said they felt that the Government should be able to  increase its cash injection in the airport projects given its  strong fiscal reserves.    Mrs. Fong said the 58 hectares of land along the airport  railway should not be granted in one go as requested by the  British side. She said all land grants should be part of the  Land Commission's land disposal programme. Mrs. Fong gave an  assurance that China had already pledged to grant all 58  hectares along the airport railway before 1997.    Asked if the Government should revise estimates on the land  sale income along the rail link, Mrs. Fong said it was not a big  problem because all the income would go to the public funds  regardless of its source. Referring to reports about abuse of  funds in the Provisional Airport Authority, Mrs. Fong said  members felt it was necessary to form a monitoring group to  control costs as well as to ensure progress of the construction  works. She said the Airport Consultative Committee had failed  to control costs of the airport projects.</p>

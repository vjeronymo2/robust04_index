			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Investing for income - A look at a sector that can prove confusing A whole variety of funds is bubbling away within the cauldron of the UK equity income sector. But the resulting brew can be a confusing mix of flavours. The Association of Unit and Investment Funds defines UK equity income funds as providing an income at least 10 per cent higher than that on the FT-SE-A All Share index. But fewer than 40 per cent of the funds in the sector conform to this definition. At the beginning of the month, the yield on the All-Share was about 3.7 per cent, but some funds were yielding as little as 2 per cent and others more than 6 per cent. The difference was due to the varying investment aims of the trusts. Some try to give investors a high yield, others concentrate on 'total return' by providing a cocktail of income and capital growth. Yet another ingredient has been tossed into the pot recently by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator of the financial services industry. It has allowed unit trusts to charge their management expenses out of capital rather than income. By doing so, income funds can boost their yields overnight. Investors may find that the new charging structure masks a greater erosion of their capital. Optimists argue, however, that some trusts may charge their expenses to capital, maintain the same yield and use the 'extra' revenue to buy better-quality stock for more rapid capital growth. For a long time, it appeared that you could not go wrong by investing in the sector. It was the natural place for income-seekers. A look at the figures also showed that if you were after capital growth and chose to re-invest your income, you would get greater returns here than in the UK equity growth sector. According to Micropal, the average UK equity income fund delivered returns (offer to bid, with net income re-invested) of 303 per cent in the 10 years to April 1, while equity growth mustered a return of 255 per cent; the figures over five and three years are growth of 45 and 32 per cent for equity income, and 40 and 36 per cent for equity growth funds. Michael Lenhoff, strategist at Capel Cure Myers, says the outperformance is due mainly to the re-rating of shares on a high yield. Income funds select companies with a high yield - where their dividend represents a relatively high proportion of the share price. A company might be on a high yield because its prospects were not thought to be good. The shares may be re-rated, however, if the market decides the company has been undervalued or it becomes the subject of a merger or acquisition. As an economy comes out of recession, cyclical stocks - such as smaller companies or recovery stock bought for their high yield  - will give higher returns than stock of a similar, but lower-yielding, type. More consistent performance can be found in the funds in our table. It lists trusts which are in the top decile (25 per cent) in the three and five years to May 1; some also have top decile performance over 10 years. Funds without a five-year track record are excluded. The effect of re-investing income is marked. High-yielding shares are not the only way of providing an income. William Mott, fund manager of Credit Suisse Income, moved about 5 per cent of the fund into permanent interest-bearing shares, which are issued by building societies and offer a yield of between 9 and 11 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP-PERFORMING UK EQUITY INCOME UNIT TRUSTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            3 years      5 years     10 years                            net inc      net inc      net inc                           (no inc)     (no inc)     (no inc) Trust name                  Pounds       Pounds       Pounds   Yield %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Credit Suisse Income     147 (130)    168 (137)    468 (313)      4.67 Eagle Star UK Hi Inc     150 (128)    179 (138)            -      5.01 GT Income                161 (139)    167 (129)    405 (248)      4.35 Jupiter/Merlin Income    182 (159)    191 (152)            -      4.00 Lazard UK Income         142 (126)    169 (136)    462 (297)      3.74 London &amp; Manch Inc       141 (123)    159 (125)            -      5.00 Morgan Grenfell Eq Inc   157 (140)    177 (145)            -      3.04 M&amp;G Dividend             146 (128)    155 (125)    457 (307)      4.24 M&amp;G Equity Income        160 (137)    156 (121)    410 (257)      4.62 Newton Income            151 (138)    195 (164)            -      3.54 Perpetual Income         142 (127)    156 (128)    419 (290)      3.11 Prolific High Income     149 (132)    156 (126)    476 (335)      4.20 Schroder Income          149 (132)    165 (133)    445 (297)      3.55 Sun Alliance Eq Inc      144 (125)    155 (122)            -      4.45 Average                  132 (116)    144 (115)    399 (264)         -  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal.

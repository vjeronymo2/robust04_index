			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Friendly answer to budget problem  -Computing I COMPLAINED in these pages a year ago that there was no home budget computer program on the British market with the versatility of the American ones. Now there is: Quicken, one of the best American programs, has been intelligently Anglicised, no small feat, and offered for sale here. It does home and small-business accounting and portfolio management. It is easy to use, with one of the best manuals I have ever seen for any program, well-indexed and full of useful cross-references. It lacks any tendency towards American cuteness and at Pounds 50, it is not expensive. I have met budget programs which were hectoring and nannyish, insisting on the maintenance of proper standards of accountancy. In Quicken, entries can be changed or annotated after the event. Expenditure does not need to be assigned to a budget category - Quicken will sweep up the left-overs and label them 'Other'. Throughout, the program is singularly relaxed, without sacrificing efficiency or usefulness. Two big difficulties in most budgeting systems, computerised or not, are getting started, and finishing off a year. Quicken makes both easy. Getting started can be something like entering a revolving door in a crowd - all right once you've done it. I have seen budget programs that expected you to start at the beginning of a financial year. Others insist at least on starting on the first of a month. In Quicken, anything will do. I started off our current and credit card accounts from the last statements. I have an 'Asset Account' (very grand) for our National Savings certificates: that dates from when we bought them. I set up the share portfolio from last month's valuation out of laziness, but I could have gone back to the purchase of the separate shares. Finishing off a year can be worse, if your program forces you to spend a month or so hopping back and forth between this year's file and last year's file. In Quicken, you never need finish off a year at all, but just go on and on adding transactions. If that idea makes you nervous, as it does me, Quicken will copy past transactions to an archive and then delete them from your current file, once a financial year has, in effect, closed itself. Quicken offers a variety of reports and some nice graphs. The reports can start and stop with any date - you do not have to view your finances month by month. Flexibility here is precisely the feature which makes starting a budget or finishing a financial year so easy. I found the reports hard to work with at first - there was so much detail, and so much space between the lines, that it was like trying to survey a landscape through binoculars. All right, we spent Pounds 48.75 on newspapers last month, but how are we doing? Then I discovered that individual budget categories can be collapsed by pressing the minus key. 'Salary', 'interest income', and 'dividend income', for instance, can appear as one item: income. Alternatively, they can be expanded right up to a list of the separate sums received. And when a report has been reduced or expanded to the point where it becomes useful to you, the program will memorise the settings for next time. Quicken has an impressive roster of smaller virtues to support the big ones: it will print cheques, on special, rather expensive forms with sprocket-holes for use on a computer printer. It will remember standing orders and direct debits, and deal with them automatically. It can handle foreign currencies. It can use data from the popular Money Manager program. There is an excellent on-screen calculator. If a computer has extended memory, Quicken can use it. The business features of the program are meant for sole traders, such as carpenters or computer consultants, and small retail businesses, clubs or charities. It is not a complete double-entry accounting system, but it is not just domestic accounting warmed-over, either. Quicken can track VAT, draw up a balance sheet and forecast cash flow. The chapters in the manual on business uses are crisp and clear. I have only one complaint: it will not calculate the tax element in interest received net of tax. The manual describes a clumsy way to record tax credits with dividend payments, and you could use the same stratagem for interest received. But a program as good as this ought to do it automatically, for interest and dividends both. In the last year or so, Quicken has been so successful in the US that it threatens to elbow the competition off-stage altogether. I would not be at all surprised if it managed the same feat in the UK. Quicken costs Pounds 49.95 including VAT and carriage from Intuit, Manor Court, High Street, Harmondsworth, West Drayton, Middlesex UB7 0AQ; telephone 0800-585058; Fax 081-759-2077.</p>

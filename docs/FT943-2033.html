			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UK catering improvement helps Brake advance 24% Improvement in the UK catering market helped to lift pre-tax profits at Brake Bros, the frozen food distributor, which yesterday announced a 24 per cent rise from Pounds 7.14m to Pounds 8.86m for the six months to June 30. Group turnover lifted 18 per cent from Pounds 160.5m to Pounds 188.9m, including a full six months' sales from Country Choice Foods, a frozen products supplier which was purchased in May 1993. Operating profit rose 19 per cent to Pounds 9.26m (Pounds 7.78m). However, the group's performance was held back by its UK chilled food catering operation, Larderfresh, which made losses of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.1m). Brake Bros sees the venture, which was launched in August 1993, as part of its long-term strategic development. The cost of establishing food distribution activities in France increased, with operating losses standing at Pounds 1.1m (nil). The French activities are not expected to make a substantial contribution this year. Mr William Brake, chairman, said: 'while the costs of entering France are proving greater than expected, the directors are confident that action taken in getting into place a strong management structure, linked to the many improvements already introduced, will enable the board to achieve its goal of creating a business emulating that in the UK.' Underlying sales at the company's core UK frozen foods business grew 6 per cent, and are expected to perform soundly for the rest of the year. Interest charges fell from Pounds 644,000 to Pounds 392,000, thanks to reduced borrowings and lower interest rates. Gearing was reduced from 5.9 per cent at December 31 to nil, after a net cash inflow of Pounds 9.6m. Earnings per share lifted 11 per cent to 11.1p (10p) and the interim dividend increased by 15 per cent to 2.3p (2p). The shares closed up 1p at 418p yesterday.</p>

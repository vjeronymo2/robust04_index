			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> CITY MAY DELAY RIFLE SALES  </P> <P> Buyers of rifles in Santa Monica in the future could be subject to a 15-day  wait before purchasing the weapons.  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday directed the city attorney to draft an ordinance  designed to discourage the purchase of long guns. The council did not set a  deadline for the draft ordinance.  </P> <P> The council had feared that such a law would clash with state regulations that  prohibit cities from imposing waiting periods for criminal record checks. But  City Atty. Robert Myers said the ordinance would sidestep the issue. He called  the wait a "cooling-off period" that would douse potential criminal passions  but would not be used for background checks.  </P> <P> However, Myers expects court challenges to the law, if it is approved. An  optimistic Councilman David Finkel, who proposed the ordinance, said "It will  heighten the discussion throughout the land on firearms."  </P></p>

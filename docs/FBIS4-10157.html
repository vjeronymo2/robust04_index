			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified special correspondent] </F>   [Excerpt] Brussels -- Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo  Scavone told NOTICIAS yesterday that the Italian Government has  finally admitted that legal mistakes were made in a $10-million  loan to install a citrus company in La Colmena. The minister  announced that the Paraguayan Government has thus been virtually  exempted from paying the loan, which, including overdue payments  and arrears interest, reportedly stands at more than $45 million.    During Stroessner's regime, the Italian Government approved  a  loan for Rossi Inc. which was allegedly guaranteed by its  Paraguayan counterpart through fraudulent actions committed by  former roving ambassador Gustavo Gramont Berres. Following the  downfall of the dictatorship it was confirmed that the loan was  not guaranteed by the Paraguayan State or by Congress.    Scavone said: "In late March, the Italian Government  admitted  that the debt had not been legally granted to Paraguay."    This situation virtually paves the way for the Paraguayan  Government's plan to reschedule its foreign debt payments with  the Paris Club. A Paraguayan delegation will go to the French  capital tomorrow to negotiate this alternative. The French  Treasury is coordinating the Paris Club's interests. The Paris  Club comprises the seven industrial powers, including Italy.    Paraguayan Central Bank official Luis Breuer is in Paris to  begin the preliminary negotiations. The negotiations will  reportedly be concluded in the presence of Wasmosy.    Our debt with the Paris Club totals about $600 million. Our  government's basic idea is to renegotiate $300 million so as to  allocate more funds for poor segments by implementing specific  projects. [passage omitted]</p>

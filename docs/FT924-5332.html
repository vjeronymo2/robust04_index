			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Big cement groups switch from rail to roads BLUE CIRCLE and Castle Cement, two of British Rail's biggest freight customers, yesterday said they were switching nearly 500,000 tonnes of freight a year from rail to road because of BR price increases. The move will result in an extra 20,000 road journeys a year by fully laden 38-tonne articulated trucks. Other railfreight customers say they are considering similar moves. News of the shift came as Charterail, the pioneering private-sector railfreight distributor which ceased trading in August, announced that it had gone into liquidation with the loss of 120 jobs. Charterail had earlier accused BR of prompting its collapse by charging too much for use of its locomotives and tracks. The company's failure has put an estimated 10,000 truckloads of freight a year on the road. Charterail's failure and the loss of the cement business are the most significant indicators yet that the government is not prepared to intervene to stop the continuing drift of freight from rail to road. They will also heighten fears that privatisation will increase the drift because charges to railfreight users will rise as the railways are put on a more commercial footing. Castle Cement said yesterday that it was switching 210,000 tonnes of cement a year from rail to road. Mr Jonathan Dale, director of logistics, blamed BR's Trainload Freight for raising prices to uneconomic levels when the recession was bringing road transport costs down. 'To make our rail operations viable we would need a cut of 75 per cent in the freight rates on offer - that's the sort of gap that has opened up,' he said. Blue Circle said it was moving 275,000 tonnes of cement a year to road because of BR's rising prices. A further 210,000 tonnes a year was transferring to road because of changing distribution patterns, and the company was reviewing its other railfreight flows. Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturing company, said it was also reviewing its options. The Freight Transport Association said BR was losing freight to the roads because it was raising prices to cut losses in the run-up to privatisation, and that had left its freight charges uncompetitive. The transport department said there was no connection with privatisation. Some of BR's freight operations had been losing money for some time and it was a commercial decision by BR to tackle them. BR could not be contacted because part of its telecommunications network had broken down.</p>

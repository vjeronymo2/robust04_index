			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Excerpt] Beijing has deployed the air force to water  fields and seed clouds in southeast Sichuan, which is facing its  worst drought in memory.    Violent disputes have broken out in the worst-hit counties  of  Ybin, Neijiang and Zigong as peasants defend their functioning  wells against raids from neighbouring villages according to Chen  Zihua, the head of Sichuan's disaster relief office. "We  immediately sent cadres to deal with the situations," he told  Eastern Express.    The first People's Liberation Army A-326 emergency aircraft  flew into Chengdu military region airspace yesterday to begin  operations, Chen said.    More than 8 million people were short of drinking water as a  result of the freak drought, which began in early May. Convoys  of fire trucks and liquid cargo carriers began transporting  large volumes of drinking water to people in affected areas on  Tuesday, he said.    Water pumps and well drilling equipment have been sent to  areas inaccessible by vehicle or too far from available water  supplies, under an operation mounted by the provincial  agricultural producer goods bureau.    There were no reports of deaths and the situation had been  ameliorated by the measures taken, Chen said, adding that there  were no plans to move people away from affected areas, a measure  that Beijing municipal authorities were forced to take in late  March after the city had its worst drought in a century.    Sichuan authorities fear that trying to move part of the  affected population, which stands at 18.4 million people in 22  counties and cities, could be impracticable and cause further  unrest. Chen said the province's main cities of Chengdu and  Chongqing were not short of water.    Residents of Chengdu said last night that heavy rain had  fallen in the afternoon, and further showers were expected today.    The Sichuan vice-governor Zhang Zhongxin, has called for  more  help from Beijing, which has so far agreed to provide only 1.5  million renminbi (HK$1.3m [Hong Kong dollars]) in relief funds.    The provincial and local governments agreed to pool together  Rmb120m [renminbi] for their effort in two emergency meetings  held on Saturday and Tuesday, Chen said.    "The State Council only became very concerned about our  situation after we reported to them on the seriousness of the  conditions," he said.    Drought is rare in the affected parts of Sichuan, but  rainfall in the Sichuan basin during May was 80 per cent below  the average of recent years. Chen said the figure was 20 per  cent below the province's last "great drought" in 1969.  Scorching temperatures and above-average hours of sunlight have  also been blamed.    While the province's massive grain harvest has already been  gathered and sold, summer crops such as corn and rice were  expected to suffer. "The provincial economy will definitely be  affected," Chen said. [passage omitted]</p>

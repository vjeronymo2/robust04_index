			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Good Food Festival Jersey is planning a Good Food Festival from Saturday May 14 to Saturday May 21. And - I know you'll want to book now when you hear this - it is to coincide with the opening of an orang-utan enclosure at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. I haven't quite worked out why the two have been linked. Monkey business at the island's tourist office?</p>

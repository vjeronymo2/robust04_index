			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Opposition gains in Venezuela poll VENEZUELA'S opposition gained a stunning victory in Sunday's state and local elections, winning a majority of seats for governors and mayors, according to preliminary results. Voting took place peacefully, despite nervousness following a failed military uprising against the government on November 27. As usual, troops were posted at each of Venezuela's 8,000 voting centres to ensure order. The governing Democratic Action (AD) party, which calls itself 'the party of the people', was forced into a minority position in state and local polls for the first time in the country's 34-year democratic history. Despite efforts by AD leaders to distance themselves from the unpopular free-market policies of President Carlos Andres Perez, most Venezuelans rejected the party. The main opposition force, the Christian Democrat Copei party, won heavily, and two left-wing organisations, the Socialist party MAS and Causa R, a militant group, also scored important victories. The vote showed the strongest preference for left-wing candidates on record and suggested a weakening of the traditional two-party system dominated by AD and Copei. Preliminary returns in state governorship contests give opposition parties a firm 14 out of a total of 22 states, compared with four for AD. In Caracas, voters rejected the two main parties to choose a leftist as the capital's mayor, the private network Televen projected. In 1989, when the last state and local elections were held, the governing party won 11 of 20 states (two federal territories have become states since then), Copei seven and MAS and Causa R one each. There were no official figures on voter abstention, which reached 73 per cent in Caracas three years ago. Unofficially, voting authorities said they believed abstention was lower this time. Venezuelans are scheduled to elect a new president, national congress and state legislatures next December.</p>

The American roving ambassador for anti terrorism affairs  during Bush's term, Jerry Braemer, gave press statements saying  that the levelling of accusations against Libya was related to  the so-called `requirements' of the peace process in the Middle  East and the issue of Western hostages held in Lebanon.    John Murphy, a relative of one of the victims of the Pan Am  American airliner said that the families of the victims of the  plane were smelling something fishy emanating from this  turnabout in the case against Libya.</p>

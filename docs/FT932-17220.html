			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Turkey recovers after a year on the downgrade - Istanbul's equity showing Falling real interest rates, coupled with better than expected corporate results, are beginning to lay the foundations for a sustained recovery in Turkish stocks. In the first two months of 1993, after a year in the doldrums, the Instanbul stock exchange rose by 40.6 per cent in dollar terms, topping the list of emerging markets covered by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. This week, in the wake of the Bayram holiday following the Moslem month of fasting, the index resumed its upward trend, closing yesterday at 5,864.17 following a record high of 6,091 on February 24. In spite of a disappointing public response to a recent offering of state-owned shares, daily trading volume has risen from a low of TL79bn in November to TL380bn yesterday. The market's equity capitalisation reached USDollars 13bn,up from USDollars 9.5bn four months ago. Brokers say that 1992 corporate profits have been 'well ahead' of inflation. Brewers such as Turk Tuborg, the large cement concerns, and the auto and retail sectors have all seen sharp improvements in reported earnings. Investor confidence has been bolstered by the central bank's decision to slow down the devaluation of the lira, apparently in anticipation of heavy foreign debt repayments by the government. Inflation, too, the principal reason why foreign investors stayed away from the Turkish market, fell to 58 per cent in February, compared with more than 70 per cent a year earlier. The exchange is starting to feel the full impact of recent legislative reforms. The state-owned Isbank, Turkey's largest bank, has announced plans to switch part of its investment portfolio out of government securities and into equities, taking advantage of tax exemptions now being offered to institutions investing 25 per cent of their portfolios in the stock exchange. Other banks are expected to follow. Paradoxically, the banks, traditionally one of the best performing sectors, have seen profits reduced as a result of the withdrawal of tax incentives for holders of treasury paper. Akbank, Turkey's private bank, reported its first ever fall in profits after incurring an excessive 140 per cent increase in its 1992 tax charge. But perhaps the biggest fillip to equities has been the steady decline in interest rates, hitherto the main competition for savers. In Turkey, one-year paper is still considered long term. However, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister, is now bidding to extend the maturity of government debt in an effort to pull down short term rates to give a spur to investment and allow the government to restructure its own internal debt. Much will depend on the government's ability to curb its appetite for funds, traditionally the main reason for Turkey's high real interest rates. Government securities still account for around 90 per cent of capital market activities. In contrast, the exchange lists just 146 companies; a much smaller number are actively traded. Market activity will continue to be constrained without an increase in liquidity. The trend of public offerings of privately owned concerns, which might ease the liquidity problems, has all but dried up. In 1992, there were just 13 new issues, compared with 24 in 1991. In the first three months of this year, there has only been one new issue - Netas, the local subsidiary of Northern Telecom, of Canada, which came to the market earlier this month after the government sold part of its stake to the public. The Netas flotation underlines the real problems faced by a programme of widening share ownership through privatisation. The privatisation agency received applications for just a third of the 20 per cent stake on offer. When they came to be traded, Netas shares opened at a discount to the issue price. Wryly commenting on the fiasco, Mr Ustun Sanver, head of the government's privatisation agency, said he had failed to realise 'just quite how small Turkey's small investors were'. In addition, the first hints of the aggressive takeover culture familiar to more developed markets has done little to encourage the large family conglomerates to float shares.</p>

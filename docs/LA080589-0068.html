			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MACEWEN SWIMS BACK TO NATIONALS THREE YEARS AFTER HER DEBUT AT 14  </P> <P> Dante can't teach Shauna MacEwen anything about purgatory. She could write her  own book about it after waiting three long years between her first appearance  in the U. S. Senior National swim meet as a 14-year-old and her second, this  summer as a 17-year-old.  </P> <P> MacEwen's idea of the paradisio has long been a return to the national meet,  and she finally fulfilled her quest by making a national cut July 14 at the Los  Angeles Invitational with a time of 8 minutes, 54.32 seconds in the 800-meter  freestyle.  </P> <P> MacEwen, who lives in Westlake Village, swam the 800-meter freestyle in the  nationals Friday at the USC Olympic Pool and finished 14th, earning three  points for her Thousand Oaks-based Daland United Swim Team.  </P> <P> "Getting here was the big deal," MacEwen said. "Anything I did was icing on the  cake."  </P> <P> MacEwen swam an 8:57.24 and finished a strong third in her early afternoon  heat. Janet Evans won the 800 with an 8:22.11 in the evening heat, which  included the eight top-seeded swimmers entering the meet.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be top 16, so that kind of makes up for being a little off on  time," said MacEwen, whose time was a full second slower than the personal  record she set at age 14. "It's a lot of fun to be here, but it's also  stressful."  </P> <P> MacEwen had begun to wonder if she would ever again compete in the senior  nationals. When her swimming career went into limbo for three years, her  spirits did the limbo, dropping down every time she failed to make a cut.  </P> <P> "I've seen 100 girls do great at 14 and never do it again," said MacEwen, who  will be a senior at Westlake High. "That was my big fear, that I had peaked at  14.  </P> <P> "The first time I didn't make it, I cried. When I didn't make it again, I cried  but not as much. The third time I didn't cry. I'd almost gotten used to not  making it."  </P> <P> As MacEwen grew older, her perspective on swimming changed, and it affected her  performance in the pool for better and worse. Learning that there was life  outside the lane dividers helped her deal with her disappointments, but she  also lost the single-mindedness that drove her as a 14-year-old.  </P> <P> "She hasn't put in the huge amount of work we did five or six years ago," said  Ingrid Daland, MacEwen's coach. "When you're 14, you're full of enthusiasm. You  have no social life. You just do it. . . . Then she got more into the high  school scene, and all her friends are not into swimming, and it makes it really  tough."  </P> <P> MacEwen's time in swimming purgatory was lengthened by the sin of forgetting  how she had initially excelled.  </P> <P> "The summer after eighth grade was the best summer I've ever had in my life,"  MacEwen said. "I thought the world was mine. I thought I could work out when I  wanted to, do what I wanted to, and it took a few months to realize it wouldn't  work."  </P> <P> Unable to make her senior national cuts and intimidated by her initial  experience at that level, MacEwen retreated to junior national swimming. She  dominated there, winning the 400-meter freestyle in the 1986 nationals and the  200 and 800 in the 1987 meet.  </P> <P> "I'm this little 14-year-old, my first time there, and boy did it scare me,"  MacEwen said of her first senior national experience. "Right around the middle  of that three-year period where I got stuck, it was almost more comfortable to  be at junior nationals and at the top of junior nationals rather than at the  bottom of senior nationals."  </P> <P> MacEwen showed signs of breaking out of her swimming lethargy in the Southern  Section meet this year when she placed third in the 500-yard free and fifth in  the 200 free. Her top-16 finish in the nationals should catch recruiters' eyes  as she enters her senior year.  </P> <P> "Freshman year, Texas was the place I had to go," MacEwen said. "All I know now  is that when I go to college I want it to be a Division I school, and I want to  swim four years. Now that I'm on the right track after three years of going  nowhere, four years doesn't seem that much."  </P></p>

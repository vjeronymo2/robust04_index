			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Ukraine steps up 'gas war' A senior Ukrainian official denied yesterday that Ukraine had been syphoning off Russian gas meant for export to western Europe, but said this could happen if Russia carried out a threat to cut supplies today, Reuter reports from Kiev. However, the chief engineer of Russia's Gazprom said this would achieve nothing as the company would simply shut off these supplies also and Kiev would face a storm of protest from Russia's western customers. Gazprom said on Tuesday it would cut off gas to Ukraine unless Kiev took steps to pay a debt of about Rbs1,500bn. Turkmenistan, Ukraine's other gas supplier, stopped its deliveries on February 20 because of non-payment. Moldova is negotiating with Russia to stop it carrying out its threat to cut off gas supplies this week unless debts are paid, a senior Moldovan gas industry official said yesterday. Moldova owes Gazprom about Rbs53bn.</p>

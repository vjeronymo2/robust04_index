			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Observer: Rocketing Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise must be spinning in his extra-terrestrial grave; now even the mystique of outer space is to be invaded by the greatest terror known to the galaxy - the mightily-feared Ad-man. Ad-man has recently been advancing on all fronts here on planet earth, recently even managing (in the US) to sell advertising space at the bottom of the little holes down which golfing fanatics try to drop white balls. Now Ad-man is set to boldly go where no toothpaste has gone before, conquering what is perhaps the final frontier, by buying and selling advertising space on the side of Nasa rockets. The going rate, according to Advertising Age, is about Dollars 500,000 for 58 square feet on the side of a Conestoga 1620 expendable rocket, for launch probably on March 31.</p>

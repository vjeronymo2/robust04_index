			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Elf given deadline on plans for refinery The Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, yesterday gave Elf Aquitaine, the French energy group, until the end of this week to give final details about its investment plans in the delayed DM4.5bn Leuna oil refinery in eastern Germany. Two Elf directors were negotiating with a senior Treuhand official until last night, when talks were interrupted to allow experts to review legal details, a Treuhand spokesman said. 'Progress was made,' he said. 'We now have to reach a conclusion.' Elf said it wants less than 50 per cent of the project, having originally taken a 67 per cent stake. The agreement for the larger stake was struck before the French energy group was due to be privatised. Under this original plan, Elf's stake would have risen to 100 per cent after Thyssen Handelsunion, the construction arm of the German group, had handed over its share once the refinery had been built. Meanwhile, Mr Klaus Schucht, a member of the Treuhand management board, said that Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil enterprise, would take a 20 per cent stake in the showpiece refinery which it would pay for with crude oil deliveries. Mr Schucht suggested that it was acceptable to reduce refining capacity from 10m tonnes to 8.5m tonnes but he insisted that work on the project should start in April, a month after construction was to have begun. The uncertainty surrounding Elf's investment has caused the French and German governments severe embarrassment. Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand were involved in the agreement, the biggest single industrial investment project in eastern Germany. However, Elf has so far failed to find a buyer and has come under increasing pressure from the German government to keep the project.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE DEALER ACQUITTED IN U.S. FRAUD CASE  </P> <P> A California insurance dealer accused by federal prosecutors in a sweeping  nationwide health insurance fraud case has been acquitted in the first of as  many as five trials.  </P> <P> Angelo T. Commito, along with an insurance broker and a union official, was  found innocent Thursday by a federal jury of charges of embezzlement from the  union's pension fund and accepting kickbacks on insurance contracts. The jury  deliberated seven hours before reaching the verdict.  </P> <P> Commito, 43, who owns Labor Health and Benefits Plan, still faces trial in San  Francisco on fraud charges in connection with his business of supplying union  insurance coverage.  </P> <P> "The government vendetta against Angelo Commito is shown for what it is: a  bunch of rumors and gossip that cannot stand up to the test of a jury trial,"  said Deputy Federal Public Defender Harry L. Hellerstein, Commito's lawyer in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> In separate indictments in San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta and Baltimore,  Commito is accused of paying kickbacks to an undercover FBI agent.  </P></p>

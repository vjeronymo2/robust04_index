			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 10 Apr [date as received] -- Ivan Plyushch,  chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, has spoken on television.  He said, in particular:    "...The new parliament's priority is to form a government  that will assume full executive power and work to stabilize the  socioeconomic situation, elect a head of government, decide  whether he should be the head of the executive power branch (and  I adhere to the view that the prime minister should be the head  of executive power) and instruct him to form a working  government within the shortest possible period of time.    "Another priority step would be to amend the law on the  president. We need to decide what the president of Ukraine  should do, and then pass a law on the powers of local power  bodies dividing powers and functions between the central and  local executive power bodies..."    In reply to a question on Ukraine's relations with the CIS,  Plyushch said: "A summit of CIS heads of state is due to be  held soon, and Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk will go there with a  whole package of proposals on the integration of our economic  system with other countries."</p>

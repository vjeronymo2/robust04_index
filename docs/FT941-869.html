			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CU takes 'embedded values' line - Composite insurer follows the lead set by a number of its rivals Commercial Union, the largest of the UK's composite insurers, has reported substantially increased profits and shareholders' funds for 1993 under results recast using an alternative accounting approach to the statutory requirements. Under the 'embedded values' technique, its life profits rose to Pounds 280m and total shareholders' funds to Pounds 3.5bn, compared with Pounds 119m and Pounds 2.5bn respectively. CU was following the lead taken by a number of other insurers over the last few months which have begun to use techniques that they believe portray their figures more effectively. The Prudential Corporation and the life subsidiaries of BAT Industries both used an alternative technique known as 'accruals accounting'. Others, including Legal &amp; General, have adopted embedded value. Insurance law requires results to be reported using an approach which requires highly conservative reserving policies to ensure solvency. Similar requirements will be made under new legislation triggered by EU directives from the current year-end. Both embedded value and accruals accounting recognise profits as they are made, while providing discounts for future risks. Mr Robbie Graham, CU's deputy group actuary, said the group decided that embedded values reflected 'the way we seek to manage the business'. He said the reason for delay in reporting using this technique - which has been used internally for some time - was caused by the difficulties in gathering information on such a wide range of life businesses. The Association of British Insurers is currently considering ways in which reporting using the alternative methods may be standardised.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Dido and Aeneas THE strange thing about the American Mark Morris is that while his dances, moment by moment, look far from radical, they feel like nothing else. Morris is a master of pronging you between two or more different reactions at once; he seldom lets you have just one simple response. I have acclaimed his dance realisation of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in these pages before. At his British debut at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, on Tuesday, I was newly struck by the second witches' scene, in which the evil is depicted at once as something comic, pathetic and horrifying. One witch mimes taking a lover: she kisses him ardently on the lips, slits his throat and lets him fall splat to the floor. Meanwhile, the Sorceress (Morris himself) lies on the floor, at the front centre of the stage. Deftly, rapidly - it's easy to miss this - she masturbates. Alternating with these scenes are the grand tragic power of Dido - also played by Morris - and her court and Aeneas. Morris catches the doom that hangs heavy on Dido from the first, her noble, joyless despondency. Then, as soon as Morris-Dido has given herself in love and brief consummation with Aeneas, Morris-Sorceress comes tearing on to wreck everything. Dido and Sorceress are two sides of the same psyche. The side that reluctantly admits passion is succeeded by the side that destroys it. And so to Dido's final return to doom - her vehement dismissal of Aeneas and her mighty, lamenting, immolation. All this Dido is a triumph of gesture, and it is in her Lament, as Dido's voice sings 'Remember me,' that Dido rises to the heights as she mimes the same gesture to east, west, south and north in huge, despairing arcs. It is a privilege to hear again the eloquent singing of Della Jones in both roles. Gareth Jones conducts the Scottish Ensemble and Schola Cantorum with clarity and tautness. Only the murky vowels of Rebecca Evans's Belinda are a slight blot on proceedings. The entire Morris company dances with startling flair, combining butchness and delicacy, attack and flow, in characterisations both vividly depicted and yet objectively delivered. Robert Bordo's set, a half-abstract map of the Mediterranean sea, casts a beautiful aura around the stage events.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BLACKHAWKS EARN SPOT IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> The Chicago Blackhawks don't have to struggle anymore.  </P> <P> Despite a 2-7-2 record in their past 11 games, Monday night's 3-2 victory over  the Toronto Maple Leafs ensured the Blackhawks of a spot in the Stanley Cup  playoffs.  </P> <P> "We played strong defensively, and that is what we have to do to prepare for  the playoffs. That was one of our better defensive games," Coach Mike Keenan  said after Denis Savard scored two goals at Toronto.  </P> <P> With six games left, Chicago has 80 points for second place in the Norris  Division, five more than Toronto and 14 more than Minnesota and Detroit, which  are tied for fourth.  </P> <P> Either the North Stars or Red Wings can finish with the same amount of points  as Chicago, but the Blackhawks are assured of having more victories than the  Red Wings.  </P> <P> Flames 5, Blues 2 -- Brian MacLellan's power-play goal snapped a tie early in  the third period and Joe Nieuwendyk scored insurance goals 15 seconds apart at  Calgary.  </P> <P> Al MacInnis also scored for the Flames, who extended their unbeaten streak to  8-0-1. Calgary leads the Smythe Division with 92 points, nine more than  Edmonton, and trails Boston, the overall NHL leader, by a point.  </P></p>

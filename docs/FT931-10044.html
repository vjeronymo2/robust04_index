			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party deal on Maastricht threatens Major TORY REBELS and Liberal Demo-crats joined Labour yesterday in a cross-party alliance in support of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty that could overturn the government's majority. Since the Liberal Democrats and the minor parties say that they intend to vote for the Labour amendment, a full turnout of MPs would need only 11 Tory rebels to defeat the government's 21 overall majority and put ratification of the treaty in doubt. So far, the government has not been defeated on the Maastricht bill because no issue has united the full range of opposition parties with Tory Euro-sceptics. However, there is now serious concern among government business managers that the amendment might be carried. If it were, the government could be left with the humiliating task of having to negotiate on the social chapter with its 11 European partners. Until now, ministers have been adamant that the workplace rights included in the treaty's social chapter are wholly unacceptable to Britain. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister, has already warned MPs that passing the Labour amendment would wreck the treaty because the UK would be unable to ratify it. The recent confirmation by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, of his party's determination to force a vote on the issue, has raised the stakes at Westminster over the vote, although it will not take place for four to six weeks. The opposition parties believe that approving the amendment would force the UK to negotiate with other EC countries, with the prospect of British adoption of the social chapter as the outcome. Tory Euro-sceptics have, however, begun a campaign to make clear that if their colleagues support the amendment they are not voting for the social chapter. They say that it does not introduce the social chapter into the Maastricht bill, but would simply remove the protocol saying that the other 11 EC countries will implement the social chapter. In any negotiations with the other EC countries, the Euro-sceptics say, the UK would not be forced into accepting the social chapter. Sir Teddy Taylor, secretary of the European Reform Group, said yesterday: 'The amendment simply makes it more difficult for the 11 other European countries to implement the social chapter. Anything we can do to make it more difficult to go ahead with Maastricht is well worthwhile.' Another Euro-sceptic, Mr James Cran, said that he and his colleagues were determined to try to find a way to amend the Maastricht bill, but many other potential rebels are keeping a low profile. The intense pressure from the whips in the run-up to the Maastricht debate last November shook some potential rebels, and they are wary of committing themselves to revolt so far in advance. Concerted efforts by the Foreign Office and the whips will begin nearer the vote, and will be at least as tough as in the previous exercise.</p>

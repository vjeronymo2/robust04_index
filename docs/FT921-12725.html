			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: Clamour of support needed for Gatt leader's draft Sir, Martin Wolf ('The Gatt makes its last stand', January 20) is so right to call attention to the scope which now exists for concluding the Uruguay Round successfully on the basis of the very helpful draft final act put together by the Gatt director general, Arthur Dunkel. The article is very timely and in a very good cause in pointing out the significant gains made in the negotiations in many areas - agriculture, textiles, services, disputes settlement, emergency protection etc - and the great need to prevent any unravelling by industrialised countries seeking to advance national positions even further. His exaggerated claim that 'never have the fundamental principles of the Gatt been more enthusiastically embraced' is excusable under the circumstances. He should, however, have emphasised even more the significant consequences of failure and the need for greater international support of Mr Dunkel's draft. Also, there is the real danger of a collapse of the whole package by a hardening of the US position in such areas as agriculture, textiles and intellectual property rights and vis-a-vis Japan, if the negotiations are not completed before trade policy becomes an issue in the US presidential election. The greatest threat to the international trading system arises from the unreasonable and petty attitude of the US and other leading countries to Japanese economic and export success and the reluctance of the Japanese to use the fortunate position of their persistent current account surpluses to provide liberal leadership in the Uruguay Round. All who believe in market systems should be clamouring for support of Mr Dunkel's draft. But if and when it is accepted Mr Wolf should note that much would remain outstanding, especially in relation to the need for quick progress in dismantling high levels of protection against exports from developing countries, many of which are now in the forefront of import liberalisation.

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDS GET GRIFFEY, 40, TO RETIRE TO MAKE ROOM ON THEIR ROSTER  </P> <P> Ken Griffey, a prominent member of Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" in the 1970s,  retired Saturday.  </P> <P> Griffey, 40, was partially dressed in his uniform when Manager Lou Piniella  called him into his office before Saturday's game against Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Piniella said Griffey, used primarily as a pinch-hitter this season, agreed to  retire to help the club through a roster problem.  </P> <P> "I think that's accurate," Piniella said. "I talked to Ken. There were a couple  of options involved and this is the one he chose. I explained the reason to  Ken, and it was the roster spot."  </P> <P> Griffey spoke to the team briefly, then left the clubhouse. He declined to  comment.  </P> <P> The Reds needed a roster spot for Chris Hammond, who was called up from  Nashville on Saturday.  </P> <P> Griffey started five games at first base and four in left field this season. He  also pinch-hit 31 times. Overall, he batted .206 with one home run and eight  runs batted in.  </P> <P> His son, Ken Jr. of the Seattle Mariners, made the All-Star team this year.  </P> <P> Griffey spent 13 seasons in the Reds' organization. He was first called up in  1973 and played his first full major league season in 1975, when the Reds won  the first of two consecutive world titles. Griffey hit .305 in 1975 and .336  the next year.  </P></p>

A  study involved 18-23 year old men who came in November-December  from USSR's European part to work in Trans-Baykal; the sample  consisted of 135 patients divided into three groups and a  control group of 46 men. The functional activity of monocytes  was examined in an integral test with tetrazole nitro blue. The  experimental procedure is outlined. The functional activity of  monocytes among newcomers suffering from acute respiratory organ  diseases and the nonspecific antiviral cell resistance to acute  respiratory organ diseases among the newcomers are summarized.  The study demonstrated that adaptation to the conditions of  Eastern Siberia is related to changes in the functional activity  of monocytes and intracellular virusemia in monocytes and  lymphocytes but revealed no significant changes in the metabolic  and phagocytic activity of monocytes during acute pneumonia and  bronchitis whereby the degree of viral damage to monocytes  serves as the determining factor. The antiviral monocyte  resistance indicators are the most significant adaptation  criteria. Tables 2; references 10.</p>

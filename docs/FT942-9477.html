			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Scargill blocks buy-out scheme Yorkshire miners are trying to organise a union buy-out of their coalfield, in the face of strong opposition from Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, Clive Cookson writes. The buy-out initiative comes from the union branch at Maltby colliery near Rotherham. It is backed by Mr Kevin Barron, a former miner who is Labour MP for Rother Valley. The Unity Trust Bank, which is controlled by the trade union movement, told the miners that it was prepared to help finance the bid. However, Mr Scargill's refusal to have anything to do with the privatisation of British Coal has blocked the initiative so far. His hard line has infuriated more pragmatic union members who want to compete for their pits.</p>

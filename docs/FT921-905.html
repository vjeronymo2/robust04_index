			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Reckitt &amp; Colman With its 11 per cent dividend increase in a recession year, Reckitt &amp; Colman has lived up to its reputation for growth. The underlying message behind yesterday's figures, however, is that exploiting Boyle-Midway has required considerable effort. The US acquisition may be earning enough to cover its carrying cost. But a large part of the 20 per cent rise in group distribution costs represents higher marketing expenditure, and the company admits that some cost savings from the integration of Boyle-Midway have been spent on brand development. That has left the group trading margin only slightly higher, at 14.7 per cent compared with 14.3. More work on brand development effort may be needed before the benefits of Boyle-Midway really show through. Though Reckitt's household products are reasonably immune from recession, demand also tends to be hit by retailer destocking which is generally slow to reverse itself in a recovery. Together these factors suggest an unexciting 1992, though the interest charge should come down as more debt is repaid. That said, yesterday's 9 per cent fall leaves the shares on a prospective multiple just over 14. That is hardly demanding for a company that should remain capable of real growth in the long run, even in the non-inflationary 1990s. The trouble is that, if the shares are not worth selling, they are not particularly attractive as a short-term buy either.</p>

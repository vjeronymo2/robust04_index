			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpt] Northern Command commander Yitzhaq Mordekhay has  ordered a wide-ranging inquiry of the command and the IDF's  [Israel Defense Forces] liaison unit in South Lebanon into how  an IDF 155-mm shell was fired at an SLA [South Lebanese Army]  outpost in the central sector causing the death of an SLA  soldier and the wounding of two others.    Major General Mordekhay was surprised Monday [24 January]  night when he was informed by Brigadier General G., commander of  the liaison unit, that IDF guns were responsible for shelling  the SLA post and the death of the soldier. The mistaken  shelling was carried out when terrorists tried to attack the SLA  outpost in the 'Alman-al-Shumariyah area. The terrorists lobbed  mortars rounds and launched Sagger antitank missiles. In  response, the IDF and SLA returned artillery fire, foiling an  attempt to overrun the outpost.    The investigation has so far shown that the IDF fired many  shells at the outpost, and one of them apparently fell inside  the post causing the death of the soldier and the wounding of  two others.

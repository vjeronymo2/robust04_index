			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Graduates 'forced to lower pay hopes' Many recent graduates have had to lower their career and pay expectations, an Institute of Manpower Studies review said yesterday. One in seven of 1992 university graduates in England, Scotland and Wales had failed to find work. Ms Helen Connor, the review's co-author, said: 'Graduate output has almost doubled in the last five years and is forecast to grow further to 1995 and beyond.' She added that the rise had altered the labour market for graduates beyond recognition. 'Graduate unemployment is still rising and the traditional demand for graduates remains weak,' Ms Connor said. Unemployment was lower for graduates from the 'old' universities (11 per cent) than for graduates from former polytechnics and colleges which are now universities (nearly 18 per cent). The institute expects the number of graduates in 1995 to be 57 per cent higher than the 1992 total, with a rise of 68 per cent for women compared with 45 per cent for men. Women's incomes, Page 9</p>

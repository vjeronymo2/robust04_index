It had become only too obvious that Serbia had  become both arrogant and complacent. Months of a varied conduct  perpetrated against Bosnian Muslims had gone unchecked. In  fact, many were becoming quite cynical of the U.S. because of  its slow reactions to Serbian aggressions.    Malaysia was among the first group of nations that broke off  diplomatic links with Serbia. At the same time, the Malaysian  community has been providing both moral and material support for  the harassed Bosnians. Now a unit of the Malaysian armed forces  is with the UN Protection Force in Bosnia. It is, therefore,  not surprising that all factions of the Malaysian community have  voiced full support for the action taken by the Atlantic  alliance.    If anything, the feeling is that this type of retaliation  with military force should have been launched much earlier. The  Serbs have only themselves to blame if the fighting escalates.  Their horrendous ethnic-cleansing policy is nothing less than  genocide. It is totally unprecedented in modern times. A small  religious minority was singled out. The Bosnian Muslims have  had to cope with the trauma of homelessness, starvation, and  mass rape. The situation has been so bad that a special  tribunal was set up to try the war crimes. A Malaysian judge is  a member of the tribunal.    The NATO shooting of the Serbs' planes represents a new  stage  in the Bosnian crisis. It should cause the Serbs in Belgrade  and outside it to face reality. To try to force a solution  through military means is going to be counter-productive.  Everyone knows that the political situation in the former  Yugoslavia is very messy and complicated. There are various  issues to be settled. They are not unique to Yugoslavia.    Many multi-ethnic nations have been able to work out  reasonable solutions for their internal governments. Wherever  the give-and- take spirit has been prominent, a stable order has  emerged. What the Serb leaders did was to grab as much  territory as possible forcibly. They have so far only paid lip  service to negotiations. Serbian propaganda has not hesitated to  claim that the planes shot down by the NATO aircraft were  somebody else's. The world will know how much credibility to  attach to this story.    The UN troops serving under difficult conditions in Bosnia  will be greatly encouraged by the use of air power. For  thousands of Bosnian Muslims, too, this action will be a great  morale booster. Everyone hopes that the Serb leadership will  draw the obvious conclusion. No one wants to see an escalation  of the fighting. The Serbs must accept peaceful solutions for  all problems.</p>

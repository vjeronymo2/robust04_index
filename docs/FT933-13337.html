			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / People: Insurance moves Roy Hurley, 50, has parted company with AA Insurance and Financial Services, having directed its rapid expansion in the late 1980s. Jim Atkinson, who has previously held responsibilities for insurance sales, operations and service, has been appointed acting managing director of AA Insurance, while AA Financial Services will until further notice report directly to AA group md, Bob Chase. Hurley, md since 1987, left on what the company describes as 'mutually agreed terms'. AA sells more than 3m home, motor and other personal lines policies, but has recently come under pressure from 'direct insurers' such as Direct Line and Churchill.</p>

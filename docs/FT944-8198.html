			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (5): Review will reveal all - Michael Smith examines the UK industry It is just conceivable that the UK nuclear power industry could be on the brink of a glorious era in which the industry will be transferred into the private sector and than expanded significantly. But few people are betting on it. All will become clear when the government announces the conclusions of its long-awaited review into the industry in the next few months. The review could provide the framework for the industry for years, possibly decades, to come. The two main generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, are pushing hard both for privatisation and for the ability to build new power stations. But they are struggling to get their arguments accepted. It is, after all, just five years since the government was persuaded that investors would not buy nuclear power stations from the state. Ministers promptly pulled the sale of the nuclear stations from the privatisation of the rest of the power industry, imposed a moratorium on the building of new stations and promised the review which is now under way. The nuclear industry has used the time well, achieving significant increases in efficiency. Since 1989, Nuclear Electric has managed to raise its share of the electricity market in England and Wales from 16 per cent to almost 25 per cent. This sharp improvement has been largely due to its success in overcoming technical difficulties with its five advanced gas-cooled reactor stations that were built in the 1970s. From having been among the worst performing nuclear stations in the world, the AGRs are now among the best. Scottish Nuclear has also made impressive strides, achieving a 40 per cent increase in output since 1989 and 50 per cent improvement in productivity. In spite of the improved efficiency, the industry is struggling to shake off its critics' claims that it is uncompetitive. The main problem is the existence of nuclear levy, through which Pounds 1bn a year is raised from domestic power consumers in England and Wales every year for the nuclear power industry. Nuclear Electric argues that the levy is to pay from liabilities it inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, its fore-runner, but the government is less precise about its purpose. The nuclear industry's opponents say it is a subsidy. They feel they are on even firmer ground over the costs of building Sizewell C, the 2,500MW power station planned for the Suffolk, England, coast. This is planned by the nuclear industry as what it hopes will be the first in a series of new plants. N. M. Rothschild, the merchant bank advising Nuclear Electric, is working on the possibility that it may be possible to build a nuclear power station entirely with private sector finance. Rothschild has yet to make its findings public but the City of London will take some convincing. Investors were sceptical enough about Nuclear Electric's claim in June that it could produce electricity from the 2,500MW Sizewell C at 3.7p a unit. This was based on the assumptions that the station could be built for Pounds 3.5bn, its operating efficiency would be 85 per cent and that the private sector would demand an 11 per cent return on capital invested. Critics say all of these claims are highly optimistic. But assuming 3.7p is achievable, it is still considerably higher than the average price of 2.4p this year in the electricity wholesale trading pool to which the new station would have to sell its power. The pool price will rise by the early years of the next century but not necessarily to 3.7p. The gap could be bridged if the government was prepared to provide a subsidy, perhaps as much as Pounds 1m. But for Sizewell C to go ahead, the government would also have to provide guarantees against future regulatory change or decommissioning problems. It felt unable to give such undertakings in 1989, but since then the environmental arguments in favour of nuclear power have increased. There is more international pressure to cut sulphur and carbon dioxide emissions. But nuclear power's opponents in the gas and coal industries could argue that providing state aid for nuclear power, whether through direct subsidy or underwriting the industry for regulatory change, would be a clear distortion in an energy market which ministers want to be fully competitive. This will prove a telling point in the review. Even more persuasive is the government's lack of funds and the argument that the UK does not need any more power stations in an over-supplied market. The Treasury backs nuclear power privatisation both for financial and ideological reasons. The two nuclear companies have suggested an industry structure which could make privatisation possible. Under this the older Magnox stations, which have large liabilities, would remain in the public sector, leaving the advanced gas-cooled reactors and Nuclear Electric's pressurised water reactor Sizewell B, to be sold off. Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, wants more radical restructuring and has suggested that Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear swap some of their assets. This is not appealing to the generators, although they welcome his support for privatisation. For all this, political considerations make it unlikely that the government will want to plunge into a privatisation. Some Conservative politicians will argue that selling the nuclear power industry would enable the government to keep the privatisation bandwagon rolling. But most consider nuclear power far too controversial an issue to bring to the fore in the run-up to a general election. The review is therefore likely to attempt to prepare the ground for nuclear privatisation after the next general election which is scheduled for 1997 at the latest. Privatisation, while winning the general approval of the government, is probably still some years off, and if the Labour party wins the next election it may never happen.</p>

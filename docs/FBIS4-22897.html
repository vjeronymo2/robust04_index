Vavilov at Russia's  Academy of Sciences, Moscow, and Pripyat Scientific Production  Association, Chernobyl; UDC 575:582.475.4]    [Abstract] The pressure exerted by man-caused environmental  factors on natural ecosystems and the urgency of correlating the  changes in the radiation conditions in the environment and the  growth of the mutation burden in populations with their  adaptation capabilities prompted a reexamination of the  electrophoretic analysis of pine seed proteins Pinus  sylvestris L. exposed to irradiation after the Chernobyl  nuclear power plant accident in order to assess the genetic  impact of the Chernobyl accident on the pine forest, set up  radiation-environmental monitoring in the population relocation  area's reforestation plantings at the molecular level, and  ascertain the extent to which these data can be used to predict  long-term genetic consequences on the nature's other creatures  and humans. A list of enzymes with the number of their scored  gene loci and commission code number, examples of abnormal  heritability products of enzyme gene loci revealed by the  electrophoresis study, the frequencies of various types of  enzyme gene loci mutations induced by ionizing radiation in  Pinus sylvestris L. macrospores after the accident,  the genetic efficiency of radiation in the relocation area based  on Pinus sylvestris L. data, and the rate of loci  mutation which are encoding the enzyme synthesis in Pinus  sylvestris L. endosperms in the relocation area are  summarized, and the dependence of the viable seed yield and  various types of mutations on the dosage rate is plotted. The  findings confirm that the pine is a convenient test system which  makes it possible to take into account the mutations induced at  the hametic level, thus making a certain contribution to  developing forecasts of long-term genetic consequences as they  apply to other species where observation of mutations is  complicated due to biological or ethical considerations. The  authors are grateful to the Corresponding Member of the Academy  Yu.P. Altukhov for valuable remarks. Figures 2; tables 4;  references 21: 15 Russian, 6 Western.</p>

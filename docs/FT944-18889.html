			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / 1,000 advisers miss PIA deadline Some 1,000 independent financial advisers appeared yesterday to have rejected regulation by the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor. The deadline was at midnight. Latest estimates from the authority suggested that about 4,300 of the 5,300 independent advisers who used to be regulated by Fimbra had applied to join the PIA. It will not be clear until next week how many of the non-applicants have left financial services. The strict deadline for applications was imposed by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator, in June. It said that by today all those in the retail financial services industry who had not applied to the PIA should have done one of three other things. They were: apply to be regulated directly by SIB or by a recognised professional body; say they were joining a network of advisers or setting up a 'tie' with a life company; signal their intention to leave the investment business by the end of the year. An independent adviser who failed to take any of the available courses would lose authorisation. This would make it a criminal offence to continue investment business, which would mean that customers would lose regulatory protection. Anyone wanting to check the status of an adviser can contact SIB central's register (071 929-3652). PIA offices in central London, Croydon and Edinburgh were remaining open until the midnight deadline in order to receive last-minute applications. The regulator estimated it could have received as many as 700 applications in the final week. The controversy and uncertainty over the PIA's future until relatively recently may have deterred some advisers from early application.</p>

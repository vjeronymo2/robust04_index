			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes trigger market rally WIDESPREAD speculation around the markets of an imminent cut in UK interest rates, possibly after news of inflation numbers for December is announced this morning, led to a good rally in London's equity market. It was additionally helped by the streadfast response of international markets to the allied strike against Iraq. Rumours of the latest military move swept London's dealing rooms on Wednesday, causing widespread unease throughout most European markets. Dealers conceded, however, that the UK equity market, which has fallen well over 100 points in seven consecutive trading sessions in response to worries about gilts funding and the prospect of a flood of rights issues, was much happier after the immediate tension generated by the Gulf conflict had abated. The FT-SE 100 Index clawed back 13.9 at 2,759.2, while the Mid 250 Index settled 11.8 higher at 2,888.1. There was an element of slight unease in London at the outset, when dealers fought shy of hoisting UK share prices because of Wall Street's unconvincing overnight showing. A good opening by the Footsie future, however, and some persistent strong buying by domestic institutions, prompted by the UK interest rate cut hints, drove shares sharply higher. Buying of the FT-SE 100 stocks gathered momentum throughout a busy morning and lifted the index to a day's high of 2,771.3, up 26 points, by early afternoon. The optimistic mood in London was quickly undermined during the afternoon, when Wall Street began to falter after an early modest rise. The US market was showing a fall of around four points as London closed and slipped further after hours. There was concern in the market that this morning will bring the first of a series of rights issues. First National Finance, the troubled finance group, has conceded the need to raise capital, and a call of around Pounds 50m has long been forecast by the market. But other, and much bigger, cash calls are said to be in the pipeline. Questioned about the possibility of a further reduction in UK interest rates in the short term, a top trader at one of the London merchant banks said he would not dismiss the thought, pointing out that 'political pressure for such a move is growing all the time'. Official inflation numbers are due to be announced at 11.30 this morning, with the general consensus for year-on-year inflation put at 3.5 per cent, although there were suggestions among the more optimistic economic forecasters that the figure could be nearer to 3 per cent. Others, however, continued to take the view that the authorities could be planning to keep rates at current levels until the UK Budget on March 16, when a reduction could be used to alleviate criticism of what may well be a tough Budget. Around the sectors, oil shares came in for a further drubbing, with BP affected by a further series of profits downgrades, many of which emanated from US broking houses previously viewed as strongly supportive of the stock. US investors now speak for getting on for 22 per cent of BP shares. Turnover in London totalled 617.6m shares, with Ft-SE 100 shares accounting for 243m shares and non-Footsie stock accounting for 374.5m shares.</p>

Upon his return to Aden, brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas  delivered a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA, in which  he said: The sigining of the accord document for building the  Yemeni state represented a good and important step along the  road for overpassing the political, economic, and social crisis  which our country is living. We were looking during the signing  of the accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, that  this will reflect itself positively, particularly on the level  of the military situation.    But, contrary to this, we were appalled with regrettable  incidents which Abyan Governorate witnessed and which took the  lives of a number of the sons of our armed forces and which led  to the raising of the level of tension to a level not  precedented before. He added, saying: We denounce this action  which we did not expect from the brothers following the signing  of the accord document. We renew the emphasis for our absolute  refusal to be dragged into such acts. In the same time, we have  confidence in our people's capability of refusing and curbing  these acts. We emphasize in this context that there is no way  out of the situation for Yemen except through dialogue and the  commitment towards this document.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Packaging side helps GEI double A STRONG performance from its packaging machinery side helped GEI International, the Bedfordshire-based engineer, to double profits in the six months to September 30, writes Graham Deller. On turnover ahead to Pounds 38.2m (Pounds 35.7m), pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 1.03m against Pounds 511,000. Mr Michael Blackburn, chairman, said packaging machinery followed an 'outstanding' 1991 with a similar performance in the half, while processing machinery lifted profits substantially and losses in the special steels division were reduced. He warned, however, that although most of the group's operating companies performed 'relatively well' in an uncertain economic climate, trading conditions remained difficult. Earnings per share improved from 0.65p to 1.31p; the interim dividend is held at 2.47p.</p>

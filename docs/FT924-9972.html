			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: British Assets value declines Over the 12 months to September 30 net asset value at British Assets Trust, which has an international portfolio of over Pounds 500m, fell 5.1 per cent, from 94.72p to 89.85p. Earnings per share fell from 4.11p to 4.02p, reflecting a combination of falling interest rates, a lower value of dollar receipts because of the declining US exchange rate, and a decrease in dividend payments by quoted UK companies. However, the final quarterly dividend is 1.07p to make a total of 4.19p for the year, against 4.04p. Barring unforeseen circumstances, a minimum distribution of 4.28p is indicated for the current year. Investors Capital Trust, 67.5 per cent owned by British Assets, saw net asset value decline from 116.7p to 111.8p over the year. Earnings per share worked through at 4.97p (5.12p) and the dividend is lifted to 5.1p (5.05p) with a final quarterly payment of 1.275p.</p>

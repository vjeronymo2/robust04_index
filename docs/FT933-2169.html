			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Cable network makes Dollars 9.5bn competing bid for Paramount A TAKEOVER battle broke out last night over Paramount Communications, the US entertainment group, as QVC Network launched a hostile Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds 6.16bn) bid to compete with an agreed Dollars 8.2bn bid announced by cable company Viacom International nine days ago. QVC is a fast-growing home shopping cable network, headed for the past nine months by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent film industry figure who developed Fox into America's fourth national network for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. QVC is much smaller than both Paramount and Viacom but its bid has the support of its two major corporate shareholders, cable programmer Liberty Media and cable service company Comcast, which have agreed to bolster its finances for the fight by each purchasing Dollars 500m of QVC convertible preferred stock. Their support could boost the credibility of QVC's bid on Wall Street and help bolster its share price, which could come under pressure when stock markets open today and absorb the new offer. The bid was announced after the markets closed last night. At that point, QVC's shares stood at Dollars 56, down Dollars 3 1/2 , on the Nasdaq market, amid rumours of an impending announcement. That makes its offer of 0.893 QVC shares and Dollars 30 in cash worth Dollars 80 for each Paramount share. Viacom's offer of Dollars 9.10 in cash and a mix of stock is worth Dollars 63.175 a share, based on last night's closing prices, and values Paramount at Dollars 7.5bn. Paramount's shares closed at Dollars 69 5/8 , up Dollars 1 1/4 . Mr Diller said it was his long-term goal to build a multi-media company and QVC, with consistent strong growth, generating cash flow of more than Dollars 173m, little debt, and strategic partners willing to invest Dollars 1bn, was the ideal company to make an offer for Paramount. Seeking to capitalise on his Hollywood reputation, he said that a 'combination between Paramount and QVC rests on the belief that the future belongs to the people who create the best programming for each emerging form of distribution'. The new bid is likely to be bitterly fought by Paramount and Viacom, which reiterated in a statement yesterday morning that no hostile takeover would be permitted to obstruct their ' well-considered' merger agreement.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Melnik] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 23 May (TASS) -- Some politicians in Ukraine  have been blaming President Leonid Kravchuk for the situation,  which has taken shape in the Crimea. Sergey Golovaty, for one,  said during his appearance on national television on Sunday that  "the president of Ukraine has shown indecision with regard to  the leadership of the autonomous republic. We are now in a  state where Leonid Kravchuk is no longer able to do anything  because he is three years late. Any actions of his can now  exacerbate the situation even more."    Sergey Golovaty said the only way out of the situation  consists in "bringing all the latest decrees and resolutions of  the parliament and the president of the Crimea in line with  Ukraine's legislation."    Former vice-premier, Igor Yukhnovsky, stressed that "Ukraine  cannot do without the Crimea and will do everything possible to  preserve its territorial integrity." Some other parliament  members called for direct presidential rule in the Crimea.</p>

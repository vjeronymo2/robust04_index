			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Declaration released by the presidents of the Common Market </F> of the South, Mercosur, following their fifth summit in Colonia  del Sacramento, Uruguay, on 17 January]    [Text] 1. In accordance with Article 11 of the Asuncion  Treaty, the Fifth Summit of the Mercosur Council was held on 17  January 1994 in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, with the  participation of Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem,  Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy, and Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle.    2. The presidents express satisfaction over the  participation  of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the meeting.    3. They emphasize that the results of the Mercosur  negotiations are an exceptional experience in the region and  represent an important asset and the basis for the permanent  development of the integration process.    4. The presidents reaffirm the principles, objectives, and  timetables established in the Asuncion Treaty to progress in a  coordinated, balanced, and sustained manner toward the  standardization of the customs procedures which will set the  basis for the structure of the Common Market.    They reaffirm their conviction that integration can  strengthen and consolidate the democratic process in the four  countries if it strongly contributes to the promotion of  economic development and social justice.    5. Recognizing that the prosperity of their people and the  achievement of a high standards of living is their main  challenge, the presidents express special satisfaction over the  substantial increase in intra-Mercosur trade, which has risen  from $3.6 billion in 1990 -- before the signing of the Asuncion  Treaty -- to more than $8 billion in 1993.    This accelerated trade growth is the result, among other  factors, of the fulfillment of the commercial liberation program  which currently has a tariff preference of 82 percent between  the states, the gradual elimination of non-tariff barriers, and  the impulse given to commercial and productive initiatives  jointly implemented by businessmen of the four countries.    6. They express satisfaction over the technical progress on  the common external tariff. They confirm their determination to  define the common external tariff by 30 June 1994 as a vital  instrument for structuring customs tariffs, which is a  significant stage in the establishment of Mercosur.    7. They stress that the coordination of macroeconomic  policies is essential for the success of the integration process  and emphasize that the fulfillment of the timetable established  in Las Lenas [Argentina] and the implementation of the decision  by the Mrecosur Council on the common external tariff -- which  are measures and instruments for structuring Mercosur --  represents a firm commitment by the four country members.    They agree that the progress on the different priority areas  must be balanced and simultaneous.    They reaffirm the important role of the Mercosur group to  reach such objectives and resolve issues of priority interest  for the four countries and recognize the need to coordinate more  frequent meetings of the group.    8. The presidents highlight the importance of the special  meeting to be held this year to establish the institutional  structure of Mercosur which will in turn draw up the permanent  institutions that will become operational on 1 January 1995.    They note the importance of granting legal status to  Mercosur  as of 1 January 1995 to strengthen the permanence of the  association established between the country members.    9. The presidents recognize the importance of physical  integration for the complete implementation of Mercosur and  reiterate their support for the many works of infrastructure  that are being projected or implemented, particularly bridges,  roads, river interconnections, and waterways. The presidents  express their willingness to enhance these projects.    10. The presidents recognize that the integration process  does not mean progress in the economic field alone and emphasize  the achievements of the specialized meeting of the education  ministers, particularly the commitment to sign an agreement to  recognize certificates, titles, and primary and secondary  non-technical studies before 30 June.    They express satisfaction over the results of the  specialized  meetings on science, technology, and the environment.    11. The presidents stress the progress made in terms of  enhancing employment, migration, workers' protection, and the  process of harmonizing the labor legislations of member  countries.    12. Within the context of Latin American integration, the  presidents recognize the importance of strengthening the Latin  American Integration Association and emphasize the need to  maintain the integrity of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty which paved  the way for a important number of achievements.    The presidents stress that the protocol interpreting Article  44 of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty -- which will be formalized at  the Eighth Ministers Council -- is an important instrument that  guarantees the integrity and juridical security of the treaty in  face of integration processes involving member countries and  developed countries from outside the region.    To further promote the trade that Mercosur member countries  maintain with other South American countries, they will  negotiate with their regional partners, as of this year, new  agreements to ensure continuity and expansion of their economic  relations and to increase the liberalization of trade.    13. The presidents stress that the integration momentum of  the past few years has facilitated the creation of new  subregional structures that need to be contemplated in order to  promote their gradual convergence and to achieve better trade  relations of Mercosur members with other brotherly countries.    Within this context, the presidents studied the Brazilian  Government proposal that was submitted at the Rio Group meeting  in Santiago de Chile to form a South American free trade area.  The presidents proposed convening a conference during 1994 to  define the mechanisms and instruments needed to conform such an  area.    14. The presidents reiterate their satisfaction over the  desire of the Bolivian Government to strengthen and enlarge its  links with Mercosur.    They believe it is necessary to meet the request of the  Bolivian Government and invite its representatives to attend  meetings of the subgroups as observers.    Priority will be given to an agreement to be signed with  Bolivia in accordance with the proposal mentioned in Paragraph  13.    15. The presidents express satisfaction over the enforcement  of NAFTA and hope that this agreement will effectively  contribute to create new trade and investment in the hemisphere,  considering the need to encourage the talks that started within  the "four plus one" agreement.    16. Evaluating the international economic situation, the  presidents endorse the recent conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  the GATT which reinforced the multilateral trade system and the  creation of the World Trade Organization to implement the  agreements reached. They express satisfaction over the  coordination of actions between Mercosur countries and highlight  the need to strengthen this in the immediate future to help  eliminate the distortions and protectionist barriers affecting  world trade.    17. The presidents express satisfaction with the important  progress in the cooperation with the EC, especially through the  CEFIR [expansion unknown] and developments within the framework  of the inter-institutional agreement with the European  communities, specifically on issues related to customs,  technical regulations, agriculture, and support for the Mercosur  Administrative Secretariat and Special Funds.    They emphasize the results obtained since the launch of the  first six-month program of the non-reimbursable technical  cooperation agreement signed with the Inter-American Development  Bank, and the importance of continuing to cooperate with that  organization.    18. They express interest in the activities to support the  progress of regional integration within the framework of the  United Nations Development Program and suggest that all  developing countries that are members of the system should  benefit from the different mechanism of cooperation.</p>

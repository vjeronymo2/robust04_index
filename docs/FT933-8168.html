			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Robert Bass-led group in Dollars 1.1bn foods buy-out AN investor group led by Texas billionaire Mr Robert Bass yesterday said it had completed the acquisition of eight food companies from Beledia NV of the Netherlands for about Dollars 1.1bn, in the first big leveraged buy-out since 1992. The acquisition partners include Keystone Inc (formerly the Robert M. Bass Group), Keystone's affiliate Acadia Partners, UBS Capital, Haas Wheat &amp; Partners, Acadia Partner, and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. They have formed a corporation, called Specialty Foods, which plans to build the businesses into an even bigger food company. Senior financing for the deal was provided by a group of banks led by Chemical Bank. Specialty Foods said further growth would come from extending product lines, improving market penetration and making other strategic acquisitions. Artal Belgium, an affiliate of the seller, will be a substantial equity investor in Specialty Foods. The investor group said it was attracted by the market positions of the food companies and their products. The eight companies, with annual revenues of Dollars 2.1bn, are Stella Foods of Green Bay, Wisconsin; Metz Baking Company of Sioux City, Iowa; Pacific Coast Baking Company and Mother's Cake &amp; Cookie Company of Oakland, California; Burns &amp; Ricker of Paterson, New Jersey; B&amp;G/DSD of Roseland, New Jersey; H&amp;M Food Systems Company of Forth Worth, Texas; and Gordon's Wholesale of Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

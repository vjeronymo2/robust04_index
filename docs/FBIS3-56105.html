			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Indira Dunayeva, Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" </F> column: "Factional Arithmetic in the Duma. PRES (Party of  Russian Unity and Accord) Has Consolidated Its Ranks and  Russia's Choice Has Not Split"]    [Text] Yesterday, which was declared a break in the work  of the State Duma, was in fact fairly strained as partisan and  independent deputies were hastily organizing parliamentary  factions. Yesterday the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]  faction was joined by a financial and industrial group of  independent deputies of approximately 20 people. All in all, as  of yesterday the faction numbered some 40 deputies.  Interestingly, this is the first coalition created by  independent and partisan deputies. Independent deputies, mainly  including entrepreneurs and bankers who have joined the PRES,  will constitute a section within the framework of this faction  and their representative will become part of the faction's  leadership. Addressing yesterday's press conference, PRES  leader Sergey Shakhray stated that the faction is conducting  talks with deputies from republics and autonomies. In his  opinion, however, the "process of factional growth will not be  explosive." Shakhray said that the faction is nominating his  candidacy for the post of chairman of the State Duma. "Wherever  I am, I shall be working on regional policy," Sergey Shakhray  stated in concluding his press conference.    Yesterday Liberal Democratic Party deputy Aleksandr  Vengerovskiy told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that apart  from the party list six people have affiliated with the faction.  The faction is headed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, of course, and  its cochairmen are Aleksandr Vengerovskiy and Sergey  Zhibrovskiy. The Liberal Democrats have the largest number of  those wishing to work in the committee on education, science,  and culture and also in the committee on organizing the Duma's  work. In addition to cochairmen, the Liberal Democratic Party's  faction council includes leaders of intrafactional groups  (lawyers, economists, youth, and women).    Sergey Baburin yesterday tried to create a deputies group  called Russian Way that, however, has not as yet gathered the  requisite minimum of 35 members. The group includes Anatoliy  Lukyanov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, Vladimir Tikhonov, and Yuriy  Vlasov (it was decided to nominate the latter to the post of  speaker of the State Duma).    Yesterday the emerging factions of deputies groups were  counting their real and hypothetical votes and discussing rumors  as to who will be elected chairman of the State Duma, his  deputies, committee chairmen and their deputies. Furthermore,  they discussed the principle to be used in filling these still  vacant posts.    In the lobby of the Duma assembly hall, in cozy leather  armchairs the deputies of the emerging Russian Way group held a  meeting -- Anatoliy Lukyanov, Sergey Baburin, Yuriy Vlasov,  Vladimir Tikhonov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and others. Mr. Lukyanov  briefed them on the progress in factional bargaining. Thus,  according to some reports, a large coalition is nominating  Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin as speaker and Alevtina  Fedulova from Women of Russia and Vladimir Medvedev from the  "independents" as his deputies.    Incidentally, the latter are divided into several groups:  the above mentioned Russian Way with an ideology of  traditionalism, according to Sergey Baburin; and yet another  group, fairly close to Russia's Choice, which will possibly be  headed by Irina Khakamada, general secretary of the Economic  Freedom Party. The creation of this group, however, has been  postponed for the time being. On the other hand, the group  headed by oil businessman Vladimir Medvedev has attracted  deputies from the republics and autonomies led by A. Dzasokhov,  and it will apparently try to register today.    As for the reports about a split within Russia's Choice,  according to a source within this faction, the bloc's leadership  has so far not accepted the idea of splitting into two groups as  a way of removing the internal tension and ensuring freedom of  maneuver for itself.    Yesterday at 1600 a meeting began between leaders of the  Duma  factions. Its agenda was as follows: procedure for conducting  sessions prior to the election of speaker; provisions on the  temporary rules of procedures; sequence of questions slated for  discussion at Duma sessions; and the formation of the leadership  of the lower chamber. According to some reports, the election  of the entire Duma leadership is to be carried out  simultaneously -- in a package. The formation of the package  will be based of how many conventional points particular  factions have gathered. These are calculated on the basis of  simple arithmetic: Each post is assigned a certain number of  points and then the aggregate number of elected deputies is  divided by their sum total, which gives the number of deputy  mandates per point (for instance, seven and a half mandates).  Next a discussion is held as to what exactly each faction can  get for its points. This method, however, is not known in  detail yet, although it is already raising objections from those  factions that are not among its authors.    The beginning of yesterday's consultations was marked by a  scandal when the Liberal Democratic Party leader voiced  suspicions with respect to his negotiating partners. It was  decided that today the elders will take turns conducting the  session and that elections of the speaker will also begin today.</p>

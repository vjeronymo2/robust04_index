			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (13): Benefits of a digital network - George Black spotlights areas of growth in Europe The emergence of a Pan-European digital telephone network could give a big boost to the development of mobile computing in the next few years. This is predicted by Mr Jeff Goldberg, industry analyst at market research company Dataquest. GSM, or Groupe Speciale Mobile, is the digital network which is beginning to replace the established analogue telephone networks across Europe. Mr Goldberg sees GSM as a major strategic advantage for Europe which will make it much easier and cheaper to provide network data services to mobile computer users. By 1996, GSM modems which enable telephones to be easily used in any European country will stimulate a boom in mobile computers of all kinds, he says. The main area of growth will probably be a new generation of devices which combine the features of the current personal organisers or personal digital assistants (PDAs) with those of the cellular phone. Much will depend on how European governments react to the opportunity. The UK is well placed to derive substantial commercial advantages because of its relatively free telecommunications environment. Most other European countries have yet to decide whether to follow the UK into total deregulation or to use state power to subsidise the building of the necessary communications infrastructure. The prospects for mobile computer vendors in the second half of the 1990s, whether selling notebooks, subnotebooks, laptops, palmtops, organisers or PDAs, look excellent. Organisers and PDAs, though generating a lot of public interest, are still a very small market sector. Only around 400,000 were sold across Europe in 1993, compared with about 1.6m notebook computers, which cost roughly 10 times as much. But the spread of GSM could turn organisers into a much more significant market. The UK has a good start in this field. Its 34 per cent of the European market for organisers represents by far the largest share. This is largely attributable to the strength of Psion in its domestic market and the fact that the British are traditionally keen on gadgets of all kinds. But whether Psion will be able to capitalise on this success across Europe is uncertain. The German and French markets are dominated by Sharp, though it has lost market share to Psion recently. Meanwhile competition is rapidly intensifying. General Magic, the US developer spun off from Apple, has just launched its Magic Cap system. This is described as graphical user interface software which can provide the basis for a range of palmtop or personal organiser applications, using wired or wireless messaging facilities. Shareholders in General Magic include Apple, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Philips, Sony and Matsushita. Another serious threat to Psion's position will come from Compaq and Microsoft, which are collaborating to launch a multi-function pen-based device, presently known as Winpad. This will take the leading notebook vendor and the leading personal computer software company together into a new and potentially very lucrative field. Compaq has been the leader in notebook computers in most European countries in the past year. The market is much more uniform across Europe than that for organisers, enabling Compaq to benefit from a strong marketing campaign, improved technology and lower prices. It has leapt ahead of its main rival, Toshiba, across Europe to take around 20 per cent of the market compared to Toshiba's 14 per cent. The German market has been enlarged by the entry of retail chains, such as Vobis and Escom, selling their own low-priced machines. According to Mr Stephan Heinrich, product marketing manager for leading international distributor Computer 2000, until a year ago only large companies in Germany bought notebooks, mainly for their sales forces. Now the market is beginning to spread to private users, he says. For this reason Compaq has recently followed the retailers in advertising its notebooks on German television. The French notebook market grew by 30 per cent last year, according to Mr Maurice Brakha, managing director, France, fordistributor Merisel, compared to 12 per cent for the personal computer business as a whole. Mr Brakha says that sales were boosted by new models with larger memories, better graphics and longer-lasting batteries. 'Mobile users need these things because for them these are tools, not toys,' he explains. Italy is the exception to the rule. Olivetti, Europe's only major indigenous notebook manufacturer, remains dominant there because of the word-of-mouth market, which is not susceptible to the marketing techniques of other European countries. The UK, France and Germany may therefore prove easier nuts to crack for mobile computer vendors. 1994 is likely to see a rather more marked shift of purchases from desktop machines to portables across Europe. The UK will probably be the best immediate prospect for vendors of both notebooks and organisers, as France and Germany are set to remain locked in recession for at least the next few months. Next year and 1996 should see more rapid growth. The biggest opportunity is in Germany, but the market for organisers remains very small. Most Germans remain very critical of these machines. Apple's Newton had some poor reviews in Germany, in which it was dismissed as a toy. Sales of organisers in France have also been slow so far. The Apple Newton has not yet reached the French shops, but it may do better in France than Germany, as Apple's desktop and notebook machines have proved very popular there and the French have shown great enthusiasm for graphical user interfaces. If the Germans and the French can be persuaded to buy organisers, Sharp looks the most likely winner, with Apple benefiting from its success. Sharp's own organiser incorporates some Apple technology and it manufactures the Newton for Apple. Sharp also has joint ventures with several other technology developers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Lu Ping's Speech Stands to Reason"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, made a splendid  speech at a luncheon jointly held by five major chamber of  commerce organizations in Hong Kong. The speech elicited  enthusiastic applause.    The subject Lu Ping dealt with was familiar to every Hong  Kong resident: The implementation of the principle of "one  country, two systems." Lu covered the background against which  the principle was formed, the Chinese Government's determination  to maintain the principle, the close relations characterized by  coexistence in harmony and supplementing each other between Hong  Kong and the mainland, and the central government's policy of  allowing Hong Kong people to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and  to administer Hong Kong, ending his speech with "all of you  present here today will be given the chance to further Fat Choy  [make money]." Lu's speech stands to reason, engenders a  feeling of freshness, and is cordial and touching. We would  like to suggest to people in all walks of life that they should  carefully read the speech.    In his speech, Lu analyzed the value of Hong Kong to China  from the high plane of the principle of "one country, two  systems." He stressed: "The value of Hong Kong to China has  been, and will be, its economic value. Hong Kong has always  been an economic city, never a political city." "It is  precisely on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value that China  formulates its present policy towards Hong Kong." "In the whole  course of building socialism, Hong Kong will continue to play  its important role as a bridge between China and the Western  world." Lu made a practical assessment of Hong Kong's role, an  assessment which conforms with the interests and aspirations of  the six million Hong Kong people. Every Hong Kong resident hopes  that Hong Kong will always be a prosperous and stable economic  city and does not want to see Hong Kong change into a site where  various political forces wrestle with one another.    Just as Lu Ping pointed out, some people do wishfully plan  to  turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to influence the  mainland in the sense of politics.    In response to Lu's speech, Chris Patten said: "I do not  believe that Hong Kong can only be taken as a economic  laboratory," "it is a society full of various types of political  ambitions." What he meant was quite clear. The British side  does hope that Hong Kong will become a "political city." In  July last year British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said:  China must acknowledge Hong Kong's "political reality." Hong  Kong "is continuing to evolve." "It is now a political city as  well as an international city."    These are not only their "words" but also their "deeds."  Since he came to Hong Kong, Patten has not been interested in  Hong Kong's economic development or the people's livelihood;  instead, he devoted all his energy to challenging China and  pursuing his "three violations" constitutional reform package in  order to, in Hurd's words, change Hong Kong into a "political  city" and "to establish a long-term political electoral system  before 1997."    In its recent report, the British Parliament Foreign Affairs  Committee summarized Britain's duties to Hong Kong as follows:  "Our duties will include setting up a legislative structure and  safeguarding Hong Kong's freedom through improving the  regulations on guaranteeing human rights." The committee also  claimed that it will urge the government to see to it that the  international community will continue its support for  safeguarding Hong Kong's human rights and rule of law."    It is clear that Britain is taking political action  characterized by "grasping two links at the same time," namely,  keeping tabs on both the political system and human rights.  While trying to set up a set of organizations which can  manipulate the political situation through "taking independent  action," they are planning to protect those elements who are  hostile to China and ready to create trouble or even turmoil by  setting up a human rights committee and working out or amending  several so-called laws and ordinances safeguarding human rights.  Patten is probably planning to turn Hong Kong into a "political  laboratory," which can influence and change the mainland in the  sense of politics. The British side has kept saying it will put  into effect the principle of "one country, two systems," but  they only pay lip service and actually undermine the principle  instead.    When we say there will be no change in the principle of "one  country, two systems," there are actually two aspects: The  capitalist system of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will remain  unchanged, but the socialist system of the main body of the  country will also not change, Deng Xiaoping once said. Only  when the socialism on the mainland prospers, can Hong Kong play  its role as a bridge between China and the Western world and  maintain its long- term prosperity and stability. Of course,  with Hong Kong playing the role as a bridge, the mainland will  do a better job in socialist modernizations. Therefore, nobody  is allowed to change the capitalist system practiced in Hong  Kong or the socialist system practiced on the mainland. We must  especially watch out for those who try to change Hong Kong into  a base hostile to the mainland under the pretext of "expanding  democracy."    The Chinese Government has made great efforts to maintain  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. In his speech, Lu cited  many examples. Back in 1967, when the Cultural Revolution was  still in progress, it was Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very  last minute stopped the "Gang of Four" from sending troops to  Hong Kong. It has been, and still is, the People's Liberation  Army, under the strict orders of the central government, who  have been guarding the Hong Kong borders. In the transitional  period, the Chinese Government has handled major Hong Kong  issues in the interest of Hong Kong people. State leaders have  repeatedly warned that no departments shall deal with Hong Kong  as they did with Shanghai; that no departments, provinces, or  municipalities are allowed to interfere in the internal affairs  of the Hong Kong SAR; and that Hong Kong people must be allowed  to administer Hong Kong and be given a high degree of autonomy  as stipulated, and so on. Hong Kong people should have full  confidence in Hong Kong's and their own future and also support  socialism on the mainland by building up a better Hong Kong so  that under the PRC flag the two systems will stand side by side  for a long time and the two places, Hong Kong and the mainland,  will enjoy long-term prosperity.</p>

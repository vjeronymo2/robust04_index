			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A provider organization recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues that may be resolved at settlement include citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a deficiency; severity and scope of the deficiency; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy imposed; exclusion of the deficiency as the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased sanctions in the future; and exclusion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency or deficiencies cited on the HCFA Form-2567 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis for further enforcement action by any other agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or office of the Department of Health and Human Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HHS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not accept the suggestion to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the regulation specific deficiency related issues that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be discussed at settlement. Providers have many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities to discuss and resolve the deficiency-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues raised by the commenter before the settlement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty would occur. Providers have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to question survey findings during the survey,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the exit conference, while awaiting receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official deficiency statement, upon receipt of same, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through ongoing dialogue with the State and HCFA regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices. Also, all States must have a dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process as required by &sect;488.331 of this rule to enable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers to discuss perceived discrepancies in the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. While the existence of a deficiency may arise at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement discussions, it is unnecessary to mention it or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other of the above issues which are predicated on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of deficiencies and which may arise. Moreover, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no authority, as the commenter suggests, to exclude a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency in the present but increase the enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action if it is repeated in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.450&blank;Continuation of Payments to a Facility With Deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virtually everyone who commented vehemently disagrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this proposed section. Consumer groups oppose this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section because, they believe, it forces HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to terminate a facility's provider agreement rather than to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose alternative remedies. State organizations disagree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the provision that the State must agree to repay FFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Medicaid facilities rather than the facility agreeing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay (as stipulated for Medicare). Providers argue that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule is too strict, because repayment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal funding would begin the day that the State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency identifies deficiencies rather than when HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State imposes remedies when facilities do not correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies. Providers also believe that asking for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement to repay Federal funds for deficiencies at low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope and severity levels is harsh.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters believed that proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.232, as redesignated at &sect;488.450, will force States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to impose termination instead of alternative remedies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all instances of noncompliance in NFs. They based their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> belief on the provision that says that, when the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency prefers an alternative remedy in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, the State must agree to repay FFP. If the NF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fails to correct the deficiencies during the correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, the State would be liable. These commenters said,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that because many States have no intention of entering into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an agreement to repay FFP, the State must start termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that if the provision remains as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prerequisite to the use of alternative remedies, reliance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination procedures will continue. In the commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view, the end result will be more litigation, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers will be placed in the unenviable position of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having to respond to potential decertification for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively minor infractions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters criticized HCFA's proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it denies the intent of OBRA to make available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States a range of remedies to be used as alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination for deficiencies of lesser severity and places  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFs in the undesirable position of having to respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decertification actions for relatively minor violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are aware of the difficulties posed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the repayment provisions of sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act. As almost all commenters noted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements constitute a significant disincentive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose alternative remedies because the Act requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the facility (under Medicare) or the State (under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid) repay the Federal government should the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail to correct identified deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note, however, that sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act specify the rules that must apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to SNFs and NFs when the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> course chosen to respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the violation of certification requirements is through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies. We reach this conclusion because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the literal language of both of the provisions of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which specifies that these remediation provisions apply when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State survey agency determines that it would be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to employ alternative means to assure compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than to seek a provider agreement termination. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters are quite right that when an alternative remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only is being sought, the repayment provisions of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for SNFs and NFs are inescapable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

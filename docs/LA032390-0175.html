			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKER BLAMES APARTHEID FOR POVERTY IN S. AFRICA  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III toured this sprawling black township  today and blamed apartheid for its poverty.  </P> <P> Baker said the contrast between Soweto and the wealth of South Africa's whites  in nearby Johannesburg is "quite distressing and that's why I said the system  of apartheid should be abolished as soon as possible."  </P> <P> The visit came one day after he said the white-run government was committed to  ending the system of racial separation.  </P> <P> Baker met with Walter Sisulu at the African National Congress leaders' home in  a neighborhood of small brick houses, visited community centers, a day-care  center and drove past a squatters' camp erected on an old golf course.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Baker met with South African President Frederik W. de Klerk. A  senior U.S. official said Baker told him that "what he had done so far was  courageous in light of the obvious political pressures and restraints he is  subject to."  </P> <P> In February, De Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC and released black  nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela from jail after 27 years.  </P> <P> Moments before Baker arrived at Sisulu's home today, children, perched on a  jungle gym, shouted ANC slogans and sang songs honoring Mandela. Baker didn't  see or hear the children.  </P> <P> Sisulu said: "I told the secretary of state we are very grateful to the people  of America for the support they gave us over the years and that we are hopeful  but we are only making a beginning and we will expect more support as the day  goes by.  </P> <P> "We have particularly mentioned to the secretary . . . lack of facilities for  proper education, which we consider can be very harmful," he said.  </P> <P> "We have also mentioned . . . the lack of accommodation which is also dynamite  for violence," Sisulu added.  </P> <P> More than 2 million people live in Soweto but by far the worst conditions are  in its growing squatter camps such as Mshenguville, which have virtually no  utilities or drainage. Rows of mobile toilets, inscribed with "Easy Loo Toilet  Hire," line the garbage-strewn dust tracks between shack dwellings.  </P> <P> Opposite the Sisulu home where the meeting took place, 3- and 4-year-old  children in a preschool center shook clenched fists in the air and shouted  "Power, Power" and "ANC, ANC."  </P> <P> Baker, not by nature a spontaneous man, watched some children jumping on a  trampoline and shook the hands of two infants before being whisked to his next  appointment.  </P> <P> Baker was flying to Kinshasa, Zaire, for meetings with President Mobutu Sese  Seko and Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi.  </P> <P> Sisulu's organization publicly opposed Baker's meeting with De Klerk but the  subject wasn't mentioned today until reporters questioned Sisulu, who appeared  to put the issue behind him.  </P> <P> "The United States realizes no fundamental change has been made but that some  encouragement should be made. We've had that," Sisulu said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BUSY MET;  </P> <P> TEUFEL DOES A LOT OF HITTING DURING AN 8-3 VICTORY OVER REDS  </P> <P> Tim Teufel, who had four hits in four at-bats to help the Mets rout the  Cincinnati Reds, 8-3, Saturday in New York, batted only .500 during a brawl in  the eighth inning.  </P> <P> With the Mets holding a 7-0 lead, controversial reliever Rob Dibble, hit Teufel  in the back. Teufel charged the mound and landed a punch that cut the pitcher's  lip but missed with another swing.  </P> <P> Both benches emptied. After order was restored, Teufel charged out for more,  and the benches emptied again. This time it was mostly wrestling. Dibble,  Teufel, the Mets' Juan Samuel and the Reds' Norm Charlton were ejected.  </P> <P> After the game, Charlton telephoned the Mets' clubhouse, asking for Samuel.  Darryl Strawberry, who hit a two-run homer, answered the phone and invited  Charlton to the clubhouse. Charlton, Tom Browning and Danny Jackson started to  go but were restrained by five security guards.  </P> <P> Dibble has been in trouble before. He was fined for hitting the Dodgers' Willie  Randolph and for throwing a bat against the backstop.  </P> <P> Red Manager Pete Rose blamed Teufel for the brawl. "Nothing happened until  Teufel charged the mound. Dibble wasn't kicked out for throwing at the batter."  </P> <P> Rose was also upset because the Mets were stealing bases late in the game with  a big lead.  </P> <P> "That's just rubbing it in," Rose said. "(Met Manager) Davey Johnson and I are  from the same school. If you're stealing at that point, you should expect to be  knocked down.  </P> <P> "I just want the opportunity to do it back, but we only get one more crack at  the Mets. I've never rubbed it in, but maybe it's the trend. The Pirates did  it, and the Dodgers, too."  </P> <P> Johnson defended the base-stealing. "I don't believe in letting up," he said.  "Six or seven runs isn't that much with their offense."  </P> <P> The other Johnson, Howard, whom the Mets tried to trade all spring, had three  hits, stole two bases and drove in two runs.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first day of the Croat-Bosniak negotiations on  the implementation of the Washington agreement ended this  evening in the American Embassy in Vienna. Tihomir Vinkovic  reports:    [Vinkovic] We discussed all open issues, Croatian Foreign  Minister Granic said, and added that the talks will be resumed  tomorrow at 1000 [0800 GMT] I believe that we will successfully  complete the negotiations tomorrow evening or on Monday morning  [9 May] at the latest, Minister Granic said.    Asked if the Muslims persisted in their demand that both the  president of the federation and the prime minister be Muslim,  Kresimir Zubak, the Croat representative from  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said: Yes, but they also have some new  ideas.    It has been learned that no names were discussed today, only  the principles of the Washington agreement, that is, which post  will be held by the representative of which nation.    After the talks, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic briefly said that the talks were constructive and held  in a good atmosphere.    We might find out tomorrow whether these statements hide  optimism or just the usual diplomatic vocabulary.</p>

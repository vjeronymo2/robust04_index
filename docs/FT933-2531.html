			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Polish Elections: Russian troops depart as Poland buries Sikorski THE last Russian soldiers on Polish soil are due to leave this morning, a day before Poles chose a new parliament in the country's fourth national election since the communists relinquished power in 1989. In a ceremony at his official residence in Warsaw's Belweder Palace yesterday, President Lech Walesa bade farewell to representatives of the Russian contingent which had, at its peak, numbered 64,000. Poland will thus be free this weekend of foreign troops for the first time since 1939. Hours before the ceremony, on the 54th anniversary of the Red Army's invasion of Poland, Mr Walesa attended the funeral in Krakow of General Wladyslaw Sikorski, the country's wartime leader. Gen Sikorski was killed, in exile, in an aircraft crash in Gibraltar in 1943 and buried in Newark in the UK. It was his last wish to be buried in a Poland free of foreign domination. The day, replete with symbolism, was marred by the cancellation of a visit on health grounds by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister. His decision followed warnings in the Russian parliament that President Boris Yeltsin's recent statement removing Russian objections to Polish Nato membership was premature. Poland has used Mr Yeltsin's statement to press Nato for a declaration of intent on future Polish, Czech, Slovak and Hungarian membership. A survey carried yesterday in the Super Express newspaper in violation of a ban on publication of poll results 12 days before the election, predicts the farmers' PSL party will top tomorrow's ballot with a 20 per cent share. The poll puts the former communist SLD movement in second place with a 16 per cent share, leaving the Solidarity-based UD party in third place, with 13.5 per cent of the ballot. The poll suggests that only six parties will enter parliament while the free market KLD group, which has held posts such as the privatisation ministry will fail to reach the 5 per cent of the ballot limit needed to enter parliament.</p>

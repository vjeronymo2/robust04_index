			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W busy Preliminary profits at the very top end of market estimates saw Cable &amp; Wireless shares outperform the rest of the market and the telecoms sector to close a net 2 higher at 450p. Earlier the shares had risen to 457p. Profits up 18 per cent at Pounds 1.09bn, against Pounds 918m, compared with a consensus forecast of around Pounds 1.05bn. 'These were good profits numbers,' said one analyst, 'but there was some disappointment in the market with the dividend.' The dividend total was increased by 11 per cent to 8.25p; best estimates in the market ranged up to 15 per cent. Turnover in C &amp; W came out at a healthy 9.2m shares, the highest single day's business in the stock since March. The announcement by Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel of its well-signposted rights issue left the shares trailing 7 at 348p. However, doubts about the financial position of the group remain and one analyst pointed out that the rights issue and the the new financing from the group's creditor banks was still short of the Pounds 1.6bn Eurotunnel had said it needed. The electricity companies raced ahead in the wake of recent strong buy notes from leading brokers, notably Kleinwort Benson. The broker said the recs offer outstanding value, with huge potential upside from the National Grid, plus the potential for share buy backs and takeover moves after the expiry of the golden shares in March 1995. London Electricity jumped 18 to 573p, and Manweb and Midland 10 apiece to to 706p and 614p. Enterprise Oil shares suffered badly from the latest shots fired by Lasmo as part of its defence against the all-paper takeover bid. Sniping about Enterprise's accounting policies unsettled Enterprise shares which dived 9 to 401p. They have retreated from 451p since Enterprise announced it was considering making a takeover bid. Burmah Castrol dipped 9 to 862p as one of the market's optimistic broking houses was said to have trimmed its numbers for the company following the presentations to analysts on Wednesday afternoon. 'The presentation was splendid but obviously someone had overdone their estimates,' said one oil sector specialist. Shell slipped 1 1/2 to 710 1/2 p with analysts speculating that much of the big fall the previous day had anticipated news that the European Commission had been advised to oppose the chemicals joint-venture with Italy's Montedison. The disposal of 450 pubs by Scottish and Newcastle helped the brewer to gain 2 to 519p. The sale was made to a private consortium to satisfy the company's obligations under the government's industry regulations following the purchase of 1,600 Chef &amp; Brewer pubs last September. Disappointing interim results and a discouraging statement hit shares of J Smart, the Edinburgh-based building contractor and housebuilder, which fell 28 to 195p. Sharpe &amp; Fisher, the builders merchants jumped 7 to 163p after the chairman said at the company's annual meeting that profits in the first four months of the year are 'substantially ahead of 1993.' A positive agm statement from Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the northern supermarket group, helped the shares edge forward 2 to 130p. Solid results from Storehouse were not enough to prevent the shares slipping back 3 to 212p, although volume was only a moderate 2.1m. Profits were in line with market expectations, and the increased dividend pleased some sceptics. However, some concerns were being expressed among stores specialists about continued margin pressure. Good results from MacDonald Martin Distillers was further confirmation for many observers that the upswing in the whisky industry is now well under way. The shares gained 35 to 480p, and also enlivened Allied Lyons, up 5 at 580p, and Guinness, ahead at 6 at 482p. Smith New Court was said to be pushing Granada, up 7 at 497p. Composite insurances held up well with General Accident rallying from an early 535p to close unchanged on balance at 540p in the wake of a strong buy recommendation from Hoare Govett. The broker said General Accident 'is at least 10 per cent undervalued.' A James Capel recommendation lifted Chubb Securities 8 to 368p. APV eased 4 1/2 to 119 1/2 with Cazenove, the company's broker, said to be negative on the stock. Motor distributor Jessups jumped 28 to 126p, after an agreed offer from BSG which eased 5 1/2 to 69p.

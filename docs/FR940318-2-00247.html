			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Under applicants' proposal, the Funds could offer shares either: (a) Subject to a front-end sales charge and a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan initially providing for a service and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of the average daily net assets (``Class A shares''); (b) without a front-end sales charge but subject to a CDSC (which applicants expect will range from 4% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchase to 1% on redemptions made during the sixth year since purchase), a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee initially at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class B shares''), and automatically convertible into Class A shares after a certain period of time; (c) without a front-end sales charge but subject to a CDSC (which applicants expect will be 1% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchases), a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee initially at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class C shares''); (d) without a CDSC but subject to a front-end sales charge (which applicants expect will be 1% or less of the amount invested), a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee initially at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class D shares''); (e) without a front-end sales charge or CDSC, but subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets, for purchase exclusively by investors meeting such minimum investment and/or other eligibility criteria established by the Funds and the Distributor (``Class Y shares''); and (f) without any sales or rule 12b&hyph;1 plan charges for purchase exclusively by Adviser, Distributor, certain agents and affiliates of Adviser and Distributor, and officers, directors, and employees of such entities and employee benefit plans established for the benefit of such persons, as may be approved for purchase of this class of shares by the Funds and Distributor and disclosed in the applicable Funds' registration statements (``Class Z shares''). <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Applicants also seek authority for the Funds to establish one or more additional classes to be sold with different sales load and service and distribution fee structures, as described below. The Funds will not impose front-end sales charges, CDSCs, rule 12b&hyph;1 service fees, or distribution fees (or any combination thereof) in excess of amounts permitted by article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants intend that upon the initial public offering of Class Y and/or Class Z shares of a Fund, shareholders of any existing classes of such Fund who would qualify for investment in Class Y or Class Z shares, as applicable, would have such existing classes automatically convert into Class Y or Class Z shares, as applicable, on the basis of the relative net asset values of such classes of shares at the time of conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Daily expenses of a Fund will be allocated to each share class depending on the nature of the expense item. Operating expenses which are attributable to all classes will be allocated daily to each share class based on the percentage of net assets at the beginning of the day. Class-specific expenses (including rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, if any) will be calculated and charged to the respective class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The CDSC will be calculated on the lesser of the net asset value at the time of the issuance of the shares or the net asset value at the time of the redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on (a) an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shares due to capital appreciation, (b) shares, or amounts representing shares, purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, or (c) shares held for longer than the applicable period of time following the issuance of shares that the CDSC applies (the ``CDSC Period''). Upon any request for redemption of shares subject to a CDSC, it will be assumed that shares subject to no CDSC will be redeemed first in the order purchased (however, if a shareholder owns Class B and Class C shares, then, absent a shareholder choice to the contrary, Class C shares not subject to a CDSC will be redeemed in full prior to any redemption of Class B shares not subject to a CDSC), and all remaining shares that are subject to a CDSC will be redeemed in the order purchased. It is expected that the CDSCs and the CDSC Periods of the Funds will vary depending in part on the front-end sales load (if any) and 12b&hyph;1 fees (if any) that are imposed by any Fund regarding its Class B or Class C shares, and on the distribution arrangements entered into by the Distributor regarding any such class of shares. Any variation in the CDSCs or DCSC Periods will be set forth in the applicable prospectus. No DCSC will be imposed on shares issued prior to the effective date of the requested order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants request the ability to waive the CDSC regarding involuntary redemptions effected pursuant to a Fund's right to liquidate shareholder accounts having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum account balance set forth in the Fund's then-current prospectus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

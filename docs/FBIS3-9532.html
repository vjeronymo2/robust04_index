			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, March 24 (BTA) -- The Confederation of  Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) supports the demands  of most national dailies for changes in the Value Added Tax Act  which is to come into force on April 1, 1994. This was  announced today by the Press Office of the KNSB -- one of the  two major trade union amalgamations in this country. The  leadership of the KNSB insists that parliament urgently revises  the issue of levying VAT on the press and advertisements in it,  with the exception of erotic and pornographic publications.  "The achievements of democracy in Bulgaria are not so great as  to allow for a restriction of the right of the public to be  informed by financial mechanisms," the KNSB press release reads.  [passage omitted]    A number of newspapers today did not cover the work of the  Council of Ministers and the National Assembly. Some came out  with blanks in protest against VAT on newspapers. The  initiators of the protest have also approached the Bulgarian  National Television and the Bulgarian National Radio with a  appeal to support their demands. Their next step will be the  stopping of newspapers and broadcasts on the private radio  stations from March 28 through 31 inclusive. If by this date  parliament does not exempt Bulgarian books, periodical press and  advertisements in it, magazines and the electronic media from  VAT, the group of 15 will discuss their next actions. The bill  on amending the VAT Act has not been put on the agenda of the  National Assembly yet.    The Parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee discussed and  adopted a stand today on the proposed changes in the VAT Act.  Members of the committee have proposed a compromise solution,  according to which the newspapers and the mass media will not  register for paying VAT till the end of this year. Instead they  will pay the old 10 percent turnover tax, including on  advertisements. The bill amending the VAT Act is expected to  enter the plenary chamber next week. Next Thursday -- March 31,  Sofia cinemas will show only erotic films in protest against  VAT, the "Sofia Film" Company told BTA. A press conference was  held at the Ministry of Finance today on the forthcoming  introduction of VAT.    This afternoon 16 editors-in-chief of national dailies  adopted a declaration demanding the resignation of Finance  Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov because of his stand on the VAT Act.  "The government should comprise only of people respecting  freedom of speech, the democratic institutions and the  Constitution", the declaration reads.    The editors-in-chief add that it is inadmissible for a  person  who rejects the most important democratic institution -- the  free press, to be a member of this country's government.</p>

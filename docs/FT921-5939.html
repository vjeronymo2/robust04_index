			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Tories distance post-election plan from Thatcherism A BLUEPRINT for a new Tory government was discreetly unveiled in Conservative Central Office yesterday with the publication of a pamphlet certain to be seen as close to heresy by the party's hard right. The 19-page document, One Nation 2000, is said in a foreword by Mr David Howell, the former energy secretary, to offer the Tories 'a guiding theme' for years leading to the millennium. Yet its message carries both implicit and explicit criticisms of social developments over the past decade, arguing strongly for government action to shape a better integrated and less divisive model for society. Taking care to praise the achievements of the Thatcher years, it goes on to warn that 'something more is needed on which to build the policies of the 1990s'. The precise wording of the paper has been approved by Mr John Major's aides, while its sentiments have been enthusiastically endorsed by Mr Chris Patten, party chairman. Authorisation of the pamphlet's release so close to a general election will come as a further signal to the Thatcherite right that the party leadership supports a fundamental shift back towards more consensus politics. The One Nation group, founded in 1950 to lobby for the Disraelian vision of a truly national and classless Conservatism, comprises 33 backbenchers and 24 ministers who are not active members. Those include seven cabinet members such as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary. The pamphlet presents a conception of government's function redolent of the Toryism of Mr Edward Heath or Mr Harold Macmillan. In particular, the paper notes that a weakening social structure has put 'fearsome challenges to the cohesion of society' on the political agenda. The paper warns that disillusioned youth culture and the disintegration of family stability creates the danger that society might turn repressive. 'The guiding principle for the next decade must be to create a sense of national unity which is vigorous enough to resist the drift to anarchy on the one hand, and the predations of selfish libertarianism on the other,' it says. On specific issues, it implicitly warns against too big a tax cut in the Budget by arguing that the scope for big extra current spending is 'very limited'. It suggests action to reform divorce law in favour of the parent left with children, a temporary employment scheme for young people in government service, more socially responsible corporate governance and tax breaks for the self-employed.</p>

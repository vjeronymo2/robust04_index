			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / US Uruguay Round vote set The EU and US opponents to the Uruguay Round deal suffered a setback when the US yesterday said it had won an important case before a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The panel found against the European petitioners that key provisions of US laws regulating car fuel economy and luxury taxes are consistent with international trade rules. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the report would 'help steer the debate' over trade and environmental issues under the new World Trade Organisation. The US Senate leadership and maverick Senator Ernest Hollings have reached agreement to hold a vote on the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round on December 1. The bill, originally scheduled for a vote next week, has been delayed by Mr Hollings, who wants a national debate on the issue. 'I'm trying my best not to alienate my colleagues,' he said.</p>

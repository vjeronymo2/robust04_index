			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tesla in the Hands of Eriksson"] </F>   [Text] After three months of negotiations among the Swedish  telecommunications company Eriksson, the Croatian Government,  and the Privatization Fund, the Fund's Board of Directors  decided at a meeting to accept the Swedish firm's offer to buy  Tesla. To meet the negotiated price of 70 million German marks  [DM], the Swedes will pay DM20 million in cash, DM25 million in  equipment, and hand over patent rights worth DM25 million.  Eriksson's purchase of Tesla is considered one of the most  important steps in the privatization process in Croatia in terms  of the future of its employees rather than purely as a business  deal. Over a five-year period the work force will be gradually  reduced from 3,500 to 1,000, after the surplus employees have  been retrained.</p>

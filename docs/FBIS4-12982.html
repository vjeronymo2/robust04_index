			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return" by Ibrahim </F> Basyuni]    [Text] Brothers along the path of revolution and  liberation: The occupied Arab territories in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip have seen further operations and violent  confrontations with Zionist soldiers and settlers. These  operations extended to parts of Palestinian territory occupied  in 1948.    Less than 24 hours after the daring martyrdom operation  carried out by a Palestinian youth in the city of 'Afula in 1948  Palestine, in which eight Israelis were killed and 52 others  were wounded, a Palestinian youth opened fire on Zionist  settlers near Ashdod, also in 1948 Palestine. A settler was  killed and four were wounded. The Palestinian youth was  martyred when the Zionist soldiers in the area shot him dead. A  Palestinian youth in the occupied Gaza Strip stabbed a Zionist  settler in the [Gush Qatif] settlement near Khan Yunus,  seriously wounding him.    These are some of the bold and heroic operations the  intifadah youth carried out against the Zionist soldiers and  settlers in the Arab territories occupied before and after 1967.  The 'Afula and subsequent operations are in reply to the  massacres committed by settler gangs and Zionist troops in the  holy Ibrahim Mosque 40 days ago.    No doubt, carrying out this operation and the Ashdod  operation in 1948 Palestine confirms the ability of intifadah  youths to expand their operations to include, in addition to the  West Bank and Gaza Strip, all the cities and villages in 1948  Palestine. The intifadah youths can move and carry out  operations throughout occupied Palestine. There will be no  secure or calm place in the occupied Arab territories as long as  Zionist occupation exists in Palestine and as long as the  occupation authorities refuse to withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories or recognize the Palestinian Arab people's  legitimate rights.    As acknowledged by Zionist officials, the 'Afula operation  and subsequent daring fedayeen operations confirmed both the  failure of the Israeli repression and the inability of the  Israeli Army, police, and all the repressive Israeli measures to  provide protection and security to the Zionist settlers. After  the Hebron massacre, the occupation authorities sealed off the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and took various terrorist  and repressive measures in order to prevent the intifadah youths  from replying to this massacre. But what was the result? The  result appeared in 'Afula, and a few hours later, in Ashdod.  The intifadah youths replied to the massacre in the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque, in which more than 60 Palestinian worshipers  were victimized and hundreds were wounded.    The intifadah youths replied to this massacre in 1948  Palestine in 'Afula and Ashdod, confirming their determination  to continue the struggle against the occupation authorities, and  stressing their ability to reach their targets at the time and  in the place they choose. There is no safe place in the  occupied Arab territories. There will be no peace or security  for Zionist settlers and soldiers as long as Israel occupies  Arab territories and as long as settler gangs and occupation  troops commit daily massacres and terrorist crimes against  Palestinian worshipers, children, and women.    Peace, security, and stability will not be achieved for  Israel as long as peace, security, and stability are not  available for the Palestinian Arab people. A just and  comprehensive peace has bases, components, and principles. UN  Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 defined these  bases and components. These resolutions provide for full  Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, namely,  the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as well  as occupied Golan and the occupied portion of southern Lebanon.  They also guarantee the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate  rights.    These are the components of a comprehensive and just peace  which were the bases of the peace process. Without implementing  these bases and components, Israel will not enjoy peace and  stability regardless of the duration of the occupation or  Israel's terrorist massacres and crimes. Our Palestinian Arab  people will not surrender as long as occupation exists in the  land of Palestine, and they will chase the Zionists in every  spot in occupied Palestine. Our people can do this, as was  proved by the 'Afula operation, by the operations that followed  this operation, and by the operation that will follow it. These  operations will never stop, regardless of challenges and of the  duration of both the occupation and aggression. Final victory  will be the lot of our Palestinian Arab people, the owners of  the land and the rightful claimants to this land, the land of  their fathers and forefathers.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: GEC-Marconi sells LNB offshoot Gooding Consumer Electronics, a privately-owned Welsh company, and Grundig of Germany have bought GEC-Marconi's LNB Division, which makes a component for the reception of satellite television. The price has not been disclosed but Mr Alfred Gooding, chairman of GCE, said it was substantial. The division makes low noise blocks, which convert the microwave signals collected by a satellite dish to a lower frequency signal. This then goes by cable to a receiver which provides the television's sound and pictures. LNB Division is claimed to be the UK market leader in the manufacture of low noise blocks and to have a third of the European market. It will be renamed Gooding Microwave Technology and the intention is to continue to supply and expand its customer base. GCE has 70 per cent of the new company and Grundig 30 per cent. Earlier this year, GCE and Grundig, in which Philips, the Dutch electronics company, has a large stake, set up Grundig Satellite Communications. The joint venture makes satellite television receivers at Llantrisant in south Wales and is already claiming to have 15 per cent of the UK market. Mr Gooding described the acquisition as 'a logical progression' of the launch of GSC. 'The purchase is part of our strategy to build a fully integrated business in consumer electronics,' he said. Gooding Microwave Technology will employ the existing 35 staff of LNB Division and continue 'for a limited period' at the present base in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.</p>

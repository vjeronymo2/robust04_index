			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. POLICE AND LA MIGRA -- AN OVERBEARING PARTNERSHIP  </P> <P> The collaboration of the Los Angeles Police Department with the Immigration and  Naturalization Service in the Latino communities should be halted immediately.  Their joint operations are discriminatory measures that are damaging relations  between Latinos and the Police Department.  </P> <P> For several months Latinos have protested Police Department harassment of day  laborers at sites where immigrants and refugees gather to seek work. The Police  Department maintains that it is enforcing anti-loitering laws and answering  complaints from local residents and business persons that the presence of the  day laborers blights their neighborhood.  </P> <P> The plight of immigrants and refugees in our country is largely an economic  problem. It is not one of crime. The day laborers, for example, are mainly  immigrants, most of whom did not qualify for the amnesty legalization program  and who are trying to eke out survival without resorting to other methods. Our  city government apparently recognized this dilemma and recently allocated funds  to establish a pilot project to create and coordinate job pickup sites for day  laborers. It was a wise and compassionate move. By assisting desperate workers  trying to survive by working, the city discourages people from turning to crime  as an alternative, defuses a divisive social problem and helps to promote  harmony.  </P> <P> However, in a clear contradiction, the Police Department has been participating  in joint raids with the INS at labor pickup sites.  </P> <P> On June 30, the department combined forces in a daylight "drug" raid of  MacArthur and Lafayette parks, in the heart of the Salvadoran community.  </P> <P> The collaboration of the Police Department with INS is sowing Latino community  anger and distrust against the department and city government. It is creating  the fear that city-sponsored labor pickup sites may be traps for INS raids. The  raids are inconsistent with the 1986 City Council resolution providing that the  city will not report undocumented persons to the INS unless they have committed  multiple misdemeanors or a serious felony.  </P> <P> The Police Department actions also violate the longstanding department policy  not to use city funds to enforce federal immigration laws. The policy, like the  1986 resolution, was designed precisely to encourage undocumented immigrants  and refugees to cooperate with law enforcement and other government agencies by  reporting crimes and serving as witnesses.  </P> <P> Police officials justify police partici-pation in the raids at labor pickup  siteson the grounds that they are providing backup for the INS. However, their  presence has been pervasive and they have played an active role in the arrests.  </P> <P> As far as the community is concerned, we are witnessing police officers  conducting immigration raids alongside immigration agents and immigration  agents participating in police raids. Unfortunately, this is the direct result  of well-intentioned but ill-conceived efforts of some City Council members to  address the crime problem in the Latino community.  </P> <P> INS raids differ in objective from police drug raids. INS raids in the Latino  communities are general searches made without warrants to ferret out the  undocumented. They are unconstitutional and discriminatory because they target  people on the basis of skin color, language or community in which they live,  work or enjoy recreation, regardless of immigration status.  </P> <P> Police raids, on the other hand, should be based on previously gathered  intelligence and target identified, suspected criminals. But when the INS and  Police Department conduct joint raids, the operations necessarily become  immigration raids. They may apprehend some criminals, but they target and  capture in their net many innocent persons who are then taken prisoner by INS  agents if they are undocumented.  </P> <P> For example, in the MacArthur and Lafayette parks raid, hundreds of persons at  the park were questioned, not only the "known drug traffickers," during four  hours of widespread general panic. Only 78 persons were arrested and more than  half of them were not charged with crimes but were arrested for being  undocumented. Others, including U.S. citizens, documented persons, children,  young people playing soccer and the homeless who just happened to be at the  park were checked by the INS and released.  </P> <P> Latinos are just as concerned as anyone about increasing crime. They are  involved in citywide grass-roots, anti-crime efforts. But the INS has been a  threat to us and our families and the increasing collaboration of the  department with the INS could cause many to withdraw from cooperating with the  police in those efforts.  </P> <P> Criminals come from all class and national origins. The use of the INS at  police anti-crime operations against Latinos is discriminatory, singles out  immigrants and makes them scapegoats for crime rates.  </P> <P> If local law enforcement does not want to erase the progress made in the  efforts to build the trust and support of immigrants for crime-control efforts,  then the police should halt its participation with INS in raids and other  operations.  </P> <P> Police agencies must deal with our community as with any other community.  Target the criminals among us based on their crimes, not their immigration  status.  </P></p>

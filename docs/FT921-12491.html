			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn sues BBC and S. Express on Halcion allegations UPJOHN, the US drugs company, and its UK subsidiary, Upjohn Ltd, yesterday served a series of writs for libel following allegations about the safety of its sleeping pill Halcion. Upjohn has served writs against the BBC - which broadcast a programme called 'The Halcion Nightmare' - and the programme's presenter, Mr Tom Mangold. A second action has been started against the Sunday Express, Miss Eve Pollard, the newspaper's editor, and Mr Neville Hodgkinson who wrote an article about Halcion and its possible side-effects on October 6 1991. A final action is being started against Dr Ian Oswald, a retired Scottish professor, who, the company claims, made allegations against Upjohn in an article published in the New York Times. The company said it had no intention at present of taking action against the New York Times. Dr Oswald, who was professor of psychiatry at Edinburgh university for seven years, claimed in a letter to The Lancet this month that Upjohn had not disclosed all of the side-effects of Halcion when it had applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for the drug to be licenced. Dr Oswald is due to speak next month at a public hearing in Berlin at the German health ministry to discuss the safety of Halcion. The drug was banned in the UK last October. The French and Spanish authorities have since forbidden sales of Halcion in doses more than 0.125mg. Upjohn said it was not prepared to allow allegations attacking the company's integrity to be published without challenge. It had instructed its solicitors, Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners, to proceed vigorously to trial to enable the company to clear its name. Mr Mangold said last night that as far as he was aware Upjohn had not been in contact with the BBC from the date of transmission or made any complaint. The company had, however, walked out of an interview with the BBC when the programme was being made, he claimed. Mr Mangold said that the purpose of the programme was to look at a possible relationship between Halcion and very serious mental illness, suicide and even murders in the US. The programme also looked at how the drug was marketed and how Upjohn dealt with complaints.</p>

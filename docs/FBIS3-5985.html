			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand and the United States are scheduled to  resume negotiations on aviation rights in Washington on April  5-6, Thai Airways International [THAI] president Thamnun Wangli  said at the weekend. This is considered the first move after a  four-year impasse during which there has been no formal  agreement.    The Thai delegation will be led by Mahidon Chantharangkun,  permanent secretary of the Ministry of Transport and  Communication; Sisuk Chantharangsu, director-general of the  Civil Aviation Department, and Mr Thamnun along with THAI  marketing and corporate planning staff.    Mr Thamnun declined to reveal the Thai position in the  negotiations.    Currently THAI flies to the US four times, Bangkok to Los  Angeles. US airlines Delta, Northwest and United operate a  total of 21 flights a week to Bangkok. Flight routing and  capacity levels are still at 1991 levels despite significant  economic changes in the region.    Mr Thamnun said THAI had no plan to increase flights to the  US in the short term, especially this summer while it tries to  expand domestic service and develop other new routes.    An informed source in the Ministry of Transport and  Communication said the US wants to increase flights to Bangkok  now that the embargo against Vietnam has been lifted.  Washington expects a lot more US tourists and businesspeople  will want to travel to Vietnam via Bangkok.    As well, American Airlines is eying the Southeast Asia  market, into which it wants to expand in a big way. The conflict  began in 1990 with a difference of opinion between Thailand and  the US on allocating a reasonable number of flights between the  two countries. Washington supports an "open skies" approach in  which US carriers can freely increase the volume of passengers  and cargo to Thailand. Thailand believes in the principle of  "capacity predetermination".    THAI believes "open skies" will hurt Thailand, because the  US  has more capacity to accommodate vast numbers of passengers and  cargo on its many airlines.    The US-Thailand route is considered very lucrative since it  includes significant stopover points such as Tokyo, Taipei and  Seoul.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUYING RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY  </P> <P> Three cheers for Santa Monica's Mayor Dennis Zane! His commentary on reclaiming  vital railroad rights-of-way ("A Rare Chance to Right a Wrong of Our Youth,"  California Commentary, Feb. 5) should be required reading for anyone who thinks  nothing can be done about congestion, noise, and overdevelopment in the Los  Angeles area.  </P> <P> Light rail is the quietest, most efficient means of getting around in areas  where space is scarce.  </P> <P> Traffic through neighborhoods would decrease and the noise that usually  accompanies it would drop.  </P> <P> To reactivate this right-of-way for transit would not only be a vindication for  the Red Cars but a crucial link to our fledgling light-rail system. Just think  of it: You could travel from downtown Los Angeles, or Long Beach, to the  Coliseum, Sports Arena, USC, Santa Monica, etc., and not have to worry about  parking! It would be a pleasure riding a smooth, quiet train instead of a  noisy, bumpy, brake-squealing bus.  </P> <P> We could spend the rest of our lives blaming someone else for taking away our  beloved streetcars. But it was our parents' responsibility then as it is our  duty now to make this place liveable through planning and executing an  efficient transit system.  </P> <P> NICK SANTANGELO  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

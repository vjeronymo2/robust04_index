			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sulzer calls off sale of unit to IMI SULZER, the Swiss engineering group, has cancelled the agreed sale of its Thermtec valves and control systems division to IMI, the British industrial group. Sulzer said a 'material difference' arose between the two parties during the negotiation, which began last September. Thermtec, which makes precision components for fossil fuelled and nuclear power plants, recorded annual sales of SFr80m (Dollars 52.71m) and is profitable. Sulzer said price was not the only factor. The Swiss company was seeking 'the most optimal environment' for the business, which meant preserving it as a centre of excellence in Winterthur. IMI said it was prevented by a non-disclosure agreement from commenting on the abortive deal.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Tax treatment Against this background, any tinkering with the tax treatment of pension funds would come at a delicate moment. By lowering funds' tax credit on dividends in March, the government reduced surpluses and increased companies' pension costs. The Treasury resisted the temptation to come back for more in the November budget, but that may only be a stay of execution. It would be strange if the review of taxation of savings to be carried out by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, did not scrutinise pension funds at all. Combined with the demands of a new solvency test and a rigorous accounting standard, tougher tax treatment could give companies just another reason for turning away from defined-benefit schemes. There is little sign of such a move as yet. Membership of occupational schemes has been in decline for some years, but companies are waiting for the shape of reform to become clear before deciding what kind of pension risks they are prepared to shoulder. The unfolding personal pensions scandal may draw attention to the attractions of occupational final-salary schemes. If companies are unwilling to shoulder their share of the risks, though, employees will have little choice.</p>

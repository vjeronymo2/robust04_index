			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Jianguo (2621 1696 0948): "Heading for the </F> Arena of International Competition--Roundup of Results Scored by  Chinese Enterprises in Transnational Operations"]    [Text] When the transnational groups and corporations of  the developed nations were active on the world economic stage 15  years ago, China was practicing a closed-door policy, and the  term "transnational corporation" was usually derogatory. Since  the mid 1980's, a number of large and medium-sized Chinese  enterprises with solid foundations, in conformity with the trend  of the world's economic internationalization and  regionalization, have stepped out of the country, have taken an  active part in international competition, have established  transnational companies with Chinese characteristics, and have  scored gratifying achievements. The Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation and other units recently held the first  exhibition on China's transnational operation in Beijing,  displaying the course of development of China's transnational  operations.  <H5>  Great Achievements Attained in Transnational Operation </H5>   Since reform and opening up, the Chinese Government has  vigorously encouraged and supported those large and medium-size  enterprises which have the requisite conditions to seize the  opportunity, take part in international competition, and engage  in transnational operations. There are now more than 7,000  various types of foreign economic and trade enterprises. Their  import and export volume has increased 750 percent over the past  15 years to reach $195.8 billion. The volume of their imports  and exports has leaped to 11th place internationally. Their  investment abroad totals $5.16 billion, where they now own 4,500  enterprises. The volume of foreign contracts undertaken and  labor services offered totals $32.4 billion, with a turnover of  $20 billion. Over the years, they have sent more than 800,000  contract laborers to 169 countries and regions.    The transnational operations of Chinese enterprises  developed  from simply setting up trade offices abroad and running  processing enterprises to commodity trade, contracting foreign  projects and offering labor services, international tourism,  exploitation of resources, production and processing,  transportation, catering, consultation, finance, and insurance,  which formed a multi-level and all-directional opening up  structure at various levels and channels. Of this, the China  Petrochemical Corporation, China Foreign Shipping, China  Hardware and Minerals Corporation, China Petroleum Engineering  and Construction Company, China Construction Corporation,  Guangdong Investment Group, and the international economic  cooperation companies in Liaoning, Shanghai, Fujian, and Beijing  are the most outstanding transnational companies. The China  Petrochemical Corporation has become a comprehensive  transnational group operating in crude oil, chemical fertilizer,  chemicals, and rubber and plastic goods. The corporation's  business volume in 1993 totaled $13.211 billion, ranking first  in the country's foreign trade sector. The corporation was also  selected by the United State's FORTUNE magazine as one of the  top 30 of the world's 500 largest comprehensive service  enterprises for four years in a row. The China Port Engineering  Company and four other companies also joined the ranks of the  255 largest international engineering companies.    By focusing on their own trade, China's transnational  enterprises developed diversified businesses. Most of them have  transformed from a single business to a diversified operation  and from a special company to a comprehensive company.  Internationalization, industrialization, and the formation of  groups has become a trend.    For example, the groups represented by the China Resources  and China International Trust and Investment Corporation engage  primarily in trade and investment. They are also involved in  production, technology, services, finance, consultation,  information, and other business areas. A number of engineering,  construction, and international economic and technological  cooperation companies, represented by China Construction, China  Port, and China Fujian shoulder the mission of China's aid to  foreign countries. Focused on contracting foreign projects and  offering labor services, they are also engaged in other  businesses.  <H5>  Make the Most of Advantages and Develop New Markets </H5>   Although the transnational operation of China's enterprises  is no match for the transnational groups of the developed  nations in terms of capital and scale of business, they do have  their unique advantages.    The first advantage: The state encourages and supports most  of the transnational enterprises. The state bears  responsibility for these companies and offers certain  preferential policies. As these enterprises have strong backing  in materials and capital, they enjoy high prestige. For  example, in developing a real estate project, the Huarong  (Macao) Engineering Company, which has done an outstanding job  in recent years, smoothly proceeded with the construction of  Huarong Square, which involved an investment of millions of Hong  Kong dollars, and attained marked economic results because it  got enormous financial support from the Fujian Finance  Department and the Huaxing and Huafu companies.    The second advantage: China has gradually established a  comprehensive industrial foundation and has advantages in  applicable technology and traditional techniques. Some  enterprises have superior operation and management experience in  technology and products. At the same time, they have trained a  number of qualified personnel for transnational operations.    The third advantage: The comprehensive competitiveness of  enterprises is enhanced in the course of the merger. In face of  the competitive international market and a small number of  transnational conglomerates, China's transnational enterprises  have adopted the method of gradually forming combinations at  home and mergers abroad, vigorously developing export-oriented  enterprise groups at home, and making full use of their  economies of scale to attain superiority in cost of operation  and production, technology, and management. A small number of  large enterprises with solid financial foundations have started  transnational mergers abroad, making full use of the available  technology, management, and supply and sales network of the  local enterprises to expand their operations.    In coordination with the Academy of Sciences, Qinghua  University, and the Nonferrous Metal Research Institute, the  China Hardware and Minerals Import and Export Corporation  invested in a series of high-tech products. They also merged a  number of relevant enterprises at home and abroad, gradually  developed a coordinated process of raw materials extraction,  processing, and export, and made marked progress in running  enterprises abroad.    The Shoudu Iron and Steel Complex, which has made a major  breakthrough in transnational operations since the early 1990's,  has 12 enterprises abroad, involving a total investment of $180  million. The complex invested $120 million in purchasing Peru  Iron Ore in 1992, which has become one of China's largest  enterprises abroad.  <H5>  Subject to Conditions and Facing Challenges </H5>   The transnational operations of China's enterprises are  developing vigorously, but, on the whole, they are still in the  initial development stage. As there continues to be a wide gap  between China's overall national strength and that of the  developed nations, and reform and opening up must still be  deepened further, the transnational operations of China's  enterprises are conditioned by various factors and are facing  challenges.    First, capital shortages are still a prominent problem in  transnational operations. As China is not yet a capital  exporting nation, capital shortages will continue to condition  the enterprises which have investment abroad for a long time to  come. There are two ways to settle the problem: First,  accommodate capital abroad and, second, enterprises pooling  funds by issuing shares.    Second, attention should be given to improving the  management  and operation level and to speed up the training of qualified  personnel. The operation and management of some of China's  enterprises abroad are not ideal, and their economic efficiency  is not high enough because of the low level of operations and  management and unqualified managerial personnel. There are also  problems in the management system, distribution of interests,  enterprise organizational structure, and the operational  mechanism, which must still be further improved and settled.    Moreover, as the export volume of China's  technology-intensive products accounts for a very low proportion  of overall exports, most of the products lack competitiveness in  the international market. Meanwhile, there are defects in the  regional distribution and trade structure of China's enterprises  abroad. Some enterprises have no access to information and have  failed to make sufficient feasibility studies on running  enterprises abroad, resulting in blind investment.    Looking forward to the future, with the development of  China's economy and the enhancement of China's national  strength, China will continuously develop, improve, and upgrade  its transnational operations.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Mexico growth forecast cut PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said Mexico's economic growth is likely to be just 3 per cent this year, compared to the official government forecast of 4 per cent. The remark confirms what many private sector analysts and the recent lacklustre performance of the stock market had already indicated: economic growth, sluggish in the second half of last year, has continued to slow this year. The president blamed the slowdown on the 'international situation' (the weakness of the US economy), although the government's tight budget and steady real appreciation of the peso-dollar exchange rate will have played their part. The slower growth has yet to have an appreciable impact on the trade deficit, which reached a record Dollars 1.435bn (Pounds 810m), excluding revenues from the maquiladora or in-bond plants, in March, against Dollars 1.38bn in February. The cumulative deficit for the first three months of the year is now Dollars 4bn, much too high for the government to meet its forecast of a current account deficit of Dollars 12.99bn for 1992. The deficit including revenues from the maquiladoras reached Dollars 1.05bn. To complete an uncomfortable picture the government has had much less success in reducing inflation than it hoped. Inflation in the first four months was 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] By now, the situation in the Black Sea Fleet's  conservation division has been stabilized, and is under full  control. This information was disclosed in an interview to the  NOVYNY Broadcasting Agency by Volodymyr Orlov, Odessa senior  naval chief [starshyy morskyy nachalnik]. He emphasized that  the majority of division personnel will continue their service  in the Ukrainian Navy. Material for initiating criminal suits  against Oleh Feokistov, commander of the division, Oleksandr  Zelenko, chief of the division staff, and Dmytro Starikov,  commander of the coastal base, is being prepared. Volodymyr  Orlov also emphasized that Russian media reports do not  correspond to reality -- there were neither wounded children nor  wounded servicemen.</p>

They will discuss  King Hassan II's peace proposal for Angola.    Meanwhile, diplomatic sources have said that Jose Eduardo  dos  Santos is disappointed with Angolan Ambassador to France  Boaventura Cardoso's work. Ambassador Cardoso had prepared the  Futungo de Belas Palace chieftain's visit to France. The  MPLA-PT leader is also unhappy about a less than truthful report  produced by Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura  suggesting improved bilateral relations. The general opinion is  that MPLA-PT leader's three-day visit to France was a thorough  fiasco.    French President Francois Mitterrand took a firm position  and  made it clear that his country did not wish to compromise the  Lusaka peace talks in any way. The government led by Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur supported President Francois  Mitterrand's positions. [passage omitted]    Using his constitutional powers, French President Mitterrand  yesterday warned Acting President Eduardo dos Santos that France  only supports a negotiated settlement to the Angolan crisis.  The upshot is that Engineer Eduardo dos Santos will be  returning home quite disappointed. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Japanese car sales fall by 6.5% A STEEP decline in car sales in March was reported yesterday by the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association (Jada), adding to the accumulating evidence that Japan's economy is slowing sharply. March sales fell by 6.5 per cent compared to a year ago to 694,520 units, Jada said in a preliminary report. For the first three months of the year, sales were down by 4.3 per cent. The Jada report nonetheless contained one slice of good news for the industry. Sales of larger cars with engines of more than two litres, which are more expensive and profitable, rose by 40.8 per cent to 86,632 units in March. Small cars (excluding minicars) were hit hardest, with sales down 15 per cent to 404,954 units. Meanwhile, a report by the Economic Planning Agency issued yesterday showed that plant and equipment investment by Japanese companies was expected to rise by an average of 4.6 per cent in the next three years, compared to an average rise of 10.6 per cent over the past three years. A main reason for the decline was the difficulty companies have raising funds on the depressed stock market, according to a survey of companies. The EPA report also said that investment in labour saving equipment and spending on research and development were affected by interest rate movements. Many analysts had assumed that these areas of investment were relatively unaffected by financial market trends.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Here come the brides IN THE cold pre-dawn of next Wednesday, a queue will start to form outside an undistinguished building in downtown Boston. A line of well-heeled women will pay homage to one of the biggest days of the US shopping season - the Bridal Event at Filene's Basement. This is no ordinary sale. The queue is expected to include not only bargain hunters who take the first T-subway from Alewife or Harvard, but seriously rich customers who stroll over to Filene's from the Ritz Carlton, where they checked in after flights from New York. Shoppers with some of the highest credit ratings in the country will be waiting patiently for a genuine bargain. Inside, assistants will be putting the final touches to more than 800 wedding dresses with famous labels such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Dior and Bloomingdales. Normally none of these dresses would sell for less than Dollars 1,000, and most for much more. Next week they will each sell at Dollars 199. The finer trappings of buying haute couture - a calm atmosphere and deferential staff  -will be abandoned at 8am when the doors open. The basement - 60,000 sq ft of space on two subterranean levels - is an institution with all the reserve and panache of the Colosseum in ancient Rome. The customers are following a grand tradition. In 1940, 15,000 women stormed the store after it purchased the last dresses to leave the Paris boutiques before the German occupation. More recently, 18 shoppers flew from New York to attend a Dollars 1.3m fur sale. On an average day up to 20,000 people visit Filene's Basement, the independent off-shoot of the larger and more refined Filene's department store. That volume of traffic allows the store - taken private by a management buy-out in 1988 and refloated in 1991 - to sell brand names such as Brooks Brothers, Lord &amp; Taylor and Pierre Cardin at savings of up to 80 per cent off the original prices. The returns are rich. The basement has taken Dollars 2.39m in a single day's trading; in 1991 its annual one-day sale of men's suits grossed more than Dollars 1m. The scale of its turnover, involving up to seven truck loads' of stock every day, makes the performance of some London stores look modest. The store has a unique attraction - the automatic markdown plan, under which merchandise carries a price tag listing the date the item was first offered for sale. After 14 days the price is cut by 25 per cent; further cuts are made after 21 and 28 days. If the item remains unsold after 35 selling days it goes to charity. You can spot markdown merchandise by the crowds four or five deep. Clothes are thrown into wooden troughs, known as booths, where shoppers gather to feed. They can buy Christian Dior dress shirts at Dollars 20; Rossinimoda or Vittoria Ricci shoes at Dollars 69; Pierre Cardin jeans at Dollars 20; Michael Laurence suits at Dollars 68.99 or splash out on a Gianpaulo creation at Dollars 299. The income generated by the plan has allowed the store to expand rapidly with branches opening in Chicago, Washington DC and Minneapolis, and shortly in Manhattan. Filene's Basement sees no need to come to Europe just yet because Europeans are busy going the other way, scrummaging along with the hardiest Bostonians. But shoppers be warned: passengers arriving in Britain from the US may bring only Pounds 36 worth of goods home with them duty free. Any items worth more are subject to duty of up to 20 per cent. Undeclared goods are subject to much stiffer penalties, and sometimes confiscation. Filene's has more than enough stock to satisfy the appetite. There are clothes and accessories on the selling floor worth Dollars 2.5m, and a further Dollars 14m in the stock rooms. Next Wednesday, Basement general manager Donald Scott is looking forward to big queues for the cash registers and credit card machines. 'People spend thousands on their wedding but pride themselves on cheap dresses,' says Scott. 'They even keep the tags to brag about - it make us different from any other store in the world.'

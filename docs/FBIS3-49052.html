			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding the letter of U.S. President Bill Clinton  referring to the arrival of his special envoy Madeleine  Albright, President Milan Kucan concluded that the initiative of  President Clinton is highly important and welcome in Slovenia.  Ambassador Albright will brief the Slovene leadership with the  conclusions of the NATO summit that will take place on 10 and 11  January. This will primarily involve NATO's security  cooperation with Central and East European countries and the  so-called partnership for peace. In Kucan's opinion this issue  is very important for Slovenia, which is a small country with  rather limited possibilities for investment into armament.  However, other issues that will supposedly be discussed are  also interesting for Slovenia, for example, the issues  concerning the functioning of the United Nations, part of which  are humanitarian aid, implementation of measures, work of the  war crimes tribunal, and expansion of the UN Security Council.    Milan Kucan also believes that the talks with Madeleine  Albright in Slovenia will also be an opportunity to discuss  relations between the states, as Ms. Albright is a good  connoisseur of the situation in Slovenia and in the region.</p>

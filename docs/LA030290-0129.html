			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FRENCHWOMAN WHO DELIVERED A BIG 'BABY' TO HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> MOVIES: HER 'THREE MEN AND A CRADLE' WAS TURNED INTO YOU KNOW WHAT. NOW SHE  HOPES LIGHTNING WILL STRIKE TWICE WITH 'MAMA, THERE'S A MAN IN YOUR BED.'  </P> <P> With "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," which opens the Santa Barbara  International Film Festival tonight, French writer-director Coline Serreau may  have another international hit on her hands. Serreau's "Three Men and a  Cradle," remade as "Three Men and a Baby" by Disney, was such a big success --  in both versions -- that Disney's Hollywood Pictures has signed her to both  direct an English remake of "Mama" and then to write and direct a sequel.  </P> <P> It's no wonder that Disney came calling. "Three Men" and "Mama" are both  big-laugh comedies with universal themes. But you don't need to wait for the  American version; in both cases, Serreau got it right the first time.  </P> <P> "Mama" is an offbeat romantic comedy about the relationship between Romuald, a  harried Paris yogurt mogul (Daniel Auteuil), and Juliette, the black cleaning  lady (Firmine Richard) who helps him trap the traitors in his midst.  </P> <P> The 42-year-old Serreau said the idea for "Mama," which bears the title  "Romuald et Juliette" in Europe, came to her while she was in California  preparing "Three Men and a Baby."  </P> <P> "It's more of an American film than a French film, really," Serreau said,  during a recent interview at a Venice cafe. "Black culture is not as important  in France as it is in America. Yet, the relationship between the races here is  so complex, so much a love/hate thing. Ask a Middle American his favorite TV  show and he'll say 'Bill Cosby.' And who's the biggest star? Eddie Murphy. It's  crazy!  </P> <P> "I wrote the first 10 lines for 'Romuald and Juliette' here and the rest in  France. I was working on another movie, but I became obsessed with 'Romuald and  Juliette' and asked my producers if we could do it instead. I was lucky; they  agreed. I don't know how Disney got hold of the script, but they wanted to buy  it. It's still a mystery to me how they got the script!"  </P> <P> The working title for the Disney remake is "Randall and Juliet." Richard  Dreyfuss will play Randall, Juliet is yet to be cast. It will mark Serreau's  American directorial debut.  </P> <P> "I was supposed to direct 'Three Men and a Baby,' " she said, "but I got sick  and had to go back to Paris only three or four weeks before we were to start  shooting, so I couldn't do it." (Serreau is not involved in the sequel, "Three  Men and a Little Lady," but she admits with a certain satisfaction that she has  a share of its profits.)  </P> <P> Serreau brings to film making an extraordinarily rich and varied background.  </P> <P> "My mother was a writer, a novelist, essayist and playwright. My father was an  avant-garde director who presented Brecht, Ionescu and Beckett -- he introduced  'Waiting for Godot' and Beckett was a family friend. So I was kind of born in  the theater, but by the time I was a teen-ager I had had enough of it.  </P> <P> "I was a pianist and organist for awhile, but I was eventually pulled back to  the theater. I acted a lot, I wrote, and when the wonderful Fratollini Circus  opened a school I went there the first day. I learned to work on the trapeze. I  may not be gifted at other things, but I am very good at that! As an actress, I  was always concerned with the physical aspects.  </P> <P> "At 13, I started writing and wrote all the time. It was never 'Today, I decide  to be a writer.' I wrote two successful plays, one a success in Paris, the  other in Geneva. I never thought that what I wrote should be directed by anyone  but me! I like to tell stories. Writing is like an instinct with me. It's not  calculated; people should stop writing if they have to work hard at it. They  should stay away, it's no good for them. The one thing that makes great movies  is a great script."  </P> <P> It was just 10 years ago that Serreau's first film, a menage a trois comedy  starring Sami Frey called "Why Not?," opened in Los Angeles. It showed more  promise than fulfillment, but it did display a quirky, fresh sensibility and it  did try to validate unconventional relationships in a crazy world.  </P> <P> Serreau says Charlie Chaplin is her idol.  </P> <P> "There are not many directors whose work I like," she says, "and he is the only  one I really, really admire. His films are beautiful -- they are always telling  us so many things about life. Like Shakespeare and Moliere, he was an actor.  The really great directors were actors, they know how to deal with an audience.  What I like here in America is that it is normal for an actor to be physical --  it doesn't all come out of the brain. The purely cerebral is often just so much  masturbation.  </P> <P> "I want to do a silent film, I'm fed up with words," she said, adamantly. "I  already have the script, I've been working on it for 10 years. Maybe it's the  last movie I'll ever make, I don't know."  </P> <P> * RELATED STORY: F9  </P></p>

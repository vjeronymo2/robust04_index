			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Docket HM&hyph;183D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 3, 1993, RSPA published an interim final rule that amended requirements concerning the registration of Registered Inspectors and Design Certifying Engineers for certification of cargo tank motor vehicles. RSPA extended the closing of the registration period from December 31, 1991 to December 31, 1995. This action was in response to a petition for rulemaking, P&hyph;1167, filed by NTTC. RSPA stated in the rule that although an opportunity for public comment had not been provided, RSPA was seeking public comment to the action. RSPA further stated that any comments received would be addressed along with comments received to the NPRM under Docket HM&hyph;183C. The effective date of this rule was September 3, 1993. The comment period closed on October 13, 1993; RSPA received no comments in regard to this action. Therefore, that extension remains in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the Regulatory policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). A regulatory evaluation is available for review in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). Federal law expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements applicable to the transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not ``substantively the same'' as the Federal requirements. 49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These covered subjects are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) the designation, description, and classification of hazardous material;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) the packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) the preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents related to hazardous material and requirements respecting the number, contents, and placement of those documents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) the written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous material; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) the design, manufacturing, fabricating, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a packaging or a container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule addresses the design, manufacturing, repairing, and other requirements for packages represented as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous material. Therefore, this final rule preempts State, local, or Indian tribe requirements that are not ``substantively the same'' as Federal requirements on these subjects. Section 5125(b)(2) of Title 49 U.S.C. provides that when DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the effective date of Federal preemption. The effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date of issuance of the final rule and no later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective date of Federal preemption of this final rule will be 90 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because RSPA lacks discretion in this area, preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. There are no direct or indirect adverse economic impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment imposes no changes to the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in the June 12, 1989 final rule, which were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and assigned control number 2137&hyph;0014.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations.

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABOVE THE STORM, FLAG FLIES HIGH  </P> <P> Flag Day was always supposed to be a time to honor Old Glory, but with the  Stars and Stripes at the center of a political firestorm, the banner itself has  become a symbol of an intense national debate.  </P> <P> And with the Supreme Court ruling that Congress cannot make it a crime to burn  the flag, defenders are rallying this Flag Day to protect their beloved  standard.  </P> <P> "We think it's disgusting," said Ed Kearns, commander of the Veterans of  Foreign Wars post in Mission Viejo. "I'm a patriot, and I've seen my buddies  die for this flag. I think the Bill of Rights should be defended. Desecrating  the flag is not a right, it's a disgrace."  </P> <P> At Mission Viejo and at other VFW posts and offices of the Elks Lodge and the  American Legion, ceremonies are being held to celebrate Flag Day, which  officially is today.  </P> <P> Kearns said many veterans were emotional during ceremonies that were held at  the post Tuesday.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of patriotism shown," Kearns said. "We had almost 200 people  there singing the National Anthem and a few shed tears were shared."  </P> <P> Harvey Tallmon, a member of the Garden Grove VFW post, also spoke out against  the Supreme Court ruling.  </P> <P> "I fought three wars because of that damned flag and I kind of like it,"  Tallmon said. "On Flag Day, I'll be flying my flag in my front yard, that's for  sure."  </P> <P> Members of the Buena Parks Elks Lodge held a Flag Day ceremony Wednesday  evening and said Flag Day means more now than ever before.  </P> <P> "There's more significance this year, a more acute awareness of our flag," said  Joe Kronsteiner, a Leading Knight in the club. "There's a lot of talk in the  lodge and people don't like the Supreme Court ruling at all. They're not  screaming fanatics about it, but they do support a constitutional amendment  against flag burning.  </P> <P> "I personally feel very bad about those flag-burning incidents and the court  ruling. Our flag is our national emblem, something to rally around, and I think  people should pay more respect to it. It's not there to be maligned."  </P> <P> Members of the Elks Lodge in Orange said they have "taken a definite stand"  against flag burning and reiterated their feeling during a ceremony held  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "All of our members feel the American flag is a sacred emblem and should be  treated as such," said Dick Arend, exalted ruler of the lodge.  </P> <P> David Moulton, commander of the American Legion post in Orange, said his  organization was also "burned up" over the ruling.  </P> <P> "Being a serviceman, you're there to defend the flag," Moulton said. "To have  people who want to abuse it, that just seems wrong to me. The only time a flag  should be burned is at an authorized disposal ceremony."  </P> <P> Patriotic service organizations aren't the only ones formally celebrating Flag  Day this week. Several schools will also be paying tribute to the American  flag. One such ceremony will take place today at Montevideo Elementary School  in Mission Viejo at 9:30 a.m.  </P></p>

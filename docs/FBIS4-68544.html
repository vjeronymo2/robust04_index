			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with cinematographer/writer Stanislav Govorukhin </F> by Eric Kotlyar; place and date not given: "A Country That Has  Betrayed Its Elderly Does Not Have a Future"]    [Text]    [Kotlyar] Stanislav Sergeyevich, much of what you write  about  agrees with the materials we publish; in particular, that  reforms in Russia are being accompanied by an explosion of  criminal manifestations on an unheard-of scale! But then how can  we explain the fact that in August 1991 you were an active  defender of the White House?    [Govorukhin] What is so surprising about this--both in 1991  and now I defended and continue to defend the constitution and  democracy. How do you explain that in 1991 our president acted  in the name of defending constitutional foundations (he took an  oath of allegiance to the people on this very constitution),  while in September 1993 the constitution was essentially  trampled! Now, this logic definitely defies explanation!    [Kotlyar] You probably remember that it was said way back in  the "500 Days" Program that "black" money is capable of  facilitating the accumulation of productive capital; then there  were contentions that any initial accumulation of capital is  good, and the sooner it "accumulates," the better; now the  president gets horrifying analytical reports saying that crime  is almost beginning to displace the state! A federal crime  suppression program is adopted, with an envisaged cost of 2  trillion rubles [R]. So what do we have: First we seem to urge  those guys to accumulate money, in order to subsequently put it  to work, by any means possible; then we start crying: "Help! We  are surrounded by robbers!"?    [Govorukhin] As early as the 1980's we, members of the  cultural establishment, warned the government that flirting with  the criminal world would end badly. I wrote a lot about this,  and my film "We Cannot Live This Way Anymore!" is a graphic  teaching aid for the powers that be! That crime will flourish if  it is encouraged was no secret to anyone. It is a different  matter that the current authorities are artificially creating  favorable conditions for bringing as many people as possible,  from different societal strata, into the criminal vortex. It  turns out that it also makes sense politically: Once you get  dirty, you have no choice but to support the authority that lets  you live this way. This is why at all elections the criminal  underworld actively supports the current regime. By creating  economic oppression, the authority itself pushes people in the  direction of "black business," machinations, buying-reselling,  embezzlement, and thus in a way creates direct dependency on  these conditions. The criminalization of society is underway.  One can see the same in the military and the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs]. Can you imagine the soldiers of the 1991 army  firing at the Supreme Soviet of Russia? Now, however--you have  seen it for yourself! The military has been put into extremely  difficult economic circumstances; it is becoming demoralized,  corrupted, and losing its moral foundations. Fight crime in  these conditions? Nonsense! We cannot stop crime through the  legal system! First, we have to change the socioeconomic nature  of our life. For instance, the law on taxes. It should be  profitable to work! It should be promising and attractive to  produce goods. Loan-sharking, on the other hand, robbing the  population through the banks, stealing state materials, and  selling off military equipment should be not just unprofitable  but outright criminal, dangerous! That is, we have to cut the  economic roots of crime. As long as a young person sees in the  experience of people around him, his own parents, that it is  impossible to live honestly, the ranks of criminals will keep  getting new recruits from the younger generation.    And the second, no less important item--creating a moral  climate that opposes criminal morality. The spirit of society is  predicated on the level of culture, on art. These are the most  effective levers of educational impact on the inner world of a  person, his formation. The church--yes! But the beneficial  influence of the goodness of the church shows up gradually,  being absorbed over several generations. This we will see in the  children that have not yet been born. Right now, what do we  have--people come to church in droves, while criminals keep  multiplying, ignoring everything, and occasionally even robbing  temples!    Only the spirituality of books, theater, cinema, and museums  are capable today of attracting people, bringing out of their  hearts an impulse for moral revival. To achieve this we have to  restore libraries to their proper place, subsidize theaters and  production of our films--fundamentally change the moral  atmosphere; only then will the code of legal norms really begin  to work!    After all, it is not that difficult to get rid of street  crime if needed. In this respect Zhirinovskiy is right--two  weeks of tough law enforcement on the city streets, and the  problem will go away. It is simply that right now nobody wants  to do this. As well as making the punishment commensurate with  the crime committed. For instance, you steal a hen and get eight  years, but you steal a car somebody had been saving for all his  life, and you get two years of probation! It is important to  correct all this, but only after the main two causes are  liquidated.    [Kotlyar] Stanislav Sergeyevich, now that you are a deputy  and can observe from inside the law-making mechanism, how do you  explain that laws on corruption and organized crime still have  not been adopted; that the notions of "leader" and "organizer"  have not been defined? Without these legal norms the militia is  practically toothless.    [Govorukhin] You reason the same way as the MVD! This is not  the point. Of course, we need laws, and the law on corruption  has already been drafted and will be passed; however, without  uprooting socioeconomic roots this will have no effect on the  final outcome. Tell me, what keeps the militia from getting rid  of street crime today? The lack of a law on corruption?    [Kotlyar] We frequently ask this question and hear in reply:  We do not have enough personnel, we are being sidetracked into  maintaining law and order during manifestations...    [Govorukhin] How many times a year does this happen? Six  thousand people gather on national holidays. Is this really the  reason? The reason is different: the military and the militia  are being readied for suppression of all sorts of public unrest.  This is happening in the regions under the guise of protection  of borders, suppression of large-scale crime.    [Kotlyar] In your book "The Great Criminal Revolution" there  is this thought: A country that has betrayed its elderly does  not have a future. That is, the generation that won the war,  that built everything that still supports our life, has found  itself essentially struck out of life and doomed. In the name of  what? In your opinion, can this be corrected?    [Govorukhin] This is precisely the moral atmosphere I am  talking about. We have rejected the elderly, the keepers of  popular wisdom and morality, people who have been revered at all  times. Among other peoples the notion of an elder is a symbol of  respect. The leadership should be comprised of people who  understand well what they are doing and what responsibility they  have to the history of the country. Take cinematography. This is  where perestroyka actually began. Like a drop reflects the sea,  this small cell of society reflects all the consequences to come  of the mistakes that have been made: The system of movie  distribution--the best in the world--has been destroyed; the  elders of the profession, who brought world fame to national  cinematography, have been relegated to the trash heap; state  support for production of Russian films has been removed; and  what did we get--ruin! Cinematography is not a  country--everything happens fast there. But was it not possible  to draw correct conclusions from the initial stage of the  experiment? No, they continued along this road, and as a result  the entire country, its entire industry and agriculture, have  been destroyed...    [Kotlyar] Stanislav Sergeyevich, prominent politicians  believe that the "Chinese way" is unsuitable for Russia...    [Govorukhin] Well, but you see, they all play tennis!  Remember Dostoyevskiy: Smerdyukov could not imagine  restructuring Russia without the Germans and the French. Our  rulers are the same way; they have forgotten our own history and  literature; they do not remember that from time immemorial the  Russian eagle has been looking to the West and to the East,  picking the best in different parts of the world.    [Kotlyar] And at the same time, it is laughable, but one can  find examples in the press that when they want to show the good  side of capitalism, they say that China and Turkey have fed and  clothed Russia in no time at all! Meanwhile, the trade routes  from Turkey and the ill-starred China are littered with young  victims. Is it possible to return this generation to a normal  life cycle?    [Govorukhin] This is a lost generation. We cannot pin any  hopes on it! They will not go to work in production, will not  defend the motherland, and of course will not want to dig into  the hard rock of science. They have been poisoned by the venom  of profit. A school of a young tribe of thieves. Children who  wash cars instead of learning. The usual argument--what is wrong  in this, let them learn how to work at a young age! Why do not  let children of big bureaucrats and nouveaux riches wash cars?  It is the children from impoverished families that stay  uneducated and quickly become criminalized. When a father is  asked to come to the school because his son is failing a grade,  he just shrugs: What can I do, I am unable to feed the family.  Children from well-to-do families will go to prestigious  lyceums, get a foreign education. The city of Zabaykalsk. By  night children rob railcars, and by day they work as rickshaws  for Chinese merchants. I saw these children--they are happy to  have what they have. They simply do not know that there can be a  different life... This is what has been done to the young  generation. And this is the worst. Not the plundered mineral  resources--this is bad, but we can survive it, ours is a rich  country; a future destroyed, however, cannot be replaced!    The substance of reforms, for the sake of which we have  sacrificed our children, is that in the 1990's inflationary  processes in the West abated dramatically, and business  activities picked up. Western economists write that about $30  billion flows there annually and work for Western capital. It is  rubbish that the West feeds Russia. John Ross puts it straight:  It is the exhausted Russia that feeds the well-to-do West. Due  to diminished internal consumption, Russia exports more fuel and  raw materials... From my own observations--Kentavr, a Chita  company, signed a contract with a Chinese company to sell  KamAZes. One KamAZ--one tonne of chewing gum! Nineteen trucks  for 19 tonnes of chewing gum! Here is a principle for you. The  more unprofitable the contract is for the state, the greater the  income "on the side!" The result: Several hundred thousands  dollars landed in the Chita company's foreign bank account. An  enormous crime against the state is being committed!    [Kotlyar] You voted for the amnesty. The law enforcement  organs maintain that many of those serving time for grave crimes  will fall under the formal provisions of the amnesty.    [Govorukhin] Quite possibly. This is not the State Duma's  initiative, however, but the president's. His draft edict on  amnesty covered only criminals. How can one start living by a  new constitution by issuing an edict freeing criminals when the  country is in such a situation? The State Duma added a political  amnesty so that people would see that there are people among  deputies who understand very well and make proper judgments of  events. As it had been under unbridled Bolshevism, the authority  draws its strength from the criminal strata and seeks support  and understanding among them. The result: People tiredly reject  everything that is going on. I meet with people and I hear them  express horror over what happened during the days of October  1993; they also want to know more about the new  apostle--Zhirinovskiy.    [Kotlyar] By the way, what is your opinion of him?    [Govorukhin] If you listen to him, he is an ardent fighter  against the current authority. In reality, however, he is  Yeltsin's man. He supported all edicts, the new constitution--it  would not have passed without his support! He is now a very  convenient lightning rod to scare the people: You say we are  bad, and maybe it is so, but look! This is what you will get if  we go! A day does not go by without the mass media portraying  time and again "Zhirinovskiy's horrors." The authority cannot  survive without an enemy. And who is the enemy today?  Khasbulatov, who is sitting in Chechnya? Rutskoy, just released  from prison? Zhirinovskiy fits perfectly the leading part of  "enemy of the authority and the people." He is a very  sophisticated and adroit politician.    [Kotlyar] Who do you see as the leader of Russia?    [Govorukhin] There are many such people! The most important  thing for each of them is to be a sincere and convinced  democrat, a man of great culture and fine intuition, a man who  loves his people without reservation and is loyal to them. Not a  few fuehrer!    [Kotlyar] But every time there is a turn in history the  possibility of a fuehrer cannot be dismissed.    [Govorukhin] Everything is possible. But one can hardly  imagine anything worse than what we have now.    [Kotlyar] Right now you have to work in the State Duma on  collective decisions together with your opponents; how do you  feel being next to your colleagues in the deputy corps from the  opposing camp?    [Govorukhin] I do not understand the mentality of these  people; it is alien to me, and I do not try to find a common  language with them.    [Kotlyar] Do you think that the State Duma has a future?    [Govorukhin] No. It has no authority. It is being  discredited; washing dirty linen in public--a lot of that is  done. A demonstration for the people--what a collection of  never-do-gooders and loafers it is. The history of the Supreme  Soviet is being repeated. That one was disbanded to popular  applause. Now there will be a presidential edict to disband  another parliament, and everybody will say: This is great! It is  important to convince the people that Russia does not need a  parliament at all!    [Kotlyar] Why did you go there then?    [Govorukhin] I realized that this would be a powerless body,  but I could not imagine that it would also be completely mute.  There is no opportunity to appear on television, to publish in  newspapers. Only now has a small window opened. People, however,  want to talk to us. Take, for instance, my book "The Great  Criminal Revolution"--a million copies sold, in our times! You  cannot find it anymore. Dozens of regional newspapers reprinted  it in its entirety. I get swamped with questions, but it is very  difficult to find a forum where I can reach broad audiences.    [Kotlyar] What do you think of Kazannik in this recent  incident involving his resignation?    [Govorukhin] I think he is too naive a person, but  undoubtedly a man of integrity.    [Kotlyar] And about Rutskoy's trust contract?    [Govorukhin] Rutskoy was dangerous while he was in prison;  now the task is to discredit him as quickly as possible. This  case will be dusted off, although nothing can be proven there.  But if it cannot be proven, what happens then--will the new  procurator be held responsible? Hence, they will use all angles,  will again investigate the Revival Foundation, the Agrokhim, and  so on. I have said this many times already.    [Kotlyar] Are you currently making a new movie, writing a  new  book, or playing in a movie?    [Govorukhin] I have produced a video film with the same  title  as the book, and am working on a new expanded edition, which  will be translated into several languages.    [Kotlyar] Thank you for answering the newspaper's questions.</p>

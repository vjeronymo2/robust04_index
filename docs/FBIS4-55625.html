			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Bonn, Vienna, London: Klaus </F> Usually Knocks on Western Doors"]    [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' recent visit to Moscow  was a rare exception to the rule that has guided Czech foreign  policy since 1992: "Go West, Mr. Prime Minister." The April 4-5  trip was the first time the Czech prime minister has set foot in  a former Soviet republic since his party gained control in the  1992 elections.    Out of Klaus' 52 trips abroad as prime minister, 37 have  been  to Western countries. His visits to Germany outnumber those he  has made to the Czech Republic's fellow Visegrad  countries--Poland, Slovakia and Hungary--combined. His scheduled  trip next week to the far-flung capitals of Argentina, Chile and  Brazil, to foster commercial contacts, is an even more unusual  departure from his usual Western itinerary.    Klaus has been singled out for criticism in the Central  European press for his alleged neglect of the Visegrad countries  and his generally non-cooperative and competitive relationship  with them.    "It's not true," Klaus shot back in an interview with the  daily LIDOVE NOVINY, published April 8. "I meet with Polish  politicians more than anyone else."    But the fact that Klaus has made three official visits to  Poland as prime minister--and has met with Polish government  representatives both here and in other countries--is  overshadowed by the overall pro-Western drive of his government.    "The orientation of the Czech Republic is clear," said Jan  Zahradil, a foreign advisor for Klaus' Civic Democratic Party  (ODS). "It's our aim to get into the Western European  structures, so of course the frequency of visits [to the West]  would be higher than, say, to Hungary or Poland."    As might be expected, Germany tops Klaus' destination list  with 13 official, unofficial and working visits in the past 21  months. Second on the list is Austria, with five visits. In  comparison, the closest he has come to visiting an Asian or  Middle Eastern country was a three-day working trip to Israel in  February. He has visited the Czech Republic's fellow Visegrad  countries a combined total of eight times.    The unabashed pro-Western push of Klaus' foreign policy was  apparent even in his seemingly less important visit to Finland  last month. "Finland is important because it's waiting to get  into the European Union. So Mr. Klaus sent there to see how the  preparations are getting along. To see it with his own eyes,"  said Zahradil.    The prime minister's trip to Russia caused a minor stir in  Moscow. The Izvestia news agency requested an article from him  on economic reform, and he gave a well-attended lecture at a  Moscow university on systemic reform in former communist  countries. When it was all over, Klaus walked away with a  promise from the Russian side to sign an agreement within two  months on paying off its $3.4 billion debt to the Czech  Republic. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said his  country can learn something from the Czech experience.    But even in this cheery diplomatic setting, Klaus made it  clear that he was mainly in the East to collect debt from the  Russians, not to work out any sort of alliance. The closest he  came to officially complimenting Russian leaders was to say that  he "found the political and economic situation a bit more stable  than anticipated."    By contrast, a Russian television report on Klaus' life was  filled with compliments. "Klaus is a born polemicist, armed with  well-considered arguments, erudition and irony as well."    It is clear that there is also a personal dimension to the  government's strongly Western policy. Klaus seems far more  comfortable in the company of Western leaders and business  people; his visits to Western countries don't necessarily have  to hold a direct political or economic aim.    Last month, he personally brought a huge bouquet of flowers  to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and stood  beaming beside her as camera shutters clicked. "They are very  good friends," said Lucie Weissova, a journalist for Czech Radio  who occasionally covers Klaus' trips abroad. "He couldn't let  this meeting go by. They agree on everything." Later, Klaus  wrote a lovingly nostalgic article for LIDOVE NOVINY about  London and British right-wing politics, titled "English  Conservatism Is Close to Us."    But Klaus doesn't let politics get in the way of good  relations with important Western neighbors. So when Rudolf  Scharping, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party and a  strong candidate for German chancellor, passed through Prague,  he met with both Klaus and President Vaclav Havel.    The ODS' Zahradil said this is an honor not afforded most  other countries' opposition party leaders during an election  year. However, since Scharping might be the leader of the Czech  Republic's most important economic partner by year's end, usual  procedures were waived.    When deciding which countries to pay an official visit to,  the Klaus government has the advantage of a world-renowned  president in Havel. So while the prime minister has never been  to Asia, Havel has. Other politically problematic invitations,  from countries such as Syria or Iran, are normally given to  other government ministers or deputy ministers, Zahradil said.    But as far as Western Europe is concerned,  invitations--whether to meet a head of state or to visit a  university for an honorable doctorate--are always given special  consideration. "One of the aims of the Czech Republic is to  have good relations with all our neighbors," said Zahradil. "Of  course, Hungary isn't as important as Germany."</p>

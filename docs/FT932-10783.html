			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: UK in no rush to step up pressure OFFICIAL attempts to bring Mr Asil Nadir back to the UK to face trial failed to advance yesterday as the attention of senior Foreign Office ministers remained focused on Bosnia. At the same time, other government departments said they were not involved in any new high-level initiatives to secure Mr Nadir's return. Mr Candemir Onhon, Turkey's ambassador to the UK, was summoned to the Foreign Office, but Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister, later cancelled a meeting with him to answer a question in the House of Commons on developments in Bosnia. As a result, the moves to have Mr Nadir returned were put on hold, having failed to make any headway the day before when the Turkish Cypriot administration rebuffed an approach from the British High Commission in Nicosia. The Foreign Office said: 'Mr Garel-Jones will press for Turkey to apply pressure for Mr Nadir's return.' No other steps would be considered until the result of political pressure on Turkey became clear, it added. The Serious Fraud Office was in direct contact with the Foreign Office yesterday, and continued to maintain that Mr Nadir's September trial had every chance of proceeding. Unofficially, however, other agencies in the City remained doubtful that his return could be arranged from the unrecognised break-away republic. The Department of Trade and Industry, the ministry directly responsible for the SFO's investigations and prosecutions, said it was not playing any part in the attempts to secure Mr Nadir's return. The Bank of England, which has emergency powers to apply financial sanctions against northern Cyprus, said that it had not been involved in any discussions with the Foreign Office, and did not expect the question of sanctions to be raised, at least for some time.</p>

The law establishes  the legal status of the country's medical institutions and the  basis of financing of the health care system.    The law defines medical aid as the activity of doctors with  a  higher medical education to protect people's health, prolong  their lives and improve the quality of life. Medical aid is  arranged on three levels: general and specialized aid at the  local government level and specialized medical aid on the  national level.    A national Health Care Council is to be set up under the  government. General administration and supervision of health  care will be placed in the hands of the Social Affairs Ministry.  County medical officers are going to shape the state's health  care policy on the regional level. They will be appointed for a  term of five years by county elders, who coordinate the  nomination with the Social Affairs Ministry.    The law on the health care system takes effect on Feb. 15.    The legislators amended the law on the relation between the  local and the state budgets, and continued the second reading of  the surveillance bill. Also Jaan Luik, a member of the State  Court, was sworn in.</p>

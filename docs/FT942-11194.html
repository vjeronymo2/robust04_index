			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Avesta Sheffield Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel producer, yesterday struck an optimistic note about prospects in 1994 after a strong recovery in the first quarter. The group, which is 40 per cent owned by British Steel, made a SKr111m (Dollars 14m) profit after financial items, compared with a SKr43m loss in the same 1993 quarter. The loss for the whole of last year totalled SKr98m. It said the performance had benefited from higher demand, cost-cutting and changes to inventory prices. Mr Per Molin, president, said the improved profits level was expected to be maintained over the rest of the year, against a background of general economic recovery in the western world. He forecast a continued upturn in demand for the group's products, but warned it might not be at the same rate as in the first quarter because of restocking. He noted that prices were recovering but 'they have not yet reached a satisfactory level and are still below 1993 average levels'. Demand for the group's main products, cold rolled sheet and plate, rose strongly in early 1994. Together with the weaker krona, the trend enabled the group to lift sales to SKr3.98bn from SKr3.49bn. Sales of cold rolled sheet and plate rose to SKr2.04bn from SKr1.80bn but the division tumbled to a SKr6m loss from a SKr27m profit because prices were lower. A recovery is expected over the rest of the year. The group's hot rolled plate division achieved a SKr45m profit after last year's SKr18m loss, as turnover climbed to SKr635m from SKr587m. Avesta, which was formed in late 1992 from a merger between Avesta and the stainless steel interests of British Steel, recently approved a SKr592.5m rights issue. It plans to invest more than SKr1bn over the next three years.</p>

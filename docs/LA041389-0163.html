			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL LOOK AT ANTI-GAY EFFORT DUE  </P> <P> Before putting the measure on a ballot, the Irvine City Council has ordered a  legal analysis of a controversial initiative that would remove homosexuals from  the protection of a human rights ordinance.  </P> <P> It will be the first time in Orange County that the issue of equal rights for  gays has been put before voters.  </P> <P> The council Tuesday night told the city attorney to report back May 9 on the  legal and other ramifications of the initiative.  </P> <P> The initiative qualified for the ballot after the Irvine Values Coalition, a  group made up primarily of residents who are religious fundamentalists,  collected 5,433 signatures.  </P> <P> The measure, if approved, will remove the words "sexual orientation" from the  ordinance, which was passed last year and bans discrimination on the basis of  sex, race, religion, physical handicaps, marital status and sexual orientation.  The measure will also require approval by the city's voters on any future law  involving sexual orientation.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran said he wants the city attorney to study the initiative so  that council members have as much information as possible before assigning the  measure to an election.  </P> <P> The City Council could hold the election on Nov. 7, consolidating it with the  school district's election at a cost of $35,000, or wait until the council  elections on June 5, 1990. A move by Councilman Edward A. Dornan to assign it  to the November ballot, without the attorney's report, failed 3-2.  </P> <P> Scott Peotter, chairman of the Irvine Values Coalition, says his group prefers  waiting for the 1990 election so that the measure will not cost the city money.  But if the city schedules a park bonds election in November, he prefers the  earlier date.  </P> <P> "I'm happy the citizens will have an opportunity to have a say on this," he  said, adding that the initiative will delete "special protection for gays and  lesbians."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Equal vs. Special Rights  </P> <P> But James Boone, the mayor's appointee to the human rights committee that  recommended the ordinance, said the ordinance guarantees equal rights, not  special rights.  </P> <P> "It applies to everyone equally," he said.  </P> <P> Boone said Peotter's group is "trying to impose their moral and religious  standards on Irvine. . . . It is clearly an attempt to establish their right to  discriminate."  </P> <P> He predicted that voters will reject the initiative. Orange County is  conservative on issues of defense and economics but is "pro-choice,  pro-privacy. . . . They want government out of their bedroom."  </P></p>

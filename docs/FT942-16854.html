			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Challenge to union candidate Rival factions in Spain's General Workers' Union (UGT), the Socialist labour confederation, yesterday joined battle over a new leadership, at a time when the union's fortunes and its relations with the Socialist government are at a low ebb. A little-known unionist from Andalucia, Mr Candido Mendez, appeared well placed to take over the leadership at the end of the union's four-day congress on Sunday, as the chosen successor of the veteran Mr Nicolas Redondo. However, Mr Mendez faces a challenge from the more combative Mr Manuel Fernandez, head of the UGT's powerful metalworkers' federation, who is strongly supported in the industrial and mining regions of northern Spain.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Chamber members to vote on merger Plans for the merger of north-east England's three chambers of commerce to create one of the UK's biggest chambers will be put to the vote next week. Unveiling details of the proposal yesterday, the senior figures in all three chambers stressed their support for the merger. They believe a merger would strengthen the north-east's business voice and enhance the services available to member companies while achieving economies of scale. The 100 members of the Tynedale Chamber have already backed the plans. On Monday, extraordinary general meetings in Billingham and Gateshead will seek the support of the 2,800 members of the Teesside and Tyne and Wear chambers. If they agree, the merger will be completed by January 1995, creating one of the five-largest chambers in the UK. The new North East Chamber would have almost 3,000 members, from companies such as ICI to individual entrepreneurs, and an annual turnover, including training activities, of about Pounds 4m. It would continue to be owned and run by its members and is expected to work closely with the emerging national one-stop shop Business Links advice network, championed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The three chambers' present 51 staff would continue to be employed by the merged chamber. A new head office in Durham is planned, supported by satellite offices based in Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Durham, South Tyneside and Newcastle. The chamber would also have a presence in several other locations in the region. It is expected to seek help from the Department of Trade and Industry towards the Pounds 224,000 restructuring costs. The chief executive post for the new body would be advertised. The proposed merger accords with the Association of British Chamber of Commerce's strategy of creating a 'quality network' by forming larger chambers. At present, it has 110 member chambers in the UK, representing 85,000 businesses. Its aim is to reduce the number of chambers in the next few years to about 50, through mergers and joint operational arrangements. The proposed merger was described yesterday by Teesside Chamber president Mr Brian Beaumont as 'the biggest single event in the long history of the three chambers'. Tyne and Wear Chamber traces its roots back to 1815, making it one of Britain's oldest chambers. Teesside's Chamber's origins lie in the Stockton-on-Tees Chamber, founded 131 years ago. Tynedale, which covers part of Northumberland, was founded in 1984.</p>

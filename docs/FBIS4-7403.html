			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta (BISNIS)--Bankers and securities companies  hope the government will give guarantees to investors holding  BAPINDO [State Trading Bank] bonds, because investors are  disturbed by the conditions they see at the BUMN [state-owned  enterprise] bank, which has been hit by a crisis. Several  brokers and bankers told BISNIS yesterday that BAPINDO, which  went public through the issuance of about 800 billion rupiah in  bonds, must give guarantees to investors that their investments  are safe.    "Holders of BAPINDO bonds are now generally disturbed," said  a broker who did not want his name mentioned. In fact, he  added, some of the bonds that were issued have fallen due, but  many that have not yet fallen due are in the hands of investors.    "To reassure investors, there should be a statement from the  government," he said.    Meanwhile, Mas Abdurachim Husein, chairman of the  Association  of Stock Brokers Representatives (AWP2E), said that it is  difficult to sell BAPINDO bonds now. "To reassure investors, I  also hope that there will be a statement from the government  that BAPINDO bondholders are safe," he urged. BAPINDO has  issued bonds seven times, the most recent in January of last  year at a value of 300 billion rupiah. Those bonds were issued  in series J and at both fixed and floating interest rates.    The fixed interest rate was 17.25 percent per annum for the  first through the fourth interest coupons. Floating interest  rates were in effect for the second, third, fourth, and fifth  years and applied to the fifth through the 20th coupons, based  on average interest rates for three-month time deposits at the  State Savings Bank.    BISNIS sources at BUMN's in the sphere of the Department of  Finance said that the arrest of three BAPINDO directors does not  mean that they are suspects. "It is possible that two of them  are suspects and that one is only a witness," he said.</p>

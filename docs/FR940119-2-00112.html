After the initial report has been submitted, the operator is required to submit a supplemental written report whenever additional relevant information is obtained concerning the particular incident or accident. The form to be used for supplemental reports is the same as for the initial report, and submittal must be no later than 30 days after acquiring the additional information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All relevant costs must be included in the estimated property damage total on the initial written incident or accident report as well as supplemental reports. This includes (but is not limited to) costs due to property damage to the operator's facilities and to property of others, commodity/product not recovered, facility repair and replacement, gas distribution service restoration and relighting, leak locating, right-of-way clean up and environmental clean up and damage. Facility repair, replacement or change that is not related to the incident but is done by the operator as a matter of convenience (for example, to take advantage of access to facilities unearthed because of the incident) should not be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An April 2, 1974, letter from the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to Lakehead Pipeline Company included an interpretation that ``*&blank;*&blank;* the value of any commodity lost or fittings used during repair which become permanently attached to the system *&blank;*&blank;*'' is not to be included in the estimate of total property damage. This interpretation is no longer applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A review of a sampling of incident and accident reports has revealed two problems with the reports:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Supplemental reports were seldom submitted, and (2) many estimates of property damage totals were low and appeared to be incomplete, particularly in regard to environmental damage including costs associated with cleanup.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to item (1), this advisory is a reminder to operators that supplemental reports updating data in the report are required to be submitted to OPS. Concerning item (2), there has been some misunderstanding on what costs to include in estimating property damage totals, perhaps because of the April 2, 1974, OPS letter to Lakehead Pipe Line Company. OPS wants all property damage costs associated with the failures reported on the report forms, particularly the costs of environmental damage and cleanup costs. Property damage costs that are determined after the initial submittal of the report forms should be submitted in additional supplemental report forms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on January 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard L.

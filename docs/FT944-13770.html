			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lep acts to cut Pounds 340m debt Lep Group, the lossmaking freight forwarding and security company, has begun intensive talks with its lenders in a bid to reduce its Pounds 340m debt. The group - restructured in 1992 in one of the UK's largest debt - for-equity swaps - admitted yesterday that its core businesses could no longer service interest payments, which totalled Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 17.5m) in the six months to June 30. Mr David James, the company doctor appointed chairman by the banks two and a half years ago, said the company was anxious both to reduce Pounds 169m of 'dead debts' from discontinued businesses and to refinance National Guardian Corporation (NGC), its US security business. 'The company is addressing these problems with our banks but it could be a year before the discussions are completed.' Lep's bankers currently hold 85 per cent of the equity, which they exchanged for Pounds 180m of debt two years ago when group borrowings stood at Pounds 630m. Although the group has reduced borrowings through a series of disposals, including the Pounds 89m sale earlier this year of Swiss Bank House in London, Mr James said the core businesses could only afford interest payments on the Pounds 149m portion of the debt which they used for working capital. Their ability even to meet those payments was hampered in the first half by Pounds 2.92m of exceptional charges covering restructuring, litigation costs and the security division's withdrawal from its special engineering business. Those charges helped cut operating profits from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 9.95m. Interest payments, a Pounds 2.57m provision for loss on the disposals and a Pounds 1m loss on the closure of Lep Industrial Holdings together contributed to increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.66m (Pounds 5.05m). Turnover was up at Pounds 723m (Pounds 703m). Mr James said the core security and freight forwarding businesses remained profitable, but their performance had been undermined by a series of 'disastrous' acquisitions in the 1980s. 'Our strategy has been to get rid of anything which is not fundamental to our two main activities,' he added. The group said it would sell its distribution business, supplying mainly automotive components, 'within a few weeks' and was determined to further restructure its freight forwarding businesses. It also predicted that it would agree a refinancing package for NGC in the first quarter of next year. Losses per share increased from 0.7p to 1.1p, and with no funds to pay a dividend, Mr James warned: 'There can be no expectation of a dividend payment in the foreseeable future'.</p>

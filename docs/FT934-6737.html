			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / The FT's New Statistics:  Wide-ranging changes are introduced today in the financial tables published in the second edition of the Financial Times. Peter Martin explains the new look Every day, the tables of statistics at the back of the FT chart the temperature of the world's financial markets. Changing them is not something to be lightly undertaken. Not only are the routines of compilation built into the day to day rhythms of the statisticians who prepare them; the habits of hundreds of thousands of readers are also built around the entirely predictable appearance of a particular table, in a particular form, on a particular page of pink newsprint. The mutual interests of consumers and producers thus tends towards a profound conservatism. The main FT-SE Actuaries table, published six days a week in the FT, today follows recognisably the same form as it did a generation ago, though the index itself and the equity market it measures have both undergone profound changes in the past three decades. This slow accretion of statistical tradition has many advantages from the point of view of the FT and its readers. But it has one over-riding disadvantage: the risk that tables gradually drift, over time, away from the relevance. Individual tables are introduced to meet new needs, but their contents are rarely revised as those needs change. Thus each table risks becoming a snapshot of the set of securities, currencies and issues which were important at the time of the table's creation, even if those have long been superseded by later market developments. We have therefore carefully assessed every table in the second section of the FT, to make sure that all of them reflect the most urgent needs of the papers' readers, and to eliminate any creeping inconsistences. There are hundreds of detailed changes in the pages that follow. Overall, however, there are five main themes BONDS The paper has now gathered together its international fixed-income coverage on to a single page. The International Capital Markets page now carries not just the daily reports on government bonds and the Eurobond market, but also all the tables that support them. Thus, the benchmark government bonds table and the FT/ISMA Eurobond service are accompanied by the UK gilts prices, which are now laid out in a format more suited to bond prices. The supporting data on the UK equity market, which formerly filled a portion of this page, has now moved. In the UK edition of the FT it can be found on the World Stock Markets pages, and in the international edition on the London Stock Market page. The statistical coverage of bonds is amplified by moving the derivatives on long-term interest rates to lie alongside the cash market. DERIVATIVES A standard approach has been adopted throughout the paper: in general, tables reporting on derivatives contracts are now printed alongside their underlying markets. Thus, futures and options on long-term interest rates move to the Capital Markets page, equity index derivatives can be found on the World Stock Markets and London Stock Market pages. Derivatives on currencies and short-term interest rates remain on the Currencies and Money page, but are clearly divided between the two sections of the page. We have adopted standard new formats for both futures and options; the futures format provides much better reporting of volume and open interest figures, where they are available. Derivatives are grouped by product, rather than by the market on which they were listed. Thus, we no longer show a single block of contracts traded on Liffe; instead, they have been divided up between subject areas, so that for instance French Pibor futures from MATIF exchange are shown alongside Liffe's short-term interest futures on other currencies. Over time, we plan to adjust derivatives listings so as to reflect the main contracts of interest to FT readers, regardless of where they are traded. INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES The main World Stock Markets tables - both those covering individual equities and those reporting on stock market indices - have been expanded in content, without taking up any more space. There is now scope for all individual international equities listings to show highs and lows achieved by the stock and to carry dividend yields and price/earnings ratios. Initially, not all shares are accompanied by these two ratios, but we shall be filling in the holes on this page one by one over the next few months. There are more stock market indices, better displayed. In particular, we have expanded our coverage of indices from emerging stock markets, both individually and collectively. CURRENCIES AND MONEY This page has undergone the most radical changes. The bond derivatives and equity futures and equity index options and futures moved to new homes, and the space left behind has been devoted to much more comprehensive currency coverage. The most immediate change to strike the reader, however, is the combination of what were until now two separate articles - on foreign exchange and money markets - into a single market report. The money market report has abandoned its exclusive UK focus in recent years, providing a report on any money market developments of interest to FT readers, with a special emphasis on the Continent. This has led to an increasing degree of overlap between the money market report and the foreign exchange report, since the same developments often needed to be summarised in each place. Combining the two will allow these two intimately entwined markets to be reported on side by side. As before, however, we remain committed to full reporting of UK money-market activities. The main currency tables, the pound and dollar tables, have been greatly expanded to show comprehensive rates for a wider set of countries, arranged by geographical region. Mid-rates are now instantly visible, instead of requiring mental arithmetic. The cross-rates table has also been expanded. Derivatives on currencies and short-term interest rates have been grouped alongside the cash markets they reflect. The FT's daily Libor rate has a new home on the page. UK base rates are now listed in a table that also shows comparable rates from other major economies. TYPOGRAPHY AND DESIGN The tables now have a consistent 'look', drawing on the FT's standard sans-serif typeface, Helvetica. Market reports now have their own livery, again using Helvetica, to distinguish them from news stories and news analyses. This supplement highlights the most important tables in the Companies and Markets section of the FT, and explains how they work. Not all the tables in the paper are included; but the ones which have undergone most change are covered in the next three pages, as well as a few which are unchanged but are at the heart of our statistical coverage. We are conscious that many readers may find the change to the new tables inconvenient: some tables have moved to new pages, others have taken on new shapes. We ask you to bear with us during the early days of inconvenience, until the new presentation becomes as familiar as the old. The old tables stood us in good stead for many years; we say goodbye to them now only because the time has come to usher in their replacements. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The work of reassessing and redesigning the tables has been a huge task, stretching over two years. The undertaking owes a great deal to preparatory work undertaken by Julian Chaffee, then on secondment to the newspaper from FT Analysis. As always in statistical matters, however, the devil is in the detail. The detailed work has fallen on the table experts of FT Statistics, under the guidance of Adrian Dicks and Gary Hayes. The changes have been accompanied by a complete rebuilding of the computer system which holds the FT's statistical databases, carried out by a team headed by Ian Craig. The design of the new tables has been carried out by the FT's editorial design department, headed by David Case, with much of the detailed typography performed by Phil Hunt. The redesigned pages have been ushered into the paper by Bob Garton of the editorial production team. Mike Gardner, head of editorial information services, kept the project on track. We are very grateful to those of our readers who have responded to our questions about how to improve the tables, or who have taken the trouble to write in with suggestions and comments. There are too many of them to thank individually, but we are very conscious of the effort and time that they devoted. Many thanks to all.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       WHERE THE TABLES HAVE MOVED  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table                                   Destination  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Long-term interest options/futures      International Capital Markets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK Gilts prices                         International Capital Markets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK Equity options                       with World Stock Markets reports                                         (in UK edition); with London                                         Stock Exchange reports                                         (International Edition)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London recent issues - Equities;        with World Stock Markets reports FT Equity indices, other UK             (in UK edition); with London Equity tables                           Stock Exchange reports                                         (International Edition)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK equity options/futures               with London Stock Exchange                                         reports  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- International options/futures           on World Stock Market prices                                         page  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Crossword                               on the Commodities page  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK base rates                           with Money tables on the                                         currencies and Money page  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New York rates, short-term              Currencies page Long-term                               International Capital Markets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT Guide to World Currencies            move from Tuesday to Monday  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

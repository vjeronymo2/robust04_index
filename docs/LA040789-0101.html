			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A longtime friend and adviser of Ben Johnson in Toronto said that the sprinter  was capable of handling most of his own business affairs without assistance,  countering suggestions by Johnson's attorney that the sprinter did not have the  intelligence to know whether he was using anabolic steroids.  </P> <P> Ross Earl, president of the track and field club of which Johnson was a member  for 12 years, told the Canadian government's commission of inquiry into drug  use by athletes that Johnson chose his own architect for the house he was  having built outside Toronto, negotiated mortgage agreements and dealt with a  real estate agent.  </P> <P> Earlier in the hearings, Johnson's attorney, Ed Futerman, suggested that  Johnson was a slow-witted and uneducated young man who was duped into taking  steroids by his coach, Charlie Francis.  </P> <P> Also Thursday, a former Canadian sprinter, Cheryl Thibedeau, disputed testimony  by her former boyfriend, sprinter and bobsledder Andrew Mowatt, that he was not  aware he was injected with steroids by Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who also treated  Johnson and other Canadian athletes. Thibedeau said, "He knew what he was  getting."  </P></p>

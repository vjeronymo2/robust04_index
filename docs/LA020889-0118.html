			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PIER TO BE REBUILT WITH PLASTIC-COATED PILINGS  </P> <P> The 77-year-old Huntington Beach Pier, closed last summer after officials  deemed it unsafe, will be rebuilt out of plastic-coated steel pilings that  resist corrosion.  </P> <P> The City Council voted, 7 to 0, Monday night to adopt the recommendation of a  citizens committee to use the polyethylene-covered steel, a relatively new  alternative for rebuilding concrete and wood piers.  </P> <P> Engineers told the committee last month that using concrete would add as much  as a year to reconstruction of the pier, perhaps crippling the city's ambitious  downtown redevelopment plans.  </P> <P> Moffatt &amp; Nichol Engineers of Long Beach told the committee that the pier  could be rebuilt with wood at about one-third the cost of concrete, but that  wood also has only a third the life span of concrete.  </P> <P> The committee -- made up of citizens, development representatives, merchants  and two council members -- has not yet made a recommendation on what material  should be used to rebuild the pier's deck. However, members said, steel has  been ruled out.  </P> <P> High seas that pounded the coast a year ago this month ripped off 250 feet of  the pier's seaward end, including a restaurant. Engineers told city officials  in July that the steel skeleton of the 1,800-foot pier and its cross beams had  eroded so severely that it was no longer safe.  </P> <P> Once the roughly $10 million to pay for rebuilding the pier is secured,  reconstruction should take about a year, engineers say. City officials say they  hope to reopen the pier by late spring, 1991.  </P></p>

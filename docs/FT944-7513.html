			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Observer: Wheels oiled Indonesia's President Suharto is getting a reputation as a man who can get things done. Having made sure that the leaders at last week's Apec summit did not get drenched - he laid on a pawang hujan (rain man) to pray for dry weather - he seems to have been responsible for banging heads together at this week's Opec conference. Opec has been looking for a new secretary general since June and it seemed as if the latest Opec meeting would pass without a decision; both Iran and Venezuela wanted their man to get the job. However, Suharto broke the deadlock with a phone call to Iran's President Rafsanjani urging him to accept Nigeria's Rilwanu Lukman as Opec's next chief. A slightly surprising choice - given Nigeria's reputation as Opec's bad boy for consistently flouting production ceilings. Even so, the fact that Opec can agree on something is bound to send the right sort of signal to the world's oil markets.</p>

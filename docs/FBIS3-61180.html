			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Polyakov: "Constitutional Democrats of </F> National Salvation"]    [Text] A few days ago in a conference hall of Rossiya  hotel, a theatrical production with the intriguing title "The  14th Congress of the Constitutional Democratic Party"  (Astafyev's) took place. Unfortunately, we have to register the  fact that the production went unnoticed by the theater-going  public--no playbills, and the tickets were distributed only  among those who have proven in deed their loyalty to the idea of  "national salvation" in the National Salvation Front [FNS]  version. About 30 such persons have indeed been found. The  congress was preceded by a thorough purge of the party,  conducted after the Central Electoral Commission had  disqualified a considerable number of signatures collected with  the help of the Communist Party, Baburin's ROS [Russian  All-People's Union], Nevzorov's Ours movement, and other kindred  organizations. The first step was the unmasking of the "gang of  four," headed by Dmitriy Rogozin, which consisted of members of  the Constitutional Democratic Party (the Party of the People's  Freedom) Central Committee, who were expelled from the  organization "for losing touch with the party."    A listless fight had been going on in the cadet  [Constitutional Democratic Party] party for a year between the  supporters of the National Salvation Front and its opponents,  who considered cooperation with communists impossible in  principle. The latter congregated in the Renewal Union and the  Congress of Russian Communities.    The events of September-October 1993 sharply changed the  situation. Having agreed to consider Boris Yeltsin's actions  unconstitutional, the "Astafyevites" and "Rogozinites" disagreed  on a main point: The way out of the crisis. And while the former  continued to follow the line of irreconcilable opposition, the  latter, having encountered the inability of the Supreme Soviet's  leadership to offer a constructive alternative, bet their chips  on the Federation Council and the tough position of the regions.  The military action at Ostankino and the White House drew the  line on this discussion. At a hastily convened plenum, Mikhail  Astafyev was asked to brief his colleagues on his activities in  the FNS leadership and to pay the bills by giving up the  position of Central Committee chairman.    Mikhail Astafyev rejected the accusations directed at him,  and characterized the activities of his opponents as "an attempt  to split the party on the eve of the elections."    After numerous violations of procedural matters and  manipulation of the votes of the absent Central Committee  members, delegations of regional party organizations left the  meeting hall in protest. As is known, however, a sacred place is  never empty, and at the next get-together, about 20 people who  have never been cadet party members gathered in the hall. Among  them were persons of certain renown--Artem Artemov and Nikolay  Andrianov, members of the FNS executive committee. To the  question when these gentlemen had managed to join the cadet  party, Mikhail Astafyev answered without blinking an eye that it  had happened between the two "conferences." That figures. After  the suspension of FNS' activities, its membership began  converging in droves under the Constitutional Democratic Party's  banners. Will Mr. Astafyev continue to claim now successorship  to the party of P. Milyukov, P. Struve, and V. Nabokov?  According to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, it was the cadet party that  expressed the interests of liberal intelligentsia, thus clearing  the way for the Bolsheviks by its radicalism. Future generations  do have something to blame them for. But not to this extent.    A necessary afterword.    In January 1994 the supporters of constitutional democracy  are convening for their next congress.</p>

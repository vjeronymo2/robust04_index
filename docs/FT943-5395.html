			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Interview: The wheel turns full circle for Dr Steiner - Oxford is about to welcome back a thinker it rejected 40 years ago George Steiner sips from a glass of white wine in the corner of a Cambridgeshire pub and confesses that the latest twist in his academic life reads like the climax of a 'bad novel'. Forty-two years ago, a precocious graduate from Chicago and Harvard, he submitted his doctorate to the English faculty at Oxford, and it was turned down. That doyenne of the academic literary world, Dame Helen Gardner, told him his work was a worthwhile study in comparative literature, but as that subject did not exist at Oxford, the examiners were not able to oblige. 'One day,' she added, 'it may well arrive here; but right now it is not in the rubric.' Next month, Steiner, first visiting professor of European Comparative Literature at Oxford, gives his inaugural lecture in the subject which prompted such a cursory dismissal all those years ago. The ironies of his appointment will doubtless be given an airing in the university's imposing Examination Schools building, but his tone will be affectionate: 'Dame Helen was right; she was always right. It just took 42 years, which, by Oxbridge standards, is not too bad.' In the weeks leading up to the lecture, Steiner is feeling remarkably relaxed about the world. His magnanimous mood enables him to skip over incidents which have become some of the most enduring tales in that curious, twilight world of academic mythology. For the Oxford snub was not his last unhappy encounter with authority; more was to come. He re-submitted a substantially different thesis to comply with regulations, and after spells at The Economist and Princeton, was invited to become a founding fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. Once there, he began to lecture with unusual charisma to packed audiences, but he had failed to take the hint from the Other Place; his first course was on how to read poetry after Marx, Freud and Levi-Strauss. Traditional English literature it was not. One day, the story goes, a senior member of faculty arrived to assess Steiner's credentials to be appointed to a full lectureship. Steiner was talking about Theodor Adorno's bleak conclusion that there could be no poetry after Auschwitz. The faculty member walked out in mid-lecture, ostentatiously, angrily. 'When I was on the Burma death railway,' he allegedly told colleagues, 'Steiner was sitting safely in his New York apartment. I will not be lectured by him on Nazi atrocities.' Not only was there no lectureship; Steiner was told not to bother applying again. So began the breach between Steiner, the archetypal Jewish, Mitteleuropean, polyglot intellectual, and the English academic establishment. Although appointed to an extraordinary fellowship at Churchill so that he could carry out his research, he ceased teaching in Cambridge. In 1974 he accepted a chair in Geneva, in which he has spent half his working time ever since. Now, at 65, he is back in the fold. The sense of the wheel having turned full circle in the year of his official retirement from Geneva gives Steiner an almost happy-go-lucky air which sits uneasily with the brooding intensity and sharp sense of melancholy of his prose. Even when conversation turns light, however, it rarely becomes trivial; describing the simple, quotidian joys of waking up in the morning, Steiner typically manages to quote Hegel: 'A Jew is a man who, given the choice between eternal salvation and tomorrow's newspaper, will choose the newspaper.' He is insistent that any rancour he has carried inside him has been finally dispersed: 'There were mistakes on both sides; I was not easy to be with. Bitterness would be folly.' Many take the Steiner story to be the classic case study of the collision between English intellectual values - oblique, clenched, bracingly empirical and fiercely pragmatic - and those of 'continental' Europe - bold, speculative, swathed in abstraction and rhetoric. It is not a new story, by any means; but when Steiner moves in his unmistakable lilting tones from Mallarme to Heidegger, Rilke to Benjamin, Hegel to Derrida, one can hear the mocking chorus at his shoulder: 'pretentious'; 'charlatan'; most damning, and English, of all: 'too clever by half]' Steiner is not unaware of the charges, but these days shrugs them aside. In fact, his relationship with English intellectual life is complex; he has, after all, spent a large part of his life in English university towns and has some sneaking sympathies. He decries the pragmatism which, in his view, inhibits great works of creative genius ('that cry of 'come-off-it', which would have prevented Beethoven's 9th symphony or Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel'), but recognises that 'a Europe in which the spectre of Germany looms immense needs a British presence more urgently than ever, for its irony, its tolerance, its genuine respect for the law'. He will not turn a blind eye to Britain's indigenous flaws, however. When asked if he had ever been asked to give the Reith lectures, he replies that an informal approach had failed to bear fruit when it was learned 'at the highest level' that his proposed subject was 'the tiredness of England'. He has no regrets: 'I am quite unrepentant on that. If there is too little nerve, too little pride to accept discussion of such a subject, then we are in trouble.' Another important reason for the wariness and occasional outright hostility shown towards Steiner is the very substance of his work, as well as its refusal to pay homage to traditional academic categories. His most urgent anxiety is that the humanities, the beautiful world of high art and culture created and enjoyed by Europeans over the last 500 years, have not only failed to humanise but have contributed to the legacy of horror which reached an unspeakable climax with the Holocaust. The striking examples he first presented in his Language and Silence have today become cliches: the concentration camp guard who tortured in the morning and was moved by Schubert in the evening; the cry of King Lear which carries greater resonance than the cry in the street. He asks if the price of all that culture, all that beauty, has been worth paying. Although he prefaces his tentative conclusions with the hope that he may be wrong, his tone is one of unmistakable pessimism. Asked in a BBC Face to Face interview how he thought he would be remembered, he replied, 'with deliberate self-cruelty', that he would be seen as a rearguard; 'someone who could still remember the inventory of that great culture, roughly from the Renaissance to Auschwitz, but who never understood his own time at all because he was hanging on to something which was in many ways a world of ash, a dead world.' Certainly he finds little solace in the democratisation and globalisation of culture, a chief characteristic of the post-war world. He finds it depressing that the lowest common denominator of cultural taste 'prefers football and bingo to Aeschylus', and sees rock music as 'a seismic break in the history of consciousness, a triumph of death'. In truth, he has shown little signs of coming to terms with mass culture in his work, though this may be a relief; there are probably enough cultural commentators making a living from EastEnders, Ryan Giggs and Nirvana. But there remains the scholar's sense of curiosity. As we drive out of college, Steiner slows down to read the slogan on a T-shirt of a man painting yellow lines on the forecourt. It reads: 'I have entered the vortex of love.' He drives away with a bemused smile, trying, no doubt, to make sense.</p>

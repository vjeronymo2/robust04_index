			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission urges sponsors to draft wrap fee brochures in a direct and understandable manner. Consideration should be given, for example, to the level of sophistication of clients and prospective clients of the program. In addition, technical language should be avoided, unless it is clearly explained or substantially all of the program's clients and prospective clients possess the sophistication to understand the disclosure without explanation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Cover Page and Table of Contents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Schedule H requires that the cover page of the wrap fee brochure include the sponsor's name, address, telephone number, and a legend regarding the purpose of the brochure. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  These requirements are the same as those of the proposed amendments. In addition, the amendments require that the wrap fee brochure include a table of contents reflecting the subject headings in the brochure. The table of contents need not be on the cover page. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Item 7(a) of Schedule H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Item 7(b) of Schedule H. The amendments do not require that the information in the brochure be ordered or organized in any particular manner, except with regard to the information required to be on the cover page.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Fee and Compensation Disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission is adopting as proposed those provisions of Schedule H that require the wrap fee brochure to set forth the wrap fee, the services provided for that fee, and whether the fee is negotiable. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  Schedule H also requires that the brochure describe the nature of any fees the client may pay in addition to the wrap fee, state that the program may cost the client more or less than the same services purchased separately, and disclose the factors that bear upon the cost of the program in relation to the cost of the same services purchased separately. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  If fees vary according to a schedule (e.g., on the basis of the amount of assets the client has in the program), the fee schedule must be presented in a table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Item 7(c) of Schedule H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The brochure is required only to explain the factors that affect whether a wrap fee arrangement or a traditional fee-plus-commission arrangement will be less costly to a client, and need not provide actual or estimated costs for particular services outside the wrap fee program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As adopted, Schedule H also retains the requirement of the proposal that the portion of the wrap fee paid to portfolio managers (or the range of those amounts) be disclosed in the wrap fee brochure. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  The Proposing Release requested comment whether similar information should be required regarding the compensation paid to registered representatives of the sponsor in connection with wrap fee accounts, and whether disclosure that registered representatives have a financial incentive to recommend the wrap fee program over other services of the sponsor should be required. Industry commenters were opposed to requiring amounts of compensation to be disclosed, in part because the amounts often vary substantially among representatives, but many acknowledged the need for disclosure that representatives are compensated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Item 7(c) of Schedule H. Because of the inclusion of this information in the sponsor's wrap fee brochure, the Division of Investment Management would not object if the portfolio manager's brochure omitted the portion of the wrap fee received by the manager in response to Item 1 of Part II. See National Regulatory Services, supra note 10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The method and amount of compensation of an adviser or its representative may create a conflict of interest between the adviser and its client and the representative and his client if incentives are created for recommending a wrap fee program rather than, for example, mutual funds or other advisory programs (including traditional fee-plus-commission arrangements) that meet the needs of clients and that may be less expensive. To alert investors to this conflict of interest, Schedule H requires that, if persons recommending a wrap fee program receive compensation as a result of client participation in the program, the wrap fee brochure must disclose (1) that persons recommending the program will be compensated, (2) that the amount of this compensation may be more than the amount the person would receive if the client participated in other programs of the sponsor or paid separately for investment advice, brokerage and other services, and (3) that the person may therefore have a financial incentive to recommend the program over other programs or services. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Item 7(e) of Schedule H. Because the amount a registered representative will receive may not be readily determinable at the time a client selects a program or service, Schedule H does not require that the brochure state that the representative will receive greater compensation in connection with the wrap fee program than with alternative programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Portfolio Manager Performance Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission proposed that the wrap fee brochure be required to disclose if performance information provided to clients regarding portfolio managers is not calculated on a uniform or consistent basis, and to refer to any standards under which the information is calculated. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  The Commission also proposed that the brochure disclose whether performance information is reviewed by the sponsor or a third party, and, if so, the identity of the reviewer. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  These requirements are being adopted substantially as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Item 7(h) of Schedule H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Proposing Release requested comment whether sponsors should be required to explain the extent of any review of portfolio manager performance information. Most commenters addressing the issue favored such disclosure, and the amendments require the wrap fee brochure to describe briefly the nature of the review. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  This description should include, among other matters, whether the review is designed to determine whether the performance information reflects the actual experience of accounts under management, the appropriateness of the methodology used to calculate performance, compliance with any standards the sponsor or portfolio manager has stated it will follow, and/or whether the reviewer has merely reviewed the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  If the scope of the review of the performance information is limited to the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, the brochure should describe that the reviewer has not reviewed the information to determine the appropriateness of the methodology used or whether the information reflects the actual experience of accounts under management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Proposing Release requested comment whether the Commission should propose the use of standardized formulas for the calculation of performance information of portfolio managers in wrap fee programs, or of advisers generally. The Commission plans to continue to study this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

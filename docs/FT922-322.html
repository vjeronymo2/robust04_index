			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Record amounts raised in US issues US COMPANIES raised a record Dollars 420bn (Pounds 222bn) in new equity and debt issues during the first half of this year, according to preliminary figures released by Securities Data, the US financial information specialist. In the first half of 1991, Dollars 280bn was raised in new issues. Two factors were behind the record financings: historically low US interest rates and buoyant stock markets. The lowest interest rates in almost 30 years fuelled a boom in the corporate bonds market where companies raised Dollars 146bn in 929 issues of new debt, 43 per cent more than in the first half of 1991. Even the much-derided junk bond market enjoyed a banner first half. Offerings reached a record Dollars 18.8bn, beating the Dollars 16.7bn raised in the second half of 1986 when the junk market was at its height. In the equity markets, the continued strength in stock prices resulted in a record 603 issues worth Dollars 41.3bn being sold to investors, topping the previous year's first-half record of Dollars 27bn (with Dollars 56bn raised in 1991 as a whole). Initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock, the US version of flotations, also set a record at Dollars 19.6bn. However, there were fewer IPOs in the April-June period than in the opening quarter. The boom in new equity and debt issues led to huge revenues for Wall Street. Underwriting fees totalled Dollars 3.5bn in the first half.</p>

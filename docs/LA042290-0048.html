			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: SUPER FLY:  </P> <P> What promises to be the most unusual collaboration of the year? Could it be  Mojo Nixon's proposed new band, which includes ex-X leader John Doe and the  Beat Farmers' Country Dick Montana? Nixon is calling the congregation the  "world's first cow-punk supergroup." . . . The B-52's' Kate Pierson has cut a  duet with Iggy Pop for his upcoming album. . . . I.R.S. is releasing a live  Squeeze album, titled "A Round and A Bout," which will feature such  classix-trax as "Tempted," "Is That Love," "Black Coffee in Bed" and "Pulling  Mussels From a Shell."  </P></p>

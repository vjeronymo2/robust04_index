			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report published under the rubric "Fact"] </F>   [Text] In the opinion of Ukrainian presidential candidate  Valeriy Babych, it is inexpedient to build the oil terminal in  Odessa, as, having spent billions of dollars, Ukraine may find  itself totally dependent upon oil-producing countries. He  believes that it would be more expedient to lease from Russia or  to redeem some of the oil field in the Tyumen Region, where  Ukraine took part in oil exploration.</p>

Seryeznov, NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC  621.791.754'29:621.039.6]    [Abstract] The thirty-year experience with developing the  equipment and practices for welding nuclear reactor core  components, radioactive isotope modules for various purposes,  and other nuclear industry products accumulated at the NIKIMT  Scientific Production Association is reviewed. Attention is  focused on achievements in the field of argon arc welding of  fuel elements (TVEL), magnetic field-controlled arc welding  (DUMP-process), and electron beam welding. In particular, the  SA-477, SA 457, SA-466, and SA-450 argon arc welding machines,  SA-448 elevated pressure argon-helium arc welding machine, and  SA-330, SA-340, SA-413, and SA-451 electron beam welding  machines are described in detail. Today, the association is  supplying the industry with small batches of power supply plants  for 6 kW welding machines with a 75 kV accelerating voltage.  This broad range of equipment and methods makes it possible to  weld virtually all core elements of domestically made reactors.  Some of the original units which have been proposed and  implemented in the nuclear industry are suitable for use in  various branches of the national economy. Figures 9.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Kover, head of the parliamentary </F> group of the Federation of Young Democrats, by Zoltan Fekete;  place and date not given: "The One Who Plays the Neutral Side  Has a Good Chance of Falling"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] Everyone clearly  rejected Viktor Orban's thoughts on a possible coalition  including the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. Do  you think that the Fidesz is looking in too many directions  simultaneously?    [Kover] I do not understand what it means to look in many  directions.    [Fekete] It is certain that, with the exception of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Fidesz is regarding all  the other parties equally....    [Kover] That is true, but this would be an unprincipled  thing to do if one could be sure about a new government based on  the Liberal Bloc, namely the parliamentary majority of the  SZDSZ, the Fidesz, the Agricultural Association, and the  Entrepreneurs' Party. Naturally, there are chances of such a  coalition, but a professional political party has to prepare for  all the political possibilities.    [Fekete] Even for a coalition with the MSZP?    [Kover] We have not closed down the coalition possibilities,  either to the left or to the right. Fidesz Chairman Viktor  Orban only said that, personally, everyone has his limits, but  life will not stop in any party if a politician is unable to  take certain measures without giving up his personal integrity.  The same way, we leave the possibility open to the right,  therefore in the direction of the coalition parties too. To the  best of my knowledge, the SZDSZ says the same thing as we do,  they only place emphasis on different things. This is not  something unprincipled. We think that a political party that  puts itself in the center cannot participate in a game on who  cannot cooperate with whom in the future. This competition does  not serve the long-term interests of Hungarian democracy. The  MDF, the SZDSZ, the MSZP, and the Fidesz should compete on the  extent of their flexibility in making sure that a realistic but  efficient government program based on compromises will emerge in  the next cycle. [passage omitted]    [Fekete] Viktor Orban, Janos Ader, and you are first-  generation intellectuals. Who are the most certain Fidesz  voters today: grandmothers or first-generation intellectuals  mainly from the provinces?    [Kover] Opinion polls do not make such a strong  delimitation; they can only evaluate the educational level and  composition of a given group of voters. Therefore, although I  am not quite sure, I can imagine that the first-generation  intellectuals like ourselves sympathize with us. It is sure  that the history of the Fidesz also speaks about their  possibilities. However, all the opinion polls agree that,  although we have voters in all the age groups, the percentage of  potential Fidesz voters among young people is much higher than  for other parties and, perhaps, this is only natural. [passage  omitted]    [Fekete] A thirty-year-old leftist premier drifted Poland  into a revolutionary situation in one year. Can you imagine  that a considerable part of the adult population in Hungary will  entrust Hungary to 30-35-year-olds, despite the leftist  restoration condemned everywhere? Particularly in view of the  fact that, recently, a journalist with a socialist daily said  that they had made the Fidesz a big force, and they would also  destroy it....    [Kover] I do not feel that the press might destroy us, but  it is obvious that an intellectual civil war is currently being  waged in the Hungarian press. Therefore, we reacted seriously  to this declaration and we know that this had, and still has,  very serious consequences regarding our popularity. However, we  think that if politics is not something omnipotent in a  democracy, the press is definitely not something omnipotent  either. Therefore, the Hungarian press cannot decide the  election results in itself; this also requires the achievements  of the various parties. [passage omitted]</p>

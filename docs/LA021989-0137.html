			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FIND UP THE NILE  </P> <P> Reading Slater and Basch's account of viewing Upper Egypt from A&amp;K's Sun  Boat (Jan. 29) recalled my wonderful experience aboard the Atlas last December.  I have received so many excellent tips, both for myself and for  Partners-In-Travel through Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips, that I would like to  share with your readers.  </P> <P> The Atlas has perhaps 40 comfortably sized cabins with bath, a pleasant bar  lounge, two sun decks and mini-pool and shop. The food is good, service  attentive and courteous. There is no resident Egyptologist but knowledgeable  tour guides are provided. The all-inclusive price for the five-day, four-night  excursion was $299 per person, double occupancy, a real bargain.  </P> <P> The Atlas is one of four properties run by Eastmar, which unfortunately has no  representative in the United States. It evidently is well-known to European  operators; my sailing included a group from England, and we were succeeded by a  group from Kuoni Tours.  </P> <P> MIRIAM TOBOLOWSKY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

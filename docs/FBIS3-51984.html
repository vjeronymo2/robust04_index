I am speaking to the  Cuban listeners of this station's live radio news program from  the Convention Center where the Board of the Central American  Commission for the Defense of Human Rights [Codehuca], a  nongovernmental organization [ngo] with consultant status at the  United Nations, is addressing the issue of human rights in Cuba.  The chairperson of this commission read a document to reporters  accredited to this Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting  for Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-Determination, and the Lives  of our Peoples.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] 1. The commission  strongly and categorically condemns and repudiates the U.S.  blockade against Cuba as unjust, cruel, and inhumane, and  because it represents an inexcusable violation of international  law -- the international human rights law and the established  precepts and rules for coexistence among nations.    2. It urges the U.S. Government to immediately comply with  the resolutions of the UN General Assembly to end the economic,  commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba.    3. It urges the United Nations to demand that the U.S.  Government comply with its resolutions through established  mechanisms, as it has done with resolutions affecting other  nations.    4. It lauds the Cuban Government and people for their  important achievements, successes, and transformations in spite  of the suffering caused by the nefarious, protracted blockade.    5. It supports the worthy, exalted, patriotic struggle by  the  Cuban people and Government against the U.S. blockade, and its  respect for international law.    6. It respectfully but strongly urges the nations and the  people participating in this meeting to adopt vigorous measures  and initiatives intended to strengthen solidarity their sister  nation, Cuba, in its struggles and its dreams to build a more  just, more humane, and more democratic society. The people of  Jose Marti need and demand it. Their unfaltering struggle, their  poignant sacrifice of so many years, and their unrenounceable  hope deserve it.    Respect for human rights means peace.    [Signed] The Central American Commission for the Defense of  Human Rights, Codehuca. Havana, 27 January 1994. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kevin Maxwell to reveal source of legal funds MR KEVIN Maxwell has agreed to reveal, in confidence, the source of funds he is using for his legal and living expenses. Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, told the High Court yesterday that Mr Maxwell had agreed to disclose to them the names and addresses of 'persons and/or other entities' who have funded him and whether the funding has been on the basis of 'gift, loan or otherwise'. The liquidators had sought a disclosure order against Mr Maxwell in connection with their attempts to recover about Pounds 450m missing from Maxwell pension funds. An application by Mirror Group Newspapers for Mrs Elizabeth Maxwell, Mr Robert Maxwell's widow, and Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell to be appointed to represent the Maxwell estate was adjourned for 28 days. Mr Martin Moore, for MGN, which is suing Mr Kevin, Mr Ian Maxwell and the estate for Pounds 170m, said Mrs Maxwell had renounced her executorship and did not wish to be appointed. Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell felt a conflict might arise if they were appointed. They intended to renounce their executorships. During the adjournment there will be talks between MGN and Mr Peter Phillips, the receiver of the estate, to try to agree representatives. The Appeals Court will give its ruling on Wednesday in Mr Kevin Maxwell's 'right to silence' case. Provisional liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, a key Maxwell company, won a high court ruling in December requiring him to give details of transfers out of Mirror Group Newspaper pension funds.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARINE EXPERTS FEAR HARASSMENT OF WHALES  </P> <P> As whale-watchers in Southern California begin coastal treks in search of  migrating whales, environmentalists and marine experts say that they are  concerned with mammal safety.  </P> <P> "The harassment has definitely increased.  </P> <P> We had cases last year where 30 boats were trailing right behind only two  whales," said Ray Sautter of the National Marine Fisheries Service at Terminal  Island.  </P> <P> The whale-watching season began Wednesday and continues through April. Tour  boat skippers take tens of thousands of people for a close-up look at the huge  sea mammals. But the boats often navigate too close to the whale pods. Whales  split up when chased, and a calf or cow will not survive if it is separated  from the group, Sautter said.  </P> <P> Federal guidelines direct boaters to stay at least 100 yards from a whale and  to follow the speed of the slowest mammal in the pod.  </P></p>

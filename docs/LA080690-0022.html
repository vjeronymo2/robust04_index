			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: L.A. FESTIVAL NEWS  </P> <P> Two Shows Sold Out: Tickets have sold out for two Los Angeles Festival events  -- the Aug. 31 opening-night "Legend of the Water Flame" at Japan America  Theatre, and the Sept. 15 presentation of the L.A. Poverty Department's  "Jupiter 35" at Highways performance space in Santa Monica. Festival box-office  manager Jill Rosenblatt said she expects tickets to be available throughout the  month for the remaining 230 events. Tickets, which have been available by mail  for more than a month, went on sale Friday at all Ticketmaster locations  (except for UCLA Freud Amphitheater's "The Dragon's Trilogy," which will be  sold through Ticketron outlets beginning Friday, and the Music Center's "Nixon  in China," which will be available through Ticketmaster Sunday).

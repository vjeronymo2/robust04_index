			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The European Market: Biotech groups find bright new world slow to dawn - Europe's patent legislation and regulations have caused frustration in the sector EUROPE'S biotechnology sector is considerably frustrated with its European Community regulators. This is partly because only three of the 12 EC states have fulfilled their obligation to implement directives on testing new bio-techniques, patent legislation has been stalled in the Strasbourg parliament for the past four years and, at least until recently, four directorates-general inside the Brussels Commission have been at odds over biotechnology. But other sectors suffer from EC tribulations, too. The 800 companies active in the EC in biotech research are particularly frustrated because they believe their future should be bright. Biotechnology, which is less a new industry than new biological techniques applied to existing industries, is seen as boosting Europe's traditional strengths in the agrichemical, pharmaceutical, and food and drink sectors into the next century. These three sectors employ 15m Europeans. Biotechnology could create a further 2m jobs by the end of this decade, according to the Commission, if all goes right. All, however, is not going right, says the Senior Advisory Group on Biotechnology (SAGB), a Brussels-based committee of major chemical companies with biotech activities. 'If our companies can't use their innovations on a par with their competitors in the US and Japan, they will either decline or move their investments elsewhere,' says Mr Brian Ager, SAGB's director. In fact, both trends seem to be occurring. According to figures on patents registered in the late 1980s, Europeans obtained 19 per cent, compared to 41 per cent for Americans and 36 per cent for Japanese. Biotech investment, particularly by the big German chemical companies Bayer, BASF and Hoechst, is shifting to the US, where the SAGB was recently invited to the White House and impressed, says Mr Ager, by the Bush administration's 'clear awareness' of biotechnology's importance. The senior Commission co-ordinator on biotechnology counters that 'industrial lobbies are over-dramatising the situation' with criticism that is, at the very least, outdated. The Commission's 1991 biotechnology policy statement, which pledged not to over-regulate and to ensure EC legislation was coherent, 'should be recognised as a positive step'. The industry welcomed the statement but has two gripes: Existing regulation. In 1990 the EC passed two directives, on the 'contained use' in development laboratories and on the 'deliberate release' for field testing of genetically modified organisms. Mr Ager complains these set up 'a complicated bureaucratic notification and approval procedure', regardless of the actual risks involved. The industry says biotech products should be assessed on any inherent risk in the product, not on the process by which it is made. EC states were due to have put the two directives on their national statute books last October; so far only three - Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands  -have. The UK is still wrestling with how to carry out the EC directive, and when it put out its proposed regulations for public comment it received in January a tart answer from the US government. 'In our view,' the US authorities said, 'these (EC) regulations would eliminate or severely restrict the potential of UK institutions to bring products to market - and solely because methods of modern biotechnology had been used in their production.' While not conceding any past errors, EC officials harp on more recent initiatives. These include last autumn's proposal for an integrated risk assessment procedure for biotech pharmaceuticals (as part of the Commission idea for a European drugs agency); a plan for a similar procedure for 'novel foods' this summer; Commission help for the CEN standards body to harmonise equipment used in the development and manufacture of biotech products; and the setting up of an advisory group on the ethical implications of biotechnology. Patenting. In 1988 the Commission proposed a directive on the legal protection of biotech inventions. This has run into opposition in the European parliament, chiefly from the Greens and the animal welfare lobby. Earlier this month the proposal was again sent back to the legal affairs committee without getting a first reading by the whole House. The reason was MEPs' differences with the Commission, whose support the parliament needs if its amendments are to get through the Council of Ministers. While the Commission accepts MEPs' opposition to patenting human life or any part thereof, it does not back parliamentary amendments on animal protection. It is also opposed to MEPs' demands that leeway be given to farmers using genetically grown seeds. Farmers want to be able to re-use patented seeds, recouped after harvest, without having to pay royalties or seek the permission of the right-holding biotech company. The Commission takes the industry's line that without such protection companies will cut investment in bio-agriculture. The argument is false, says Lord Inglewood, a Tory MEP who is both a farmer and a member of the legal affairs committee. He reckons the biotech companies would not have a hope of collecting royalties from farmers across the Community, but could in any case rely on farmers periodically switching to new strains of seed. The patent dispute needs a speedy solution, if Europe's biotech companies are to get uniform protection for inventions in the single market.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> PRICE: WE MADE MARINOVICH'S YEAR  </P> <P> In his fourth game as USC's quarterback last season, redshirt freshman Todd  Marinovich led a 91-yard, 18-play touchdown drive in the last 3 1/2 minutes,  lifting the Trojans to an improbable 18-17 victory over Washington State at  Pullman, Wash.  </P> <P> In his fourth game as UCLA's quarterback, redshirt freshman Tommy Maddox passed  for 273 yards and the go-ahead touchdown with 7:55 left, helping the Bruins  overcome a 10-point second-half deficit in a 30-20 victory over Washington  State last Saturday at Pullman, Wash.  </P> <P> "They're different in their style," said Cougar Coach Mike Price, who will get  a second look at Marinovich Saturday night at the Coliseum. "Marinovich is a  little more deliberate in his throwing motion -- a lot of left-handers are. I  don't know if they are, but they look like they are.  </P> <P> "Maddox doesn't have that over-the-head delivery. He's got a three-quarters  sidearm delivery and lets the ball go quickly. But they're both excellent. I  was very, very impressed with Maddox. And of course, Marinovich -- we made his  year last year." JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Froilan Arencibia] </F>   [Text] Doha, 6 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina met today with Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani,  Qatar's crown prince and defense minister, to whom he delivered  a message from Cuban President Fidel Castro.    Cuban delegation sources said that Robaina and Al Thani  talked about the current state of bilateral relations and shared  the two governments' interest in finding ways to expand and  develop them in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Robaina  expressed his country's willingness to promote cooperation with  Qatar in areas already identified, such as health, medical  products, tourism, and sports.    Meanwhile, Prince Al Thani reiterated his government's  willingness to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based  on respect for the sovereignty and free choice of social  development systems, regardless of pressures from third  countries. He added that he was aware of the situation in Cuba  and made a pledge to promote the visit of a delegation of  businessmen to Havana in the coming weeks. Al Thani accepted  Robaina's invitation to visit Cuba and learn firsthand about the  Cuban situation.    In addition, Robaina held a working meeting with Public  Health Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Suhaym Al Thani and the health  delegation that visited Cuba recently. Bin-Suhaym conveyed his  willingness to hire health personnel and buy pharmaceutical  products to be registered and sold in Qatar. The Qatari  official conveyed his admiration for the Cuban public health  system, particularly, the results obtained with the concept of  the family doctor (basic attention for the population).    During this second visit to this Arab-Persian Gulf emirate,  Robaina also met with the minister of finance, economy, and  trade, to whom he explained the characteristics of foreign  capital investment in Cuba. The Qatari minister confirmed that  in July, he will submit various proposals to his government  regarding areas in which it is feasible to begin immediate  commercial exchanges.    Today, Robaina officially inaugurated the headquarters of  the  Cuban Embassy in Qatar. Relations with Oman, a Persian Gulf  country with which Cuba established diplomatic relations in May,  will also be handled from the embassy in Qatar.</p>

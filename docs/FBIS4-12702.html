			<p>BFN     [Text] Muhammad al-Ba'labakki, chairman of the Press  Syndicate, and Milhim Karam, chairman of the Editors Syndicate,  held an emergency meeting in the Editors Syndicate offices this  morning. Afterward they issued a statement saying a battle has  been imposed on the press, which they must fight to the end.  They added that everything they had been told--assurances given  to people working in the media and citizens everywhere that  freedoms were secure--has been proven false.    The two media officials said that every Lebanese journalist  and all those who want to maintain simple freedom of expression  should mass on a broad front that includes Lebanese, Arab, and  international organizations and individuals in a confrontation  that might last for some time but that will inevitably end with  victory for freedom of expression and the protection of  democracy and public freedoms.    Chairmen al-Ba'labakki and Karam invited members of the  boards of the two syndicates to a joint meeting to be held at  1200 on 11 April at the Press Syndicate offices.</p>

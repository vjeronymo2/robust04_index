			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Japan likely to cut economic growth forecast: Last year's growth rate of 3.5 per cent would be welcomed by most other industrialised countries THE Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday indicated it might be forced to cut its 3.5 per cent economic growth target for the year to next March, in view of the continued sluggishness of the economy. The agency's admission, which accompanied the release of economic data for the first quarter of 1992, could pave the way for increasingly urgent discussions among policymakers about possible government measures to revive the flagging economy. A senior EPA official said: 'Until now we have said we can achieve 3.5 per cent. Now we are saying 'It may be hard to achieve 3.5 per cent, though not impossible.' It is too early to tell.' Agency officials said the issue of possible government action was 'very delicate.' The EPA, Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan insist it is still too early to consider boosting the economy through further interest rate cut and increased public works spending. But they are under pressure to act from politicians and from the US, which fears a sluggish Japanese economy could constrain growth elsewhere in the industrialised world. The report the agency published yesterday showed the economy grew in terms of real GNP by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter - an annualised growth rate of 4.3 per cent. However, the EPA estimated that 0.4 percentage points of the growth in the quarter were accounted for by the fact that the leap year had added an extra day of economic activity. The figures are consistent with a slow braking of growth, with sluggishness spreading throughout the economy. Compared with the same period in 1991, the economy grew by 2.3 per cent  - the lowest rate since 1986 and the fourth quarterly decline in succession. Capital investment, the engine of growth in the late 1980s, fell 0.9 per cent compared with the same quarter in 1991, the first year-on-year decline since 1983. For the fiscal year to the end of March the economy grew 3.5 per cent, little short of the 3.7 per cent government target and a rate that would be welcomed by officials and businessmen in most other industrialised countries. Nevertheless, Mr Takeshi Noda, the EPA's director general, said that in view of the leap year the figures for the January-March quarter looked better than they actually were.</p>

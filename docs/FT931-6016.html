			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bad debts behind 43% fall at Instem Instem, the USM-quoted computer electronics and information systems group, saw profits tumble 43 per cent in a 'disappointing outcome' for the 53 weeks to December 31. After an exceptional Pounds 386,000 provision for bad debts, after three customers went into receivership, the pre-tax line emerged at Pounds 575,000, against Pounds 1.01m in the previous year. Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15.8m), partly attributable to the 'uneven nature of our project work' said to Mr David Gare, chairman. The final dividend is maintained at 1.8p for a total of 3.1p (3p), covered 2.7 times by earnings of 8.5p (15.2p) per share.</p>

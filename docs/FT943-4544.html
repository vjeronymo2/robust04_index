			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / 'Telecom shock' hits Japanese market 'Telecom shock' has hit the Tokyo stock market. Shares in Japan Telecom, the country's third largest telecommunications company, have fallen by 5.7 per cent from their issue price of Y4.7m (Dollars 47,600) since trading began on Tuesday, Yesterday alone, Japan Telecom shares lost Y220,000, or 4.7 per cent, to close at Y4.43m. The decline washed into the wider market, pushing the Nikkei 225 index down by 370.18, or 1.8 per cent, to 20,023.80. Japanese stockbrokers have been caught out. 'We thought Telecom would bring investors back to the market,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities. Brokers had hoped that the Japan Telecom listing would revive the market. 'Telecom shock' has raised worries over next month's Y900bn (Dollars 9.1bn) flotation of Japan Tobacco, the semi-privatised tobacco and salt company. Although public pension and insurance funds moved to stem the Nikkei's fall yesterday, recent declines have confirmed weak underlying sentiment. The Nikkei rose 24 per cent during the first six months of 1994 on buying from the US and Europe, but a widening belief that corporate earnings would improve only gradually weighed on share prices in recent months. Investors fear a repeat of last year's decline triggered by the flotation of East Japan Railway which dropped Y1,000bn worth of shares on the market. The Tokyo stock exchange's computer system almost collapsed due to a surge of sell orders, prompting the Nikkei to lose more than 20 per cent in a month. Lex, Page 24 World stock markets, Page 43</p>

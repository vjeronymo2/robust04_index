			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOLIVIA, AIDED BY FBI, SEIZES 8 TERROR SUSPECTS;  </P> <P> ZARATE WILLKA GROUP TIED TO KILLING OF 2 AMERICANS, BOMBINGS  </P> <P> American FBI agents have helped track down members of a terrorist group wanted  for a bomb attack last August on the U.S. secretary of state's motorcade and  for the slaying in May of two Mormon missionaries from Utah.  </P> <P> The self-styled Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation, a Marxist group named  after an obscure Indian rebel of the late 1800s, claimed responsibility for  both attacks. At week's end, authorities said that eight front members were  under arrest and that at least three of them had participated directly in the  bombing or the killings.  </P> <P> Some of those arrested had once worked in a military government's  "paramilitary" intelligence service, Bolivian officials said. The U.S. Embassy  said that at least one had received training in Cuba.  </P> <P> In 1967, Cuba sponsored a guerrilla band led by revolutionary hero Ernesto  (Che) Guevara in rural Bolivia. With the aid of U.S. advisers, Bolivian army  rangers hunted the guerrillas down and killed Guevara in October, 1967.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Group Since 1970s  </P> <P> Other small Bolivian guerrilla groups were defeated early in the 1970s. Since  then, Zarate Willka is the first armed rebel organization to surface in this  landlocked country, the poorest in South America.  </P> <P> Few people had heard of the Zarate Willka group when it claimed responsibility  for the dynamite bomb that damaged four cars in the motorcade bringing George  P. Shultz, then secretary of state, into La Paz on Aug. 8. No one was injured  in the blast.  </P> <P> In January, the group set off a bomb at the National Congress Building. Again,  no one was hurt.  </P> <P> But on May 25, the terrorist band announced the "execution" of two young Mormon  missionaries minutes after they were shot to death on their doorstep with an  automatic assault rifle.  </P> <P> A handwritten statement delivered to a newspaper declared that "the violation  of our national sovereignty" by "Yankee invaders" would not go unpunished. "Our  hate is implacable and our war is to the death," the message said.  </P> <P> The victims were roommates Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, both 20 and  both from small towns in Utah. They had been in Bolivia about a year, doing  door-to-door proselytizing for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  </P> <P> There are about 400 Mormon missionaries in Bolivia, half of them young  Americans who have saved their own money to pay for their missions.  </P> <P> Wilson and Ball were returning to their rented room in a house near the La Paz  cemetery when a yellow Volkswagen station wagon stopped nearby. Witnesses said  that a man got out of the car and opened fire on the two as they prepared to  enter the house.  </P> <P> Dr. Ramiro Donoso, a Bolivian physician who is active in the church, said other  missionaries in Bolivia were horrified by the slayings.  </P> <P> "There was fear, to the point that the missionaries didn't go out to work for  several days," Donoso said.  </P> <P> But now they are working normally and have had no more trouble, he said. "I  think the thing has been against Americans instead of against the church."  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Gelbard said that Bolivia's extreme left, unable to  win mass allegiance, uses the United States as a scapegoat for its failure.  Marxist politicians accused the United States of violating Bolivian sovereignty  with anti-drug and military aid programs.  </P> <P> Gelbard said the terrorists struck out at the missionaries "because the Mormons  in their eyes are symbolic of the United States."  </P> <P> After the slayings, a special six-member team of FBI agents came to work with  Bolivian police in the investigation. The FBI brought lie detectors, ballistics  laboratory equipment and other instruments.  </P> <P> Some observers say that a $500,000 reward offered by the United States for  information leading to the conviction of the killers also may have helped in  the investigation.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the interior and information ministers announced the arrests of  several Zarate Willka members, including two university students and a medical  doctor.  </P> <P> Constantino Yujra, a sociology student, "confessed having participated in the  attack on Mr. George Shultz," Interior Minister Eduardo Perez Beltran said.  </P> <P> On Friday, police arrested two brothers, Felix and Nestor Encinas, accused of  killing the Mormons.  </P> <P> Still at large are the group's leader, identified only as "Horacio," and his  second-in-command, "Sapo" -- the Spanish word for toad.  </P> <P> Information Minister Herman Antelo said that there is no evidence that the  Zarate Willka band is linked to any Bolivian political party or foreign  organization. There had been speculation that it received support from the  Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas of neighboring Peru, who  assassinated the Peruvian naval attache in La Paz last December.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trained in Cuba  </P> <P> Ambassador Gelbard said in an interview that one man under arrest, Julio  Penaranda, received bomb training in Cuba.  </P> <P> "It's pure Cuban terrorism, I don't think there is any question about it," the  ambassador said. He added that the Zarate Willka group has been wounded but not  crushed.  </P> <P> "My concern is that in the short term this will cause the group to lash out and  show they are still effective," Gelbard said. "I think they still would like to  do something spectacular."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ZARATE WILLKA'S TARGETS  </P> <P> AUG. 8, 1988: Claims responsibility for dynamite bomb that damages four cars in  a motorcade bringing then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz to La Paz, the  capital. No one injured.  </P> <P> JANUARY, 1989: Claims responsibility for a bomb blast at the National Congress  Building in La Paz. No one injured.  </P> <P> MAY 25, 1989: Announces "execution" of Jeffrey Brent Ball and Todd Ray Wilson,  two young Mormon missionaries from Utah.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  Chairman Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said that the last  election Sunday [12 June] was a "very good day for the CDU and  the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]." An important stage had  been achieved but there was "absolutely no reason to give the  all-clear signal," Kohl said after the meeting of the CDU  Presidium and Executive Committee that discussed the results of  the European and municipal elections.    The European election was "not a test election for the  Bundestag election," the CDU chairman said. An additional voter  turnout of 20 percent as expected for 16 October will lead to  different decisions on the part of the voters. Nevertheless,  the result of the European election refuted those who said that  the CDU was on the decline. For the good results achieved by his  own party, the election of the federal president played a major  role for the motivation of the CDU supporters. The economic  upswing that set in in the spring and the clinging to a clear  European course have also been helpful.    The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] had banked on  "pessimism and on trying to make the situation appear as worse  than it is. The voters did not support that." Through its  pessimism the SPD did not make any gains but, willy-nilly,  helped the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the new  laender. The chancellor described the Alliance 90/Greens as  "profiteers of the weakness of the SPD." It was now time for  the Social Democrats to clearly declare their support for an  alliance between the SPD and Greens, the chancellor said. He  said that the poor result of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] was a result of the low voter turnout. For him it  was obvious that the FDP would be voted into the Bundestag  again. The chancellor described as particularly encouraging --  particularly because of the effects abroad -- the poor  performance of the Republikaner.</p>

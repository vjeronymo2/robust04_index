			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Stober] </F>   [Text] With the countdown display at the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] reception registering 19 days to go  before the election, 193,000 electoral officers -- who will have  to run the voting stations during the three days of the poll --  still have to be trained or have their training upgraded.    The final training programme, which will equip them for  their  duties at the stations, is only due to kick in next week and  will continue until April 24.    Training of electoral officers who have specialised  functions  -- such as counting the votes -- will continue right up until  the election.    The tasks facing the IEC in the three short weeks before the  election are daunting, and international observers working with  the commission are convinced it is too late for the massive  election operation to be implemented as originally planned. "We  are concerned that they have left it too late," an insider said  diplomatically. "But there is nothing to be done except to push  ahead."    The outstanding tasks include:    -- The training of more than 12,000 electoral monitors, who  will be the eyes and ears of the IEC on the ground during the  poll and will help the commission decide whether the election  has been free and fair.    The IEC has 8,171 monitors in hand, with another 2,300 due  to  join them at the end of the week. The cut-off date for the  training of monitors is April 17. Their deployment around the  country has not yet been finalised.    -- The location of nearly 3,000 polling stations around the  country. Of the 8,500 stations, 5,740 have been designated.    Equipment for all the stations has been ordered and it is  planned that everything will be in place three days before the  election.    In addition, the National Electoral Observer Network (Neon),  which is accredited by the IEC, this week began recruiting the  50,000 local observers they hope to have in place for the poll.    The observers -- who can only report incidents to the IEC's  election monitors -- are expected to provide vital support to  the monitors who will be stretched thin on the ground during the  poll.    The national co-ordinator of the network, Stiaan van der  Merwe, complained: "The IEC is paying very little attention to  making this work, despite good arrangements being made".    But the IEC's chief media officer, Pieter Cronje, is not  unduly worried. "Our election readiness plan is computerised,  and when you look at the graphics we are on target," he said.    The logistical problems are not the only ones currently  besetting the IEC. One insider said that while the commission  was being pushed on by "plenty of good people working helluva  hard", the operation has picked up "underqualified freeloaders  who walk around waiting for their beepers to go off for lunch."    The IEC has almost 180,000 people on its payroll and the  number is growing as more operations get under way. And,  although many staffers are equipped with cars, beepers and  cellular phones, they seem to have difficulty communicating with  each other and bureaucratic snarl-ups have proved a constant  hindrance.    Last week, over 200 monitors threatened to go on strike  after  they did not receive salaries.    "They are there to represent civil society but they have  assumed a kind of bureaucratic attitude which is not explained  by the pressures of time. They are not transparent at all,"  said Van der Merwe, who is trying to co-ordinate Neon's  observers with the commission.    Cronje responded: "Any large body of people working together  will produce complaints about process and product. We have to  work fast."</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Dean &amp; Bowes chairman buys subsidiary and quits MR STEPHEN Dean has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Dean &amp; Bowes, a designer and refurbisher of licensed premises and hotels. He will be replaced by Mr Philip Sims, the company's former finance director. Mr Dean is to buy out Dean &amp; Bowes (Contracts), a specialist public house furnisher, for Pounds 300,000, after capitalisation of Pounds 420,000 of inter company indebtedness and repayment of a further Pounds 1m. Management accounts showed that the company incurred losses before interest and management charges of Pounds 7,000 for 1991, compared with operating profits of Pounds 488,000. Net assets of Pounds 78,000 turned round to liabilities of Pounds 100,000. Following the sale, Dean &amp; Bowes will concentrate on its billiards and snooker subsidiary, EJ Riley, and several shop and interior refurbishment businesses. Dean &amp; Bowes has been disposing of assets in a bid to cut borrowings. In the first half, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 301,000 (Pounds 1.71m). The shares have collapsed since a rights issue last July at 60p raised Pounds 1.38m. They fell 3p yesterday to a low of 17p. Mr Dean has reduced his holding in the company from 25 to about 15 per cent following the placing of 2m shares at 16.25p.</p>

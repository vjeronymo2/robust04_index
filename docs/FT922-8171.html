			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Italy's presidential election begins with scuffles Italy's presidential election began with scuffles yesterday when neo-fascist MPs, shouting 'thieves', tried to storm the benches of Italy's largest party, the ruling Christian Democrats. Members of parliament traded blows before voting began. Against the background of a bribery scandal which has hit all the main parties, 1,014 electors drawn from the two parliamentary chambers and Italy's 20 regions must choose a new head of state before a new government can be formed. A result is not expected before Friday night. Brawl adds to drama, Page 2</p>

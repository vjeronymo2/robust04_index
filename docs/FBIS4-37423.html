			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 20, IRNA -- The terrorist Mojahedeen  Khalq Organization (MKO) has once again committed a heinous  crime, this time at the mausoleum of Imam Reza (A.S.) [peace be  upon him].    Since June 20, 1981, the people of Iran have been victimized  by this terrorist outfit that has always underestimated the  resolve and the indomitable spirit of the people of Iran, a  spirit that will not allow the MKO to reach its unholy aims.    The formation of the so called Liberation Army in Iraq on  the  part of the MKO at a time when parts of Islamic Iran was  occupied by Ba'thist forces was another vain attempt by MKO to  get out of the impasse in which they found themselves.    Repeated setbacks, including their notorious failure in  Mersad operations, caused many of MKO rank and file to be  disenchanted with the leadership.    Most political observers believe that by targeting the  people  as they did today they are stepping on the same path as Saddam's  regime that victimized the Iranian civilian populace instead of  facing the valiant Iranian forces at the front.    As a matter of fact the post-revolution history of MKO  testifies to the fact that they have preferred to target the  innocent people.    Just recently, a failed attempt by MKO on the life of  Hojjatoleslam Abaie, the Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, was  meant to create the same sense of insecurity here in this city.    Today's crime in the mausoleum of Imam Reza was a terrorist  act for which the MKO is directly held responsible. In addition  to the terrorist MKO, their supporters such as Saddam's regime,  the U.S., Britain and some European countries who have spared no  efforts in supporting the terrorist outfit have to answer to the  people of Iran why the innocent people were so butchered today  at a mausoleum whose sanctity for centuries no one had dared to  violate, a place wherein up to today no one had dared to shed  anyone's blood.</p>

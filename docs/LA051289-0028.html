			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KENNEDY CLINCHES SECOND LEAGUE TITLE IN A ROW  </P> <P> Standing between San Fernando High senior right-hander Frank Serna and a  possible North Valley League title was Kennedy slugger Gino Tagliaferri, who in  the third inning had blasted yet another home run.  </P> <P> When Tagliaferri strode to the plate in the sixth inning Thursday with the  bases loaded and the score tied, Serna flashed back to the third inning, when  Tagliaferri had tagged Hector De La Cruz for his 11th home run.  </P> <P> "I thought for sure he was going to hit No. 12 off me," Serna said.  </P> <P> Serna (7-4) made the showdown elementary, however, by throwing away a pickoff  attempt at first for an error, allowing the go-ahead runs to score as host  Kennedy won, 7-5, to clinch its second consecutive league title.  </P> <P> Serna's half-hearted throw to first eluded Andrew Munoz and allowed Danny  Gugler and Mike Murray to score, breaking a 5-5 tie as Kennedy (18-7, 12-5 in  league) moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the Tigers with one game remaining.  </P> <P> San Fernando (16-6-1, 10-5-1) scored three runs in the top of the sixth with  two out. Bobby Corrales' two-run single capped the rally and tied the score,  5-5. STEVE ELLING  </P></p>

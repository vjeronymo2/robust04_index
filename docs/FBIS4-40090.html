			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Abrosimov and Lyudmila </F> Yermakova]    [Text] Sofia June 13 TASS -- Russia's Federation Council  Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko, who is currently here on an official  visit at the head of a Russian delegation, has announced that  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is to visit Bulgaria  in autumn.    Shumeyko said that during the forthcoming visit the Russian  premier is expected to sign a package of documents that are of  importance for the development of cooperation between the two  countries.    This subject was also the focus of a meeting here on Monday  between the Russian parliamentarians and Professor Lyuben Berov,  chairman of Bulgaria's Council of Ministers. Special attention  was devoted to matters connected with settling the two  countries' mutual debts.    The two sides believe that it is now essential to approach  this problem "in an unprejudiced way and find a mutually  acceptable compromise", Shumeyko said.    Military-technical cooperation, including that between  defence industry enterprises, was discussed as well. The two  sides agreed that one should now renounce primitive forms of  perestroyka-period cooperation, barter in particular, and move  on to civilised forms acceptable throughout the world.</p>

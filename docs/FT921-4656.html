			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: LAIT net assets more than double LATIN AMERICAN Invest-ment Trust (LAIT), the top-performing investment trust in 1991, reported net assets per share more than doubled to Dollars 1.77 last year, from 79.5 cents in 1990, writes Sara Webb. Net assets rose from Dollars 59.7m in 1990 to Dollars 133.1m (Pounds 75.6m) last year, helped by gains in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. Argentina was the emerging market that performed best in 1991 - it almost quintupled in US dollar terms. The dividend of 50 cents per share, is small but reflects the lack of 'dividend culture' among Latin American companies, according to the managers. Mr Eduardo Faria, who manages the fund for Latin American Securities, said that LAIT's net assets had risen to Dollars 158.8m, or Dollars 2.12 per share, so far this year, helped by rallies in Brazil, Chile and Mexico.</p>

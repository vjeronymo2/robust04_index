			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSTLER'S ASSESSMENT MAY HAVE MISSED MARK  </P> <P> I deeply resent Scott Ostler's comparison of Dennis Conner winning the match  race against New Zealand to Ben Johnson winning the Olympic 100-meter dash.  </P> <P> Dennis Conner is a dedicated sportsman, who is an almost paranoid  perfectionist. He is, even by most of his competitors, rated as the top sailor  in the world.  </P> <P> To accuse him of cheating is one of the most absurd statements I've ever heard.  To say that he answered Michael Fay in kind is closer to the truth.  </P> <P> BYRON SLATER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

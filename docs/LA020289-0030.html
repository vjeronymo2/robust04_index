			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ALAN FEINBERG IN CONTEMPORARY PROGRAM  </P> <P> New York pianist Alan Feinberg presented a thoroughly satisfying solo recital  of mostly American music Tuesday night in Gerald Daniel Recital Hall at Cal  State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Feinberg -- who last performed in Los Angeles in November with percussionist  Daniel Druckman -- mastered the intricacies of every score with nonchalant  technical prowess, demonstrating deep understanding of some very difficult  music.  </P> <P> The local premiere of Charles Wuorinen's brainy Sonata No. 3, written for  Feinberg last year, gave the pianist the biggest workout, with layer upon layer  of serial structures, organized into a three-movement sonata form. Feinberg  approached the 20-minute work with confidence, conveying complicated motives  and harmonies with seeming ease.  </P> <P> Roger Sessions' masterpiece of free serialism, the Piano Sonata No. 3  (1964-65), also proved a test for Feinberg's stamina. Inspired by the  assassination of John F. Kennedy, the three-movement composition flowed  seamlessly, stirring deep emotions.  </P> <P> Three works from the 1970s by Feinberg's former teacher, Robert Helps, found a  more sentimental, melancholy side to his artistry. Two Etudes for left hand  contrasted duple and triple meters with a precarious chromatic melody given to  the fifth finger. The purely tonal "Hommage a Faure" also proved a study on  bringing out a difficult melody. All three were mastered handily by Feinberg.  </P> <P> Brilliant, comprehensive performances of Gottschalk's Variations on "God Save  the Queen" and "Le Chute des Feuilles" opened the program. Feinberg originally  intended to play three Preludes and Fugues by J. S. Bach, but explained from  the stage that the instrument he was performing on was more suited for Romantic  music.  </P> <P> Also on the program was Soviet composer Javanshir Kuliyev's "Seven Pieces With  Interludes in Mugham Modes"(1980), which Feinberg had played here in  November.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Booker turns in marginal advance to Pounds 103.9m BOOKER, the food group which spans breeding to distribution, barely increased profits in 1991 and saw earnings per share drop 13.4 per cent as the recession and dilution from the acquisition of Fitch Lovell in 1990 had their effect. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 103.9m (Pounds 102.9m) and earnings were 36.3p (41.9p). However, Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said the year had seen the group become sharper and more focused and debt had been reduced. Booker is increasing its final dividend to 14.25p (14p) to give a total of 21.75p (21.25p). Group sales were 12.4 per cent higher at Pounds 3.29bn and operating profits rose 2.6 per cent to Pounds 122.8m. Higher interest charges of Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 16.8m) reflected the extra debt from the Fitch purchase. The tax rate rose to 23.5 per cent (22.1 per cent). Extraordinary gains of Pounds 2m (Pounds 28.7m) were mainly profits less losses on disposals and closures. Pre-tax profits from food distribution were 17.5 per cent higher at Pounds 57.8m, on sales 12.1 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.61bn, helped by Fitch. Bad debt provisions had trebled to Pounds 4.5m. Agribusiness profits fell 10 per cent to Pounds 21.6m but the fish and prepared foods side grew from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 17.1m. Profits from health products fell from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 6.8m, while other activities lost Pounds 2.8m (profit Pounds 8.7m) mainly because it includes a Pounds 9m increase in the central interest charge. Disposals raised Pounds 64.7m and a further Pounds 20m is expected from the sale of P Leiner, the US health products business. Net debt was cut from Pounds 199.3m to Pounds 138.2m, gearing of 76 per cent. COMMENT There is no denying that Booker is a much tighter company than it was 10 years ago when its divisional list included shipping, engineering and rum. And what it has left ought to provide good growth opportunities. But Booker has often promised more than it has delivered, and niggling problems, like turkeys, salmon and mushrooms, keep appearing. Profit forecasts for the current year are about where they started last year before repeated downgradings. On a forecast of Pounds 115m the prospective p/e is under 11 and the yield with a maintained dividend is 6.7 per cent. The rating is cautious.</p>

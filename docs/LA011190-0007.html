			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CISNEROS CASE  </P> <P> In response to a letter (Dec. 28) by Debra J. Reed, I would like to point out  that Ms. Reed takes out of context a quote of mine from an article ("Deals Won  Jail Informant Freedom to Attack Again," Dec. 11). In the first place, there  were no "deals" made with Stephen Cisneros on the Bittaker case.  </P> <P> A letter accurately stating what Cisneros did for Sheriff's Homicide in dealing  with the key witness in the case was written at the request of Cisneros'  defense attorney. The letter was not written as the result of a "deal" but as  the result of a legitimate request by Cisneros' defense attorney to present  those facts to the judge who was to sentence Cisneros on an unrelated case.  </P> <P> My statement that Cisneros was a "small, teeny little offshoot" of the Bittaker  case (not of any informant program) was said to put the incident into  perspective. The Bittaker case was a very complex case which took a year for  investigation and preparation. Cisneros played a small role in the total case  and was never used as a witness. I certainly feel bad that Cisneros went on to  become a rapist but, frankly, it is quite evident that Cisneros would have  become a rapist whether or not the letter was written.  </P> <P> STEPHEN R. KAY  </P> <P> Assistant Director, Bureau of Branch and Area Operations  </P> <P> Office of the District Attorney  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

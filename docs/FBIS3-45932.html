The law-related news journal is being jointly published by  the office of FAZHI RIBAO and the Policy and Legislation  Department of the State Press and Publications Administration.  It is the record of actual events; it is readable; it serves  the readers; and it has a penetrating style. The main contents  of the first issue includes the following:    The special feature "Blood and Tears Cannot Be Shed in Vain"  exclusively reveals an event in which public security personnel  and policemen were involved in harboring criminals in a  manslaughter case. The shocking facts will prompt people to be  resolute in fighting corruption.    The special interview "The Secret Marriage of President  'Arafat" is the first report in China about the secret marriage  between 64- year-old 'Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian  people, and his young wife Suha.    In the "Global View" column, "The Scandal of Creating a  `Scandal'" reveals how Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST was  forced to pay a huge amount in damages after cooking up the  startling rumor that Ma Yongwei, president of the Agricultural  Bank, had been sentenced to death for embezzling a huge amount  of public funds and attempting to flee abroad.    In the "Long River of History" column, the first installment  of the story "Mao Zedong Helped Old Chiang" gives a detailed  account of this top-level inside story known to only few people  about the bombing of Jinmen and Mazu in 1958.    Other reports include "Secret Society `Yi Guan Dao' Returns  to the Mainland," "The Execution of China's Biggest Corruption  Criminal," and "Why They Killed Their Husbands."

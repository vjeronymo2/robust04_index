			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Text] The government today strongly backed the use of NATO  airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces besieging Gorazde in  eastern Bosnia.    Answering the opposition's emergency question in the Lords  shortly after a second attack, Foreign Office Minister of State  Baroness Chalker described the action as "prompt and  appropriate." She said: "We hope that all parties will draw  appropriate lessons from the use of air power and that attacks  on the safe areas will now cease."    Lady Chalker acknowledged that Britain had not been  consulted before yesterday's air strike against the Bosnian Serb  forces by NATO war planes, but stressed that the government  would not have expected to have been. She said authority for  "close air support" was delegated by the UN secretary general to  his special representatives and by NATO to relevant military  commanders. Humanitarian convoys crossing Bosnian Serb areas and  some aid flights into Sarajevo had been temporarily suspended,  she told peers. "We hope they will be able to resume shortly  and the considerable progress made over the last few months will  continue."    In her statement, Lady Chalker told peers that the  government  had only just received reports of the second NATO attack and had  no further information available at present. "The action taken  yesterday by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and NATO has our  full support," she said. "The decision was taken in accordance  with normal UN and Nato procedures. UNPROFOR is neutral and not  a party to the conflict but has the right of self defence. On  this occasion the risk to UNPROFOR personnel was thought by  UNPROFOR commanders to warrant a request to Nato for air  support. I'm sure the House will welcome the prompt and  appropriate action taken by NATO in support of UN personnel and  with the full support of both organisations. We hope the  parties will be able to agree to a global cessation of  hostilities in Bosnia as a first step to an overall political  settlement."    Lord Richard, Labour leader in the Lords, said if it was  true  Bosnian Serb forces were endangering UN forces and civilian  personnel it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the  Serbs had "brought this on themselves."    He asked: "What steps are being taken to protect UNPROFOR  forces and particularly British troops against the possibility  of retaliation?" He also asked what had been the response of  the Russian Government to the air strikes.    Lady Chalker said: "We have heard that President Yeltsin has  stated his concern that Russia wasn't consulted before  yesterday's incident. The authority for close air support was  delegated by the UN secretary general to his special  representatives and by NATO to relevant military commanders.  The UK Government wasn't consulted. We didn't expect to be  consulted and we were not aware that any other NATO ally was  being consulted -- so there was no reason why the Russian  Government should have been consulted."    On the possibility of Serb retaliation, the minister  warned: "If there is retaliation we might need to retaliate with  close air support in the future." But she stressed that such  action would only be taken after careful consideration and if it  was fully justified.    For the Liberal Democrats, Lord Bonham-Carter said it might  have been wise to have consulted the Russians before carrying  out the bombing. He stressed: "It is extremely important that  we do everything in our power to keep the Russians in step."    Lady Chalker told him that authority had been given to the  UN secretary general. No nation should be "seeking to second  guess" the issue, she added.    Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Merlyn-Rees asked if the  minister thought the action would be sufficient to deter the  Serbs.    Lady Chalker replied: "I sincerely hope that the Serb  authorities will see that NATO and the UN mean business."    She said the chance for peace had been going well until it  was "quite clearly" broken by the Serbian advance on Friday:  "That advance has to be stopped."    Tory former Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham asked if  yesterday's attack had been effective. Lady Chalker said: "I  cannot give you the exact detail. From general reporting that I  have heard on the radio, it does seem that the strikes went home  to stop a communication centre."    Labour's Lord Stoddart of Swindon urged her to comment on  reports that UNPROFOR observers in Gorazde included an SAS  [Special Air Service] member who had directed fire onto Serb  positions. But she told him: "It is long-standing policy not to  comment on special forces matters. Beyond that I can make no  further comment today."    Tory the Earl of Onslow asked: "What happens if the Serbs  are  not deterred?" Lady Chalker insisted the Serbs had been  deterred: "They were certainly deterred as far as Sarejevo was  concerned."</p>

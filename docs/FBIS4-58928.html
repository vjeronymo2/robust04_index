			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rashid Khashanah report: "Palestinian Officials' </F> Reservations Delay Announcement of National Authority Formation"]    [Text] Tunis -- The [PLO] Executive Committee failed to  agree at its third meeting in Tunis yesterday on forming the  Palestinian authority because of reservations expressed by many  of its members and figures from inside the occupied territories  about the way in which President 'Arafat ran the consultations  on forming the authority.    President 'Arafat departed Tunis for South Africa at noon  yesterday after agreeing with Executive Committee members to  resume the meeting Wednesday morning -- which means postponing  the handover of powers to the Palestinian authority.    An Executive Committee member has said that only three  members at yesterday's meeting -- which was attended by Mahmud  'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, Samir Ghawshah, Jawid al-Ghusayn, Jamal al-Surani,  Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 'Ali Ishaq, and Yasir 'Amr --  announced their agreement to participate in the authority. The  three are: 'Amr, al-Ghusayn, and al-Nashashibi. Four members  announced their refusal openly. They are: Abu-Mazin,  Abu-al-Lutf, Ghawshah, and al-Surani. As for 'Abd-Rabbuh, he  asked for some time to consider the issue.    During the meeting President 'Arafat phoned Executive  Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab, who is in Amman, and  People's Party leader Bashir al-Barghuti, asking them to  participate in the authority, but they refused. 'Ali Ishaq did  not give a specific reply. Maybe because Muhammad 'Abbas  (Abu-al-'Abbas), leader of the Palestine Liberation Front,  represented by Ishaq, asked to come to Tunis and discuss the  issue alone with President 'Arafat.    AL-HAYAH has learned that during the meeting yesterday some  Executive Committee members raised the need to agree first on  rules for the authority so that its role will be clear,  especially its link with the Executive Committee as an authority  for the Palestinian authority.    Al-Nashashibi stressed during the debates the need to define  responsibilities for the authority and to draw up rules similar  to those whereby the Executive Committee operates. Other  speakers criticized what they termed "haste" in the Palestinian  police's entry into Gaza and Jericho. They demanded that the  leadership method be changed before agreeing on the names. They  expressed their fear of a repetition of the "autocratic method,"  which they said has for some years been adopted by the Executive  Committee.    Some Executive Committee members objected to what they  termed  Fatah's monopoly on decisions and appointments to sensitive  posts. They said that the appointments were made without  consulting the Executive Committee and sometimes without  consulting the Fatah Central Committee itself, merely on the  grounds that President 'Arafat is the chairman of the  Palestinian authority.    As for figures inside the occupied territories, AL-HAYAH has  learned that a series of contacts have been held with Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi, Mahir al-Masri, and Faysal al-Husayni. They all  refused to be included in forming the authority. President  'Arafat invited al-Husayni to meet with him in Tunis on  Wednesday. While contacts with Ilyas Frayj have produced no  results so far, as he asked for time to consider the issue.    An Executive Committee member said that the tension  accompanying the appointment of the Palestinian authority  members is attributable to the fact that the matter no longer  has anything to do with the issuing of statements and adoption  of positions. "It is a real responsibility as regards the  running of Palestinian affairs in the Jericho area and the Gaza  Strip, from power, education, and health care to developing the  course of the economic and financial cycle."    He pointed out that current meetings and consultations at  the  Executive Committee level coincide with the donors' observations  about the method of making economic decisions and managing  international aid, and also with the "confusion" which Executive  Committee members have noted in the police forces' entry into  Gaza and Jericho, and which has led to delaying the selection of  the authority members.</p>

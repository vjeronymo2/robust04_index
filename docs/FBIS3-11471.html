			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva from Washington] </F>   [Text] Many people in the United States believe the  Democratic Party 1992 presidential ticket was perfect, except  for one detail: It should have been inverted, with Al Gore as  the presidential candidate and Bill Clinton as the  vice-presidential candidate.    All objective perception indicates that Gore is better  prepared than Clinton to exercise the presidency of the United  States. He has an excellent academic curriculum in the areas of  law and philosophy, he served with the Army in Vietnam -- even  though he always opposed the presence of the U.S. military in  Southeast Asia -- he is an excellent speaker, he has never been  accused of underhand business deals or of marital  unfaithfulness, he is the son of a powerful and competent former  senator, and he places himself in the center of the ideological  spectrum.    Gore is the most influential and active vice president in  the  history of the United States, and he is the natural Democrat  successor to Clinton. The president has left him in charge of  some of the sectors in which he specialized during his career.  In a very short time he has conquered the foreign policy area.    Latin America has become one of the areas in which Gore  exercises influence since he decisively helped to guarantee the  NAFTA agreement in 1993.</p>

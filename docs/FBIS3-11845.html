			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections  scheduled for 29 May.    Conservative Party presidential hopeful Juan Diego Jaramillo  has given up his presidential aspirations. Jaramillo has  acknowledged most Conservative Party members support the  candidacy of Andres Pastrana, though he has reiterated he will  not endorse Pastrana. Jaramillo has concluded he recently  declined an offer by candidate Miguel Maza Marquez to become his  running mate. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar  94 p 7A)    Upon analyzing the results of the Liberal Party, PL,  presidential primary election, opposition presidential candidate  Andres Pastrana said on 14 March that one of his campaign's main  objectives will be to lure 52 percent of PL members who did not  vote for Samper. He said Samper was unable to garner 50 percent  of the vote, because his program is incoherent. Pastrana  concluded he will also concentrate on seeking the support of  youths, who appear indifferent regarding the election. (Santa  Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Mar 94 p 11A)    Pastrana highlighted the differences on 20 March between his  proposal and that of PL candidate Ernesto Samper to build a  subway in Santa Fe de Bogota. On touring the capital, Pastrana  said while he will build the subway by granting a concession to  private companies, Samper will fund construction via new taxes  and the privatization of public companies. (Santa Fe de Bogota  Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 21 Mar 94)    Pastrana cited the need on 21 March to strengthen the Army  and called on guerrillas to demonstrate a genuine desire for  peace. Speaking at a rally in Florencia, capital of Caqueta  Department, Pastrana said if guerrillas do not show their  determination to attain peace, "the Armed Forces will be forced  to enforce the state's obligation of guaranteeing Colombians'  lives and property, as established by the Constitution."  Pastrana pledged to offer credits to peasants to make them  private entrepreneurs. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision  Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 22 Mar 94)    Luis Fernando Ramirez, Conservative Party vice presidential  candidate, has challenged his colleague, Humberto de La Calle,  to a public debate to discuss ideas and the government program.  (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish  0130 GMT 21 Mar 94)    Samuel Moreno Rojas, representative of the National People's  Alliance, has said he will endorse Ernesto Samper in his bid for  the presidency. Moreno has said Samper's political platform is  fully committed to social investments. He has concluded Cusiana  oil resources must be invested in the infrastructure to be able  to better compete in international markets. Moreno Rojas called  for the reactivation of the economy in the countryside. (Santa  Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 25 Mar  94)    The 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance, AD/M-19,  presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff has chosen Indian  Jesus Enrique Pinacue as his running mate. AD/M-19 suffered a  setback on 18 March, however, after Representative Gustavo Petro  resigned from the party, announcing he will not support Navarro  in the presidential election. Petro said the results of the  legislative election reflect the party's inability to  differentiate itself from traditional parties. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 8A)    Navarro Wolff said in Barranquilla on 20 March his running  mate is the best alternative for Colombians. Meanwhile, vice  presidential candidate Jesus Enrique Pinacue has said he favors  the resumption of talks with the guerrillas.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yomitan [Okinawa] -- At a time when the return of  the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield is becoming a hot issue, it was  learned on 12 May that the Yomitan village government, which is  planning to build a new village government building on the site  of the airfield, has asked the Naha Defense Facilities  Administration Bureau [NDFAB] to allow Yomitan Village to share  in the use of parts of the airfield with the U.S. Forces so that  construction work on the village government building can be  started in fiscal 1995.    Since the airfield is state property, use of the site will  require the permission of the Ministry of Finance. However,  according to village officials, the permission may be granted as  early as the first half of fiscal year 1994.    According to village officials, the village started  negotiations with the NDFAB in 1991 with the aim of seeking the  "outright return of the airfield," or if not, "shared use of the  airfield." Meanwhile, basic design for the new village  government building was completed at the end of fiscal 1992, and  the construction plan has been decided upon. Yomitan plans to  finish the operational designs this fall, start construction  work in fiscal 1995, and complete it in fiscal 1996 for the  village government to move in.    While there have been moves toward the return of the  airfield  this spring, the village government thinks that this will not  come in time for architectural design work in the fall. Thus,  it has attempted to negotiate shared use of the airfield.    According to the basic design, the village building will be  located on a site extending from the center of the runway to the  northeast, near the Heiwa-no-Mori ball park and sports ground.  The building is designed to be a four-story structure, with one  floor underground and three floors aboveground, and a total  floor area of 6,376 square meters. It will also have a parking  lot, and the village civic hall is scheduled to be moved to a  nearby site.    At present, the U.S. Forces also share the use of the  Heiwa-no-Mori ball park and sports ground. The U.S. military is  hesitant to return the auxiliary airfield because of possible  hindrance to telecommunications at the neighboring Sobe  Communications Station after the return. However, Yomitan  claims that "the construction of the ball park and other  facilities proved that there has not been any radiowave jamming."</p>

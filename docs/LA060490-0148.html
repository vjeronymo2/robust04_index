			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS INSTITUTE MAPS OUT ROAD TO 'NEW CIVIC VIRTUE'  </P> <P> Is it too soon to worry about the equivalent of a "Keating Five" blight on the  tender flower of democracy in Eastern Europe?  </P> <P> Not for attorney Michael Josephson.  </P> <P> Josephson believes governments emerging from communism's collapse could fritter  away moral capital on scandals analogous to the savings and loan fiasco that  has enveloped five U.S. Senators.  </P> <P> "What we're afraid of is that you start with this massive euphoria of  pro-democracy (in Eastern Europe), and it will start turning into the reality  of contending self-interests and corruption and selfishness," says Josephson,  sitting in his antique-furnished office in Marina del Rey. "That in turn could  create another small revolution, which leads to dictatorship."  </P> <P> In fact, for this independently wealthy ethics advocate, it's never too early  to fret about the insidious inroads of corruption, whether in the Iron Curtain  rust belt or the mountain-rimmed vastness of Juneau, Alaska.  </P> <P> And those are exactly the places where Josephson -- a singled-minded, voluble  former law professor who made his money in publishing and bar exam review  courses -- has made inroads of his own lately.  </P> <P> Last month, the Alaska Senate passed -- largely intact -- ethics legislation  drafted by the 5-year-old Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute for the  Advancement of Ethics, founded by the 47-year-old lawyer in honor of his  parents. Josephson's interest in ethics was fanned by a class he taught on the  subject at Loyola University Law School in 1976. Today, ethics has become an  all-consuming interest, he says, explaining that his only outside interest is  his 14-year-old son, Justin. "A lot of this for me is fun. . . . It's just  great stuff to do."  </P> <P> This week, a paper drafted by the institute, "Preserving the Public Trust:  Principles of Public Service Ethics," will be distributed to 175 political and  economic officials from former Eastern Bloc countries at a meeting in  Stockholm.  </P> <P> The paper, first issued in March, is a manifesto on the "moral obligations" of  public servants that "transcend obligations imposed by laws and formal codes of  conduct."  </P> <P> Furthermore, Josephson touts "Preserving the Public Trust" as a document that  breaks new ground in mapping out the straight and narrow for public officials.  It details, he maintains, "the root of not only the fundamental ethical  obligation of public officials, but the root of every corruption of public  officials."  </P> <P> A statement of five principles in 23 pages, the paper represents perhaps the  first coherent articulation of how democratic leaders can keep the faith with  constituents, Josephson claims. Forged over 18 months, the paper was drafted by  a commission of former government officials, politicians, journalists and  scholars, including former State Department spokesman Hodding Carter III.  </P> <P> Among other things, the paper asserts that public officials should use their  offices "to advance public interests, and not to attain personal benefits or  pursue any other private interest incompatible with the public good." The paper  also emphasizes that officials should always make decisions objectively,  conduct public business openly, honor "the principles and spirit of  representative democracy," and avoid even the appearance of impropriety.  </P> <P> While these points may seem elementary, Josephson says the paper grew out of  his discovery of widespread imprecision regarding ethical concepts, even among  veterans of public life.  </P> <P> "There was no coherent understanding or statement of what do we mean by that --  what does it mean to live up to the notion of public trust?" he says.  </P> <P> But Josephson is a realist. He says he does not expect the paper to change  anyone -- at least not immediately -- including the officials of the Soviet  Union, Hungary, Romania and other Eastern European countries who will get  copies this week.  </P> <P> "This is not -- and I want to stress this -- ever something that will make a  bad person good," he says. "Statements of principle don't make bad people good.  Statements of principle will, however, guide people of good will."  </P> <P> Distribution of the paper to Eastern Europe officials was engineered by Richard  Shubert, a former president of Bethlehem Steel and the American Red Cross, who  is a consultant to the Institute for East West Securities Studies of New York,  which is sponsoring the Stockholm conference.  </P> <P> Schubert, who helped draft the paper, says he sees it as a "a think-provoking  document" that will outline some problems of democracy for novices in  representative government.  </P> <P> If nothing else, Josephson says, the paper will serve as a counterweight to  other American political exports to fledgling democracies. "What are we sending  to Eastern Europe? Pollsters, all our campaign manager types who are advising  people on how to run campaigns," he says with chagrin. "In some of our views,  not the highest and best of what we have to offer in a political system."  </P> <P> Both Josephson and Schubert say, however, that problems other than ethics are  going to top the officials' agenda. "The last thing they want to hear about  probably is ethics and principles," says Josephson. "They're very much  concerned with food and getting their economies going."  </P> <P> In contrast, the Alaska Legislature saw ethics as a top priority when it asked  Josephson's institute to draft legislation on proper conduct for lawmakers  earlier this year.  </P> <P> The bill struck some Alaska politicians as Draconian. It severely limited  campaign fund raising, imposed a ban on converting campaign funds to personal  use, put a one-year ban on former legislators and legislative aides lobbying in  the Legislature, required stricter financial disclosure, placed an almost total  ban on privately funded travel, prohibited legislators from representing legal  clients before state agencies and established general standards of rectitude  for legislators.  </P> <P> The bill was not welcomed in some quarters, acknowledges Alaska Senate  President Tim Kelly, a strong backer of the bill who noted that Josephson's  brash attitude was sometimes an impediment.  </P> <P> "His argumentative nature sometimes rubbed people the wrong way," Kelly says,  adding that this provided ammunition for the bill's enemies. "Some thought they  could discredit the message if they could discredit the messenger."  </P> <P> The Anchorage Daily News reported one hallway encounter between Josephson and a  lobbyist Bill Ray:  </P> <P> Josephson: "I thought you were a lobbyist."  </P> <P> Ray: "I'm a consultant."  </P> <P> Josephson: "OK, that's precisely the kind of distinctions that aren't  acceptable under this code. I mean, you call a spade a spade. . . ."  </P> <P> Ray: "I know a hell of a lot more about the Alaska Legislature than you do,  I'll tell you that much."  </P> <P> Josephson: "You certainly do. And that's why they needed an outsider."  </P> <P> Josephson recalls that he had many spirited exchanges in Juneau -- and met with  a good deal of incomprehension. One legislator, he was told, reacted to  proposed publication of floor votes by saying, "That's nobody's business."  Unfortunately for Josephson, his bill was not passed by the Alaskan House,  which dropped the legislation on a procedural vote minutes before adjournment  last month.  </P> <P> Both Kelly and Josephson say, however, that the bill will come up again, either  in next year's session or in a special session this summer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Josephson will keep spreading his message, using "Preserving the  Public Trust" as "a kind of a road map for a new civic virtue."  </P> <P> After these words roll off his tongue, he quickly adds: "I know that sounds  pretentious, I know that makes people nervous, but democracy is so inherently  idealistic . . . if we can't be idealistic about our ideals, we lose them."  </P></p>

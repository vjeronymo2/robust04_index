			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways There are two ways of looking at the share price implications for British Airways of the Virgin libel victory. The indulgent one, adopted by the market so far, is that it will have little fundamental impact. Disgracefully though BA has behaved, the government is not about to force it to cede routes to Virgin. BA is unlikely to lose nor Virgin to gain much business as a result of the case. BA may find its relations with government a little harder, but it does not mind brushing with authority - witness its decision to halt contributions to the Tory party in 1991. This version, though, may be too simple. The market has come to attribute BA's transformation to the leadership of Lord King and Sir Colin Marshall. Their failure to root out and stop the dirty tricks campaign against Virgin reveals their judgment as seriously flawed. Less can be taken on trust in future, especially if BA now becomes inward-looking and obsessed with damage limitation. Perhaps the strategy is not all it is cracked up to be. Having failed to cement its original alliance with USAir, should BA now be doggedly pursuing a lesser but still costly deal with the same partner? Mr Branson is determined to make the most of his victory. The more he succeeds in shaking faith in BA's leadership, the greater the threat to its share price. If investors were to start losing money as a result, complaints about corporate governance would escalate.</p>

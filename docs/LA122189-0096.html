			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: ARTESIA;  </P> <P> MORATORIUM PLACED ON LAST VACANT COMMERCIAL PARCEL  </P> <P> The Artesia City Council has placed a one-year moratorium on the development of  a six-acre site at South Street and Pioneer Boulevard.  </P> <P> It will allow the council time to come up with a development plan that will  bring more sales taxes into the city, Mayor Dennis Fellows said. About 40% of  the city's $3.2-million budget for 1989-90 is from sales taxes. "This is the  last remaining single piece of property left in the city and we would like to  see an attractive development there, perhaps a shopping center rather than some  type of hodgepodge," Fellows said.  </P> <P> Most of the land, which is on the southwest corner of the intersection, is  vacant, officials said.  </P> <P> Fellows said the council had heard so many rumors about what was going to  happen to the property that officials decided to take action. The moratorium  will not prevent owners of the property from selling, and it can be lifted at  any time, Fellows said.  </P> <P> Plans are being made to get the council, city staff and property owners  together for discussions, Fellows said.  </P></p>

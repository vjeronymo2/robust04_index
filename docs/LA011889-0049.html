			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE INAUGURATION  </P> <P> Bad Roger was all ready for George Bush's inauguration. He had on his tuxedo,  his patent leather shoes and his cummerbund with the pink GOP elephants on  them.  </P> <P> He had everything, in fact, except an invitation.  </P> <P> "A mere oversight," Bad Roger said. "I am guessing that Lee Atwater will want  to deliver it personally."  </P> <P> Good Roger was not going to George Bush's inauguration. Good Roger was going to  deliver food baskets to the poor instead.  </P> <P> Good Roger is the kinder, gentler side of me. Bad Roger is the mean, nasty,  take-no-prisoners side of me. And ever since Nov. 8 of last year, Bad Roger has  sensed that America has swung his way.  </P> <P> "Yes-sir-ree," Bad Roger said, "me and Lee Atwater symbolize the '90s."  </P> <P> Lee Atwater was George Bush's campaign manager. He persuaded Bush to run a  negative campaign and attack Michael Dukakis' patriotism, competence and  sanity. Atwater will be installed as chairman of the Republican National  Committee.  </P> <P> "This guy is my hero," Bad Roger said.  </P> <P> "Do you realize the disgusting cost of this wretched inaugural excess?" Good  Roger said. "In 1977, Jimmy Carter spent $3.5 million. In 1981, Ronald Reagan  spent $15.5 million and in 1985, he spent $20 million. But George Bush has  decided to spend an obscene $25 million!"  </P> <P> Bad Roger said, "All that money is coming from corporate giants and millionaire  bigwigs."  </P> <P> "It's coming from people who hope to curry favor with the new Administration to  get huge government contracts later on," Good Roger said.  </P> <P> "Of course," Bad Roger said. "How else are we going to get $600 toilet seats  for our jet planes?"  </P> <P> Good Roger was really angry now. "And don't forget the $7 million that is  coming directly out of the taxpayers' pockets for this inaugural insanity," he  said. "All those millions could be spent to improve the lives of unfortunate  Americans instead on a bunch of drunks."  </P> <P> "I want to read you something," Good Roger said, rummaging through a stack of  newspapers. "Barbara Bush was asked if that $25 million could have been raised  for the homeless. And she replied: 'No it couldn't, because you wouldn't raise  the money for that purpose. These people are raising it because they worked  years and years to elect a President.' "  </P> <P> "And she's exactly right!" Bad Roger said. "You go to a bunch of Republican fat  cats and say: 'Let's raise $25 million to help AIDS research and build homeless  shelters.' And they'd look at you and say: 'Sorry, I got to mow the lawn.' Or:  'Gee, I gave at the office.' "  </P> <P> Good Roger shook his head sadly. "Listen to what is being assembled for this  inaugural: Caterers using 60 trucks and 700 waiters will be serving 20,000  meals. There will be 1,000 elephant-shaped cookies. Mussels will be flown in  from New Zealand, shrimp from Alabama, crayfish from Louisiana and oysters from  Maine. Sixty pounds of white truffles have been flown in from Paris at $400 a  pound. Also 1,000 pounds of wild boar sausage, 1,080 quail eggs, more than a  ton of Norwegian salmon."  </P> <P> ". . .Plus 800 quarts of raspberries and 7,000 bottles of wine," Good Roger  said. "Can you believe this? Mitch Snyder, the homeless activist, has declared  that such lavish spending 'is in extremely bad taste' in a city where 'human  beings are freezing and eating out of garbage pails.' "  </P> <P> For once, Bad Roger had no snappy comeback. "I do have one question," Bad Roger  said quietly.  </P> <P> "Yes?" Good Roger said, his heart swelling with joy.  </P> <P> "Are the pleats on a cummerbund supposed to go up to catch the crumbs, or down  so they fall on the floor?"  </P> <P> Bad Roger and the Bush Era. A winning combination.  </P></p>

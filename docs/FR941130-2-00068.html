			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under section 9 of the Act and its implementing regulations, ``taking'' of the northern spotted owl, a threatened species, is prohibited. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take threatened wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for threatened species are in 50 CFR 17.32. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicant proposes to implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the spotted owl that will allow timber harvest on portions of approximately 209,000 acres of the Applicant's land in Coos and Douglas Counties, Oregon. The Applicant's proposed timber harvest may result in the take, as defined in the Act and its implementing regulations, of any owls in the harvest area. The HCP and permit would be in effect for 50 years with the possibility of extending the permit with 10 year extensions, for a total of an additional 30 years, given certain biological and economic criteria are met. The application includes an HCP and Implementation Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicant proposes to mitigate for the incidental take by maintaining at least 40 percent of the tree farm in dispersal habitat with limitations on gap size between habitat blocks; retaining 1,592 acres of existing forest habitat for 20 years to enhance the dispersal landscape and productive capability at 4 known spotted owl sites; retaining 371 acres of existing forest habitat adjacent to 4 known spotted owl sites on Federal lands near the tree farm for 20 years; protecting at least 70 acres of nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat around all occupied sites. The Applicant will minimize take by prohibiting timber harvest and road construction within 0.25 miles of active spotted owl nests during the active breeding season, March 1 through September 30 each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA considers the environmental consequences of four alternatives, including the proposed action and no-take alternatives. The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a) of the Act that would authorize incidental take of spotted owls on the Applicant's private landholding of the 209,000-acre permit area, and require implementation of the Habitat Conservation Plan. Under the no-take alternative, the applicant would avoid incidental take of spotted owls and the permit would not be issued. The third alternative is to manage the tree farm for dispersal habitat without retaining any nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat. The fourth alternative is to manage the tree farm for dispersal habitat, and simultaneously avoid the incidental take of selected spotted own pairs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Dated: November 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Bill Shake, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=2 --> Acting Deputy Regional Director, Region 1, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=2 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29436 Filed 11&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=2 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

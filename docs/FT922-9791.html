			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: WPP still in talks on financial structure SHARES in WPP Group, the marketing services combine, fell 5p to 63p yesterday when the company said it was continuing talks about strengthening its capital structure and improving liquidity. Analysts feared either a share issue or sales of assets at prices too low to offset the loss of their earnings. The group's shares fell during April to a low of 54p by the end of the month as rumours about the company's financial position circulated around the stock market. Last week they bounced to 68p. WPP, which owns J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, had warned in mid-March that discussions were continuing with bankers about ways of improving its capital structure. It said then that it might float its market research business and its Far Eastern operations or sell Scali McCabe Sloves, its US advertising agency. At the end of 1991 WPP's balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 334m and negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 268m. In April last year the group agreed a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 560m) debt rescheduling with its banks, under which Dollars 400m of debt would be repaid in June 1993. However, WPP's refinancing did not involve issuing shares, unlike that of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi where existing shareholders found their interests heavily diluted.</p>

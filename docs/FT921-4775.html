			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Virgin deal welcomed THE SHARE price of Thorn EMI see-sawed after the leisure group emerged as the successful bidder for Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music Group. Volatility in the shares increased as the market initially recoiled at the prospect of a Pounds 516m rights issue but buyers then became increasingly enthusiastic about prospects for a rapid expansion of Thorn's music recording and publishing businesses. Thorn shares, which have come under sustained pressure in recent days amid hints that it was the front runner to acquire the Virgin businesses, initially fell sharply from an overnight level of 770p, but then picked up strongly to touch 811p before closing the session a net 22 higher at 808p. Turnover in Thorn shares reached 5.5m, well ahead of usual levels of activity. Mr Peter Joseph at Smith New Court said that although the deal was 'a sound strategic move for Thorn' he thought the group had 'paid a full price.' He said there now looked to be little upside in Thorn shares over the next 12 months. Ms Lisa Gordon at County NatWest was more enthusiastic about the deal; 'It was struck at a sensible price and there is tremendous scope for margin improvements with Virgin on board.' SmithKline deal Much of the early activity in the traditionally heavily traded pharmaceuticals area of the market was confined to the two classes of stock in SmithKline Beecham after large-scale switching between the two categories of shares in the group . SmithKline ordinary shares initially edged ahead to 904p before coming off sharply and ending the session a net 7 lower at 900p while SmithKline units, marked down from an overnight level of 4138p to 4100p at the outset of trading subsequently rallied to close 13 easier on balance at 4125p. Dealers said Salomon Brothers, one of the big US investment banks had operated a switch, selling 4m of the ordinaries at 903p and buying a block of 800,000 Units at 4135p, in a deal worth around Pounds 7m. The uninspiring presentation at midweek to US institutions by Mr John Browne, BP's head of exploration and production, continued to affect BP shares which slipped 3 more to 262p. Turnover was 12m. Oil sector specialists said there was no doubt that much of the hefty American buying for the past two weeks had been triggered by hopes that the BP director would deliver encouraging exploration news and confidence in the group's dividend policy. Shell eased the same amount to 442p on 3.4m shares. The BZW sell note on National Power and PowerGen exerted further downward pressure on the stocks although both attracted considerable support at the lower levels and closed above the worst. National Power, sold down to 217p, rallied to end a net 2 off at 221p with a heavy 8.4m shares traded, while PowerGen settled 3 off at 233p, after 229p, with 4.5m shares traded. There was aggressive two-way business in the Scottish generators where Scottish Power, on turnover of 6.8m shares, held at 103p and Scottish Hydro ended the day slightly firmer at 105 1/2 p on 4.1m traded. Political worries hounded the regional electricity and water sectors. The Electricity Package lost 48 to Pounds 2800, responding to wide-ranging losses among the sector's constituents. Switching operations dominated activity in the banks. Abbey National, hit in midweek by large-scale switching out of the stock into the big-four, where many analysts see scope for recovery, rallied strongly and closed 7 firmer at 293p. Barclays fell heavily to touch 363p during early trading, upset by suggestions that the group may soon lose its premium debt rating, but later picked up strongly to close 3 higher on balance at 370p as dealers took the view that the recent bout of selling had been overdone. A rise of 5 to 588p in Guinness bucked the general trend in the drinks sector as rumours continued that Mr Warren Buffett of Salomon Brothers is using his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway to build up a stake in the company. It was suggested that he has sold part of his 10 per cent stake in Coca-Cola to invest in Guinness. Nervousness about the political situation weighed against the brewers in general. Bass continued on a downward course, losing 6 to 542p, on fear that the company's main operating arms will underperform. Strength in the dollar supported food manufacturers such as Cadbury, up 6 at 466p, and Unilever, 4 higher at 946p. On the other hand Tate &amp; Lyle, with its US sugar business was unchanged at 428p. United Biscuits eased 1 to 411p ahead of next Thursday's results, on turnover of 1.1m shares. Analysts expect the world's second largest biscuit manufacturer, after Nabisco, to have increased profits to Pounds 206-210m in 1991 from Pounds 197.7m the previous year. A rise in the dividend to 14.9p from 14.4p is also generally forecast. It is hoped that increased overseas sales will offset a subdued performance by the recession hit UK operations. This week's proposal by Hillsdown holdings to float Fairview New Homes, its housebuilding subsidiary, provided continued support, lifting the shares 3 to 168p. Dalepak retreated further, falling 5 to 385p, failing to sustain the level of 433p seen on Monday when preliminary talks to buy part or all of the company were announced. Fear of a price war among do-it-yourself stores pushed Kingfisher down another 5 to 521p, but WH Smith and Ladbroke, also involved in the DIY business, through Do It All and Texas, gained a little ground. WH Smith 'A' shares rose 2 to 465p and Ladbroke put on 3 to 232p. Analysis of the sector by Credit Lyonnais Laing suggested that Kingfisher is the most exposed to a price war. The investment house has downgraded its forecast of Kingfisher's profits by Pounds 5m to Pounds 250m. Profit-takers were seen at British Aerospace where the shares retreated 9 to 327p on turnover of 4.7 million. Sentiment was also affected by the view that benefits from the anticipated Al Yamamah 2 defence contract may be 'further out in the distance'. BTR weakened 6 to 390p in nervous trading ahead of next Wednesday's figures, however TI Group which reports results on Thursday were wanted and the shares firmed 7 to 627p. Among pharmaceutical stocks, Medeva gained 6 to 288p after Goldman Sachs recommended the stock on two year investment horizon. Mr Paul Krikler at Goldman Sachs said 'the company has successfully built its position in the US and UK and we can expect further moves into Europe in the coming years.' A series of agency crosses was partly responsible for big gains in Burnfield, 19 higher at 182p and Jones Stroud, 20 to the good at 230p. The proposed massive job cuts did little for BT whose shares settled 2 off at 334p on turnover of 6.7m; the partly-paid were 1 1/2 easier at 120 1/4 p after 12m shares were traded. Reuters, given a severe mauling in midweek after the failure in London, Chicago and New York of testing of its Globex financial futures trading system, dropped 11 more to 1159p, after 1156p.

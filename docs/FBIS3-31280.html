			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The work so far on Poland's  participation in the Partnership for Peace program has been  presented at a joint meeting of the Sejm commissions for foreign  affairs and for national defense by Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski and Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejdzyk. Our  foreign minister told the deputies that a program was already  being worked on by a joint working party of the Defense and  Foreign Affairs Ministries. National Defense Minister  Kolodziejdzyk emphasized that sending a Polish mission to NATO  Headquarters was a matter of urgency.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Koziol] Does the Defense  Ministry have the money to send a mission to NATO headquarters?    [Kolodziejdzyk] Right now we do not. Right now we do not  have  money for anything because the budget has not been adopted. Of  course, we are going to look for it because we cannot completely  put this initiative aside. Well, we are going to look for  reserves, perhaps cut something back from training, perhaps call  up fewer soldiers for military service. There are no good  solutions here, but we have to have a sense of vision as to what  is right now the most important thing for Poland's security and  what can be left to one side for another five minutes. We have  to talk about actually entering NATO structures, about actual  presence, participation in exercises, in missions, in symposia,  in meetings. Unfortunately this cannot be done without money.  That today is our great problem.    [Koziol] The Polish Government has to prepare a document....    [Kolodziejdzyk, interrupting] A presentation document, that  is what it is called.    [Koziol] So, could you tell me, today we heard that there  are  no dates set for this. So how do you, Minister, see this in real  terms? When should this (?happen)?    [Kolodziejdzyk] Well, I see this in very real terms. I would  not like this government in which I participate to make any  spectacular, hurried, badly prepared moves. We said today that  the government still has to work on this document, consult with  the Sejm National Defense Commission about it, discuss it among  ourselves, calmly, and with full awareness of how much this is  going to cost, whether can we afford it, and so on. So, rushing  things here would not be a good idea. I think that in March we  will be ready for talks with NATO HQ, for the so-called  bilateral negotiations from which it will transpire how we are  going to move along the road, not so much toward partnership but  toward security structures. [end recording]    [Announcer] Journalists asked both ministers to comment on  yesterday's WASHINGTON POST report that, in the 1980's, Poland  allegedly sold weapons to the United States for $2 million.  According to Minister Kolodziejdzyk, these reports are fiction.    [Begin Kolodziejdzyk recording] THE WASHINGTON POST, using  its outstanding journalism, has written an article that smacks  of a horror story. Why doesn't our press summon up enough  courage to ponder and analyze what the purpose could be of  publishing such phenomenal, even fantasy, stories? So far, the  Pentagon has refused to comment on these facts. I see no reason  to rush ahead of the Pentagon right now because, after all, it  is their work, and they are also a suspect, seeing as allegedly,  all in all, it was two parties who were involved in this  underhand dealing. [end recording]    [Announcer] Minister Olechowski would not give an  unambiguous  reply.    [Begin Olechowski recording] It says--if it is true, of  course, because I have no reason to maintain that it either is  or is not--that, over several years, several million dollars'  worth of equipment was sold, and no one knows what the bottom  line was, how much of this went toward some sort of bribes or  middlemen, well, I do not know, they must have been selling  braces because it seems that it was very cheap equipment, so,  perhaps in general it was a very good move because perhaps  Polish weapon components were being sold. [sentence as heard]  I do not know. For me this is such a mystery that, until I have  read about it and learned something, I am not going to know.  [end recording]</p>

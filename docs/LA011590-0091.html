			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIRGINIA GOV. WILDER SEES ELECTION OF BLACK PRESIDENT AS A POSSIBILITY  </P> <P> Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, in his first full day in office as the nation's first  elected black governor, said Sunday the United States may be ready to elect a  black as President in the "foreseeable future."  </P> <P> Wilder, appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," was asked about  the prospect of a black reaching the White House "in our time."  </P> <P> "Yes. When you say our time, I think that you mean . . . the foreseeable  future. Yes, I do think that's a possibility," Wilder said.  </P> <P> Wilder, a grandson of slaves raised in the segregated South who became a  successful, wealthy attorney, was inaugurated Saturday. He said he sees a  future in which "nothing is impossible."  </P> <P> Wilder, a Democrat, already has been mentioned as a possible moderate  counterweight to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a role he has indicated he would  relish. On the Brinkley show, he was asked to explain how he won a large number  of white votes last year while Jackson has received only 15% of the white vote  in presidential primaries.  </P> <P> "Well, I've been involved for a long time in running for office," he replied.  "And I understand coalitions. I understand the need to compromise. . . . I do  believe in taking the half loaf until you can get the other half."  </P> <P> Earlier Sunday, Wilder watched as members of his Cabinet were sworn into office  during a ceremony at the state Capitol and posed with them for photographs.  Later, he hosted a brunch for campaign contributors and a reception for  Democratic volunteers, both held at the Executive Mansion.  </P> <P> Wilder, whose election Nov. 7 focused attention on a state once strictly  segregated, said in his inaugural address that his victory was "not a victory  of party or the accomplishments of an individual, but the triumph of an idea --  an idea as old as America; as old as the God who looks out for us all."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Afghan government denied there are any Soviet military advisers working  with its troops, despite U.S. assertions to the contrary. "There is no Soviet  military adviser in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan armed forces enjoy sufficient  experience and morale to defend the country," a Foreign Ministry statement  said. Peter Tomsen, the U.S. envoy to the Afghan rebel government based in  Pakistan, said last week that at least 300 Soviet advisers were helping the  Kabul regime. He also said Washington will continue to provide military  assistance to all rebel groups. The Afghan statement criticized this U.S. aid  pledge, saying it "indicates the instability of the moujahedeen (rebel)  government and the U.S. lack of confidence in that government."  </P></p>

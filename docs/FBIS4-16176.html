			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov and Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Boris </F> Yeltsin Makes Tempting Proposal to Madrid Businessmen. Spanish  Scent Big Money"]    [Text] Madrid-Barcelona -- The Bosnia crisis could not  spoil the atmosphere of the Russian-Spanish dialogue in Madrid.  B. Yeltsin and Premier F. Gonzalez called it very successful  and interesting.    Boris Yeltsin advised that so far Russia and Spain have been  trading very badly -- Spain accounts for just 2 percent of  Russia's foreign trade turnover. In a frank and categorical way  he attempted to win over around 200 top Spanish businessmen with  whom he held a business lunch at the Ritz Hotel. The president  announced that the government is currently drawing up new  foreign economic legislation which will envisage, in particular,  the granting of most-favored status to foreign investors and the  creation of conditions for delivering goods to the Russian  market similar to those which exist for Russian producers.  Admittedly, despite the well-known pressure on him in Russia,  he did not reject the use of import tariffs as an instrument for  regulating foreign trade.    The businessmen listened with interest to the president's  promise to provide guarantees for investors against any  political surprises. Certain specific proposals were also  voiced -- to modernize several oil refineries and even to get  involved in opening up oil fields in Udmurtia and Krasnoyarsk  Kray. The Spanish scented big money in these proposals.    They have all been beaten to the punch by Pedro Balvye [name  as transliterated], president of the Campofrio meat processing  concern. Having taken a chance on investing in Russia several  years ago, this concern is now not only operating successfully  in Moscow but is even building another major plant. Visiting a  Campofrio enterprise near Madrid, Boris Yeltsin was clearly  surprised in one shop to see large hams going round on a  mechanical carousel. Many Russian tourists even think that  these popular smoked hams, to be found in every Spanish bar and  restaurant looking as natural as if they had been painted by  Rubens, are plaster casts. The journalists were waiting for the  tasting, and were speculating on which wine the president would  choose to accompany the ham. But they were disappointed -- he  did not touch anything.    At a press conference an Italian journalist asked Boris  Yeltsin about his health. The president replied:    "I would like everyone my age to have the same health as I  have. I play tennis, swim in the Black Sea in March when the  water temperature is four degrees, and work 16-18 hours a day  with hardly any days off. I would like to make the following  offer to those who try to upset me by talking about my health:  I am prepared to undergo an all-day checkup [dispanserizatsiya]  with journalists present. Let the doctors do their examinations  and produce their analyses, and then everyone will know my state  of health."</p>

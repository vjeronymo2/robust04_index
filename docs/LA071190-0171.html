			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST ANNOUNCES HE'S GAY  </P> <P> After Marvin Liebman, one of the founders of the modern conservative movement,  privately distributed copies of a letter a few weeks ago announcing to his  "best friend" William F. Buckley Jr. that he was coming out of the closet, he  received a call from Bill's older brother, Jim, inviting him to dinner.  </P> <P> They went to I Ricchi and had a pleasant talk, without any mention of Liebman's  impending public revelation. When the check came, Jim, a judge on the U.S.  Court of Appeals in Washington and a former U.S. senator from New York whose  campaigns had been fueled by Liebman's fund-raising expertise, paid it and then  lifted his glass.  </P> <P> "This is my way," he said with the characteristic Buckley grin, "of saluting an  act of courage."  </P> <P> "And," says Liebman, sitting in his Washington apartment the other day  reflecting on his life, "not another word was said on the matter."  </P> <P> In his moving letter -- published in the July 9 issue of William Buckley's  National Review -- Liebman writes that "I am almost 67 years old. For more than  half of my lifetime, I have been engaged in, and indeed helped to organize and  maintain, the conservative and anti-Communist cause. The names of some of the  enterprises we helped launch may bring a nostalgic tug . . . the American  Committee for Aid to the Katanga Freedom-Fighters . . . the Committee of One  Million . . . Young Americans for Freedom . . . the Conservative Party of New  York . . . the Goldwater and Reagan campaigns."  </P> <P> And then: "All the time I labored in the conservative vineyard, I was gay."  </P> <P> The editor in chief's published response to his "brother in combat" and "dear  friend" -- Buckley, two years younger, was his godfather when Liebman became  Catholic a decade ago -- was more formal, although he notes his "affection and  respect" for Liebman. He writes that he understands the "pain" that society has  inflicted on homosexuals "sometimes unintentionally, sometimes sadistically. It  is wholesome that we should be reproached for causing that pain." And he  promises that National Review "will not be scarred by thoughtless gay-bashing."  </P> <P> However, Buckley writes, in "the Judeo-Christian tradition" to which he  adheres, homosexuality is considered "unnatural, whatever its etiology. . . .  Ought considerations of charity entirely swamp us, causing us to submerge  convictions having to do with that which we deem to be normal, and healthy?"  </P> <P> Liebman chuckles at this.  </P> <P> "There's very little Bill could do that would distress me," he says. "He's been  my best and closest friend. That's just the way he is. I don't feel remotely  put down by it. You know, he has these crazy ideas -- Judeo-Christian bull. But  he's a nice man."  </P> <P> Friday Liebman wrapped up the week's work at the Federal Trade Commission,  where he's director of special projects, and left for Stamford for a small  gathering of family and friends to celebrate Bill and Patricia Buckley's 40th  wedding anniversary. Arriving back in Washington, Liebman said he and Buckley  discussed the matter amiably and Buckley was "very cool about it; he was very  nice."  </P> <P> "Knowing Bill has absolutely changed my life," says Liebman, who was persuaded  into the conservative camp from Marxism after meeting the young author of "God  and Man at Yale" in New York in the early '50s. "He's been the most important  man in my life, and Pat has been very important. It was Pat who taught me about  finger bowls and manners and all that sort of stuff, who gave me  sophistication."  </P> <P> Buckley declined Friday to call his wife to the phone to talk with a reporter,  saying, "I wouldn't do that. She wouldn't talk about it."  </P> <P> Before Liebman came to Washington from New York in 1980 to join the Reagan  Revolution, serving as public relations official at the National Endowment for  the Arts and in various other posts, it was a rare weekend when he wasn't to be  seen socializing around one of the two pools (one indoor) at the Stamford house  with Pat and Bill and close friends, or sailing on one of Buckley's yachts.  </P> <P> Yet it was never mentioned that he was gay.  </P> <P> "The most important part of my life was never discussed with them, never  verbalized," he says. "It was a secret. Now it's not a secret."  </P> <P> In a sense, Liebman says, "my whole life was a lie, and it was terrible. I was  ashamed. Life was made miserable because you were gay."  </P> <P> Gay-bashing on the political right particularly pained Liebman, and in his  letter in National Review he writes that "in many years of service to The Cause  I've sat in rooms where people we both know -- brilliant, thoughtful, kind  people -- have said, without any sense of shame, vulgar and cruel things about  people who through no fault of their own happen to be different in their  sexuality."  </P> <P> His decision to come out, he writes, was motivated partly "because I fear that  our cause might sink back into the ooze in which so much of it rested in pre-NR  days (Buckley founded the magazine in 1955). In that dark age, the American  Right was heavily, perhaps dominantly, made up of bigots, anti-Semites,  anti-Catholics, the KKK, rednecks, Know Nothings, a sorry lot of public  hucksters and religious medicine men."  </P> <P> Now, Liebman writes, "too many of our friends have recently used homophobia to  sell their newsletters, or to raise money through direct mail for their causes  and themselves." He elaborates on these themes in an interview published in the  July 19 issue of the Advocate, a national gay newsmagazine.  </P> <P> Buckley said that he thinks Liebman's fears on this score are "terribly  exaggerated, that the conservative movement . . . is disintegrating into a  series of discrete plots which are anti-Catholic, antisemitic, anti-gay. The  conservative movement is entirely wholesome. I don't see happening what he sees  happening."  </P> <P> Today, Liebman says, he deeply regrets all those decades of silence.  </P> <P> "By not speaking about it," he says, "you're denying who you are, what you are.  To let it be known that you are a different person, to be accepted as such,  that is a great comfort, and it's so great for this new generation of gay  people! With my generation, you killed yourself rather than be exposed." In  coming out he's been surprised to learn, among other things, that "nobody  really cares, so my message now for my gay friends is, 'Get out and loosen up,  just let it all hang out.' The public is so forgiving, and really there's  nothing to forgive. Come on out -- the air is great!'  </P> <P> "The air in the closet was really sort of stultifying."  </P></p>

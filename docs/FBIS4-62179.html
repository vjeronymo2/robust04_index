			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Business News" rubric: </F> "Will We Sell Arms to Kuwait?"]    [Text] The Kuwaiti Government is planning to buy military  equipment in Russia, including 20 BMP-2 and 60 BMP-3 armored  personnel carriers, spare parts, and possibly 27 300-mm rocket  launchers. The purchase of Russian weapons represents a radical  change in Kuwait's previous position; in the past, it relied  solely on Western countries for the organizational development  of its armed forces.</p>

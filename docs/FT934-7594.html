			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Buthelezi 'will fight new deal' CONSERVATIVE black leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday warned President F W de Klerk he would fight South Africa's new interim constitution and reduce it to 'the rubble of passing history,' Reuter reports from Durban. Chief Buthelezi, who quit the constitutional talks five months ago, said Mr de Klerk and African National Congress leader Mr Nelson Mandela had decided 'to go it alone' without his participation or approval. 'We will meet the present draft constitution. . . with determined resistance,' said Chief Buthelezi, who demands autonomy for the Natal KwaZulu region where he has his power base. 'I want to point out that when it comes to the implementation of the new constitution and the whole transitional phase, nobody should expect us to be faithful and diligent in assisting.' Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela and 17 other leaders approved an interim constitution early yesterday providing for non-racial elections next April. Black and white right-wing groups reject the document as a recipe for ANC domination. Chief Buthelezi said he would not take part in the election if it meant legitimising a flawed constitution. 'I would rather go into the political wilderness,' he said.</p>

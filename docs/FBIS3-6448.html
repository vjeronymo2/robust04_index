The Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI] adopted the report at a meeting of the  panel on 16 March.    The panel is a private panel for the chief of the MITI  Industry Policy Bureau. The report, pointing to the drastically  growing demand for visual information in the individual  entertainment and office work sectors, estimates the visual  information market will grow from 15 trillion yen in 1992 to 71  trillion in 2015. The report points out that for the market to  expand in the future, it is important to deregulate and upgrade  the current information and communications infrastructures and  to establish an intellectual property rights system to protect  copyrights.    Visual information uses computers to transmit images and  sounds to the human visual and auditory senses. For this reason,  the report predicts that visual information will make it easy to  get information, and the demand for visual information will grow  drastically, especially in the exchange of information between  individuals and enterprises. The report analyzes that the demand  for information in the medical, education, and distribution  sectors will grow.    The report estimates the visual information market will grow  from 15 trillion yen (3.2 percent of the GNP) in 1992 to 25  trillion yen (4.2 percent of GNP) in 2000, and to 71 trillion  yen (8.3 percent of GNP) in 2015. The report points out that for  the visual information industry to develop in the future, it is  necessary to upgrade the current infrastructure, create an  information and communications network, establish a center where  visual information is stored and utilized, and establish a  visual information industry complex where related industries are  concentrated. The report advocates the need to provide financial  assistance to entrepreneurs eager to participate in the visual  information industry.</p>

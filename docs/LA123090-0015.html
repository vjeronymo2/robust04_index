			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti In Concert: Arias and songs.  Orchestras of the Florence May Festival and Rome Opera, Zubin Mehta,  conducting.  </P> <P> London 430 433-2 (compact disc). In July, three of the most famous tenors in  the world, along with a well-known conductor, participated in one of the most  extravagant vocal three-ring circuses in memory. This recording is taken from  that evening and has not one shred of interest for a serious collector. Chief  curiosity is the state of Carreras' voice after his long battle with leukemia.  The sound is fresh and youthful, if there are hints of a wobble in high,  fortissimo passages. Domingo's singing is about as usual, which means generally  beautiful, if unvarying in color or expressivity. It is left to Pavarotti to  provide the one instance of distinguished singing in a Crescenzo song, "Rondine  al Nido." As always, he projects the Italian language with a mastery few  singers can match. The final medley of war horses reaches its height of  vulgarity with a unison "Vincero" at the close of "Nessun dorma." Why a serious  musician like Mehta would lend his name to this travesty is an open  question.WALTER PRICE  </P></p>

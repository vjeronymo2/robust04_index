			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO OF MAYOR CALLED GOOD IDEA  </P> <P> I have lived in West Hollywood for many years; I am active in city affairs, and  I'm getting totally disenchanted with the narrow-minded "oppose everything"  mentality of many of our citizens.  </P> <P> The idea of a video profile of Mayor Abbe Land is an excellent idea. She is a  devoted, caring city official. She is dedicated to improving the quality on  life in our city. She is responsive to the particular needs of our  demographics; she works hard -- and she gets paid very little. She is not  running for reelection, so the program cannot be construed as politically  self-serving.  </P> <P> What could possibly be wrong with a community getting to know its public  officials better? This innovative idea is so good it should be expanded to  include the other members of the City Council, our city manager, department  heads, and key members of the government. Informative sketches such as this are  completely within propriety and belong on our city channel TV, which exists as  a "government access" channel. And no, as a taxpayer, I don't object to a few  of our dollars being spent to produce such material.  </P> <P> JIM ROGERS  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

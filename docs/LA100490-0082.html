			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SALUTES GERMANY IN ROSE GARDEN RITES;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: 'DREAMS DO COME TRUE,' THE PRESIDENT TELLS CELEBRATORS. BUT IN  ISRAEL, THE REACTION IS SOMBER.  </P> <P> President Bush staged his own celebration of German unification on Wednesday,  congratulating Chancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone and proclaiming  "German-American Day" at a Rose Garden ceremony.  </P> <P> "Today, it is the wall that lies in ruins and our eyes open on a new world of  hope," Bush told an audience of German-Americans.  </P> <P> Bush called the remnants of the Berlin Wall "a ragged monument in brick and  barbed wire" that serves as "proof that no wall can ever crush a nation's  soul."  </P> <P> "Dreams sometimes do come true. Germany is united. Germany is free," Bush said.  </P> <P> From elsewhere around the world congratulations were showered on Germany for  its rebirth as a united country after 45 years of division.  </P> <P> But many references to the previous experience with Germany as the dominant  power in Europe showed that the past is still not quite forgotten.  </P> <P> Israel, gripped by memories of the Nazi Holocaust, greeted German unification  somberly, with one newspaper calling it an insult.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he was disappointed that the unity agreement  made no mention of wartime Germany's slaughter of 6 million Jews.  </P> <P> The prime minister's adviser, Avi Pazner, said that a message from Kohl,  delivered in Jerusalem by the German charge d'affaires, "stressed the united  Germany's historical commitment to the Jewish people and the state of Israel .  . . a result of the crimes against the Jewish people by Nazi Germany."  </P> <P> Pazner said Israel had mixed feelings about reunification. He said Lichter's  meeting with the Polish-born Shamir, whose family was wiped out by the Nazis,  took place in a "reflective mood."  </P> <P> The English-language Jerusalem Post said memories of the wartime genocide  against Jews will never fade.  </P> <P> "And to many, the rise of a super-Germany less than 50 years after the  Holocaust is not only dangerous but an insult to historic justice," the  conservative daily said.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute to the "peaceful  and worthy solution of the 'German issue.' "  </P> <P> He cited "all those in my country and in your country who, overcoming sorrows,  remembering losses and honoring the dead, did not yield to prejudice and  fears."  </P> <P> In Brussels, NATO held a special meeting Wednesday to mark German  reunification, a time of "undiminished rejoicing," and thanked the Soviets for  agreeing to united Germany's membership in the alliance.  </P> <P> "Today we put nearly half a century of confrontation and frustration behind  us," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner told the 16 Atlantic Alliance  ambassadors.  </P> <P> President Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, the first country invaded by the  Nazis, wrote in a letter to German President Richard von Weizsaecker: "In this  historic moment for the German nation, I am convinced that united Germany will  not disappoint the trust of the world, and especially of its neighbors."  </P> <P> Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel called unification "the final end to the  war. . . . The unnatural division of Germany becomes a matter of the past, as  does the division of our continent."  </P> <P> "The desperation and scars cannot be erased from our minds, but it is necessary  and possible to overcome them," Havel added in a statement issued in Prague.  </P> <P> While most commentaries looked back to the Nazi past, in Hungary the former  Communist daily Nepszabadsag saw a wider significance in the death of the  German Democratic Republic, the former East Germany.  </P> <P> "The GDR was the socialist state par excellence, the country on whose existence  the viability of the socialist system hinged," it said. "So the disappearance  of the GDR also means a symbolic goodby to the phenomenon of European  communism."  </P></p>

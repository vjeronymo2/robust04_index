			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Gummer issues Pounds 2m writ for BT rent Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday issued a writ against British Telecommunications claiming more than Pounds 2.2m in rent and interest. Mr Gummer alleges that since Christmas day, BT has failed to pay Pounds 2.1m of rent for the 15 floors of the Euston Tower, in north-west London, that it leases from the department through an underlease. Mr Gummer also claims that BT, through two other underleases, owes another Pounds 123,000 for 50 parking spaces and rooms it rents in the tower's basement. The writ comes as BT, which has one of the largest corporate property portfolios in the UK, presses on with plans to cut its holdings from 75m sq ft to 15m sq ft by 2010. In particular BT is looking at properties where leases are ending, properties with long leases, where there is a notice to break a lease, and where there is a sub-leased property. A BT spokesman said he knew of 'no connection between the writ and our property disposals'. He added that the writ had not yet been served on the company. The Euston Tower is owned by British Land.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Palestinians want own central bank PALESTINIANS negotiating future economic relations with Israel yesterday insisted on their own central bank with the power to issue a separate currency and wide-ranging powers of independent decision-making in trade and taxation policy. In the first set of Palestinian-Israeli economic talks, which concluded in Paris last night, Palestinian delegates stressed they were seeking real economic sovereignty in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho and wanted independent economic decision-making to lay the basis for statehood. Israel is due to start a four-month military withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho next month. Despite public statements by heads of both delegations about the good atmosphere at the talks, deep divisions are apparent. On the critical issue of Israel's proposal for a customs union, Palestinian delegates said they would not accept Israeli imposition of a uniform customs and tax regime; they wanted all customs revenues on Palestinian imports to accrue to an independent Palestinian treasury and would insist on free trade with Jordan. They also object to the word 'union' which they believe carries unacceptable political implications negating their claims to sovereignty. 'We don't reject a customs union but we want to have our own economic decisions about customs, taxation and investment policy,' said Mr Mohamed Abu-Koash, PLO director for international economic affairs. 'But after 27 years of occupation we want to decide how best to develop our economic interests and sectors and encourage the right investments and we cannot begin with the same taxes as Israel.' Mr David Brodet, Israel's director of the state budget, was more optimistic. 'Both sides agree on the need for the free movement of goods, services and labour between Israel and the Palestinian economy. There will be some exceptions and maybe a phased exposure but the principle is agreed and everything else can be negotiated.' In money and banking the Palestinians made it clear for the first time they want an independent central bank with full powers to issue a Palestinian currency, control, license and hold the reserves of commercial banks and to direct monetary policy. 'We are talking about the economic sovereignty of the Palestinian nation,' Mr Abu-Koash said. 'We are not going to let anyone else exercise the rights over our monetary policy. We will have a purely Palestinian institution.' Israel is unhappy about the imminent prospect of a Palestinian central bank and prefers a gradual handover of monetary policy beginning with a Palestinian currency board. Palestinians also said they wanted Israel to remove barriers to Palestinian and Arab investment. The two sides agreed to establish three sub-committees to meet in Paris next week to bridge the differences of opinion on economic relations. They will focus on the main policy issues: trade and labour; money and banking; and fiscal policy. A joint statement said economic co-operation would be based on 'reciprocity, equity and fair economic relations as well as the enhancement of the role of the private sector in promoting economic growth'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin article: "Search for 18 Trillion Rubles </F> Continues. Not Only for Army -- for Country's Security"]    [Text] Today, according to the agenda approved Wednesday  [25 May], the State Duma will continue its work on the draft law  "On the Federal Budget for 1994." Discussion of defense items  will take place behind closed doors.    I do not think there is any need to explain why "closed  doors" were necessary. "We will try to convince the deputies,"  I was told by Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma  Defense Committee, "that 55 trillion rubles [R] is the minimum  defense expenditure below which we cannot go." The discussion  will proceed with specific figures to hand and with Defense  Ministry computations -- where particular sums are going and  what they are for. Yushenkov believes it is largely the  detailed argument which could sway those who voted 11 May  against increasing military expenditure.    But let us stipulate immediately that the "anti-Army"  motives  are by no means homogeneous here. There are, of course, those  deputies who by virtue of their professional detachment from  defense problems are more inclined to believe the expert  authorities. If the government says R37 trillion is enough to  cover defense expenditure, is it not best to believe it?  Especially as, instead of a well reasoned project, during the  first reading the deputies were offered, as they say, just "the  bare figures." It is for the sake of this category of doubters  that it it is possible and necessary to try to interpret where  and how the military intend to spend the people's money. But I  fear that for a certain number of deputies nothing can be proved  -- some, having sworn loyalty to their own departmenbt, will not  give up a single kopek, others will be inflexible because the  proposal arises from "politically alien elements," still others  will be guided by subtle and political considerations calculated  many moves in advance. Any reasoning is poweless here.    Yes, our deputies come in many varieties. But let us recall  that a majority -- 166 people -- nonetheless voted for the  allocation of the R18 trillion sought. Let us also bear in mind  that it was in the Duma that this amendment to the government's  draft law arose. And it was the Defenmse Committee and the  Defense Ministry which initiated the meeting with the Russian  Federation president's assistant for security, which ultimately  led to the president's intervention, who recognized the  correctness of increasing the defense budget to R55 trillion.  Today, when battle will again be joined for a realistic amount  of military expenditure, I know there will be many defenders of  the Army to be found in the State Duma hall. But the discussion  will not be about defending the Army on a grand scale but about  the state's security. It is not at all obligatory that somebody  should attack us from outside -- the collapse of the Army and  defense industry will shake the country worse than aggression  would.    What is actually going on? Everyone realizes -- even the  Finance Ministry and Central Bank -- that the military is not  asking for anything excessive. And this is stated by the person  who bears chief responsibility for the state's defense  capability -- Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin. But  the question of the additional R18 trillion remains up in the  air.    It is the easiest thing in the world to look for plotters,  especially across the ocean. But here it is better to agree  with Yushenkov's deputy -- Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov: The root  of evil lies in our negligence, in the inability to see further  than our own noses. Economizing on the Army and the defense  industry today means to lose those same trillions tomorrow, only  multiplied 10-fold. Piskunov off the cuff offered a scenario  for the development of the situation if there were just the  paltry R37 trillion. I issue a defense order, but the state is  not giving enterprises the money. So directors take out bank  loans (naturally at commercial banks -- there are no others) at  extortionate interest rates. The order is fulfilled but, in  order to pay the banks back they accordingly increase the price  of their output. Thus, domestically-produced combat equipment  and weapons will turn out so expensive that it will be more  advantageous to buy weapons and equipment abroad. "Specialists"  in the field of foreign trade will be found who will readily  substantiate the need for the final collapse of the Russian  defense industry, citing as substantiation none other than the  state's interests. It is easy to miss all this in one's  calculations today -- like the losses from the impossibility of  advantageously trading arms on the world market. But for some,  as Piskunov said, there is an insurmountable temptation to pay  "for the financial system's inefficiency with the collapse of  effective defense."    The budget deficit must not be increased. The consequences  of this step are also easy to miss when calculating. Meanwhile,  the inflationary noose, which will inevitably be pulled tighter  after a new batch of money backed by nothing is printed (the  same R18 trillion), and it will take a mortal grip on the throat  of the military man, above all. Whereas other people, even  those working in the budget-financed sector but civilians  nonetheless, have the opportunity to do a bit of extra work  somewhere to supplement their family budget, the military man is  completely deprived of this opportunity. This is why, Yushenkov  tried to convince me, when "Russia's Choice" categorically comes  out against increasing the budget deficit, it is not least  defending the interests of military personnel themselves. What  is the solution? Yushenkov (let me remind you that he is a  "Russia's Choice" activist) belives that it is possible to  scrape together the required sum by reassessing sources of the  income element of the budget. Incidentally, the State Duma  Economic Policy Committee has specific proposals on this.  Specifically, committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev is proposing  refusing a number of privileges to structures trading abroad  (the estimated saving is between R5 trillion and R10 trillion),  and to make privatization more "lucrative." Sergey Yushenkov is  counting on income from foreign economic activity and reducing  the state apparatus, and is not ruling out the possibility of  efficiently raising a domestic targeted loan from both citizens  and commercial structures. Aleksandr Piskunov sees some  unexploited poitential in tax policy but chiefly in the taxation  practice. (The state just cannot learn how to collect taxes).  There are also other proposals. The main thing, Piskunov said,  is that during the second reading there should be no clash  between conceptual economic schools. Putting it simply, our  learned economists should not lapse into arrogance. There is  one further hope that government representatives too will come  along to today's session with specific options for resolving  this difficult situation. Only not with those which will cause  the military to clash head-on with, for instance, the farmers,  the scientists, the medical personnel, or the whole world in  general. So that some time later you would have to explain to  the people: You will have to wait this year for an increase in  wages and pensions -- you yourselves are aware that the Army's  demands have had to be met.    Nonetheless, let us hope that the state will provide a  subsistence minimum for its Armed Forces, however hard it is to  do so. But it is woth bearing in mind for the future that  Russians are also giving us money today for real reforms in the  Army. They, our reforms, do not come cheap. But the route  which they are now to take is dependent on what kind of defense  budget for 1995 the State Duma deputies will vote tomorrow, and  with what kind of enthusiasm they vote.    It is the easiest thing in the world to look for plotters,  especially across the ocean.

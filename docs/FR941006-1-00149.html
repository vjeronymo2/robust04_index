			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Benefits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the past 7 years, there have been at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37 cases of pediatric fatality from the accidental ingestion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing products, or a mean of 5.3 deaths per year. Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the potency of the product consumed is available for 25 cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all cases for which information is available, the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumed contained at least 40 mg of iron. In the same 7-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, there were nearly 190 poisonings reported that were life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatening or that resulted in permanent injury, and over 2,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported poisonings requiring some form of treatment. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that most, if not all, such deaths and some poisonings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be prevented by requiring that higher-potency iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products be packaged in unit-dose packaging. Studies indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the child is less likely to consume the number of dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units that may be fatal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although no studies have attempted to directly estimate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of reducing the risk of death and illness to children in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, many studies have attempted to estimate the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing these risks to adults. Most of these estimates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on wage differences between high and low risk jobs and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus, are derived from the labor market decisions of middle-aged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults. Although these estimates cluster around a fairly small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range, $2 million to $10 million, it is not clear that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates are valid when applied to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has used estimates of the value of reducing risks to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults to a level that would avoid one statistical fatality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between $1.5 million and $5 million in past rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings, including recent food labeling regulations and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current proposal to require domestic and foreign processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers of fish and fishery products to establish Hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis Critical Control Points (HAACP) controls to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood products (59 FR 4142, January 28, 1994). One method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimating the value of reducing risks to children is to adjust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of reducing risks to adults by accounting for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference in the number of life-years saved. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach, an often used estimate of the value of the risks to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults to a level that would avoid one statistical fatality is $5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million for a middle-aged adult. If this value does not vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with life years remaining (that is, if we assume that an infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is willing to pay the same amount to avoid risk of death as a 40- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year old would be willing to pay and assuming the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of wealth exists in both age groups), then $5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million is a reasonable estimate. If, however, this value does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vary with life years remaining, then the corresponding value for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing the risks to small children would be $11 million. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will use these figures ($5 to 11 million) to provide a range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates. Although FDA is using these values in this analysis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA stresses the tentative nature of these estimates and requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on an appropriate method of estimating the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing risks to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of fatalities prevented by requiring unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging for iron-containing products at any potency level less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 60 mg iron/dosage unit will not be significantly different.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because all fatalities for which FDA has information resulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from ingestion of dosage units of at least 40 mg iron potency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all three of these options (all products, 30 mg and above, and 40 mg and above) would result in benefits of reducing an average of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.3 deaths per year, valued at between $280 million and $618  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, however, FDA were to select the option of requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit-dose packaging for all iron-containing products of potencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 60 mg iron per dosage unit and above, an average of 5 deaths  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be prevented per year leading to total discounted benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of preventing fatalities over 20 years of between $265 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and $583 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring unit-dosage packaging for iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will also reduce the number of nonfatal cases of pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning. FDA has obtained from CPSC case reports for 78 iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestions necessitating emergency room treatment reported over 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, or an average of 11 illnesses per year. The potency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product consumed was reported for 12 cases. In five of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the potency reported was under 30 mg iron/dosage unit. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seven cases, the potency reported was over 60 mg iron/dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. AAPCC data shows that from 1986 through 1992 there were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearly 190 reported poisonings that were life threatening or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in permanent injury, and over 2,000 reported poisonings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring some form of treatment as a result of accidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of adult and pediatric iron-containing products, or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average of 286 per year. FDA is unable to predict the percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these nonfatal poisonings which would be prevented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituting unit-dose packaging for bottles. It is possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that not all nonfatal poisonings will be prevented because a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child can still gain access to the product. However, he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will gain access to fewer dosage units than if the product is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a bottle. FDA requests comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using a methodology developed previously for FDA to value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> morbidity risks, FDA is able to estimate the value of reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of nonfatal poisoning. By comparing similar symptoms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical interventions, the agency has derived an estimate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of preventing a nonfatal pediatric iron poisoning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $20,000 per case. (Ref. 37) As stated previously, 7 out of 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases of nonfatal poisonings were a result of ingestion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products of potencies over 60 mg iron per dosage unit. If this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion can be extrapolated to the remaining cases for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is unknown, and if unit-dose packaging will prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all nonfatal cases (at least 2,000 cases in 7 years), then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring unit-dose packaging for products of 60 mg or more iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per dosage unit will add approximately $35 million to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits over the next 20 years (discounted at seven percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because no nonfatal cases for which information is known were a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of ingesting products with potencies between 30 mg and 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg iron per dosage unit, the options of requiring unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging for products with potencies of 40 mg and 30 mg iron per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage unit will not add more to the benefits than the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option. Still assuming that all nonfatal cases can be prevented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by unit-dose packaging, requiring packaging changes for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products would result in reduced morbidity valued at $61 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the next 20 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Hungarian Way Circles movement considers  rapprochement with the coalition parties possible, Chairman  Istvan Csurka has said, adding that relations between the  movement and the government parties naturally depend also on the  willingness of the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the operation  of the Boross government. Krisztina Hadas reports:    [Hadas] The statement of the Hungarian Way Circles presidium  urges unity of national forces. According to movement leader  Istvan Csurka, today countless parties characterize themselves  as national but this self-declaration is no more than an empty  phrase. The Hungarian Way Circles movement interprets such  unity as meaning unity with parties of the present government  coalition.    [Begin Csurka recording] This appeal, in fact, concerns the  coalition parties and the smaller and bigger political  gatherings and movements which are already members of the  Hungarian Way. Now we wish to see more pronounced politics from  them. After all, the force in government is the most important,  regardless of how much of its popularity has been lost during  the time of governing. [end recording]    [Hadas] At his news conference Csurka said that the four  month activity of the government lead by Peter Boross could be  extremely important for the country's future. The leader of the  Hungarian Way Circles hopes that the forthcoming national  conference of the Hungarian Democratic Forum will bring a  favorable political turn for them. He did not speculate but  said that, come what may, the Hungarian Way Circles and the  Hungarian Justice and Life Party can only influence the  government by declarations of principles.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Reason for optimism about changes in auditing practice Sir, I refer to your article 'Auditors' body calls for changes in practice' (November 24). It is ironic that the accounting profession, this time in the form of the Auditing Practices Board, is discovering again that there is 'a need for auditors to report to a wider audience' and 'on a far wider range of activities'. It is ironic because this was the main thrust of the Accounting Standards Steering Committee's 'The Corporate Report', published in 1975. This document proposed six specific additional statements, many of which address current concerns and none of which has ever been taken up by the ASC, the stock exchange or legislation. The Corporate Report, like the current discussion document, was radical in recognising a responsibility to regulators, employees, etc. However, there is more reason to be optimistic under the new standard setting regime that the profession will at long last grasp this thistle and make major improvements in both financial reporting and the role of auditors.

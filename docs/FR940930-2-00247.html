The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Notice was reviewed by OMB under Executive Order 12866 as a significant regulatory action.

This notice only affects participants and investors in GNMA guaranteed single and multiclass securities industry.

The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13 was implemented by a final rule codified as 24 CFR Part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read Part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any questions about that rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410&hyph;3000.

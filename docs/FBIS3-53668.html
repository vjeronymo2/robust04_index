			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi] </F>   [Text] Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the banned  Muslim Brotherhood, has returned on the same flight that took  him to Jordan after he was prevented by the Jordanian  authorities at the airport from entering the country last  Thursday in the first case of its kind experienced by  al-Hudaybi, who has regularly visited Jordan for the past 20  years.    Al-Hudaybi, who appeared moved by the sudden Jordanian  decision, told ROSE AL-YUSUF: I was going to visit my physician  daughter, who is married to a physician, lives in Jordan, and  has Jordanian citizenship. I spoke to her on the telephone and  told her: I am coming to visit you. I have been visiting her  for the past 20 years. What happened!    [Al-Ibrashi] Was there a political, party, Muslim  Brotherhood, or other conference or meeting?    [Al-Hudaybi] Not at all. This was a family visit unrelated  to any other activity.    [Al-Ibrashi] Did the Jordanian authorities give you any  explanation for preventing you from entering the country?    [Al-Hudaybi] I asked them and they told me that you are  banned from entering the country. I asked them why. They said:  We are security people and carry out instructions. I tried to  see the security director. I tried to talk to anyone. But they  prevented me and did not want to listen. My daughter was  waiting for me at the airport. I tried to see her, but they  also prevented me.    Al-Hudaybi added: I have not recently said anything at all  against Jordan. On the contrary. I have praised the democratic  experiment in Jordan in the wake of the recent elections. The  Muslim Brotherhood there is recognized and licensed. The party  won 18 seats in the recent elections. I was only going to see  my daughter.    Meanwhile, Jordanian diplomatic sources have told ROSE  AL-YUSUF that the Jordanian authorities have adopted new  measures regarding the entry of the leaders and members of  fundamentalist groups. They said that they have no knowledge or  explanation why al-Hudaybi was banned from entering Jordan and  whether this ban is part of these measures or there are other  reasons.    Jordan has recently arrested on arrival 15 Jordanians and  Palestinians returning from Afghanistan. Before that, it  arrested others and released some of them following the  intervention of the Muslim Brotherhood there. Some are still  being detained.</p>

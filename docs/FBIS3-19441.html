			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The tragic shipping accident in the Bosporus  Straits has created a bad precedent in Turkey's announced  intention to seek amendments to the 1936 Treaty of Montreux  governing the international status of the straits with  international marine regulations.    In 1992, Ankara began a process to amend the Treaty and  recently moved to adopt a new rule for the straits that provides  for a 24 hour advance notice of the passage of ships with  dangerous and polluting cargo.    In connection with the amendment of the Treaty, Turkey  recalls the dangers to the sea from the passage of big tankers,  which mainly come through the Black Sea. The tragic accident in  the Bosporus and the threat of a major ecological disaster to  the area could be a first class pretext for Turkey to insist on  the amendment of the Treaty of Montreux.    Ankara's main goal is to control the sea route for  transporting oil, a move that will primarily hurt Russia, but  also all other countries with commercial interests in the Black  Sea. It will also hurt Greece, which, above all else, is a  cosignatory of the Treaty.    Alexandros Alavanos, a Coalition of the Left and Progress  European Parliament deputy, has already asked the European Union  Council of Ministers to deal with an attempt by Turkey to  violate the Treaty and asked that the issue be discussed at the  Pan European Transport Conference in Crete.

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commission urges France to halt state subsidies to Groupe Bull The European Commission will next week call on the French government to suspend a final FFr2.5bn (Pounds 287m) tranche of aid to Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group, pending the outcome of a Commission investigation into FFr11.1bn of subsidies. Officials agreed yesterday that the 17 commissioners would adopt the proposal from Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, next Wednesday without further discussion. The decision represents growing frustration in Brussels that the French government has failed to provide details of its restructuring plan for Bull, announced last October. Commission officials admitted yesterday they could do little to force France to comply with the request. However, one official advised the French government to act before next Wednesday's meeting to defuse the tension over the Bull case. 'If the French have any common sense they will send a letter to Van Miert undertaking not to pay the remaining part of the aid,' said the official. The Commission is already investigating a FFr2.5bn capital allocation to Bull, granted by the previous French government, on the grounds that it may distort competition. Commissioners will agree next week to extend that inquiry to cover the FFr8.6bn allocation from the present government and France Telecom, which owns 16 per cent of Bull. Commissioners face a much more difficult decision on Mr Van Miert's controversial proposal to block a three-way joint venture involving French, German and Italian manufacturers of stainless steel tubes. If the deal is opposed, it will be only the second time that the EU's 1990 merger regulation has been used to outlaw a deal. Officials said yesterday that they were under heavy pressure from lobbyists and trade unions to approve the venture, but it was difficult to predict which way commissioners would vote. The Commission is also set to wave through Mr Van Miert's proposal to open an investigation into subsidies from the city-state of Bremen, Germany, to Klockner-Werke's steel mill. A decision on whether to block the subsidies will not be taken until later. But Mr Van Miert is known to be extremely concerned about the city-state's plan to sell the steel mill and grant a DM200m cash injection to maintain steel-making capacity, at a time when other steelmakers are forsaking subsidies and cutting production. Officials said yesterday the Commission would act fast to reach a decision on the case.</p>

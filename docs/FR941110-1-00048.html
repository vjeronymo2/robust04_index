			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Testimony indicates that it would be desirable to hold nomination meetings in conjunction with other industry meetings, such as a shipper's association, grower's association, or Extension Service meetings. Such a procedure would encourage higher attendance at the meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meetings held for nominating members and alternates of subsequent committees should be held no later than April 1 of each year or such other date as the committee may recommend and the Secretary may approve. Inasmuch as the term of office would begin June 1 of each year, nomination meetings should be held in sufficient time to assure that appointments may be made prior to the beginning of each new term of office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nominations should be submitted in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe. One nominee should be designated for each position that is to be filled the following June 1. Sufficient information about each nominee should be provided so the Secretary can determine if such person is qualified for the position for which nominated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers should participate in designating nominees for producer members and alternates. Only Walla Walla Sweet Onion handlers would be entitled to vote for handler members. If a person both produces and handles Walla Walla Sweet Onions, such person may vote either as a producer or a handler, but not both. Each eligible person should be allowed to cast only one vote in the nomination process for each member and alternate member position that is to be filled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions also should be made for the nomination and selection of a public member and alternate. The record indicates that nominees for the public member and alternate should be selected by the industry members of the committee every three years at the first meeting following the selection of the current committee. The names of the nominees would then be forwarded to the Secretary for selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order should provide that the members of the committee should be selected by the Secretary from persons nominated or from among other qualified persons, in accordance with proposed &sect;956.23. In the event nominations are not made within the time and in the manner specified in the order, the Secretary may select members and alternates without regard to nominations, in accordance with proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;956.27. Such selection should be from qualified persons as provided in the order. Each person to be selected by the Secretary as a member or as an alternate member of the committee should, prior to selection, qualify by advising the Secretary that such person agrees to serve in the position for which nominated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;956.26 states that the order should provide a method for promptly filling any vacancies on the committee for unexpired terms of office. There may be vacancies caused by the death, removal, resignation, or disqualification of a member or alternate. The order should provide that the Secretary should name a successor to fill an unexpired term from nominations made in the same manner as provided for nominating all other members and alternates. Any nomination meetings for filling vacancies should be held within a reasonable amount of time after a vacancy occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to avoid holding meetings and electing nominees when other nominees acceptable to the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry are before the Secretary, the selection of members from nominees previously submitted but not selected should be permitted. This would allow, for example, the Secretary to appoint a person who received the second highest number of votes at the last nomination meeting for the position that has become vacant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As set forth in proposed &sect;956.28, the order should specify a procedure for the committee to conduct its meetings. It should provide that a majority of all members of the committee is necessary to constitute a quorum and to pass any motion or approve any committee action. However, any action made pursuant to proposed &sect;956.61 pertaining to recommendations for regulations, would require seven concurring votes. Accordingly, six members of the ten-member committee must be present in order to constitute a quorum and enable the committee to conduct a meeting. At least six affirmative votes should be required to pass any motion or approve any committee action, except when dealing with recommendations for regulations, which would require at least seven. The evidence of record is that at least seven committee members should be required to concur on any recommendations pertaining to the imposition of container marking requirements because more is needed to protect minority interests while at the same time allowing majority rule. A simple majority would be sufficient for recommendations on other activities authorized under the marketing order, i.e., recommendations on production and marketing research and marketing development and promotion projects, including paid advertising, and the financing of these activities through handler assessments and voluntary contributions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There may be times when it will be impossible to assemble the committee promptly to meet an emergency situation. Therefore, the order also should enable committee members, and alternates when acting as members, to vote by mail, telegraph, telephone, facsimile, or other means of communication, provided that any vote cast orally be confirmed promptly in writing. If an assembled meeting is held, all votes should be cast in person, to ensure that the person voting on a motion or committee action hears both sides of the question before taking such action. The majority, quorum, and voting requirements should still apply when voting by mail, telegraph, telephone, facsimile, or other means of communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee members and alternates will necessarily incur some expense while on committee business. Reasonable expenses, which may include travel, meals and lodging, should be reimbursed to members while attending committee meetings or performing other duties under the order, in accordance with proposed &sect;956.29. Therefore, the order should provide that members, and alternates when serving as members of the committee, should serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for such expenses authorized by the committee and necessarily incurred by them in attending committee meetings and in the performance of their duties under the order. Testimony indicates that it should be at the discretion of the committee to pay expenses of alternate members who are requested to attend meetings regardless of whether their respective members are present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee, under proposed &sect;956.30, should be given those specific powers that are set forth in section 608c(7)(C) of the Act. Such powers are granted by the enabling statutory authority and are necessary for an administrative agency, such as the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Committee, to carry out its proper functions. It would be necessary for the committee to adopt rules and regulations, prescribe the terms on which applications or information is to be filed, and to set up procedural rules to administer this part. The committee also should have the power to investigate complaints of violations to the order and forward such information to the Secretary, and to recommend to the Secretary appropriate amendments to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee's duties as set forth in &sect;956.31 of the proposed order are necessary for the discharge of its responsibilities. These duties are similar to those typically specified for administrative agencies under other programs of this nature. They pertain to specific activities authorized under the order, such as investigating and compiling information regarding Walla Walla Sweet Onion marketing conditions, and to the general operation of the order including hiring employees, appointing officers, and keeping records of all committee transactions. It is proposed that the marketing order delineate committee duties as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) At the beginning of each fiscal period, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the committee should hold an organizational meeting at which a chairman and such other officers as may be necessary would be selected, any necessary subcommittees should be appointed, and such rules and regulations for the conduct of business should be adopted as may be advisable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The committee should act as intermediary between the Secretary and producers and handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

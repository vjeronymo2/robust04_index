			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IF JACK CLARK RETURNS, AT LEAST ONE FAN WON'T  </P> <P> I just read today's article on Tony Gwynn, and I have to say Jack Clark is a  lost cause! He's a bad example of a team leader.  </P> <P> First of all, we pay him the big bucks to throw bases around. Secondly, it  seems he's always sick or hurt. For one who complains a lot, if he doesn't like  it, he can leave. At least Tony Gwynn earns his money.  </P> <P> JIM SKERTICH, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese drug group licenses treatment Ajinomoto, the Japanese pharmaceuticals, chemicals and food additives company, yesterday signed an agreement with Sandoz to license a diabetes treatment to the Swiss drugs group. The move demonstrates the increasing productivity and sophistication of Japanese drugs research. Sandoz will pay a licence fee of at least Y1bn (Dollars 9m), as well as royalties equivalent to about 10 per cent of sales. The Basle-based group has acquired the rights to develop and market the drug. Ajinomoto hopes the compound could be marketed in Japan as early as 1998 and eventually generate world-wide annual sales of Y50bn. Of these, 40 per cent would be domestic. World-wide sales of diabetic drugs were about Dollars 2.5bn in 1992 and growing at about 10 per cent a year, according to Lehman Brothers, the international securities company. Others developing or marketing similar drugs include Hoechst of Germany, and Upjohn and Pfizer of the US. Ajinomoto's sales of drugs, amino acids and speciality chemicals were Y93.7bn in 1992, compared with a group turnover of Y667bn. The company is one of a number of Japanese groups that have diversified into pharmaceuticals in recent years.</p>

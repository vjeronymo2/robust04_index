			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (15): The sweet smell of success / Profile of L'Oreal WHENEVER you flick through the pages of a glossy fashion magazine you are almost certain to see at least one advertisement bearing the image of the soignee actress, Isabella Rossellini. Ms Rossellini is the 'face' of Lancome, one of the world's most famous cosmetics brands. She is also one of the most potent weapons of Lancome and L'Oreal, its French parent company, in the increasingly competitive international cosmetics industry. L'Oreal is one of the handful of multinational manufacturers which, in recent years, has turned the beauty business into a high stakes game of expensive advertising campaigns, ambitious product development programmes and soaring research budgets. So far L'Oreal has held a winning hand. The competitive state of the industry has put intense pressure on the smaller players and made it very difficult for the big industrial groups which recently expanded in cosmetics, such as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, to integrate their acquisitions. L'Oreal, by contrast, is not only the world's largest cosmetics company, but, thanks to 80 years of experience, is also one of the longest established forces in the industry. As a result it has had the advantage of being one of the few players with the resources needed to remain competitive and the flexible management structure required to respond to fast-changing markets such as make-up and fragrances. At a time when the global cosmetics market has been sluggish and other French companies have been hit by the economic slowdown, L'Oreal has continued to grow. It was the highest riser among the top 50 companies in the 1992 FT500, moving from 67th to 36th place during the year. L'Oreal, led by Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, who became chairman five years ago, achieved this through a 19.7 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.02bn in 1991, from FFr1.69bn in 1990, on sales which rose by 10.2 per cent to FFr33.44bn. Analysts expect further growth in profits, albeit at a slower pace, this year. Mr Loic Morvan, an analyst at James Capel in Paris, predicts net profits of FFr2.2bn to FFr2.3bn for 1992. Ostensibly L'Oreal seems well-placed to reap the rewards of its years of investment in management systems, marketing and product development in spite of the difficult state of its markets. But there is a cloud on the horizon. So far L'Oreal has had the benefit of stable ownership. It is still controlled by its founding family, the Bettencourts, and has thus been free from the threat of a takeover bid. Ms Liliane Bettencourt, the founder's daughter, owns 51 per cent of the company that controls two thirds of L'Oreal. The other 49 per cent has, since 1974, been held by Nestle, the Swiss food group, which has pre-emptive rights over the rest. Ms Bettencourt has promised to retain control for as long as she lives. But Nestle's agreement not to bid for control expires at the end of this year. Even after that Nestle would need to secure the French government's permission to win control of L'Oreal. However, Nestle already has significant interests in France, thanks to its success last spring in the bitter bid battle for Perrier mineral water. Mr Helmut Maucher, its indomitable chairman has made no secret of the fact that he would like to control L'Oreal. And, as the Perrier affair proved, Mr Maucher always tries very, very hard to get whatever he wants.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUC WILL LET THE MARKET SELECT PIPELINES  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission said Wednesday that it will allow  competition to determine which proposed pipelines will bring clean-burning  natural gas to California from out of state, rather than making the choice  itself.  </P> <P> California's demand for natural gas is rising rapidly and the state needs new  pipelines, said PUC Commissioner Stanley W. Hulett. Electric utilities, which  can use either oil or gas to generate electricity, frequently find their  natural gas transmissions cut when supplies are short because the needs of  residential customers are put first.  </P> <P> "With the recognition that natural gas is the environmentally preferred fuel,  especially for electric generation in the southern part of the state, it is  obvious that new pipeline capacity will benefit this and future generations of  Californians," Hulett said.  </P> <P> An administrative law judge recommended last year that the commission back the  pipeline proposed by Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which intends to begin  building a 904-mile pipeline from Wyoming to California by the end of the year.  </P> <P> But the PUC found that because so much competition exists to serve the  California market, the commission only needs to set conditions to "prevent the  cost of the new pipelines from falling disproportionately on residential  customers." The commission said it would back all proposals that met those  conditions.  </P> <P> A Kern River Gas Transmission spokesman said the company is "extremely  delighted" with the decision because it believes its proposal will be  competitive. Its pipeline, a joint venture between the Williams Cos. of Tulsa,  Okla., and Tenneco Inc. of Houston, should begin operating in 1991.  </P> <P> The Wyoming-California Pipeline Co., known as Wycal, also said it was pleased  with the ruling. Wycal, a subsidiary of Houston-based Coastal Corp., said it  plans to begin construction by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Also covered by the decision are pipelines proposed by the Mojave Pipeline Co.,  Pacific Gas Transmission Co./Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and Transwestern  Pipeline Co.  </P> <P> In addition, the PUC proposed restructuring the way gas is purchased and  delivered to industrial customers. The intent of the restructuring is to make  the natural gas market more competitive, the PUC said.  </P> <P> The proposals would prohibit regulated gas utilities -- primarily Southern  California Gas, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric --  from selling to industrial and large commercial users except at the same rates  they charge residential customers. One of the proposals would require utilities  to spin off non-regulated affiliates that would compete with all other gas  suppliers if they want to sell to industrial customers.  </P></p>

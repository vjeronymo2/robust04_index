			<p>BFN     [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of  the House of Representatives, has sent a letter to the chairman  of the current session of the Afro-Arab parliamentary dialogue  conference, in which he regretted the Yemeni House of  Representatives' inability to take part in the conference. He  said this is a result of the situation in our country since the  eruption of the political crisis in August and a result of the  military situation exploded by the secessionist clique within  the Socialist Party, as well as al-Bid's secessionist  declaration that has no foundation in the Constitution or the  law, since the Yemeni Republic is an indivisible whole and no  part of it may be relinquished.    The letter asked the conference to voice support for Yemen's  unity and constitutional authority that was elected by the  people.</p>

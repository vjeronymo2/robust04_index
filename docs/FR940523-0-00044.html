			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has determined that there is no need to set a tolerance for the amount of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II that will be consumed because the agency knows of no reason why this protein would have any properties that would distinguish it toxicologically from any other phosphorylating enzymes in the food supply. Also, as discussed above, APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II will not affect efficacy of orally administered antibiotics because APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is rapidly digested under normal conditions in the GI tract, and even in abnormal gastric conditions where APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II may not be rapidly digested, the amount of ATP available in food would allow only a small proportion of kanamycin and neomycin to be inactivated. Therefore, the agency concludes that there is no need to require quality control and assurance procedures to ensure that the APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II level will be no more than 0.1 percent of the total protein in commercial tomato varieties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third comment argued that Calgene did not provide data to establish that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II would not be present after tomato processing and after extraction of edible oils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency's exposure estimates included an assumption that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II would be present in both processed tomatoes and fresh tomatoes even though the high temperatures involved in processing inactivate enzymes and therefore, processed tomato products are unlikely to contain enzymatically active APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II (Ref. 18). In addition, well-established processing procedures used to extract edible oils from oilseed crops do not extract significant amounts of protein (Ref. 23). Therefore, exposure to APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II obtained from rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil would be negligible (Ref. 18). The comment did not present any information to contradict FDA's analysis and conclusion on this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Potential for Side Effects From Consumption of Genetically Engineered Foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment asked whether there might be side effects from consumption of genetically engineered foods, and if so, whether these side effects would be short term or long term. Another comment noted that food plants and humans exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior and that therefore, the safety of a food substance should be based on thoughtfully gathered empirical evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments did not point to any specific side effects of genetically engineered foods. FDA has evaluated the safety of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II and has determined that it is safe for its proposed use. This safety assessment is in fact based on empirical evidence, such as the structure and function of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II, the low level at which APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II occurs in foods, the digestibility of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II, and the inability of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II to interfere with clinically useful antibiotics under usual conditions of use for the antibiotics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Relevance of Clinical Studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments noted that a National Institutes of Health (NIH) gene therapy trial in which cancer patients were infused with cells containing the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene, and which was cited by Calgene as strong evidence for the safety of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene, provides little information concerning the safety of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in food. One comment also noted that the combination of data from the in vitro studies and the gene therapy study was an inadequate basis for a safety determination of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in food that millions of people might eat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is safe for its proposed food additive use, FDA did not rely on the NIH gene therapy trial. However, FDA does believe that the in vitro degradation data provide important information that should be and was considered by the agency as part of its overall safety assessment of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II, as discussed earlier in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Possible Effect on Clinical Efficacy of Orally Administered Kanamycin or Neomycin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments questioned whether the presence of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in tomatoes or other foods might compromise the clinical efficacy of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin. One comment noted that Calgene claimed that at most only 76,800 people annually were administered kanamycin or neomycin orally, and argued that those people deserved not to be put at risk. The comment further requested that Calgene be required to perform animal studies on the effects of ingestion of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II on the efficacy of orally administered kanamycin and neomycin. The comment asserted that if APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II were shown to compromise clinical efficacy of kanamycin or neomycin, food containing APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II should be appropriately labeled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments observed that ingested APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II would not impair the efficacy of orally administered kanamycin and neomycin, that these antibiotics are rarely administered orally, and that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene is therefore a good choice as a selectable marker gene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees with Calgene that kanamycin and neomycin are rarely administered orally. The primary clinical role for orally administered neomycin, and to a lesser extent kanamycin, is cleansing the bowel of microbes prior to bowel surgery. This use is relatively minor because of severe side effects (auditory nerve damage and kidney damage) that may result from the antibiotic that is absorbed from the GI tract (Ref. 38).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, for most individuals receiving oral kanamycin or neomycin, APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II will be inactivated by the acidic environment of the stomach and degraded by the digestive enzymes present in the GI tract. More important, even for patients receiving simultaneous treatment to reduce stomach acidity, the amount of ATP available from food would allow, at most, only a small fraction of kanamycin or neomycin to be inactivated. The comment advocating animal studies did not contradict directly or indirectly FDA's analysis concerning the inactivation and degradation of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II or the information concerning ATP levels. FDA has therefore determined that the presence of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in food will not compromise therapy with orally administered kanamycin or neomycin. On this basis, FDA has concluded that neither animal studies on the effects of ingestion of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II on the efficacy of the antibiotics, nor special labeling of foods containing APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II for patients receiving orally administered kanamycin or neomycin, are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Finance Minister Crispiniano </F> Sandoval by unidentified reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [ABC COLOR] We are only 15 days away from decisive  political and technical Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  meetings. How do you view Mercosur's immediate future? Will it  be a free-trade zone, a united customs system, or a common  market?    [Sandoval] About Mercosur's immediate future: Officially,  the schedule established at Las Lenas is being fulfilled. That  schedule established the creation of a common market as of 1  January 1995. However, the decisive item in the creation of a  common market, the establishment of a common external duty  system, has been delayed.    According to a decision made during the 28 December 1992  presidential meeting in Montevideo, the common external duty  system will have levels between zero and 20 percent, although "a  reduced list of products will have different rates, which will  reach up to 35 percent, with the understanding that this special  rate will be reduced to a maximum of 20 percent over a period no  longer than six years beginning on 1 January 1995."    On the other hand, the Asuncion Treaty gives Paraguay and  Uruguay one year, or until 1 January 1995, for the total  elimination of the list of exceptions that is included in the  remaining 20 percent of that list.    We can infer from all I said above that if products and  duties in the reduced list mentioned in the 28 December 1992  presidents declaration are not many, we will have a "limited  customs union" on 1 January 1995.    [ABC COLOR] Considering the difficulties encountered among  member countries during the negotiating process, what are  Brazil's proposals for breaking the deadlock and establishing a  common external duty system for products called sensitive, such  as capital goods, pharmaceutical chemistry [quimica fina],  computers, etc.? Will the date for the establishment of an  extended market, which was set for 1 January 1995, be delayed if  it is not possible to find common ground for an agreement?    [Sandoval] According to what was said in the last economy  vice ministers' meeting in Montevideo on 12 November 1993, as  well as during the previous meetings of the technical subgroup  10 (to coordinate macroeconomic policies), the Brazilian  position on one hand, and the Argentine, Paraguayan, and  Uruguayan positions on the other, are irreducible when referring  to products such as capital goods, computers, and pharmaceutical  chemistry. Brazil wants to protect its industries in these  areas, while Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay need to equip  themselves, want the freedom to freely chose technologically  advanced products from third countries at a reasonable price,  and do not want to be forced to purchase Brazilian machinery  which is competitive simply because of the zero duty between  Mercosur countries.    Brazil has made a concrete proposal. They proposed applying  a 35 percent duty on these products at first, then lowering the  rate gradually until it reaches 20 percent in six years starting  in 1995. But this position was categorically rejected by  Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Evidently this is a very  difficult point because it not only deals with a difference in  criteria on duties, but also affects the macroeconomic policies  of these countries. The media has reported two bilateral  meetings between Argentina and Brazil at the level of the  economy vice ministers and economy ministers during December, to  discuss these points. Paraguay and Uruguay were excluded from  those meetings. Decisions in Mercosur must consented to by the  four member countries. We can assure you that Paraguay will not  yield its position of demanding reduced duties for these  products.    There is no doubt that a stalemate on this point will be an  obstacle for the establishment of the Mercosur as of 1 January  1995. But it is better to wait and see.    [ABC COLOR] The schedule for the gradual elimination of  tariffs has been strictly fulfilled. But very little progress  has been made in the area of coordinating macroeconomic  policies. We can almost say that talks on this matter are  stalemated. What is being done to correct the asymmetries  regarding trade, foreign exchange, tariffs, and even some  protectionism that is still noticeable in the national economic  structures of member countries?    [Sandoval] Here we must say that Brazil is the member  country  that must correct its economic policy in order to move its  position closer to that of the other countries. According to  macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rate, devaluation,  fiscal balance, and custom tariffs, there is a great difference  between Brazil and the other three member countries. The  indicators mentioned above are not too different in Argentina,  Paraguay, and Uruguay, and the gap can, therefore, be closed.  But Brazil, with a 30 percent monthly inflation rate,  correlative devaluations, and protectionist tariff policies in  general, is too far out and will have difficulties in closing  the gap. This country must establish the mechanisms to  substantially reduce those rates. No one can ask the other  three countries to increase their indicators disproportionately.    Uruguay's case is somewhat different because, although it  does not have an incredibly high inflation rate nor devaluations  (between 30 and 60 percent per year), its indicators do not  match those of Argentina and Paraguay, but there are greater  possibilities of adjusting them. This issue, obviously, is  Mercosur's "Achilles tendon" because the respective economic  plans are subject to the domestic policies, and in order to  become attuned with other countries it is necessary to make  changes which in some cases may represent great detours from the  chosen path.    But we must also bear in mind that there is still a year  ahead of us before Mercosur is implemented, and that the  Brazilian delegations, during the economy ministers' meeting  held in Asuncion on 1 July 1993, made a proposal to study the  possibility of a maximum exchange rate band for the real  exchange rate. This proposal is being assessed by the working  subgroups.    [ABC COLOR] In the case of a possible link with NAFTA, what  do you think Brazil will do if it has to choose between NAFTA  and Mercosur?    [Sandoval] Although the Asuncion Treaty does not  specifically  mention the linking of member countries with other economic  blocs, with the exception of ALADI [Latin American Integration  Association], it can be deduced from what is established in  Article 8 that any advantage granted to a member country is  extended to the other Mercosur members. Therefore, Brazil or  any other Mercosur member country's link with NAFTA would  automatically mean the link of the entire group with the NAFTA  bloc.    Another possibility is that Brazil leave Mercosur, as  established in Articles 21 and 22, to independently join NAFTA.  We do not believe this will happen because it was precisely  Brazil and Argentina that promoted Mercosur. Moreover, in the  hypothetical case that it has to choose between Mercosur and  NAFTA, we believe that Brazil as the country with greater  economic development in the region will be more interested in  Mercosur for competitiveness and leadership reasons.</p>

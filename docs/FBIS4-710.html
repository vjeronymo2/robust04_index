			<p>BFN     [Text] Libreville, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Gabon's main opposition  leader Father Paul Mba Abessole returned to Libreville this  morning after over a month's visit to Paris. Father Abessole  left Gabon after last February's disturbances which led to nine  deaths. The National Lumberjacks Rally [RNB] party leader was  welcomed by about 100 enthusiastic RNB supporters on arrival at  Libreville Airport where policemen had taken position. Father  Abessole made no statement on arrival.    The opposition leader left Libreville for Paris on 8 March  officially to "rest and to contact his friends," an opposition  spokesman announced. His departure followed four days of  violent disturbances, from 21 to 24 February, in several parts  of Libreville's residential districts during which nine persons,  including two soldiers, were killed, according to an official  report. The government had accused Father Mba Abessole and his  party of being responsible for the disturbances that had flared  up following a strike called by a labor union close to the  opposition. During the disturbances, security forces had,  notably, stormed the opposition leader's residence in Libreville  in his absence. The state of alert which banned demonstrations  and a curfew were reimposed following the disturbances. The  state of alert was lifted on 8 April.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Two nuclear-capable Soviet warships and an oiler will dock July 21 at Atlantic  Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va., marking the first time Soviet warships have  visited a U.S. military port, the Navy said. The four-day visit by a Soviet  destroyer and cruiser, both capable of firing nuclear-tipped cruise missiles,  is part of a good-will exchange agreement in which U.S. warships will later  visit a Soviet port. The schedule and details of the American visit were still  being discussed, a Navy spokesman said. Arriving aboard the Soviet warships  will be a small number of civilians and 1,100 Soviet naval personnel. The  visiting ships will include the Slava-class guided-missile cruiser Marshal  Ustinov and the Sovremenny-class destroyer Otlichnny.  </P></p>

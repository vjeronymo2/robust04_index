The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, indicated  that Ivanov acquainted brother Abu-'Ammar with the outcome of  his talks with the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister.    Brother Abu-'Ammar laid out for the Russian envoy the PLO's  basic demand that protection for the Palestinians in the  occupied territories be ensured before the talks can be resumed.  Brother Abu-'Ammar reiterated the PLO's position that the  United Nations must secure protection for the Palestinians and  disarm Jewish settlers. The brother president, WAFA adds, told  the Russian envoy he was disturbed that the UN Security Council  found it hard to pass a resolution that would make it possible  for the peace talks to resume and for secure protection for the  Palestinians throughout the occupied territories to be ensured.  The meeting took place in a cordial atmosphere and demonstrated  that the Palestinian and Russian viewpoints were identical.    According to a Palestinian source, brother Abu-'Ammar  earlier  received the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, John McCarthy, to discuss  continuing consultations about a UN Security Council resolution  on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Russia is widely thought to be  in favor of a resolution providing for international protection  for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, while the  United States and Israel are opposed.</p>

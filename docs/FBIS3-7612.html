Korean Authorities Accused of Blocking Pyongyang Trip </F> of Large-Scale High-Level Foreign Peace Mission" -- KCNA  headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the  Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement  today denouncing the South Korean authorities for having blocked  former presidents, prime ministers and other high-level  politicians of different countries from visiting Pyongyang  through Panmunjom.    The spokesman said:    Former presidents, prime ministers and other high-level  politicians of different countries, who had attended the Second  World Peace Conference a few days ago, expressed their  willingness to visit Pyongyang, passing through Panmunjom, in  order to have a better understanding of the realities of the  DPRK and manifest their support and solidarity for the Korean  people's efforts for peace and reunification of the country.    Among them were about 100 prominent political activists from  different continents -- some 30 former heads of state and  government including former Costa Rican presidents Rodrigo  Carazo and Mario Echandi, former Sudanese President Abdel Rahman  Sowar el Dahab and former Prime Minister El Katim el Khalifa,  former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, former Guyanese  President Desmond Hoyte, and former Canadian Governor-General  Edward Schreyer; incumbent and former high-level politicians  from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand and other Asian  countries, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and other Middle East  countries, France, Spain, Norway and other European countries,  Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other countries in Latin America;  and high-level politicians from the United States.    The spokesman said:    "Though we had made preparations and kept our side's portion  of Panmunjom open to welcome them as envoys of peace and  friendship, their visit to Pyongyang could not be realised due  to the obstruction of the South Korean authorities."    Branding the South Korean authorities' act in barring their  Pyongyang visit by blocking the South side's portion of  Panmunjom as a rude act against international courtesy and  morality, he said:    What must not be overlooked in their act is that they abused  the issue of their Pyongyang visit for the purpose of  North-South confrontation.    As was already reported, they unilaterally broke up the  working contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between  the North and the South and froze all the dialogue between the  two sides, driving the situation to the brink of war.    They raised a hue and cry over "the threat from the North"  to  stir up uneasiness among the people and, at the same time, made  public a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan  No. 5027," openly crying for "unification by prevailing over  communism." Their racket became noisier when the issue of  foreign envoys' visit to Pyongyang was raised.    Thus they created a grave situation under the eyes of  foreign  envoys and, on this pretext, demanded the cancellation of their  projected passage through Panmunjom and visit to Pyongyang.  This was really a disgusting, despicable act.    Clear is the reason why they blocked the foreign envoys'  visit to Pyongyang.    They were afraid that the quite different realities of the  North and the South should be known to the world public.    Had the mission visited Pyongyang, it would have clearly  seen  that, under Korean-style socialism centering on the popular  masses where the leader, the party and the masses are  singleheartedly united, all the people are leading an  independent and creative happy life with no worries about food,  clothing and housing, stepping up peaceful economic construction  not "preparations for a war", and are aspiring after a reunified  Korea, contrary to what the South Korean rulers advertise.    And multifarious social evils of South Korea, corrupt and  ailing under the present "civilian" rule, which stakes its fate  on outside forces, would have been brought into bolder relief in  contrast with the North.    If the mission had seen the DPRK which is animated with  peaceful construction, a scene quite different from South Korea  across the Military Demarcation Line where powder- reeking war  fever is being incited, it would have understood who really  wants peace and reunification and who really pursues war and  division.    This is what the South Korean authorities were afraid of.    Truth and lie are bound to be made clear. As the sun cannot  be covered by a palm, so the South Korean authorities can never  cover up the high external prestige of the ever- victorious DPRK  by checking the tour of the international mission to the North.    The South Korean authorities should no longer continue the  anti- national act of pursuing division and confrontation  against the desire of all the fellow countrymen and the  peaceloving people of the world and the rash action of impairing  the image of our nation known as the eastern country of good  manners.    We always keep the door open to foreign missions who come to  do work favorable for the peace and peaceful reunification of  the Korean peninsula with good intention toward us.</p>

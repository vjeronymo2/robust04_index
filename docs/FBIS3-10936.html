We are a handful of men and women who, by taking up arms,  found an answer to the oblivion into which the state plunged us,  to the daily hunger, and to the lack of public services to  reaffirm our condition as decent human beings. On other  occasions, we resorted to arms in self-defense of the criminal  behavior of police authorities who are killing the future of  Ciudad Bolivar: its youth.    We believe that now is a propitious moment to stop, pause  for  the sake of coexistence to find different ways to face despair  and anguish; we urge communities to join efforts and the  national and district governments to adopt a new attitude to  rescue this vast zone known as Ciudad Bolivar.    For us, peace negotiations at this location only make sense  insofar as they bring about social investments by the state to  settle the social and human debt that Colombia and Santa Fe de  Bogota owe to Ciudad Bolivar.</p>

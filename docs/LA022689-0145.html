			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX EQUITY  </P> <P> By striking down tax laws that treat citizens unequally, the U.S. and now the  California Supreme Court may be starting to polish off Proposition 13. The  state would benefit from that.  </P> <P> The latest case represents a temporary setback for beleaguered school districts  trying to raise money with taxes or fees imposed on developers. Voters in five  Santa Clarita Valley school districts who were seeking more construction  funding had imposed a tax that could have added as much as $6,300 to the cost  of each new home. The California Supreme Court last week let stand a state  appellate court ruling that struck down that tax. That could have wide effects  because many California cities, counties and other election districts have  imposed similar fees. They use the money to repair roads, build jails and  provide other services that lost funding after Proposition 13 slashed property  taxes in 1978.  </P> <P> But the decision could be a long-term victory if its inherent logic leads to  repeal or revision of Proposition 13. And there is nothing obscure about the  direction of the appellate court's thinking: The tax was considered illegal  because it was not imposed uniformly on residents and property owners but would  be borne only by developers and future residents. The burdens of Proposition 13  are distributed the same way.  </P> <P> For one thing, commercial property changes hands less frequently and so its  owners often pay taxes at lower rates than homeowners. Even among homeowners,  property taxes are not imposed uniformly. People who bought houses before  Proposition 13 was passed had their property-tax assessments frozen at 1975  levels; those assessments can only be raised by 2% a year while people who  purchased their homes since then pay taxes based on the purchase price.  </P> <P> The future of Proposition 13 was jeopardized earlier this year when the U.S.  Supreme Court struck down a West Virginia tax law. In that case, the court said  the Constitution requires "rough equality in tax treatment of similarly  situated properties." Clearly, Proposition 13 does not provide that rough  equality.  </P> <P> In his opinion in the Santa Clarita case, Appellate Justice H. Walter Croskey  wrote that because the special tax was not uniformly imposed on residents, it  doesn't meet the requirements of Proposition 13. The public has long known that  that ballot measure provided relief for many people from unbearably high  property taxes but also imposed sharp restrictions on how much money state  government could raise. Now, after it has snatched financial support from so  many government services essential to Californians, Proposition 13 may be  losing the legal support so essential to its future.  </P></p>

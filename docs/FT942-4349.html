			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Stallholders unite to fight a free market: Neil Buckley on ministers' moves to deregulate 'come hell or high water' Dave Stevens first started working on a flower stall in East Street market, off the Old Kent Road in south-east London, when his mother ran it 30 years ago. Now he wonders how much longer he can make a living from it. Hit by recession and by competition from supermarkets and shopping centres, many traditional street markets have seen their fortunes decline. Now, says Mr Stevens, they face another threat. 'Car-boot sales have become huge illegal markets,' he said. 'People are bringing vans and lorries, and they're selling a lot of dodgy stuff. The trouble is, if the government had their way, it would be like India, everyone trying to sell something on every street.' He is referring to the government's attempts through the deregulation and contracting-out bill - which received its second reading in the House of Lords on Monday - to abolish the centuries-old rights of many local authorities to control market trading. Traders and councils say this would lead to an explosion of new markets, many engaged in illegal trade. The government, faced last month with a rebellion by backbench MPs, was forced to remove clauses designed to abolish so-called market-franchise rights. But the issue has not gone away. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, told the Commons the government would consult further, and bring forward amended clauses on markets during the bill's passage through the Lords. The Department of the Environment confirmed this week that this was still its intention - in spite of appeals from opponents not to 'rush through' potentially incomplete and inadequate legislation. 'The government has got this policy to deregulate, but as far as markets are concerned it seems to be deregulate come hell or high water,' said Mr Brian Ormshaw, secretary of the National Association of British Market Authorities, a group of 135 local authorities. 'Nobody wants red tape and bureaucracy, but it is clear that some activities need to be controlled.' Charters and statutes giving councils the right to hold a market in their town, while restricting the operation of other markets, date to the 12th century. Some 250 councils have market-franchise rights, and together receive about Pounds 110m a year in gross rents. No other markets can be held without local authority permission within a 6 2/3 -mile radius of a charter market - considered in medieval times to be the maximum distance a trader with horse and cart could travel out and back in a day to conduct trade. The government says the rules are anachronistic and are misused by some councils to stifle business initiatives. Opponents agree the system is outdated, but argue abolition is not the way to deal with it. The association has formed an umbrella group, the Campaign for Quality Markets, to oppose the government's original plans. Eight other bodies are members, including the National Market Traders' Federation; the Association of British Chambers of Commerce; the Federation of Small Businesses; the Association of District Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. The campaign says abolishing market-franchise rights would lead to huge growth in car-boot sales, which some research suggests are already visited by 1m consumers a week, but which can create noise and nuisance, and act as outlets for stolen, counterfeit or defective goods. It adds that deregulation of market trading contradicts the policy of encouraging town-centre development, and could lead to rival markets setting up outside towns. The campaign believes there is not enough time to come up with workable clauses for the deregulation bill, and is calling for separate legislation at a later date. It proposes: The replacement of the 6 2/3 -mile rule with one giving local authorities jurisdiction over markets only within their own administrative areas. That would remove anomalies such as Liverpool City Council being able to control markets in neighbouring Knowsley. A system of local authority registration or licensing of all commercial markets, including car-boot sales. This would include a right of appeal for applicants who have been refused. Exemption from the need to register for markets held for charitable purposes, but with safeguards against abuse. At a recent meeting at the Department of the Environment, most participants except the Institute of Directors, which backs the government, broadly supported these proposals. The Association of Private Market Operators, representing private markets, also accepted the principles, but wanted measures included in the deregulation bill. The parties must now wait to hear the government's new proposals. Not all traders, however, are concerned. Further up East Street, a man selling toiletries said he had no objection to car-boot sales. 'Of course they take trade from us, but everyone has to earn a crust,' he said. 'Good luck to them.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gandhi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Joaquin Villalobos, one of the eight FMLN [Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front] leaders separated from their  post by the party's national council, said that he will not heed  the resolution and that he will continue to work as a leader  because he considers the measure applied by three of the five  organizations that make up the former guerrilla organization to  be illegal.    The People's Revitalizing Expression, ERP, secretary general  said that the FMLN's internal crisis does not end with the  removal of these leaders from the political commission. He even  mentioned the possibility of legally appealing against the FPL  [Farabundo Marti Peoples Liberation Forces], the Communist Party  of El Salvador, and the PRTC [Revolutionary Party of Central  American Workers].    [Begin Villalobos recording] I belong to the Front as much  as  any other person. Just as I said there, with all due respect to  our comrades, I am a guerrilla just like most of them or even  more so in the case of many of them. [end recording]    That is the position of the ERP's Joaquin Villalobos in the  face of the FMLN National Council decision to suspend him  together with seven deputies who are part of his organization as  well as members of the Armed Forces of National Resistance.  Villalobos said that both he and his comrades will continue  their work as party leaders and said that the problem has not  ended with the resolution adopted by the National Council.    [Begin Villalobos recording] They cannot apply that measure,  which only serves to broaden the framework for the debate.  There are going to be legal debates, legal measures will be  taken to counter this, there will be more national political  debates, and I believe that at the same time arguments within  each of the organizations will heighten. [end recording]    Joaquin Villalobos said the decision to dismiss them is  loaded with a dose of traditional past Leninist hegemony, which  to his mind are notions that history is casting aside. The ERP  leader said that in the long run the PRTC, the FPL, and the  Communist Party of El Salvador will have to change.    [Begin Villalobos recording] I believe we will be seeing  more  changes in the next few months, even the change of forces. I am  not talking about of the ERP or the RN [Armed Forces of National  Resistance], but the three other organizations; social  democratic forces will take up center-left positions and agree  with us in this debate. It is too early to try to interpret  things. The next thing we will know is that everything is over  with. I think this is what the more radical members want. [end  recording]    Villalobos admitted that this internal FMLN conflict has  taken its political toll, but gave assurances that it is only  temporary.</p>

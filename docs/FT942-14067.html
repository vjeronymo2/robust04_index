			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.5% as region's performance steadies With investors worried that weak US stock and bond prices will lead to a lower dollar and a higher yen, the Nikkei index surrendered 1.5 per cent, falling below 20,000 for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average lost 310.16 to 19,882.18 after a high of 20,222.64 and a low of 19,850.37, reflecting heavy Topix-linked arbitrage selling and the liquidation of large portfolios by corporations. Traders said that dealers were squaring their positions ahead of the 'Golden Week' holidays starting at the end of next week. Foreign investors' buy orders failed to offset the selling. Volume totalled 340m shares against 338m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 23.58 to 1,613.43 and the Nikkei 300 index lost 4.71 to 294.84. Declines led advances by 807 to 248 with 122 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.80 to 1,315.86. Some market participants were apprehensive about the next few weeks, fearing that there could have been a precedent last year when the Nikkei rose during the first quarter but lost ground later as hopes of an economic recovery faded in May. However, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said in a recent report that the differences were greater than the similarities. Fiscal and monetary policies were more stimulative, it said, and the improvement in economic indicators, which turned down last May in spite of the earlier rise, was more broadly-based and sustainable. Large capital steels were mainly lower on corporate selling. Although Kobe Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to Y288, Nippon Steel fell Y8 to Y349 and Kawasaki Steel by Y11 to Y366. Banks, heavily weighted in the Topix index, lost ground. Industrial Bank of Japan declined Y110 to Y3,170, Mitsubishi Bank Y60 to Y2,790 and Sumitomo Bank Y50 to Y2,170. Shipping stocks, previously picked up as laggards, fell on profit-taking. Mitsui OSK Lines retreated Y10 to Y379 and Navix Line by Y12 to Y360. Japan Airlines rose Y4 to Y713. The company announced an early retirement plan for employees in their 30s, an unprecedented move among blue chip companies. They expect younger workers will have larger opportunities in finding new jobs than middle aged workers. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 246.41 to 22,223.94 in volume of 16.8m shares. Roundup The region put in a steadier performance after Tuesday's falls. Bombay was closed for a Hindu festival. TAIWAN finished higher, but well off the day's highs after waves of late profit-taking in industrials, which have been in demand recently as investors focus on the outlook for profits. The weighted index closed 16.57 ahead at 5,692.32, after an intra-session high of 5,760.72. Turnover surged to TDollars 70.49bn, the highest since March 7, from Tuesday's TDollars 58.9bn. AUSTRALIA, still nervous after Tuesday's fall, lost further ground, dragged down by falls in futures, a sharp drop in gold prices and volatility in overseas markets. The All Ordinaries index fell 14.8 to 2,046.6, unnerved during the afternoon by a sell-off on the futures market. The gold index fell 50 or 2.2 per cent, to 2,197.7 after bullion in the US dropped by Dollars 5.05 an ounce overnight. SEOUL was lower for the third consecutive session in very thin trading as some investors switched attention to the public auction of the state-funded Korea Telecom. The composite stock index lost 5.01 to 880.84. MANILA was helped higher by better-than-expected corporate earning results in the first quarter, but profit-taking in the last 30 minutes of trade pared gains. The composite index rose 20.89 to 2,846.82 as volume climbed to 1.2bn shares from Tuesday's 838.2m. HONG KONG was weaker after a featureless day's trade as concern grew ahead of a meeting tomorrow of local banks on the outlook for local interest rates. The Hang Seng index slid 82.90 to 9,221.01, turnover falling to an indicated HKDollars 3.33bn from Tuesday's final HKDollars 4.59bn. KUALA LUMPUR moved higher as buyers returned in the afternoon after a quiet morning session, but interest was selective. The composite index closed up 3.62 at 1,039.66. JAKARTA fell back on local nervous selling following riots in the north-western city of Medan. The official index fell 7.08 to 458.68. SINGAPORE firmed late in the session amid brisk demand for property and technology stocks. The Straits Times Industrials index rose 8.66 to 2,229.66. BANGKOK had a volatile session as buying was undercut by profit-taking and the SET index finished 8.36 higher at 1,282.38 in moderate turnover of Bt7.6bn NEW ZEALAND steadied after Tuesday's 37 point fall, the NZSE 40 Capital index rising 2.65 to 2,107.35.</p>

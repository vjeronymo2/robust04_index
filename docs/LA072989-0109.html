			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO VOTES ON PORTER RANCH PLAN  </P> <P> I am most concerned with the proposed Porter Ranch project.  </P> <P> The traffic generated by this immense project would negatively impact not only  the northern San Fernando Valley but also our neighboring communities,  especially Simi.  </P> <P> It is unreasonable to predict that most employees of this "regional center"  would come from its immediate area. The homes in this area currently are priced  too high for any but those with a six-figure income. A great number of minimum  wage employees will be required to keep a center of this size operating. They  won't be able to afford to live in the new residences surrounding these  10-story office buildings, but will have to commute from somewhere else. How  could this possibly be considered a self-contained community?  </P> <P> City Councilman Hal Bernson has consistently opposed opening a private segment  of Winnetka Avenue to facilitate traffic flow because to do so would create  damage to the rural character of the Monteria Estates area. How can he be less  concerned about an area which is so much larger and will be environmentally  impacted in such a major way? The suburban character of the North Valley would  be exchanged forever for the gridlock common to the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> Thousands of signatures opposing the Porter Ranch Development project have been  collected. I do hope the City Council will listen to reasonable fears for the  quality of life of the residents of the North San Fernando and Simi valleys and  vote "no" before Bernson's dream of a "city center" becomes a gridlock  nightmare.  </P> <P> NANCY REED  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

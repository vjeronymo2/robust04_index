			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung's  Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation on Monday clarified the former  opposition Democratic Party [DP] chairman's remarks about North  Korea's possible possession of nuclear weapons, which have been  causing a stir in South Korean political circles.    In an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim Tae-chung,  who  is visiting the United States, reportedly said that North  Korea's possession of two or three nuclear bombs is nothing  compared with the Western world which has more than 20,000.    Kim's comment was interpreted in South Korea as meaning that  it would not pose much of a problem even if Pyongyang had two or  three nuclear bombs.    The remark created shock waves in Seoul since it came only  days after the minister of the National Unification Board (NUB),  Yi Hong- ku, said if Pyongyang developed or had "even one-half  of a nuclear bomb," it would be regarded by Seoul as nullifying  the inter-Korean denuclearization declaration.    "Below the statement in question is an underlying principle  that North Korea should not develop nuclear weapons under any  circumstances," said the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation.    Yi yong-chak, director of the foundation's Washington  office,  said Kim made the remark in response to a WASHINGTON TIMES  interviewer's question on whether the United States should not  redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea if the international  community could not stop North Korea from developing nuclear  arms.    Yi said Kim Tae-chung replied to the question by saying that  it would be meaningless to redeploy nuclear weapons in South  Korea.    Under circumstances where the United States has several tens  of hundreds of nuclear bombs, it would mean nothing even if  North Korea came to possess two or three atomic weapons, Kim  Tae-chung was quoted by Yi as telling THE WASHINGTON TIMES.    Kim said he opposed the redeployment of nuclear weapons in  South Korea, according to Yi.    Kim stated further that if North Korea managed to acquire  nuclear weapons, it could never establish diplomatic relations  with the United States and other Western countries. They would  be of no help to North Korea either, Kim added.    The strong reaction to Kim's statement in South Korea was  prompted by press reports that took his remarks out of context,  Yi said.    In its report, THE WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Kim as saying  that  even if Pyongyang has nuclear weapons, they would be useless if  "we don't attack North Korea."    Kim was also reported to have said the no. 1 priority for  North Korea is not developing nuclear weapons but improving  relations with the United States.    Washington should offer to establish diplomatic relations  with Pyongyang as well as security guarantees as part of a  package deal, Kim said.    If North Korea rejected such a proposal, then China would  join U.N. sanctions against its neighbor, Kim predicted.</p>

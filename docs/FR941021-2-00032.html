Specifically, FGT submits the revised tariff sheets as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third Revised Sheet No. 1 reflects FGT's correction of two page references and adds Sheet No. 8D to the Table of Contents. Sheet No. 8D was filed September 22, 1994, in compliance with FERC's Order issued August 31, 1994, in Docket No. RP94&hyph;332. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth Revised Sheet No. 43 and Third Revised Sheet No. 49 eliminate the designation of contacts authorized to perform day-to-day dispatching from the listing of information required when requesting ITS&hyph;1 and IPS transportation service. Due to the changing nature of this information, it is more expedient for FGT to obtain this data at the time nominations are furnished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second Revised Sheet No. 180 clarifies that FGT will retain variable costs, usage surcharges, and fuel charges prior to revenue sharing and crediting consistent with the sharing and crediting mechanism approved in Docket No. RS92&hyph;16. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second Revised Sheet No. 183 corrects an error in the determination of Participating Firm Shippers' total share of Interruptible Shared Proceeds. Original Sheet No. 183 made effective November 1, 1993, contained the correct determination of the shared proceeds. When FGT filed First Revised Sheet No. 183 to change certain other provisions of this section, language from an earlier draft of this sheet, which never became effective, was inadvertently included. In addition, the term ``Relinquishing Shipper'' has been changed to ``Participating Shipper'' to conform with the terms used in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First Revised Sheet Nos. 197A and 197C reflect an accounting change required by the FERC in Order No. 552. Two typographical errors also are corrected on Sheet No. 197C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second Revised Sheet Nos. 452, 459 and 462 and First Revised Sheet No. 463 delete references to and eliminate Exhibit C from FGT's FTS&hyph;1 form of service agreement while designating and modifying Exhibit B to set forth the Maximum Daily Transportation Quantities formerly reflected on Exhibit C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First Revised Sheet Nos. 454, 470, 485, 494A, 500 and 514 have been modified to clarify that the commencement of the primary term of a transportation service agreement between FGT and a Shipper may be different than the effective date of the service agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second Revised Sheet Nos. 499, 502, 504 and 507 and First Revised Sheet Nos. 500, 505 and 506 reflect certain modifications to FGT's ITS&hyph;1 form of service agreement solely for purposes of clarification. Second Revised Sheet Nos. 501 and 508 delete references to and eliminate Exhibit A from the ITS&hyph;1 form of service agreement. Third Revised Sheet No. 509 eliminates extraneous text from this page previously designated as ``Reserved for Future Use''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, First Revised Sheet No. 659 corrects two typographical errors reflected on FGT's Index of Requirements by End-Use Priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the filing and the interested state commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 24, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person wishing to become a party must file a Motion to Intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

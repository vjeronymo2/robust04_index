			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / GARY KLEIN;  </P> <P> KUDRAVE GOES SLIP-SLIDIN' TO 9TH IN ARC RACE  </P> <P> Race-car driver David Kudrave took an unexpected spin last weekend on a  grease-slickened course at the American Racing Series event in Portland.  </P> <P> Kudrave, driving a 430-horsepower Indy-style car sponsored by Arciero Wines,  spun out on the final turn of the 40-lap race Sunday and finished ninth. He  earned $1,500.  </P> <P> "Most of our preseason races were in cool weather," said Kudrave, who lives in  La Canada. "But the last two races have been under hot conditions and the track  gets a little bit greasier.  </P> <P> "I was trying to make up ground on the guy ahead of me and it cost me three  places."  </P> <P> Kudrave, 23, had qualified fifth at 105.1 m. p. h. over the 2 1/2-mile course.  His next race is in two weeks in New Jersey.  </P> <P> All-Star football: The first Burbank-Glendale-area All-Star Football Game will  be played Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Burroughs High in Burbank.  </P> <P> Seventy-two graduating seniors from 24 high schools in Glendale and the San  Fernando Valley will participate in the game.  </P> <P> Ken Gerard of Marshall heads the Glendale-area coaching staff that also  includes Dennis Hughes of Hoover and Charley Mack of Verdugo Hills.  </P> <P> "The kids have been very cooperative," said Gerard, who led his team to the  Northeast League championship last season. "We've had great attendance and good  attitude. They get along well and have been helping each other."  </P> <P> Sid Oxford of Marshall will start at quarterback, joining Tony Gibson of  Marshall and Rafik Thorossian of Glendale in the backfield.  </P> <P> Both teams will use a 52 defense and linebacker blitzes are against the rules.  If a team trails by eight points after scoring in the fourth quarter, it will  have the option to receive the ensuing kickoff.  </P> <P> "The kids are learning pretty fast," Wagner said.  </P> <P> More all-star football: Workouts began Tuesday for the Glendale-area high  school players that will participate in the Daily News All-Star Football Game  on July 14 at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> Mike Plaisance of Village Christian and Jeff Engilman of Sylmar are the coaches  for the 38-player East team.  </P> <P> Glendale-area players include Greg Thompson of La Canada, Fred Hughes of St.  Francis and Greg Lloyd of Village Christian.  </P> <P> Darren Haines of Crescenta Valley, Jeff Dyrek of St. Francis and Kevin Ebenhock  of Village Christian are alternates.  </P> <P> Honor roll: Eric Jacobson of Eagle Rock High has been named All-City Section in  tennis.  </P> <P> Jacobson, a senior, was selected to the first team. Jade Ellis of Eagle Rock  was named to the second team.  </P></p>

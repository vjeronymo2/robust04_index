			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Aer Lingus urged to seek link AER LINGUS, the Irish Republic's state-run national airline, was told yesterday that it should consider linking up with another airline and that manpower cuts must be made 'from the top-down' in any rationalisation plan implemented to stem mounting losses. Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, said yesterday that such links are 'the way the world aviation business has been moving for a number of years and that is the way Aer Lingus should be looking.' Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn, the Irish transport and communications minister, said: 'I am very concerned . . . in relation to job maintenance and job creation in the country. The airline is currently undertaking a review of its entire operations. This could result in a substantial pruning of its route network and more than 1,000 redundancies from its 6,500 workforce. Losses are running at IPounds 40m (Pounds 43.4m) a year. In what appeared to be an implicit criticism of the airline's management, Ms Geoghegan Quinn said: 'If sacrifices have to be made in the company, then those sacrifices have to start at the top down'. Yesterday, the directors of Aer Lingus said: 'Bearing fully in mind the concerns expressed by the minister, the company is determined to take the actions necessary to restore the air transport division to profitability'. On Wednesday Mr Ray Burke, a former industry minister and prominent backbencher in the ruling Fianna Fail party, called for a cash injection into the airline saying it would be 'national sabotage' if it were allowed to undertake a plan of compulsory redundancies. Ms Geoghegan Quinn was non-committal over Mr Burke's proposal.</p>

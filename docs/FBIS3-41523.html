			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Qiang (0002 1730)] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- The 19th  Conference of the International Union of Nature Conservation and  Natural Resources held its 101st meeting in Argentina's capital  Buenos Aires on 18 January. In his speech at the meeting,  Chinese delegate expressed China's resolute opposition to the  union council's decision to admit the so-called ``International  Tibet Lawyers Committee'' as a member of the union.    In his speech, Shen Maocheng, Chinese vice minister of  forestry and vice president of the China Wildlife Protection  Association, pointed out: The ``International Tibet Lawyers  Committee'' is not a nature conservation organization. The  committee's activities are stirring up Tibet independence and  splitting China; these activities have nothing to do with  Tibet's nature conservation and the protection of Tibet's  natural resources. Since the organization was formed in 1989,  it has never provided practical aid and support in any form to  Tibet's nature conservation.    Shen Maocheng stressed: Tibet has always been an inalienable  part of China's sacred territory. China resolutely opposes any  foreign forces' activities designed to split China.    The Chinese delegate's speech won support of the delegates  of  Pakistan and other countries. The meeting's chairman (Lanfar)  decided to set up a special committee to investigate the matter  and to make a decision on whether or not to admit the  ``International Tibet Lawyers Committee.''    The current international environmental protection meeting,  whose theme is to ``show concern for the earth and its  dwellers,'' opened in Buenos Aires on 17 January. More than  1,300 delegates from 118 countries are attending the 10-day  meeting.</p>

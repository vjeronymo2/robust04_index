			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: KLM Royal Dutch plunges 72% KLM ROYAL Dutch Airlines yesterday reported a 72 per cent decline in first-quarter net profit, due partly to a widening of losses at NorthWest Airlines, the US carrier in which it owns a substantial minority stake. Other factors behind the downturn were higher interest charges and the absence of book profits on the sale of aircraft. Net profit tumbled to Fl 38.4m (Dollars 23.3m) in the three months to June 30 from Fl 135.9m in the same period of 1991-1992. Operating profit improved by Fl 28.8m to Fl 182.3m, but this increase was almost entirely offset by a Fl 26.8m rise in interest payments. At the same time, KLM's share of losses posted by associate companies - mainly NorthWest - widened to Fl 60.9m from Fl 25.8m the year before. KLM also showed a book loss of Fl 0.8m on the sale of computer equipment in the latest quarter compared with a Fl 62.7m book profit in the previous year on the disposal of older DC-10 aircraft. Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, told the airline's shareholders' meeting yesterday that the industry faced a difficult year. The fierce price competition on fares between Europe and North America would be felt not only by KLM but also by NorthWest, as well as by competitors. KLM declined to predict full-year results, citing the onset of price wars over the North Atlantic and the uncertainty surrounding the results of the company's holdings in other airlines. The first-quarter results were below analysts' forecasts, and the company's shares closed down 4.5 per cent at Fl 27.70, though above the day's low of Fl 26. KLM noted that the 18.8 per cent rise in operating profit was achieved against the background of a lower dollar and the outbreak of fierce competition on important North Atlantic routes. The airline, which is in the midst of a cost-cutting programme, added that the productivity of its workforce improved by 14 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year. Total traffic at KLM and its Cityhopper subsidiary, including passengers, cargo and mail, rose by 12 per cent to 1.35bn tonne-kilometres. But traffic revenue (excluding newly-consolidated Air Littoral of France and Transavia, the Dutch charter airline) increased by only 9 per cent, reflecting fare-cutting and negative currency movements. Total turnover, including new consolidations, increased by by 17 per cent to Fl 2.2bn, outstripping a 16 per cent increase in total costs to Fl 2.0bn.</p>

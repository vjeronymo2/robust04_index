			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> FIRE GUTS SANTA ANA TIRE STORE  </P> <P> A persistent two-alarm blaze raced through a downtown Santa Ana tire store  early this morning, injuring five firefighters and causing traffic delays for  commuters trying to get to offices and businesses near the Civic Center Plaza.  </P> <P> The fire, reported at 4:07 a.m., gutted the B. F. Goodrich store at Bristol and  1st streets before 35 firefighters could put it out almost four hours later,  Santa Ana Fire Department Inspector Karl Ellman said.  </P> <P> The cause was under investigation by fire inspectors, who spent the morning  sifting through debris and hundreds of melted tires, Ellman said. No estimate  of damage was available.  </P> <P> The melting rubber sent a cloud of thick, acrid black smoke, which could be  seen for miles, into the morning sky.  </P> <P> Two firefighters suffered smoke inhalation, and three others were sent to a  local hospital when the front facade of the store fell onto them. One of the  three suffered burns, a neck injury and a broken ankle. The second complained  of pains in his leg, and the third pulled a back muscle, Ellman said.  </P></p>

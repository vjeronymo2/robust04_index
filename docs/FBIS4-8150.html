			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic People's Party, by Moricz; place and date not given:  "Calm Is in the Public Interest"]    [Text] Despite their public fighting, the parties have  been making statements in the spirit of a foreign political  consensus, even if some parties thought this consensus was  lacking, Laszlo Surjan told us.    [Moricz] After his visit in Budapest, the Russian prime  minister received the Hungarian journalist in Moscow and spoke  with great appreciation of his talks with the Hungarian  Government. How did you receive this evaluation at home?    [Surjan] On behalf of both the government and myself, I can  say that the visit of the Russian premier in Hungary was  extremely important indeed. We highly appreciate the firm  Russian readiness to settle the outstanding Russian debt to  Hungary. Hungarian participation in the Russian privatization  process opens up possibilities for both settling the debt issue  and vitally broadening our foreign trade that dropped  considerably after the collapse of the Soviet market.    [Moricz] What effect could the domestic political echoes of  this visit have on the ratification of the basic agreement?    [Surjan] This cannot affect the ratification of the basic  treaty. At the same time, caution and consideration are needed  in the course of election speeches, and I also include myself in  this requirement, because emotional elements can greatly affect  the public mood and the relations between individual parties.    [Moricz] In your opinion, how will Hungary fare in the  period until the May 8 elections?    [Surjan] It is a positive development that, according to  opinion polls, the percentage of people willing to participate  in the elections is increasing. I am convinced that a bad  decision will not emerge if a sufficient number of people go to  vote. In the current difficult economic situation, it is in the  public interest to enable the new government to lead the country  in calm and stable circumstances.</p>

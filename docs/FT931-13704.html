			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tories warn Lamont against tax increases SENIOR Conservative MPs warned Mr Norman Lamont last night not to risk aborting the fragile economic recovery with large tax increases in his March budget. But the officers of the Tory backbench finance committee, who met the chancellor as part of an intensive pre-Budget consultation exercise, signalled that they could accept some extension of value added tax. Their comments came amid intense speculation that Mr Lamont is ready to end VAT zero-rating on products and services ranging from newspapers to children's clothes and domestic fuel. Tory MPs reported that in a meeting earlier this week Mr Lamont had made clear that the government's election pledges did not rule out such a move. Some senior Conservatives also suspect that the chancellor will bring food into the VAT net at a reduced rate of 5 per cent. The Treasury traditionally has argued that it would be administratively too complex to operate a twin-rate VAT regime but it has failed to convince Tory MPs of its case. An emerging view among a majority of Conservative MPs that the chancellor should strictly limit the overall increase in the tax burden in March was being echoed yesterday by senior ministers. The sharp rise in unemployment last month confirmed the view of many that the Treasury's optimism about economic recovery is premature. Although some cabinet members believe that the prospects for the public borrowing requirement are sufficiently dire to necessitate an immediate increases in taxes, others are arguing forcefully Mr Lamont should delay until the second Budget in December. Mr John Major is understood to share the cautious approach. Yesterday's delegation of senior backbenchers suggested that Mr Lamont should focus also on cutting public spending later in the year before deciding whether to increase taxes. They warned the chancellor that significant rises in excise duties - traditionally one of the most convenient ways for the Treasury to raise revenue - would simply boost the growing cross-channel trade in spirits, wine, beer and tobacco.</p>

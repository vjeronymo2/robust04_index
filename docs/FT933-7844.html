			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Technology: In search of quality - A look at an automated product that aims to filter computer data for flaws The principle 'garbage in, garbage out' is a basic feature of computers. With the personal computer has come personal data, which has made things worse, not better. Research carried out at Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that data stored in a spreadsheet such as Excel is generally unuseable by anyone other than its author. This is a chilling discovery because many organisations rely on data held in personal spreadsheets for critical decisions. It hardly matters how fast information is delivered to the screen, if the data is untrustworthy. Everyone has stories about a stupid computer and the problems can usually be traced to human error - mis-keying - but more seriously, they result from systems design. For example, a parent who complained that British Waterways had tried to charge a 10-year-old the full price for his dinghy licence was told, 'the computer can't tell he's a juvenile'. If that is so, then not only is the data incomplete, but the system design is at fault. The word 'quality' appears in almost every annual report as an objective, or point of pride. Quality can be built into a car, by a process of training, evaluation and checking. Applying the rule of quality to data is more difficult, and many systems have foundered on this. This was the conclusion of Robert P Goldberg, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management. Research at MIT proved the unreliability of data, not only personal, as in spreadsheets, but departmental. Goldberg, the co-developer of the Best/1 package which is used worldwide to measure and plan computer capacity performance, and his researchers have produced a piece of software to help measure 'data quality'. This is a different job from validation of data, which is often done by screen checks that set parameters for the entry of certain values. Sometimes checks can be overwritten, but data can be corrupted by valid, but totally meaningless entries. Often, this happens when the person entering the data has no ultimate interest or responsibility - known as ownership - of the results. A common cause of flaws is the 'code that works'. For instance, a data entry screen on a customer might ask for various items, including the SIC, or Standard Industry Code. The finance clerk entering the data is in a hurry to enter current values and find out about this month's late payers. The SIC code is irrelevant to the immediate task, but has to be entered, so the quick solution is to find any valid code that works - oil industry will do nicely - and keep entering it as a way of getting past the SIC field. The result is that some time later, the marketing department gets very excited about making such promising strides in the oil industry, and mounts a direct mail campaign, on totally inaccurate information. Another common problem is a value field set up for one purpose, but used for another unrelated function, by some system of values or codes that means something to one department but not to anyone else. Goldberg and his MIT research team have plenty of horror stories, such as the airline that flew aircraft half-empty due to 'phantom bookings' made by test data. The QDB Analyze software the team developed is aimed at improving data quality by applying some of the mechanical and engineering processes used in total quality management. 'Quality' depends upon a subjective evaluation in which accuracy, integrity, consistency, completeness and timeliness are all elements. 'An increasing amount of information is becoming a fundamental part of decision making,' says Ken Ledeen, chief executive officer of QDB Solutions, the company set up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to market QDB Analyze worldwide. 'It is dramatically increasing the visibility of inaccuracy. There are no clean sheets any more. You might be sitting down with new software tools but old data derived from existing databases.' What matters, says Ledeen, is the process behind the data. 'There is no absolute definition of correct or accurate. The priorities have to be set according to the payoff, and that means determining what the system does and what the user needs from it.' He cites JP Morgan, the banking and investment institution in New York, whose expertise in risk management was undermined by poor quality data. The data on its credit-risk management database was only 60 per cent complete, and any user had to double-check. Using QDB Analyze, JP Morgan discovered the problem was one of accuracy taking precedence over timeliness. Timeliness is more important in risk management, because the users need to know immediately a transaction had taken place: they are less bothered whether it is worth Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.60m) or Dollars 7.5m. Jonathan Kutchins, president of the Exeter Group, a consulting and software company in Cambridge, Mass is an enthusiastic user of QDB for his clients. 'QDB Analyze acts almost like a cleanser. It gives you statistics about your data over a period of time, but as well as overall metrics, it can, on request, provide actual instances of bad data,' says Kutchins. 'It's one thing to correct data, but another to correct the process that resulted in the flaw in the first place.' According to Kutchins, the PC-based product is easy to use, and capable of downloading large datasets - not just samples - from many different mainframe database products. QDB Analyze is one of a very few automated products available for data filtering. People, not computers, used to do the job of 'filtering data', a point particularly relevant in the recession-hit UK, according to Rick Marengo. He is the managing director of Softool Rack, the Wokingham-based software tools specialist recently appointed as the UK agent for QDB Solutions. 'The middle managers simply are not there any more to filter out the rubbish' he says. 'The accuracy of the data becomes paramount.'</p>

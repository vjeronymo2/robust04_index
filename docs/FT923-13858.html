			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon's Pounds 6.3m loss triggers plunge in share price HARLAND Simon, the control systems specialist which saw its shares plunge from 585p to 79p following a profits warning in February, yesterday watched as they dived again, losing 28p to close at 40p. The company announced a number of exceptional items which resulted in pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m for the year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds 9.88m. The accounts were also qualified by accountants Price Waterhouse. The company said it was a 'technical qualification' about ownership of shares in a loss-making information network company, PIL. Mr David Mahony, who returned as chairman in February following the resignation of Mr Roy Ashman, said the issue would soon be resolved and Harland Simon would own 67 per cent of PIL. Mr Ashman has refused to sell a 27 per cent stake he retained in PIL. Exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.1m were taken to cover all money owed by PIL to Harland Simon. A Pounds 500,000 investment by Harland Simon's pension fund in PIL will also be reimbursed and has been included in the provision. Other exceptional costs totalled Pounds 3.57m and included a Pounds 300,000 pay-off to Mr Ashman, and bad debt provisions of Pounds 1.6m which included disputed payments due from two companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. A sell-off of non-core businesses is under way, and shareholders' approval is being sought for the Pounds 8.1m disposal of Vickerys, a blade and screen maker. Harland also said it was in discussions to sell Contraves, which was acquired last year, and the loss-making Pro-Aqua and NEF. Following these sales, Mr Mahony said, net borrowings would fall from Pounds 11.8m to 'very low levels'. There was a loss per share of 36.5p (earnings 38.6p). In the February profits warning, the company promised to maintain its final dividend. However, the exceptional provisions almost used up distributable reserves, and there is no final dividend. Sales were Pounds 81.8m (Pounds 75.7m) due to inclusion of Contraves. But administration expenses rose to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 7.96m). COMMENT Now that Harland's market capitalisation has fallen from over Pounds 100m to just Pounds 7m, the easy conclusion is that it is either a screaming buy or a basket case. The difficult bit is which. Assuming the confusion about PIL is cleared up in the accounts, which the company is promising, and the various disposals go through, its longer-term viability looks secure as a much diminished company, possibly facing break-up. But despite protestations to the contrary, sales this year must be hit by Harland's very public problems. Analysts, who were not impressed by their meeting with the company yesterday, are guessing on profits of between nothing and Pounds 2m. The optimistic figure gives a multiple of 5, although any dividend must depend on disposals. With so much up in the air, only rich speculators need pay attention at this stage.</p>

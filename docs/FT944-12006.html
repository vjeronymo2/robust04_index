			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Prudential seeks custodian for Pounds 40bn of assets Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance company, has asked 10 leading international banks to bid for its global custody business, which holds Pounds 40bn in UK and international securities. This follows the Pru's decision to act no longer as its own custodian for securities. Mr David Hanson, a director at Prudential Portfolio Managers, said that the company was concerned that it would have to make significant investments in technology to maintain standards in its custody service. The move is a part of a growing trend among international fund managers to focus activities on their core businesses and contract out administrative services. It would be the largest individual global custody contract to be awarded since the State of California sought tenders three years ago for its assets of Dollars 80bn (Pounds 51bn). Mr Hanson declined to name the banks which had been asked to present proposals. However, it is believed the list includes Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Midland Bank. The banks, which have received the offer, have five weeks to prepare submissions. Custody is the broad term applied to the safe-keeping and record-keeping of funds. It generally includes the provision of cash management, foreign exchange facilities and securities lending. For leading international banks, the provision of custody - part of transactions banking - is a significant contributor to profits. Banks have invested heavily in technology to improve the services they provide to fund management clients and the Pru would have to make similar investments, Mr Hanson said. 'You would have to justify that spend, and that makes you pause. I'm not sure that custody is our business.' he said. However, he said the in-house custody service was meeting present needs. Prudential has been its own custodian for its UK domestic securities portfolio and has used three other banks for the custody of its UK gilts and non-domestic securities, which are invested from London. It also manages Pounds 35bn in assets which are held with custodians in other regions. Prudential is not seeking new custodians for these funds. Mr Hanson said changes in the way the Pru managed funds were partly responsible for the decision. In the past 10 years the Pru has begun to manage money from centres in North America, Australasia and east Asia, increasing its need for a global custodian. He added that the Pru had begun to retain custodians in each region. Regulatory changes, including the introduction of a new accounting standard for custodians, the advent of the Crest paperless share settlement system in London and the possibility of new UK regulations had made it consider its position.</p>

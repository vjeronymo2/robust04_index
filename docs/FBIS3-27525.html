"A negotiating strategy is the most effective approach to  mobilizing U.S. and allied strengths in dealing with Pyongyang,"  the United States institute of peace said in a report released  today.    The institute, comprised of former senior U.S. officials,  suggested that at the current time diplomacy represented the  best option for handling the DPRK nuclear issue.    The DPRK has accepted the inspection activities requested by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its seven  nuclear facilities.    The DPRK said early inspections by the IAEA depends on  whether the United States carries its commitment made earlier,  that is, the U.S. should cancel its annual military exercise  with South Korea and issue a joint decision with the DPRK on the  timing of the third round of meetings.    Members of the institute said they believe the DPRK's  success  in assembling a nuclear weapon had been overblown.    The think thank advised the Clinton administration to name a  senior coordinator to act as the focal point for all dealings  related to negotiations with the DPRK.</p>

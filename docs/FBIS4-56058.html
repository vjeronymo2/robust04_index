			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces on Wednesday  [25 March] continued attacking Serb settlements and army  positions in the northern part of the former Yugoslav republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was also confirmed by the United  Nations Protection Force. The most intensive Moslem fire, from  all available infantry and artillery weapons, was reported on  the Teslic front, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. Serb Army  units were forced to return fire in order to protect lives and  positions.    Moslem forces fired 11 shells on Teslic itself but the  attack  fortunately caused only damage to local facilities without any  casualties. On the southern part of the Teslic battlefront, a  large Moslem terrorist group was sent to penetrate deep into the  Serb territory and carry out silent liquidation of Serb  civilians and other terrorist actions, Bosnian Serb Army sources  said, adding that the group had suffered a heavy defeat after  walking into a mine field.    The group left behind much of their equipment while trying  to  escape and take the wounded with them. On the Ozren battlefront  south of Doboj, Moslem forces opened infantry and sniper fire on  Serb settlements and, after massing troops in the vicinity of  Serb defence lines on the south-western part of the front, made  frequent and violent reconnaissance missions, said Serb Army  sources.    Bosnian Serb Army units were forced to return fire and  prevent this kind of activity, they said. On the southern part  of the Vozuca battlefront, Moslem forces opened strong artillery  fire on Serb positions after bringing in fresh troops. The Serb  Army returned fire, it was announced.    Moslem assaults were also reported on the Trebava front.    Moslem and Croat forces in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina are  preparing an offensive whose aim is to cut the land corridor  linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb  Republic.</p>

Zych recalled that the president's representative Lech  Falandysz, was not a member of the committee but only took part  in its proceedings. Zych thought that Walesa's descision would  cause some damage.    The chairman of the Constitutional Committee and leader of  the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski said  that Walesa's decision was "a prelude" to the presidential  elections which have to be held within the next two years.    He stressed that the committee was working in accordance  with  the law concerning the preparatory work for the constitution,  passed in 1991.    Kwasniewski thought that there would eventually be a  referendum on the constitution and that Walesa would oppose  parliament's proposals.    Kwasniewski reacted to Walesa's comment that "the  postcommunists are feeling strong". He said that he did not  know what "strength" the president was referring to.    He thought Walesa was clearly trying to gain the support of  the right wing. He added that there had been no "plan" to  reject Walesa's proposals on the constitution. In the voting  even Walesa's "favourites" in the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) had  voted against Walesa's proposals, explained Kwasniewski.    The chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee,  Bronislaw  Geremek, said on "Radio 3" on Tuesday that in politics one  should not feel insulted.    Geremek also thought that Walesa was manoeuvring before the  presidential elections. He said that his party the Democratic  Union (UD) had voted to accept that Walesa's proposals would be  worked on simply because it had wanted to show resepect towards  the president of the Republic of Poland.    He did not think that Walesa's proposals were good because  the president wanted parliament to be dissolved if it rejected  the constitution.</p>

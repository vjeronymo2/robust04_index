			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Observer: Office etiquette Nice to know Lord O'Hagan, Conservative MEP for Devon, has the interests of his constituents at heart. 'Many people believe that tossing the caber is about to become illegal under European Community law on health and safety. Is this true?' he enquires in an exchange recorded in the recent Official Journal of the European Communities. EC social affairs commissioner Vasso Papandreou is glad she was asked that question. After first acknowledging her gratitude to the honourable member for his 'regular tabling of questions that allow (the Commission) to keep in touch with the beliefs and fears of ordinary people over the EC's intentions', she goes on to explain that while there are no plans to make that well-known Devonian custom illegal, two council directives coming into force next January will have to be taken into account, by employers and workers alike, as regards caber-tossing in the workplace.</p>

Only integration within the framework  of the Commonwealth can assuage the controversy around the  problems of the Russian-speaking population in the "near  abroad", the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's department  for CIS affairs Leonid Drachevskiy stated in Moscow on Friday.  He spoke at a seminar on the problems of the Russian-speaking  population in "the near abroad" organized by the Russian Foreign  Ministry.    In the diplomat's opinion, "it is necessary to accelerate  the  implementation of the treaty on economic union."  "Unfortunately, many of the agreements attached to that treaty  are not working. The problem is that they were concluded  sporadically. As a result, their implementation was not carried  out in stages as required", he noted.    Drachevskiy also spoke in favor of "intensifying" work on  the  creation of a collective security system. "Obviously, the  borders within the Commonwealth should be transparent. Only  outer frontiers of the CIS should be thoroughly guarded. So far  we have signed such agreements only with Central Asian  republics," he said.    Drachevskiy particularly noted that negotiations with the  CIS  countries on dual citizenship "regularly get into impasse."  "Many experts justifiably believe that in our conditions dual  citizenship generates more questions, than answers. Obviously,  it would be reasonable to consider some intermediate option  envisaging "special regime of citizenship" within the CIS. This  means that a citizen of one state would not be considered as a  foreigner on the territory of other state, but would have all  rights with small "exception", for example, the right to vote",  the diplomat pointed out.    He expressed confidence that these steps would "have a  positive influence on the plight of Russians living in the near  abroad."    The strategic task of Russia is "to keep all Euroasian  territory of the former Soviet Union if not under control, then  under strong influence." This opinion was expressed by a  representative of the association for ties with foreign  compatriots "Russkiye Zoriy" Gennadiy Mozhayev who spoke at the  seminar.    In his view, the 21st century will be come "a century of  fighting for energy sources." "That is why the preservation of  its influence on the territory of the former Soviet Union is a  vitally important task for Russia. From this point of view it's  an advantage for us to have a big number of Russians in the near  abroad", he said.    Mozhayev also spoke in favor of setting up an All-Russian  state foundation on support of Russians living in the CIS  countries.    Russia's senior adviser at the United Nations in New York  Aleksandr Denisov, a spokesman for the Congress of Russian  Communities has said that "not only CIS but the Baltic states  are a zone of special political, military and strategic  interests for Russia."    There can be no talk "about any migration of ethnic Russians  from CIS countries. The Russians must stay wherever they are  historically strong and should be only economically supported",  Denisov said.    In his opinion, the emerging Russian business is "a rather  effective means for Russia to gain a foothold in CIS states."  As an example, Denisov cited the fact that about 80% of  entrepreneurs in Lithuania are Russians. "In other countries,  the situation is similar. This potential need to be tapped", he  stressed.    Whatever happens, Russia must not allow "politicizing of its  communities in the CIS." Such an opinion has been voiced by  Russia's ex Foreign Minister Shelov-Kovedyayev, a co-chairman of  "The Russian Club", an international non-governmental  organization.    "To employ these people for gaining influence as a "fifth  column" is not only corrupt and inhumane but dangerous for them,  as we know from world history", he stressed.    According to Shelov-Kovedyayev, one of the main problems,  facing the Russians in the CIS is the economic one. So, they  should be supported in every way to forestall their massive  migration. That would be much cheaper than to accommodate  millions of resettlers in Russia.</p>

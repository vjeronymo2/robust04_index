			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> GORDON, LIEBERTHAL TO SQUARE OFF IN BID TO SETTLE POWER STRUGGLE  </P> <P> Joe Gordon of Simi Valley High and Westlake's Mike Lieberthal will go head to  head today in their quests for the Southern Section single-season home run  record when Westlake visits Simi Valley in a Marmonte League game.  </P> <P> Gordon hit his 14th homer Wednesday, leaving him two shy of the record set by  Arnold Garcia of Channel Islands in 1981. Lieberthal has been stuck at 13 since  April 20.  </P> <P> Garcia was a left-handed pull hitter whose home runs over the right-field fence  at Channel Islands would be met by a chorus of moos.  </P> <P> "There was an animal-husbandry class on the other side of the fence," recalled  Don Cardinal, the Channel Islands coach. "We'd say he was taking them deep into  the cows."  </P> <P> Because Channel Islands is also in the Marmonte League, Cardinal has watched  firsthand the assault on Garcia's record.  </P> <P> "Arnold was a lot like Gordon and Lieberthal," he said. "Not a big kid, but he  just had that stroke, and he worked real hard at his hitting."  </P> <P> Although Gordon has hit more home runs recently, Lieberthal figures to have  more games ahead of him.  </P> <P> Simi Valley (11-11, 4-6 in league play) finishes its league schedule Wednesday  and is a long shot to make the playoffs. Westlake (23-1, 11-0) closes out  league play today but is certain to be the top-seeded team in the 5-A Division  playoffs.  </P> <P> Pitching rich: Few expected Saugus High to have strong pitching this season.  </P> <P> Gone was Roger Salkeld, picked third in last June's amateur draft by the  Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> Left behind were sophomores Chris Hernandez and David Weeg, and junior Doug  Maggiora, who logged all of six innings last season.  </P> <P> But a combined effort has carried the Centurions far. With a respectable team  earned-run average of 3.49, Saugus (15-5-1 overall) is atop the Golden League  standings with a 10-1 record and holds a three-game lead over second-place  Palmdale.  </P> <P> The side-arming Maggiora, who routinely has entered games in the middle  innings, has been most impressive. He has compiled an 8-1 record with four  saves and a 2.59 ERA in 67 1/3 innings -- most in the Valley area.  </P> <P> Hernandez (5-2, 4.20), a left-hander, and Weeg (2-0, 3.29), a right-hander,  have held their own at the varsity level and show a lot of promise.  </P> <P> In the spotlight: New names have cropped up in the box scores of Poly's games.  A look at the batteries in recent Parrot outings reveals names such as Torres  and Rocha notching wins and saves for Poly (20-3, 15-0) -- names unseen two  weeks ago.  </P> <P> But the fresh faces are producing. Raul Torres and Adolpho Rocha, both juniors,  have been thrust into the limelight since mainstays David Giatti (broken ankle)  and Rodrigo Dorame (tender arm) became unable to pitch.  </P> <P> Torres, especially, has been effective, notching a 4-1 record in six  appearances. He is now Coach Jerry Cord's No. 2 starter behind senior Eddie  Castellanos (11-0).  </P> <P> "They're still just getting their feet wet, really," Cord said of the tandem.  "I didn't figure they'd throw much, except in relief. But they're just tough  kids. They want to compete."  </P> <P> If it isn't broken: Birmingham has won 12 consecutive games. Birmingham is a  baseball team. Ergo, Birmingham is superstitious.  </P> <P> Following the grand baseball tradition of quirky, off-beat behavior that  characterizes a team on a win streak, the Braves have decided to shun their  white, home jerseys in favor of the blue road jerseys they wore during the  Holt-Goodman tournament that launched the win streak. Even at home, the Braves  wear road blue.  </P> <P> "It came time for us to wear our home jerseys again," Coach Wayne Sink said,  "and the guys said to me, 'White jerseys? What white jerseys?' "  </P> <P> Staff writers Steve Henson, Vince Kowalick and Brian Murphy contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

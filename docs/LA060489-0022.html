			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARATTA AND THE LETTER CAMPAIGN FOR 'BEAUTY'  </P> <P> Being one of those folks behind the write-in campaign to save television series  "Beauty and the Beast," I have to say that Maratta's May 28 cartoon is  offensive.  </P> <P> I am not offended by the implication that I am "beastly" or disfigured. What  bothers me and saddens me is the apparent lack of understanding of why I and  others have written to CBS.  </P> <P> "Beauty and the Beast" is a touching, beautifully mounted, very literate  series. I have no desire to see yet another lame-brained detective show or pair  of sitcoms about "a bunch o' zany but lovable folks" in its time slot.  </P> <P> JON R. McKENZIE  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P> <P> "Beauty and the Beast" has received a new order for 12 episodes from CBS, for  midseason, the producers of the offbeat fantasy series say. In a May 25 Morning  Report item on the new order, a production company executive refers to the  "very loyal and significant audience" of the series.  </P> <P> DR, Silent Pictures / Maratta  </P></p>

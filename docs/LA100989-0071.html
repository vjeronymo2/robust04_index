			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: DO LESS AND LIVE BETTER  </P> <P> Egads! It's possible to get as much work done in an eight-hour day as in one  that stretches to 10 or 12? Egads! Advertising images glorify self-destructive  overwork? Egads! Productivity can be enhanced if employees actually take all  their vacation time?  </P> <P> These revolutionary notions are the pith of EGADS: Exposing the Glorification  of our Anxiety Driven Society, a newsletter launched this month by  Overachievers Anonymous.  </P> <P> The 10,000-member group, founded by San Francisco public relations executive  Carol Orsborn, is dedicated to the belief that people should work to live, not  live to work. The first issue of the newsletter rails against advertising that  portrays successful executives as anxious, overworked and competitive, warning  that such images heighten business people's insecurity and drive them to  endanger their health and ignore their families.  </P> <P> Overachievers Anonymous makes no such demands, according to Orsborn. It  guarantees no meetings, no classes and no fund-raisers. "In fact," she says,  "we don't do anything."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Making Dealies for Wheelies  </P> <P> The folks that brought you "Wheel of Fortune," the wildly successful game show  that made household names out of Vanna and Pat (as in White and Sajak), are  hoping to hit it big with some new characters: the Wheelies.  </P> <P> Currently featured in commercials for "Wheel of Fortune," Wheelies are  "adorable, mischievous characters" who live on the "Wheel of Fortune" set and  play the game all night after the prime time regulars have gone home, said  Jerry Kapner, vice president of merchandising for King World Productions, which  distributes "Wheel of Fortune." King World, which already has successful  licensing programs for its "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" shows, is  negotiating with several companies to license the multicolored puppets for  merchandising, he said.  </P> <P> Two of the Wheelies bear a vague resemblance to Sajak and White -- that is, if  the host and well-dressed letter-turner had fangs, bowed legs and an appendage  that looks like the collar on Dracula's cape.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Is It for You or Your Dog?  </P> <P> Smelling like your dog may not be the goal of many pet owners but  Nebraska-based conglomerate ConAgra thinks that there's a market for matching  fragrances.  </P> <P> Snoopy Private Collection Cologne, a line of scents that ConAgra hopes to have  out for the start of the Christmas buying season, comes in five fragrances --  Pedigree, Puppy Love, A Breed Apart, Delightful and Fetching -- that ConAgra  says are compatible with human-targeted products Obsession, Giorgio, Chanel,  Opium and Aramis.  </P> <P> In addition to the Snoopy scents, expected to retail for $3.99, the company is  expanding its line of Snoopy toys.  </P> <P> "The new Snoopy toys and the pet perfumes will give our company added  merchandising strength on the retail front," according to a release from  ConAgra Pet Products Co. "We expect to set new sales highs as this program  picks up momentum."  </P> <P> The time must be ripe for the perfumed pooch.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OF, BY AND FOR THE CHILDREN;  </P> <P> WE COULD ALL LEARN A FEW THINGS FROM SWEET POLLY AND CRAFTY MADELINE  </P> <P> One is a cartoon. One is flesh and blood. But both Polly and Madeline -- the  stars of two specials for children this week -- are lively young girls.  </P> <P> You might remember Polly, played by "The Cosby Show's" Keshia Knight Pulliam,  from last year's "Polly," a Disney musical special loosely based on Eleanor H.  Porter's children's classic "Pollyanna." Pulliam played a girl who comes to  live with her rich aunt (played by Phylicia Rashad, also of "Cosby") after her  parents are killed in a car accident. The new Polly Comin' Home! continues  where the story left off, with the 12-year-old heroine and her friends working  to ease racial tension in her small town. In the process, Polly even helps her  aunt rekindle a romance! The TV movie also stars Dorian Harewood and Barbara  Montgomery of "Married People."  </P> <P> "Polly Comin' Home!" Sunday at 7 p.m., NBC. For families.  </P> <P> Madeline's Christmas is a new animated special based on the classic children's  books by Ludwig Bemelmans. Here, the precocious Madeline, who lives at a  boarding school in Paris, is the only girl in the school who isn't in bed with  a cold. She finds herself faced with the awesome responsibility of spreading  holiday cheer, but winds up getting help from a special visitor. Christopher  Plummer narrates the charming tale.  </P> <P> "Madeline's Christmas" Thursday at 6 p.m., the Family Channel. For  2-to11-year-olds.  </P> <P> MORE KIDS' SHOWS  </P> <P> For Kids' Sake: Kids Under the Influence (Sunday at noon on KCAL looks at the  problem of teen-age alcohol abuse. For parents.  </P> <P> Kids-TV's newest installment is "Life Without a Home" (Sunday at 7:30 a.m.,  Friday at 6 a.m. and 5:25 p.m. on Showtime), which teaches young children about  homelessness and shows what some kids are doing to help the problem.

Our bet: In a fight between a dog and a  penguin, we'd put our money on the dog any day. For 2-to11-year-olds.  </P> <P> It's the day after Thanksgiving and there's nothing to do except eat, you say?  Try tuning in to an afternoon's worth of outer space-themed episodes of some  old favorite kids shows (Friday on Nickelodeon). Count Duckula, Dennis the  Menace and Yogi Bear are just a few of the characters who travel to distant  galaxies and encounter alien beings, which should keep you entertained until  dinner.

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Bangkok to slash tariffs on 4,000 imports Thailand is from January 1 to slash tariffs on nearly 4,000 kinds of imports, with the emphasis on raw materials and semi-manufactured goods for industry. The move will bring import duties down from 100 per cent to a maximum 30 per cent by 1997. It confirms the government's determination gradually to remove tax protection that can shelter inefficient domestic manufacturers which could hinder Thailand's attempt to produce higher value-added products. The new tax rates will reduce the average tariff on nearly all imports, excluding agricultural produce, from 39.24 per cent to 17.61 per cent when fully implemented. Many of the cuts, to affect more than half of all taxable imports, are scheduled to come into full effect next week; the deepest cuts in certain sensitive categories will have to wait until in 1997. Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister, said: 'Our economy has made significant advances in terms of efficiency and competitiveness, so we need this tax reform to benefit the people and to create an effective linkage between the Thai economy and the global economy.' Analysts welcomed the move. HG Asia's Mr Neil Semple said: 'This is very good news; it lowers the overall cost structure of the economy at a time when there are worries about rising wages and inflation'. Mr Scott Christensen, Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities' Bangkok economist, declared: 'It's terrific. Some firms will suffer, but the overall effect will prove very helpful.' Mr Tarrin said the measures will cost the government Bt11.43bn (Pounds 291m) in 1995 and Bt6.24bn in 1997. The tariff system will also be trimmed from 36 different taxes to just six, which will reduce uncertainty among importers about what charges the customs service will impose. The six rates will range from no tariff on medical equipment, 1 per cent on raw materials and electronic parts such as coal, 5 per cent for machinery and computers, 10 per cent for intermediate goods, 20 per cent for finished products, to 30 per cent on goods such as silk and leather products. These last two are considered to need fairly high protection. The heavily protected petroleum industry enjoys tariffs ranging from 30 per cent on naphtha to 60 per cent on plastic pellets. These fall to 1 per cent for naphtha in 1995 and to 30 per cent on plastic pellets by 1997. Artificial and knitted fabrics will have duties cut from 60 to 40 per cent in 1995 and to 20 per cent in 1997. Finance ministry officials said the tariff cuts were generally deeper than were required by the Gatt agreement and will continue the liberalisation of the economy which had been begun in the late 1980s. The government can afford to lower tariffs partly as a result of value added tax. A decade ago, tariff income typically supplied 60 per cent of government income; at the end of the 1993 financial year this had been reduced to 18 per cent. Thailand has a rebate system for manufacturers to claim back import duties but this relief is lost if the imported item is sold on before leaving the country, and, anyway, is difficult to administer.</p>

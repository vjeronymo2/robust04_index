			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Previti Urges Attention for Defence </F> Issues"]    [Text] (ANSA) Civitavecchia, north of Rome, June 16 --  Italy's major role in the Atlantic Alliance, European defence  cooperation, and Mediterranean stability, not to mention  international peace-keeping missions, should be matched by  closer attention for defence issues in the government and  parliament, Italian Defence Minister Cesare Previti said here  today.    Closing the academic year at the War School in this coastal  town north of Rome, he said planned armed forces reform should  be followed quickly by the financial decisions needed to put  them into effect. Two draft bills are currently pending before  parliament to reform the armed forces' legislative framework and  organisation, above all, by creating more streamlined command  structures and admitting greater reliance on volunteers.    "More quality and less quantity makes sense if you make new  investments as well as making cuts," said Previti, "but if you  just cut, the result is simple reductions which, in the long  term, are harmful."    In his first meeting with the army's top echelons, Previti,  whose expertise in the defence field derives in part from a  stint as a top executive at Alenia, the public-sector aerospace  and defence contractor, urged the government to make adequate  investments to give "new impetus to the indispensable process of  renewal and modernisation" in the armed forces. "Without this,"  he pointed out, "it makes no practical sense to talk about a new  defence model and role for Italy on the international scene so  that it can make its due contribution to peace and security."    He also told his audience that increasingly frequent  international security commitments had been a great drain on  defence funds as well as accelerating the wear and tear on  equipment.    Previti also said he would be working for a mix of national  servicemen and volunteers, even if the armed forces are reduced  in size as planned. He added that the draft could only be  shortened substantially if sufficient national servicemen serve  the draft and investments for the armed forces' qualitative  growth materialise.</p>

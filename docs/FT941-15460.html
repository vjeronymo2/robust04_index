			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: A tale of debt and survival on the high seas - How the Atlantic fishery crisis affected two Canadian groups This is a tale of two companies which, six years ago, were difficult to tell apart. However, an unexpected crisis has driven them in almost diametrically opposite directions, to the point where they now have little in common. One is brimming with confidence, the other is at the mercy of shareholders and creditors. Based in the neighbouring Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, National Sea Products (Natsea) and Fishery Products International (FPI) were rooted in the rich fishing grounds off Canada's east coast. Each was the product of a sweeping rationalisation of the fragmented east coast fishery in the early 1980s. Their operations were of a similar size, with each big enough to rank towards the top of the international fishing industry. Both were vertically integrated, with operations stretching from impressive trawler fleets to fish-processing plants along the eastern seaboard of the US and Canada. There was, however, one big difference between the two companies: debt. Natsea had its origins in a succession of private-sector takeovers and mergers. The cornerstone of its 1984 restructuring was a large issue of preferred shares to creditors. Even when its fishing business was booming in the mid-80s, its debt was well over 100 per cent of common equity. FPI had the benefit of being taken under the wing of the Canadian and Newfoundland governments in the early 1980s. A privatisation deal, including a CDollars 177m (USDollars 136.2m) public equity issue, was completed just a few months before the 1987 stock market crash. Its debt as a percentage of capital at the end of that year was a mere 7.6 per cent. 'We've always said that fish and debt don't mix,' says Mr Victor Young, FPI's chief executive. 'We've been obsessed with our balance sheet.' The companies' uneven debt loads have led to sharply different responses to the virtual disappearance in the late 1980s of the fish on which they depended. For FPI, the crisis has created an opportunity to diversify. Debt-burdened Natsea has had little choice but to pull in its horns. The sudden depletion of cod and other fish stocks in the north-west Atlantic has yet to be fully explained. Scientists have blamed, among other things, changes in water temperature and over-fishing by Canadians and Europeans. In a bid to revive the fishery, the authorities in Ottawa have slashed groundfish quotas by 75 per cent over the past five years, including a total ban on catches of northern cod off Newfoundland. The impact on the local industry has been devastating. About 35,000 fishermen and plant workers are unemployed. Mr Young estimates that FPI has lost 94 per cent of its north Atlantic fish resource. Natsea's active fishing fleet, once 50-strong, has been reduced to four vessels, and even they can put to sea for only a few months each year. But thanks to its strong balance sheet, FPI has been able to engineer a transformation from a north Atlantic fishing company to an international seafood conglomerate. It has increasingly turned to trading, processing and food-service operations. FPI bought less than 2 per cent of its raw material from other parts of the world in the late 1980s; its plants now rely on cod, pollock and flatfish from as far afield as Russia, Alaska and Scandinavia for 87 per cent of supplies. Its customers include British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines and Migros, Switzerland's leading food retailer. Revenues have jumped by more than two thirds since 1988, to about CDollars 600m last year. It has made two large acquisitions and is hunting for more. One acquisition has given the company a toehold in the shrimp business, to the point where shrimp - most of it bought in the east Asia and sold in the US - now makes up almost a third of its business. Natsea's story is a less happy one. Its sales last year were about 40 per cent below those of 1988. As part of efforts to repair the balance sheet, it has sold its extensive international operations, which stretched from Portugal to Australia. Its remaining businesses are centred on the North American retail market, where its brands remain well-entrenched. By shrinking, Natsea hopes to rebuild its business from a solid base. 'Our approach has been to focus on our strengths,' says Mr Henry Demone, Natsea's president. FPI's expansion has also given it extra flexibility to deal with remaining problems at home. One processing plant has been switched from cod to turning out high-margin shrimp products. The company is negotiating to contribute some idle trawlers to an international fishing venture, which will help secure its raw material supplies. Natsea's gaze, however, remains fixed mostly on its balance sheet. A considerable write-down will soon be required to take account of the diminished value of more than a dozen idle vessels and six vacant processing plants. Mr Demone's consolation is that, having lost 95 per cent of its Atlantic fishing quota, Natsea's plight 'obviously can't get much worse'. He is confident the remaining businesses will be able to support present debt of between CDollars 80m and CDollars 90m. However, repairing the balance sheet is likely to require several more years of patience from shareholders and bankers.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CORN BELT HERO REAPS CITY'S GRATITUDE;  </P> <P> WALL STREET INVESTMENT BANKER ADOPTS SMALL IOWA TOWN  </P> <P> There's a Bolger Drive in town. A smiling Bolger portrait in City Hall. And,  unlikely as it seems, a Bolger beach amid the cornfields.  </P> <P> But the name doesn't belong to a founding father or local hero. Bolger wasn't  born here. He has never even lived here.  </P> <P> So who is he?  </P> <P> In Wall Street circles, David Bolger is a wealthy investment banker. In  Fayette, Iowa, he's a guardian angel.  </P> <P> "He kind of feels we're his adopted community. And we've adopted him," says  former Mayor Roy Karlson.  </P> <P> Bolger and some friends and clients have donated to Fayette the ownership of  part or virtually all of some 20 properties, ranging from a can factory to a  bank.  </P> <P> The arrangement has brought Fayette hundreds of thousands of dollars that have  helped build a new city hall, expand utilities and buy a street sweeper,  lights, two ambulances and two police cars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cares for Them  </P> <P> "He really understands a small town in the middle of nowhere has needs,"  Karlson says.  </P> <P> "Fayette exemplifies the best of middle America," the New Jersey financier  says, by way of explanation. "People are hard-working, relatively quiet and  reserved. The city is of people and by people. . . . They care for each other."  </P> <P> And he cares for them, through a friendship that belongs in a Frank Capra  movie: big-time businessman embraces speck-on-the-map town, spreads greenbacks  and good cheer.  </P> <P> No strings attached.  </P> <P> When Fayette got new Main Street lights, thanks to Bolger, flip-of-the-switch  honors went to his wife, Barbara.  </P> <P> A sandy fun-in-the-sun spot in corn country? Bolger paid to bulldoze a  riverbank area, and Bernard "Scorch" Pattison, the grain and feed mill owner,  hauled white silica sand from his company's underground mine to create a beach  named after -- guess who?  </P> <P> "He gets a kick out of seeing many things happen because of what he's  contributed," says Mayor Denny Dumermuth, noting that taxes would have to be  raised or services cut without Bolger.  </P> <P> Fayette needs help: many streets have potholes, houses are in disrepair.  </P> <P> To Bolger, good deeds are "what my parents taught me to do -- put back in the  community what you take out."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted Home  </P> <P> Bolger, whose Fayette link goes back 25 years, visits occasionally -- sometimes  by private jet. He eats at Lucy's Garden of Eatin' cafe, chats with Kenny, the  hardware store owner, and is on a first-name basis with other shopkeepers.  </P> <P> No corporate pinstripes, no stuffy meetings. Bolger goes fishing or antique  hunting and sometimes brings back his wife's favorite -- Iowa smoked pork  chops.  </P> <P> "He works with Wall Street people 350 days a year," explains city attorney  Charles Hurley. "It's a cutthroat world. He loves to come out here where the  pace is slower. I think he's doing some good things with his generosity, not  squandering it on wine, women and song."  </P> <P> Fayette, population 1,500, has made Bolger honorary mayor. His wife is honorary  police chief.  </P> <P> This spring, Bolger received an award from Upper Iowa University. In the early  1960s when Bolger worked at a Wall Street securities firm, he arranged  financing for a dormitory-food service center there.  </P> <P> Years later, the school's lenders called on him when the university was $3  million in debt. Bolger arranged a refinancing plan, secured loans and canceled  $1.8 million in long-term mortgages he held on the school.  </P> <P> Starting then, and continuing through the '70s and '80s, Bolger, business  partners and some clients arranged to donate some 20 commercial properties  they'd owned and leased to corporations.  </P> <P> Initially, the offer created "a lot of suspicion" and liability concerns,  Karlson says. "Small town, big millionaire. Is this real or not?"  </P> <P> But manna from heaven it was.  </P> <P> "I think he was looking for someone to give a charitable gift to," Karlson  adds. "Thank God it was us."  </P> <P> This year, Fayette received checks including $247,500 for the sale of a  Michigan retail store and $30,000 for its share in an Ohio shopping center that  was sold.  </P> <P> In some cases, Fayette owns the land, in others, the building, too. Bolger  maintains some ownership of all properties, which include an Illinois can  factory, a Texas cold storage house and several Cleveland supermarkets.  </P> <P> Experts say giving property to a municipality is a tax savings -- the donor  deducts the entire fair market value when the gift is given. But the money  saved is less than if the property is sold and taxes are paid.  </P> <P> No one knows exactly how much money Fayette has received, though Karlson  estimates that it's more than half a million dollars.  </P> <P> A committee determines how to spend the "Bolger fund," which in mid-June  totaled $366,000. The council recently approved a committee recommendation to  use most of the cash for street renovation, for razing an old sewer plant, for  an ambulance and for a loan to the local development group.  </P> <P> "There's a feeling of responsibility," Hurley says. "We want to put it to good  use. We want to have a nice town in 50 to 100 years."  </P> <P> Bolger doesn't participate, saying: "I think it's appropriate the community  decides what they want. Once I get something together, I pull back."  </P> <P> Bolger, however, did provide $140,000 in long-term financing for Blessing  Industries, a fast-growing metal fabricating firm.  </P> <P> "What he leaves behind to Fayette is something he's been a part of," says  Blaine Blessing, the firm's owner. "He wants to . . . make it better for the  people who are here."  </P></p>

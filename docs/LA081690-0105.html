			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> FREE AGENT FAISON UNLIKELY -- AND UNFAZED  </P> <P> His name is Derrick Faison. You've never heard of him. He wasn't drafted,  scouted, tested, measured or given a second thought.  </P> <P> He played basketball his senior year in college, not football. When Faison did  play football, his team ran a run-option offense. Faison was a receiver.  </P> <P> But last Saturday in West Berlin, Faison caught two passes for the Rams in  American Bowl '90. That was two more passes than were caught by starters Henry  Ellard and Flipper Anderson. It was the first football game Faison played in  more than a year.  </P> <P> "You don't drop one," Faison said. "When I caught that first pass, I was kind  of stunned for a second; you know, it was nationwide."  </P> <P> One sensed the nation didn't care as much as Faison. He is this year's training  camp puzzler, a player who somehow slipped through 12 rounds of the NFL draft  and an ever-growing maze of scouting services and experts.  </P> <P> Of the players mentioned to compete for the team's No. 4 receiver spot,  Faison's name was never uttered. He just sort of showed up one day and took his  place in line.  </P> <P> Sixth-round choice Tim Stallworth was the early-camp favorite to win the spot.  Being a second cousin to John Stallworth, he had the right genealogy.  </P> <P> Tony Lomack, a ninth-round choice, was close on Stallworth's heels. Lomack  played for the University of Florida.  </P> <P> Faison? He was a free agent from Howard University who didn't stand a chance.  Until now.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Faison has closed the gap enough to warrant closer inspection.  He offers what no other Ram receiver has -- size. Faison is 6 feet 4 and 200  pounds.  </P> <P> His talents are unpolished, and he's still a few great catches removed from a  roster spot, but his course from Howard to UC Irvine has been interesting.  </P> <P> Faison was deprived of his senior season at Howard when it was revealed after  his junior year that he played too many minutes as a freshman to qualify as a  redshirt.  </P> <P> "I played in a couple games, like five seconds here, 10 seconds there, which  cost me a whole year," Faison said.  </P> <P> Instead, he played basketball and ran track his senior year at Howard, a  Division I-AA school in Washington.  </P> <P> When an article on his misfortune appeared in the Washington Post, Faison's  agent mailed duplicates to all 28 NFL teams.  </P> <P> Frank Trump of the Rams' scouting department passed it along to Tank Younger of  the team's administrative staff. Younger knew Faison's former coach at Howard,  Willie Jeffries.  </P> <P> "He told me he was worth bringing to camp," Younger said. "I got some game film  on him, and we brought him out."  </P> <P> Faison arrived on a Wednesday and told the Rams he had to be in Cleveland for a  tryout two days later. The Browns, obviously, received the same clipping.  </P> <P> "We worked out a deal," Younger said. "I felt, Cleveland, they're professionals  too. When they see him, they're going to sign him."  </P> <P> Faison said he's just trying to make the most out of his summer. He knows the  math; there are at least three competing receivers and one open spot.  </P> <P> "I came from a small school, and we ran the option," he said. "We ran a lot, so  this is just like being in heaven. It's just real fun, because I'm getting a  lot of footballs and I'm catching them."  </P> <P> Faison said the competition among the receivers is intense but not hostile.  </P> <P> "We're just pushing each other and fighting hard. We just pump each other up.  All I wanted to do was to get in somebody's camp, just to get a look."  </P> <P> Faison has done that. Whether he makes the team is another question.  </P> <P> "I would like to stay here," Faison said. "If it doesn't work out, hopefully  I'll be somewhere else. If not, then I can finish my last 10 hours at Howard  (to complete a degree in business management)."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Brian Smith, expected to be a key member of the Rams' inside pass rush, injured  his left knee in afternoon practice Wednesday. Afterward, the knee was heavily  bandaged and braced, and he left on crutches. Smith said the knee would be  further examined today by Dr. Clarence Shields. "I hope it's only a sprain,"  Smith said. . . . Quarterback Jim Everett sat out practice with a sore back,  the result, he said, of the long return flight from Germany on Sunday. "It's  not a major deal," he said. Everett suffered similar back problems at the end  of last season. "There's no change of schedule. We're just being cautious."  </P> <P> Tim Stallworth, who suffered a neck strain Tuesday, was improved Wednesday but  as a precaution, Coach John Robinson held Stallworth out of practice. "He said  he could practice, but we're not going to let him," Robinson said. . . .  Tailback Cleveland Gary's back problem lingers, and there is some question  whether he'll play in Saturday's game against San Diego.  </P></p>

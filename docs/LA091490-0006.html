			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG WATCH;  </P> <P> LATEST VICTIM  </P> <P> Let us all hope -- and, where appropriate, pray -- for the return to health of  one Jonathon Fabian, an unarmed resident of the city of Lynwood in Los Angeles  County.  </P> <P> He is currently in a hospital bed at Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> /Drew Medical Center, struggling against critical stomach wounds sustained in a  cold-blooded gang shooting.  </P> <P> Jonathon Fabian was not armed when he was surrounded by three teen-age boys and  plugged point blank by one of the gang members carrying a handgun. They then  escaped and are now the target of a police manhunt.  </P> <P> Jonathon Fabian is of course not the first victim of youth gang violence in  1990: As of Wednesday morning there had been 116 gang-related murders in  unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County this year alone (112 in all of last  year).  </P> <P> And of course he surely won't be the last. Gang violence in some parts of  Southern California is out of control, and it is probably due to the  geographical location of the shootings -- generally not in the higher-income  areas -- that more isn't being done about the problem. Yes, if these crimes  were occurring in places like Brentwood rather than Lynwood, more would be  done, no question.  </P> <P> Besides being unarmed, Jonathon was not a known member of any gang. He had no  criminal record and was not thought to be in any way a problem to the  community. Nevertheless, police apparently believe that he was deliberately,  not accidently, shot, and are deeply puzzled by the incident.  </P> <P> Victim Jonathon Fabian, you see, is 2.  </P></p>

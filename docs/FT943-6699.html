			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Banks must pre-notify on charges Sir, There has been much comment in recent weeks regarding the banks' standards of charges and service (Editorial: 'Bank raids', August 23, 'Brown pledges to curb bank charges', August 22). Some of that comment is justified, but not all. No bank should be complacent about the level of service it offers and all should strive constantly to improve. Unlike the rest of the commercial market, most banks do not notify customers before a charge is made. Naturally, customers would prefer not to pay charges at all, but our research shows that by notifying them before the amount is debited many problems are overcome. TSB was the first to introduce pre-notification of all charges in February. Others are now doing so. Little attention has been paid to the benefit to customers of pre-notification. All banks must rectify this if we are to avoid the criticism of charging practices. Locksley Ryan, TSB Group, London EC3V 9DN</p>

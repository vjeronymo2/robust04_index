			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Special  Economic Zone (SEZ) in east China's Fujian Province, is expected  to be empowered with legislative rights by the National People's  Congress (NPC).    The Sixth Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee,  which  opened today, will deliberate the draft decision to authorize  the people's congress and its Standing Committee in Xiamen to  formulate laws and regulations, and the Xiamen People's  Government to issue decrees for the special economic zone.    The NPC Law Committee said that Xiamen, one of the earliest  special economic zones in China, has been authorized by the  State Council to implement some free port policies and appointed  to be a pilot SEZ for urban economic structural reform.    With China opening wider to the outside world, especially  with more contacts across the Taiwan Straits, Xiamen has become  an important "window" in developing economic and trade ties with  Taiwan and foreign countries.    The draft decision will be submitted to the Second Plenary  Session of the Eighth NPC, which falls on March 10, for further  deliberation.    The NPC Law Committee said that the draft decision was  initiated by more than 60 NPC deputies from Fujian Province.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Peace breaks out in ERM THE DANISH krone, Irish punt and French franc appeared well underpinned against the D-Mark yesterday, as tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism continued to dissipate, writes James Blitz. At the end of a comparatively mild week for the ERM, the three currencies at the bottom of the system's grid appeared to be in no danger of an imminent devaluation, despite political uncertainty in their respective countries. Mr Poul Schluter's resignation as prime minister of Denmark had no impact at all on the krone which was at DKr3.8508 against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon, stronger than Thursday night's London close of around DKr3.646. The Irish punt remained above its floors against the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc - two of the strongest ERM currencies - in spite of a drastic cut in money market rates by the Irish authorities this week. The French franc gained more strength against the D-Mark, rising above the FFr3.38 level against the German currency, its highest level since November 20. At Wednesday's meeting in Frankfurt of the privately organised G7 Council, central bankers of countries still in the ERM claimed that the four-month crisis in the European Monetary System was past its peak. But there are reasons for caution. First, interest rates in several European countries, including France, Denmark and Ireland, remain at high levels. There were suggestions this week that if the Bank of France does not bring money market rates down from their level of 11 1/2 per cent, the higher costs incurred by commercial banks may be passed to the retail sector in the next two weeks. The Bundesbank will be under more pressure to shave money market rates at its council meetings on 21 January and 4 February. If it fails to respond, the pressures on weak ERM currencies could return. There may also be unfinished business in Scandinavia, whose currencies can have an impact on ERM trading. The week has been marked by a sharp fall in the value of the Swedish krona, with the central bank intervening in support of the currency. The Swedish authorities recently announced that their budget deficit for 1993/4 will be 11 per cent of GDP, and another fall for the krona cannot be ruled out. The dollar yesterday broke higher in late European trade, helped by rumours of co-ordinated rate cuts in Europe. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6355, up more than 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day.</p>

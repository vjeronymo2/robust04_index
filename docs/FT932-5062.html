			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions THE WEEK started with a bang as Sir Bernard Ashley and his family sold a total of 30m shares in Laura Ashley at 108p. This came shortly after his announcement that he would step down as chairman to become non-executive life president. The sale also furthered the family's stated intention to reduce its holding to about 30 per cent over time. The other significant sales were in Domestic &amp; General, the fast-growing UK insurance company. Martin Copley and Howard James, respectively chairman and managing director, have been prominent in reducing their holdings in recent years. The shares have been consistently good performers and the latest deals came after a near-50 per cent rise in the share price since the beginning of the year. Osprey Communications has featured recently under the 'purchases' section, but a sale of 500,000 shares at 36p was made by Frederick French, who resigns as chairman and chief executive as soon as the acquisition of SMS is complete.

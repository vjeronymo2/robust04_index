The Council of Ministers accepted the proposals of the  Social  Policy Commission for the reduction of the subsidy given to the  Social Welfare Insurance Fund by 480 trillion zloties. The  above sum will be allocated for the creation of a miscellaneous  reserve fund for the Ministry of Labor. Investments in parishes  [gminy] threatened by structural unemployment (for instance, the  clearing of ground for the purposes of attracting potential  investors) would be partly financed from this reserve fund.    The government acknowledged that in association with the  lack of additional sources of funding for the budget, it does  not see the possibility of financing the expenditures proposed  by the Sejm commissions in the course of work on the budget law.    The Council of Ministers adopted a decree amending the  decree  on the matter of tarriffs on imports from abroad.    The decree has as its aim the specification of the  requirements regarding the industrial assembly of road tractors  for the haulage of trailers. In the customs tarriff in force  until 31 December 1993 requirement was set for the assembly from  imported parts of at least 1,000 road tractors, and carrying the  entitlement to import free of tarriffs the parts for the  construction of these tractors.    In the decree adopted by the Council of Ministers those  enterprises will be entitled to import without tarriff parts for  the assembly of road tractors which assemble at least 200 such  vehicles over the course of the year.</p>

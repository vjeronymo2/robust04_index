			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH STUDENTS SCRAMBLE FOR REHEARSAL SPACE;  </P> <P> MUSIC: COLLAPSE OF UNIVERSITY HALL AND CLOSING OF OTHER BUILDINGS CREATE  SHORTAGE. SITUATION FIGURES TO GET WORSE IN SEPTEMBER, TEACHERS PREDICT.  </P> <P> This fall, Cal State Long Beach music student Vickie Reed had planned to walk  into the university's Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall and, before her family,  friends and teachers, give a performance that would mark the culmination of  years of hard work.  </P> <P> Instead, she is now scrambling about town for a place with a concert grand  piano and good acoustics.  </P> <P> After the collapse of the hall last month and the closing of five more  buildings in the music complex last week, Reed is not the only student in  search of a spot to play music. When classes begin Sept. 4, about 400 music  students in the larger performing groups will be lugging instruments to local  churches, the main library downtown and even the Queen Mary.  </P> <P> "We're really rather frantically trying to find rehearsal places," said Prof.  Michael Carson, director of the university's opera program. "It's a huge  crisis. You just can't imagine."  </P> <P> "Teaching is just going to be a nightmare," added Prof. Edith Hirshtal, who  teaches piano.  </P> <P> Donald Para, music department chairman, said late last week that he is  confident there will be enough teaching and rehearsal rooms found on and off  campus before classes start. About a half-dozen churches have volunteered  space, the downtown library will make room for musicians in its auditorium and  the Queen Mary has offered a ballroom for a major opera production in November,  Para said.  </P> <P> "The community has been very supportive," said Prof. Richard Birkemeier,  director of the Brass Ensemble. "You find out who your friends are when the  going gets rough -- and it has gotten rough."  </P> <P> The roof of the recital hall collapsed July 2. Normally used for rehearsals and  performances, the hall was empty when 120 tons of concrete and steel crashed  down. Officials immediately closed another rehearsal hall and a third building  with faculty offices and a storage area for music equipment.  </P> <P> Last week, the experts investigating the collapse of the recital hall decided  to shut down five more buildings in the music complex, saying the 8-year-old  structures would not withstand a major earthquake.  </P> <P> The cause of the hall's cave-in remains a mystery, but of equal mystery is why  past inspections of the other buildings did not reveal the structural  deficiencies that led to their closing this week.  </P> <P> Para said many of the 3,000 music students who are not in the larger performing  groups will be transferred to classrooms throughout campus.  </P> <P> "I'm sure we're going to have some difficulties in the fall. There'll be some  confusion," Para said.  </P> <P> Adding to the inconvenience of traveling across campus or to a nearby church  will be problems posed by impromptu rooms not designed for music classes, Para  and others said.  </P> <P> "The fact that they won't be practicing and rehearsing in places designed for  music will be difficult," Para said.  </P> <P> Pianists, for example, need larger rooms, said Hirshtal, the piano professor.  </P> <P> She said practicing pianists have been left with just a few small rooms, in  which most of the pianos are inadequate. When the roof of the hall collapsed,  it came tumbling down on the two grand pianos that students had used to give  their recitals.  </P> <P> "I hate to teach in those rooms," Hirshtal said about the small chambers. "You  can't hear what you're doing. Some of those pianos are so bad that students  call them 'piano-shaped objects.' "  </P> <P> Reed, the student looking for a place to hold her senior recital, said of the  practice rooms left: "It's like performing in a bathroom."  </P> <P> Music student Esme Vera, another pianist, said she has been practicing six  hours a day to prepare for her much-anticipated junior recital, originally  scheduled next month. Now, she does not know where she will hold it.  </P> <P> Hirshtal said she is "really worried about morale. These are not kids who are  rich, like those at USC. They don't have wonderful pianos at home."  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cariplo will await world recovery before relaunch Cariplo, the Italian savings bank, hopes to relaunch its postponed international share issue 'soon', but only when world markets recover confidence, according to the bank's chairman. The Milan-based bank, which claims to be the world's largest savings bank, is the latest victim of what analysts have called 'issue fatigue' on the Italian market. It suspended the issue on Friday night. The shares were supposed to go on sale today, raising as much as L1,650bn (Dollars 1.02bn) and giving Cariplo its first stock market listing since its foundation 171 years ago. In an interview published in yesterday's Corriere della Sera, the Milan daily, Mr Sandro Molinari, Cariplo's chairman, said: 'We will re-table plans for the operation when dealers are more optimistic about the markets. And note that I'm talking about all markets. The Italian market is not alone in being dominated by a cautious tone, and a low level of confidence.' Mr Molinari pointed out that the bank did not need funds. He also denied that the decision had been influenced by local politicians, in particular the regionalist Northern League, which appoints two directors of the foundation which controls Cariplo. The League is unhappy about rules limiting the foundation's use of dividends after flotation. Italian companies had planned to raise more than L10,000bn of capital on the Milan stock market during July. Cariplo's decision to delay its issue came three weeks after the postponement of a L1,500bn rights issue by Mediobanca, the influential Milan merchant bank, and in the same week as shares in Ina, the newly privatised insurer, began trading sluggishly. The Ina shares, which were made available in the biggest Italian privatisation yet, have barely risen above the issue price of L2,400.</p>

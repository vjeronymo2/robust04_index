			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rate cuts undermine Wimpey WIMPEY, one of Britain's biggest construction groups revealed yesterday how sharp falls in UK and US interest rates had undermined carefully laid plans to restrict the cost of borrowings in the 1990s. The group, like many large businesses, had entered into a series of hedging deals to limit rises in borrowing charges if international interest rates increased. In fact UK and US interest rates have fallen and yesterday Wimpey announced provisions of Pounds 25.5m to cover the cost of unwinding those banking agreements. Mr Roger Wood, finance director, said: 'The company in the late 1980s was concerned it would be squeezed between falling house prices and sales in the UK and US and rising international interest rates and entered into a series of hedging deals. ' In the three years from 1988 to 1990, these saved Wimpey about Pounds 11m. By last year interest rates had moved against the group costing it an additional Pounds 7m in interest charges in 1992. The mechanisms used by Wimpey to protect itself from rising interest rates involved a a complex package of interest rate caps, swaps and collars. These firstly put a ceiling on interest charges by requiring banks to pay any excess above an agreed fixed interest rate. In the case of the company's sterling debt the cap was fixed at about an average of 12 per cent. For dollar debt the cap was triggered at about 10.5 per cent. Wimpey also entered into swaps and collars to fix rates at an average 11.4 per cent in sterling and 8.7 per cent in dollars. This meant that Wimpey would have to fund the difference if interest rates dropped below those levels. Commercial interest rates currently are about 6 per cent in the UK and 3.25 per cent in the US, said Wimpey which under the hedging arrangements has been unable to benefit from lower interest charges. Mr Wood who joined Wimpey in 1991 said that the group is now negotiating a new series of agreements to offset the impact of previous deals. These involve capping sterling and dollar borrowings at much lower rates as well as protecting the company in case interest rates fall even further. The new arrangements will affect up to 40 per cent of the group's borrowings. The provisions are to cover the difference between the cost of the new safety net and the original hedging arrangements. The group estimates that it will save Pounds 8m in interest charges in the current year and Pounds 5m in 1994 as a result of its provisions on the former hedging arrangements.</p>

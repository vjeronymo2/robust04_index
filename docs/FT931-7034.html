Either they fail to provide second screenings for programmes that clearly deserve them, or they run so many together that viewers protest. Tonight BBC2 packs its schedule with repeats of The Man From UNCLE, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf V, and Heimat. True, Red Dwarf (9.00), which parodies all those space sagas from 2001 to Aliens, is one of the best of the current comedy series, and Heimat, (11.20) the long story of a small country town in Germany on either side of the Second World War, is one of the most impressive drama serials ever made. Yet it still seems barmy to show quite so many repeats on the same evening. Two slabs of Marks and Spencer drama clash: The Good Guys runs for an hour on ITV starting at 9.00, and Love Hurts runs for an hour on BBC1 starting at 9.30. The Good Guys with chance acquaintances Nigel Havers and Keith Barron playing knights errant, is one of those ideas that look better on paper than on screen. Love Hurts with ill-assorted lovers Adam Faith and Zoe Wanamaker, wealthy plumber and trendy charity worker respectively, is usually better.</p>

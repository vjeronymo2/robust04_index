			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / EC action call on employment Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC Commissioner for Social Affairs, yesterday said important changes were needed in research, training, industrial relations and the mobility of pension funds, in order to tackle unemployment, which could rise to 20m in the EC next year, writes Tim Coone from Dublin. He told Irish pension fund managers in Dublin that the traditional maxim that employment growth could be achieved through economic growth had failed in Europe. To help combat this, he said, the community must dedicate more resources to research and training. 'We cannot compete with the low-cost countries of east Asia. . . we have lost the world edge in research, and so we must re-establish that and apply it coherently to stay ahead in our levels of training and use this to maintain our competitiveness and job creation possibilities'.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Return of corporate borrowers generally well received A SPATE of corporate borrowers hit the Eurobond market yesterday, with Bellsouth Telecommunications' Dollars 500m, five-year issue making the biggest splash. Corporate borrowers have shied away from the Eurobond market in recent months, leaving investors starved of top quality corporate paper, so the deals launched yesterday were generally well-received. Bellsouth Telecommunications is a triple A rated name which last tapped the Eurobond market in 1988 with a Dollars 120m deal. The five-year bonds have a 5.25 per cent coupon, an issue price of 101.25 and were re-offered at 99.58. The yield spread over the relevant US Treasury bond was 25 basis points at launch, and tightened slightly to 24 basis points by late afternoon, according to Morgan Stanley, the lead manager. The deal went well, helped by the fact that Swiss retail investors and European institutional investors have seen a dearth of high quality US corporate paper, while Bellsouth itself is not a frequent name in the market. The proceeds will be used to repay some short and long-term debt, refinancing the borrowings at more attractive rates. Morgan Stanley said the borrower had achieved much more attractive terms in the Eurobond market than it would have done in the domestic US bond market, claiming Bellsouth saved about 15 basis points on the yield spread. Bell Canada, the biggest Canadian phone company, also tapped the Eurobond market yesterday, but chose the Canadian dollar sector with a CDollars 200m, 10-year issue. The borrower's credit rating is AA3/AA- and the deal was priced to yield 76 basis points over the relevant government bond. Wood Gundy, the lead manager, said the deal saw interest from continental European investors attracted by the relatively high coupon of 8.5 per cent. In the Eurosterling sector, McDonald's came with a Pounds 100m, 10-year bond issue which was initially criticised for being rather aggressively priced. The fast-food chain is not a frequent borrower in the Eurosterling sector. BZW, the lead manager, said demand was mainly from institutional investors. The bonds were launched with a yield spread of 40 basis points over the 10-year gilt, and by late afternoon had held their spread, trading at a price of 98.85-98.90. BZW said it looked at a couple of recent Eurosterling issues when pricing the deal, citing a recent issue from Abbey National which is also a AA/AA2 credit and whose bonds were trading at a yield spread of 39-40 basis points over gilts in the secondary market. Other deals of interest yesterday included a Dollars 150m, three-year issue from the Republic of Venezuela. The bonds were launched with a yield spread of 473 basis points over US Treasuries but by late afternoon the spread had tightened to 444 basis points, according to the joint lead managers. CSFB, the book-runner, said the deal attracted strong investor interest from a mix of retail and institutional investors interested in the emerging markets. Venezuela has tapped the Eurobond market before and in the secondary market its 9 3/4 per cent bond due 1996 is trading at a yield spread of about 400 basis points over Treasuries. A more recent bond issue - Dollars 130m of 9 1/8 per cent bonds due 1996 - was targeted at the Colombian market and these bonds are trading at a yield spread of about 450 basis points. Kingdom of Spain added a further FFr1bn to its recent FFr6bn issue, lead manager CCF said yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China has decided to  step up the development of rural enterprises in its inland  provinces as part of an effort to narrow the gap between their  economy and that of coastal regions.    The country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, will  allocate special funds every year till the year 2000 as low  interest loans for these areas to develop township enterprises.    This was revealed here today by He Kang, vice-chairman of  the  Chinese Association for Science and Technology (CAST) at a CAST  national conference.    They will also be given priority in using other loans from  banks, or encouraged to raise funds through issuing shares, said  the vice- chairman, who was formerly minister of agriculture.    Economic and technological cooperation between the inland  provinces and coastal regions is to be enhanced in terms of  selling of technology, jointly venturing and raw material  processing, he said.    Other programs include developing rural towns and trade with  bordering countries, he disclosed.    "Though these places suffer from the inconvenience of  transportation, they have a long border line, on which they may  rely to enter foreign markets," He Kang said.    "With both foreign markets and home markets accessible, the  inland provinces could better allocate resources."    But the rural enterprises in the inland provinces, covering  80 percent of China's territory and having 65 percent of the  country's 800 million farmers, get a smaller slice of the cake  than their coastal counterparts.    He Kang said that the inland areas have advantages of rich  natural resources, abundant labor and considerable market  potential.    "With support by the central government, aid from the  eastern  areas and avid expectations of their people, the rural  enterprises in the inland provinces will be quickly developed  and the whole economy will step further," he said.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / 5,000 Croats 'missing' in areas captured by Serbs AT LEAST 5,000 people are still missing in Croatia where Serb insurgents and the federal army have executed and tortured Croat civilians during the seven-month war, the human rights organisation Helsinki Watch said yesterday. The New York-based group, in a letter to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and army chief of staff General Blagoje Adzic, appeals for the unconditional release of all civilians taken hostage in the hostilities which it says have left at least 10,000 people dead. It calls on the federal army and Serbia to 'investigate reports of torture and summary executions', to 'refrain from the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, which has caused thousands of civilian deaths, and cease all discriminate attacks against civilians - including journalists - and civilian targets'. Helsinki Watch, which next week will detail similar reports of atrocities and violations by Croat forces, accuses Serbia of providing 'military, economic and political support' to local Serb insurgents in Croatia. Its letter also denounces the 'continuing persecution of the Albanian population of Kosovo', a province under the direct control of Belgrade. It urges humane treatment of prisoners held in an estimated 36 detention camps throughout Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Krajina, a self-proclaim Serb republic in southern Croatia. Prisoners are currently held in 'appalling conditions', it says, and in 'many cases detainees are tortured and beaten by their captors'. Families have not been notified of the fate of at least 3,000 people taken captive after the fall of Vukovar, eastern Croatia, on November 18. Many of the Croat prisoners are feared to have been executed. The 23-page letter contains the most extensive eyewitness accounts to date of brutalities committed in Croatia's war zones. Reports from Hum and Vocin, villages about 100 miles east of Zagreb, describe savage acts committed by the White Eagles, an ultra-nationalist Serb militia, when the villages were seized in August. The pro-Serb army should be held responsible for the conduct of paramilitary groups which are armed by the federal military, says Helsinki Watch. Croatian autopsy reports said many of the Croatian victims from Hum and Vocin had multiple gunshot wounds to the face and neck, usually from the back. Ten bodies had been badly burned, two people had been hit with a sharp object, propably an axe. Two people had been shot in the eyes. 'Two others appeared to have chained to a table and then set afire while still alive. . . . An elderly Croatian couple were chained and burned in their backyard'. Helsinki Watch officials in Belgrade said yesterday the army had promised to respond to the letter, which follows similar charges of atrocities by EC monitors in Croatia.</p>

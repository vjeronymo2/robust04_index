			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Any finance preferable to bank borrowing Sir, I refer to Brian Warnes's letter (January 4) regarding growth and companies vowing never to borrow again. This company, 20 years old this year, recently approached its bank for a loan. The bank's proposed fees amounted to almost 3 per cent of the sum advanced. It required a charge over the company's assets, a personal guarantee from me and a mortgage on our home. It also suggested we should use three sets of solicitors to advise (a) the company, (b) me, (c) my wife. In addition, it retained the right to debit the loan account with such administration charges that it, at its absolute discretion, saw fit and, finally, it admitted that, no matter what reduction in the loan balance over time there might be, it would still retain its charge on our home at its original level. Given all this we are trying, as Mr Warne suggests, to find a different source of funds. Perhaps the chancellor's enterprise initiative scheme may be a way. Notwithstanding this reluctance to borrow, our business is growing and we have increased employment.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal to S. Korean Religionists" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the  Korean Religionists' Council issued a statement Monday calling  on all religionists of South Korea to rise up in a struggle for  the convocation of a national conference.    The statement says the Kim Yong-sam group of South Korea  shows a negative attitude toward the North-proposed convocation  of a national conference and it is resorting to criminal moves  to unleash a nuclear war despite the unanimous protest and  denunciation from people at home and abroad.    This is a heinous treachery to reduce South Korea to a  market  for U.S. weapons and victimise the nation for big powers, the  statement notes, and continues:    Achievement of the great unity of the whole nation is the  only way for our nation to overcome the grave difficulties  caused by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet  group and realise peace and peaceful reunification of the  country.    The religionists and religious organisations in the North,  South and overseas should show their will for great national  unity by a practical action by taking an active part in the  patriotic struggle for the convocation of a national conference.    We earnestly call on all religionists of South Korea to turn  out as one in the struggle to check and frustrate the South  Korean authorities' confrontational moves for war and realise  the national conference, irrespective of denomination and order.    The statement expresses the hope that all religious  organisations, clergymen and laymen the world over will extend  unstinting support and encouragement to the Korean nation in the  efforts to build a unified country of justice and peace with  love and reconciliation.</p>

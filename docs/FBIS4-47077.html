			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kabay Karabekov: "Labyrinths of Power; the Best </F> Vegetables Grow in Osha, and Fruit--in the Chuiskiy Valley; What  the Biographies of Potential Candidates for President of  Kyrgyzstan Have in Common"]    [Text] The republic's newspapers have started an undeclared  preelection campaign for future president of Kyrgyzstan. Is it  not too early? It seems that it is not. Not much time is left  before the date--autumn 1996--that is cherished by some  political leaders. But in the struggle for power, as is well  known, the one who begins to prepare the sleigh well ahead of  time wins more often.    The confrontation in the upper echelons of power is also  coming out in the open. The campaign is already developing in  earnest. All of the groups that are involved in this process are  actively preparing reliable springboards for their candidates.  The arrangement of forces is being publicly counted, and the  newspapers indicate with an accuracy of up to one-hundredth of a  percent the representation in the government of natives of one  or another region. Every slight shortcoming of a potential  candidate for the first post in the republic is recorded and  filed in a dossier. Without a doubt, the assembled compromising  material will be reported to the voters at the necessary time.    So who could end up on the voter's ballot within two years?  Besides Feliks Kulov, the former vice president (this candidacy  has already been examined in previous issues of NYG [NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA], there are three real aspirants: Askar  Akayev, the current head of state (despite the statement that he  does not intend to take part in the new political show);  Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Medetkan Sherimkulov; and Prime  Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov. These three are well known to the  people, and each of them has his strong and weak points, and  pluses and minuses.  <H5>  Carte Blanche of the Communists </H5>   The most real political force in Kyrgyzstan today is the  party of the Communists. To all appearances, it is counting on  M. Sherimkulov, speaker of the parliament. Dzh. Amanbayev, the  former leader of the Communists and the present deputy prime  minister, in fact, crossed himself off the list of aspirants to  "father of the nation" with his own hand. The deputy prime  minister, while on a working trip to the south of the republic,  allowed himself a whole number of rather imprudent statements.  Speaking to the aktiv of two agricultural oblasts, in the past  an ardent supporter of the kolkhoz-sovkhoz system, he suddenly  declared publicly that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes are a "thing  of the past." The state, he said, is not in a condition to  finance unprofitable production. Of course, they can exist in  the event that they do not request money from the authorities  for subsistence. And he noted in passing that the government  allocated a total of 150 million soms for spring field work.  This, he said, is all that it is possible to do in the given  situation.    The Communists will hardly forgive their former leader for  betraying the general party line. It is still fresh in people's  minds how the willful Communist Dzh. Amanbayev did not let an  occasion pass to goad the president for badgering the kolkhozes  and sovkhozes, and he was one of A. Akayev's most serious  opponents.    But a lot speaks in favor of M. Sherimkulov. First, which is  quite important, he is the only representative of the party  elite in the higher echelons of power. (In the former regime,  Sherimkulov occupied the post of secretary of the Central  Committee of the KPK [Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan] for  ideology. Second, which is no less important, he is an  intelligent, subtle, and very experienced politician. While  holding the position of speaker of parliament, Sherimkulov  collected a lot of points, skillfully analyzing all of the  stratagems of eastern politics. During this time, the speaker  worked on foreign policy as well as on domestic policy. He  proved himself to be a peacemaker in the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict.    M. Sherimkulov is a very strong trump card for the Communist  Party. If the Communists will unanimously and to the last come  out for the speaker, they will acquire a good opportunity to  enter the White House on the shoulders of the head of parliament  and thereby return to grand policy. And with respect to  everything else, the speaker in his position is in a more  winning situation than his two nearest rivals: because he is  associated far less than A. Akayev and A. Dzhumagulov with the  republic's economic problems, and all of the troubles and  problems of the population will be attributed to the account of  the latter two.  <H5>  Will the Prime Minister Sit in the President's Chair? </H5>   Abbas Dzhumagulov, the former perennial second in the  communist system and present prime minister, having tasted  freedom, is beginning to conduct himself in this eminent company  in a more and more relaxed manner. He understands perfectly well  that there will be no break in the economy for the next three to  four years. Unemployment is increasing. Seventy large  enterprises have been stopped, and of these, four are grandees  of the defense industry, where, incidentally, mainly highly  qualified Russian specialists work. Deprived of earnings, they  will leave Kyrgyzstan. In order to stop the specialists, it will  be necessary to put the dying plants into operation. But the  republic does not have the resources for this. And Russia has  declared openly that it can keep only 30 percent of Kyrgyz  defense industry occupied.    The situation in the economy of the republic shocked  specialists of the IMF. Money that is earmarked for production  disappears in the sand. The government is not in a condition to  retrieve it, inasmuch as only altruistic businessmen make tax  payments to the treasury. The rest either hide their incomes or  procrastinate as long as possible. But many, after receiving  credits, disappear in unknown directions.    The prime minister, naturally, could not agree to the  demands  of the IMF to freeze wages fully. He promised that excise taxes  on a whole series of commodities would be introduced. The state  once again will become a monopolist in the production of vodka.  The sale of alcohol will be prohibited. In the near future, the  output of commodities will be prohibited that do not meet  quality standards. A. Dzhumagulov intends to make essential  consumer goods accessible in price and to make it up in volume.    The intentions are good, but they are not new. There is no  doubt that the Kyrgyz homegrown "marketeers" will find a way out  of this situation and a method for duping the state. And the  Kyrgyzstan Government will once again slip out behind the flags  that the IMF sets up.    It is quite possible that right after the minister of  finance, several other members of the cabinet and rayon managers  will "disappear." Life will make it also necessary, probably, to  reduce the number of oblasts and rayons and to eliminate them  entirely in the future. The prime minister will certainly come  out with a new administrative structure at the next session. He  has no other way out. Otherwise, the prime minister is deprived  of all prospects for the future, and he will be compelled always  to remain in secondary roles, carrying out the instructions of  more resolute politicians.  <H5>  Today the First, but Tomorrow.... </H5>   President Akayev has a no less, if not a more, difficult  situation. His team is composed of the second echelon of the  Communist nomenklatura. There is not one representative of the  party generals next to him.    The trump ace of the president is foreign policy. He was  able  to place himself in the rank of CIS leaders whose opinion is  heeded.    But today, it is necessary for A. Akayev to score in the  republic also. Seeing that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes are not  making a go, A. Akayev is counting on the farmers. In the  future, the association of farmers could become a powerful  political force and constitute a serious competitor to the  Communists.    The president will have to "grapple" with the prime minister  very soon. If the government, in unison with the parliament,  tries to subordinate the National Bank under it, the president  will be deprived of a lot.    The "golden" question will once again become the urgent  argument in the hands of the opposition. In the next few days,  one more project will come into doubt that is being concluded by  the government with the support of the president--a contract for  the development of the very large Kumtor gold field. In the  president's opinion, the break with Kameko [name as  transliterated]--a Canadian firm--promises the republic a lot of  unpleasantness. In addition to the fact that it will be  necessary to pay a huge penalty to the firm, Kyrgyzstan's  authority will be fundamentally tarnished. Information  concerning the fact that the firm is already investing resources  in the uranium production of a neighboring republic sounded like  an alarm bell for the defenders of the Kameko project. However,  Kameko is associated with Seabeco. And everyone knows this.  Among the opponents of the president, political considerations  will dominate over common sense.    Personnel policy will also seriously let A. Akayev down. In  the opinion of many, the staffs of the president and the  government are insufficiently professional, not to mention the  managers in the localities. In the opinion of Professor N.  Eshmambetov, an assistant to A. Akayev for economics, the  intellectual level of the staff leaves a lot to be desired.    These are the starting positions in which the real aspirants  to the second successive post of president of Kyrgyzstan find  themselves. Of course, many are disturbed by the fact that the  current president, speaker, and prime minister are natives of  the Chuiskiy Valley. But it is easy to correct this reality. In  the event of a victory of one of them, the three branches of  power--presidential, legislative, and executive--simply will be  divided among the three largest regions of the  republic--Chuiskiy--Talasskiy, Issyk-Kulsko--Narynskiy, and  Osha--Dzhalal-Abadskiy.    It is impossible today to say unequivocally who will become  the next head of state. But fortune will smile on the one of  them who uses the remaining period to maximum advantage for  himself.</p>

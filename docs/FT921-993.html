			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan falls to 1992 low as rumour enlivens Paris MILAN fell to its lowest level this year while wishful thinking boosted Paris, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was enlivened in the afternoon by a rumour, swiftly denied, that Prime Minister Edith Cresson had resigned. The CAC-40 index closed up 32.02 or 1.7 per cent to 1,928.28, just off the day's high of 1,929.34, while turnover, which was quietly below FFr1bn by lunch, rose to FFr2.21bn. Most blue-chips participated in the afternoon rise, with BSN up FFr23 to FFr1,098 following its pleasing 1991 results on Tuesday. Euro Disney was the notable exception, dropping another FFr3.50 or 2.3 per cent to FFr150 following Goldman Sach's sell note. Sanofi was volatile following its 1991 results. The stock fell to FFr1,141 before closing up FFr25 to FFr1,200 in moderate volume of 24,000 shares. Some analysts said net profit of FFr956m, up 12 per cent, was not as good as it appeared, since it reflected the inclusion for the first time of profit from its 40 per cent stake in the Hungarian pharmaceuticals company, Chinoin, and a rise in profit at its associated perfume companies, rather than growth in operating profit. MILAN fell to its lowest level this year on reports in the domestic press, confirmed in yesterday's release of the Treasury report on state finances, that a fall in fiscal revenues was undermining the government's efforts to cut its budget deficit. The market was also depressed by Banca Commerciale Italiana's 1991 results, and fears of a lira devaluation. The Comit index fell 6.21 to 499.29 in turnover estimated at L85bn after L83.8bn. Heavy selling pushed Banca Commerciale down by L192 or 5.2 per cent to L3,558, accounting for more than half of the total L34bn turned over on the screen-based trading system. Fiat fell L121 or 2.5 per cent to L4,747, Generali lost L335 to L28,655 and Montedison dropped L36 to L1,349. FRANKFURT was pulled off an early high by news that inflation in Baden-Wurttemberg stood at a higher-than-expected 4.6 per cent in mid-March. The market was also depressed by disappointing results from Schering, while Veba's surprise dividend increase came too late to revive sentiment. The DAX index reached 1,712.39 in the first 45 minutes before closing at 1,716.26, up 3.15, in turnover of DM5.5bn after DM5.7bn. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 3.53 to 698.47. Schering fell 20 pfg to DM835.80 after the company said it expected no improvement in profit this year, which analysts attributed to the delays in launching a new contraceptive pill in the US and Japan, and disposing of non-core activities. Reports of big buy orders from the UK pulled Bayer up by DM4.60 to DM300.30 and BMW by DM4.50 to DM575.50. Asko put on another DM15 to DM900 while Continental added DM2 to DM248.50 on bargain-hunting. Veba ended 50 pfg better at DM377.80 before announcing a DM1 rise in the 1991 payout to DM12 but it rose DM2 after hours. AMSTERDAM was active in Nedlloyd and Daf, the latter slipping ahead of today's results which are expected to disappoint. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.1 to 125.0. Daf closed down Fl 1.20 or 4.9 per cent at Fl 24.20. Nedlloyd reached an intraday high of Fl 61.20 but was dragged lower to close 90 cents ahead at Fl 60.00 after the works council lodged an official objection to the appointment of Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian shareholder, to the supervisory board. Bols gained Fl 1 to Fl 47.80 and announced a 17 per cent rise in net profit after the close. STOCKHOLM again concentrated on Volvo as it B shares advanced 3.5 per cent to SKr15 to SKr430. At an analysts meeting in London on Tuesday the car maker said that 1992 earnings would benefit from a cost-cutting package, enabling its car and bus divisions to return to profit. James Capel has subsequently revised its EPS 1991 forecast to SKr33 from SKr26. The Affarsvarlden General Index added 7.9 to 1,009.3 in turnover of SKr845m after SKr597m. ZURICH lost some early gains on profit-taking. The SMI advanced 6.0 to 1,830.1. Nestle remained in focus following its successful bid for Perrier. The group said reports that the European Commission planned to investigate the deal would not affect the takeover. Nestle bearers and registered shares rose SFr10 and SFr50 to SFr9,490 and SFr9,460 respectively. Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz were active ahead of today's results: Ciba-Geigy bearers rose SFr40 to SFr3,450 and registered shares put on SFr30 to SFr3,450. Sandoz bearers shed SFr10 to SFr2,610. BRUSSELS closed higher after five days of falls, helped by stronger bond prices. The Bel-20 index firmed 3.56 to 1,193.37 in turnover of BFr860m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 25                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open     10 am     11 am   12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1143.66  1144.39   1143.93  1143.43  1143.75  1143.90  1143.00  1144.53                    Day's High  1145.52    Day's Low  1142.89               Mar 24    Mar 23    Mar 20    Mar 19     Mar 18              1142.88   1142.05   1153.93    1153.18    1153.82 Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

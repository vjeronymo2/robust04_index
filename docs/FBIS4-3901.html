			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] An official from the local office of the New China  News Agency (Xinhua) has reconfirmed there was no chance that Lu  Ping, the director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, would meet the Governor during his visit to the  territory next week. It would be Lu's first visit since Chris  Patten took office. Patten has said he would be "delighted" to  talk to Lu.    "Patten probably thinks that he can do whatever he wants,"  said the local Xinhua deputy director, Zhang Junsheng. "He  thinks if he wants to meet Lu, he can do so at any time. It is  just his wishful thinking." When asked why Lu should decline  Patten's invitation, Zhang said no reason was needed. "It is  him (Patten) who has undermined the cooperative spirits of the  two countries.    "Now Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report  publicly voices its support for Patten's so-called reform  proposal.    "There is nothing Lu can talk to him (about)."    Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing, said  yesterday the report represented the views of some MPs, not the  British government.</p>

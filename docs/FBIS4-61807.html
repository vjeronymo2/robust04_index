			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 10 May RAHVA HAAL, p.1; "News Bulletin" No. 89] </F>   [Text] An unnamed official is quoted as claiming that the  hasty return of President Lennart Meri was caused by an alert to  the Defence Forces declared by Commander in Chief General  Aleksander Einseln in connection with the statement by Russian  Defence Minister Grachev. The same source claimed that the  alert was later renamed regular training exercise.    Chief of the GHQ Colonel Arvo Sirel rejected the claims,  declaring that the Defence Forces had held a regular exercise on  Saturday [7 May] night in order to train the deployment of  officers. There was no alert, he stressed, explaining that the  GHQ has a practice of holding such sudden checkups of deployment  every month. The date for Saturday's exercise had been agreed  upon last December, the colonel said.    Russia had also reported the violation of its airspace by an  Estonian aircraft. The Border Guard Department denied having  alerted its forces at that time, but Director General Tarmo  Kduts admitted the exercise and a flight of a Border Guard  patrol aircraft. "Our aircraft did fly during the exercise, but  in Estonian airspace. I do not know what aircraft the Russians  are speaking about," he said.    Government spokesman Ain Saarna claimed to have no  information about an alert or exercise. "I cannot comment it,  this is a matter of the Defence Forces," he said.</p>

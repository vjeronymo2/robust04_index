OCE 33&hyph;15&hyph;73 (oval 1 -ga steel arch) is no longer approved for new construction; however, existing magazines are considered ``standard.'' For new construction of large magazines of this type use the earth-covered steel, semi-circular-arch magazine design shown on Army OCE drawing number 421&hyph;80&hyph;01, and for new construction of smaller magazines of this type use OCE drawing number AW 33&hyph;15&hyph;65 addressed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mass detonating explosives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . High explosives, black powder, certain propellants, certain pyrotechnics, and other similar explosives, alone or in combination, or loaded into various types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small portion is subject to fire, to severe concussion or impact, to the impulse of an initiating agent, or to the effect of a considerable discharge of energy from without. Such an explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation may occur immediately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more quantities shall be considered as one for quantity-distance (Q/D) purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maximum credible event (MCE) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In hazards evaluation, the MCE from a hypothesized accidental explosion, fire, or agent release is the worst single event that is likely to occur from a given quantity and disposition of ammunition and explosives. Event shall be realistic with a reasonable probability of occurrence, considering the explosion propagation, burning rate characteristics, and physical protection given to the items involved. The MCE evaluated on this basis may then be used as a basis for effects calculations and casualty predictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Military pyrotechnics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

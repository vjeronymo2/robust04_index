			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Smith article: "Minister Rules Out Nuclear </F> Sell-off in Current Parliament"]    [Text] The nuclear power industry is unlikely to be  privatised before the next election, Mr Tim Eggar, energy  minister, said yesterday.    Launching a wide-ranging review of the sector's future, Mr  Eggar said of the possible privatisation: "It would not be  practical to do it in this parliament."    His comments are a significant setback to the hopes of  Nuclear Electric, operator of nuclear power plants in England  and Wales, which has been pressing strongly for privatisation.    Although Mr Eggar did not elaborate on why an early sale was  impractical, the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] -- where  he is a minister -- is already preoccupied with privatisation of  the Post Office, among other issues.    Privatisation of the nuclear industry would lead to a highly  charged political debate. Tories fear the Labour party could  make political capital of the issue in the run-up to a general  election.    But Mr Eggar's dismissal of an early privatisation could  annoy some in the Treasury, where ministers are much more  enthusiastic about a sell-off.    Differences of opinion between the Treasury and DTI are  believed to have been a factor in delaying the review, which the  government had hoped to start last year. The DTI's review of  the nuclear power industry will run in tandem with a Department  of Environment inquiry, also announced yesterday, into the  disposal of radioactive waste.    The preliminary results of this investigation are due to be  announced in the summer and are likely to feed into the nuclear  power review, which will probably last longer.    Environmental organisations welcomed the waste review  yesterday, saying it would expose problems that would make the  power industry more difficult to privatise in the long term.    In spite of Mr Eggar's caution, the DTI has agreed to  consider privatisation as a key element of its review, which  will also focus on the economic and commercial viability of new  nuclear stations.    The government imposed a moratorium on building nuclear  power  stations other than Sizewell B in Suffolk when it excluded  nuclear power from its plans to privatise the electricity  industry in 1989.    The government said its review would not consider whether  Sizewell B should be brought on stream as planned by Nuclear  Electric later this year. This was a matter for "appropriate  ministers and authorities."    The review will also consider nuclear waste and  decommissioning liabilities.</p>

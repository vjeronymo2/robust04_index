			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GRADUATING SENIORS CAN SLEEP BIT LONGER  </P> <P> For graduating seniors at Cal State Northridge, the first day of the rest of  their lives will start a little later.  </P> <P> Responding to complaints from students and parents, the university said it will  change the start of spring graduation ceremonies on May 26 from 7 a.m. to 11  a.m.  </P> <P> School administrators had announced the 7 a.m. start time last month, hoping  the early hour would avoid hot temperatures and be symbolic of a new beginning  for graduates.  </P> <P> "We had thought that the students would be excited about it," university  spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. "That didn't happen. . . . You have to listen  to what the students want."  </P> <P> Many of the 4,650 graduating students and their parents complained to  university officials that they would have to wake before dawn to attend the  ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl.  </P></p>

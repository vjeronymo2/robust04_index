			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: French group details plans for investment COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the French industrial holding company, indicated yesterday that some of the proceeds of its planned FFr3bn-FFr4bn (Dollars 535-Dollars 714m) rights issue would be devoted to developing cellular phones in Europe and electricity production in the US. These are among the group's fastest-growing activities, and it plans FFr3bn investment this year. Announcing the rights issue on Tuesday night, the company said its aim was to 'reinforce its own funds', but a spokeswoman yesterday pointed out that group equity, together with convertible bonds, totalled FFr29bn, outweighing long-term debt at the end of last year. The rights issue brings to FFr35bn the amount of new equity that companies have raised, or plan to raise, this year, in addition to the government's programme to sell around FFr40bn of state assets this autumn, according to Mr Michel Vigier of Cholet Dupont. This compares with a total of FFr50bn equity raised last year. The volume of convertible bond issues has also risen from FFr3bn in the whole of 1992, to FFr12bn so far this year.</p>

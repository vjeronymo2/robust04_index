			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Temperature Superconductors: </F> Dramatic Breakthrough by Two French Teams"]    [Text] Paris--Within a few hours of each other, two teams  headed by French scientists announced that they had achieved a  dramatic breakthrough in the field of superconductivity, raising  it for the first time to around zero degree Celsius, and thus  heralding the day when superconductors will be available at room  temperature and under normal pressure.    On 17 December, the CNRS [National Center for Scientific  Research] announced that researchers at two of its Grenoble  laboratories had obtained mercury cuprates that are partially  superconductive at temperatures ranging from 190 Kelvin [K] (-63  degrees Celsius [C]) to 280 K (+7 degrees C), thus beating the  250 K (-23 degrees C) record announced less than 24 hours before  by a team of the Higher School of Industrial Physics and  Chemistry of the City of Paris (ESPCI) headed by Michel  Lagues--which record, according to the researchers themselves,  remains to be verified.    Although these results were obtained by different methods  and  with different compounds, nevertheless they prove the existence,  long in doubt, of superconductivity at a very high "critical  temperature" (below which a material will conduct electric  current without opposing any resistance to it). Less than three  months ago[.sup]1[/], the record was only 157 K, at a  pressure of 235 kilobars (about 235,000 atmospheres), whereas  the new results were achieved under normal pressure.    The Grenoble researchers, at the Research Center on Very Low  Temperatures (Jean-Louis Tholence, Benedict Souletie, Olivier  Laborde) and at the Crystallography Laboratory (Catherine  Chaillout, Jean-Jacques Capponi, Massimo Marezio, and Miguel  Alario Franco) obtained mercury cuprates, consisting of mercury,  barium, calcium, and CuO[.sup]2[/] copper oxide, and more  precisely with [sic] the phase Hg-1223  (HgBa[.sup]2[/]Ca[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]8+d[/]),  as well as Hg-1245.    What did the team headed by Jean-Louis Tholence and formed  nearly seven years ago observe? The two "signatures" of  superconductivity: a sudden drop of electric resistance (in  seven of the samples) and the "diamagnetic transition," which  shows as an apparent magnetization in a direction opposed to  that of the magnetic field applied to the sample (on the 15 or  so samples), at temperatures ranging from 190 K to 280 K,  depending on the compounds.    According to Jean-Louis Tholence, the record, a  "superconductive transition" at 280 K, was observed on "one  percent of the sample volume." Its structure remains to be  determined in order to obtain samples with larger  "superconductive" fractions. A report on this research will be  published on 3 January in the American review PHYSICS  LETTERS.[.sup]2[/]    At the end of September, the Grenoble physicists had already  achieved a record, reaching a critical temperature of 157 K in a  mercury cuprate (Hg-1223, already), but subjecting the sample to  a very high pressure: 235 kilobars. Like Paul Chu and his team  at the Houston University, they used the fact that, in these  cuprates, bringing atoms closer together (which can be done by  applying pressure) will increase the critical temperature.    In November 1992, the Crystallography Laboratory had  discovered the first compound of the family, Hg-1201  (HgBa[.sup]2[/]CuO[.sub]4[/]) with the collaboration of  Serguei Poutiline of the Lomonossov University in Moscow, who  was in Grenoble at the time.    The Grenoble researchers' samples measured about 10 cubic  millimeters. The material in which the ESPCI team[.sup]3[/]  observed a "resistive transition" at 250 K--i.e. a sudden  decrease of electric resistance, "by a factor of 100,000," which  led the researchers to believe that it involved a  superconductive transition--was a bismuth cuprate, of the  BiSrCaCuO family (bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide),  deposited on a substrate in the form of a 30-nanometer thick  film. In addition, the characteristics of the phenomenon--in  particular its non-linearity, i.e. the anomalies observed in the  current/voltage ratio (which normally increase [sic] in a linear  manner)--"point to the existence in this material of a  superconductive phase at a still higher temperature, which a few  minor changes might make evident."    This result, an account of which was published in the  American weekly SCIENCE,[.sup]4[/] was obtained through long  and persistent research performed in collaboration at the  Tel-Aviv University (Guy Deutscher), the Higher Normal School  (Philippe Monod, Nicole Bontemps), the Pierre-et-Marie-Curie  University (Julien Bok, also at the ESPCI), and the Institute of  Materials Sciences and Radiation or ISMRA (Guy Raveau) in Caen.    Actually, back in 1986 a Surfaces and Superconductors team  was created at the ESPCI; the following year, the team leader,  Michel Lagues (with the support of Jacques Lewiner, scientific  director of the ESPCI, and Julien Bok) decided to attempt the  development of thin-film superconductors. To deposit these films  on a substrate, one atom layer at a time, the ESPCI decided to  acquire a machine that Riber, the French manufacturer of  epitaxial facilities (which currently supplies 50 percent of the  world market) took two years to develop, jointly with the ESPCI  team.    Although the initial results were disappointing, which  explains why many teams throughout the world became  discouraged--actually, in cuprates, atoms are not always willing  to cooperate and grow in a single plane (a phenomenon which  Michel Lagues proposed to call "infinite phase" growth)--the  team managed to master this method of "epitaxy through imposed  sequence of atomic layers," which is continuously controlled by  electronic diffraction, and they prepared their first sample,  with three layers of copper oxide, and then, two years later,  the present compound with eight CuO[.sup]2[/] layers.    The technique was covered by a patent application and a  structure was set up jointly with Sofinnova for "the industrial  implementation of this research." Although the diamagnetism of  the sample remains to be verified (a difficult operation  considering the thinness of the film, which tests the  sensitivity of measuring instruments), the ESPCI seems  confident. These results, they estimated, "should open a new  field for the study of the superconductive properties of  cuprates," and above all "should make it possible to achieve the  goal pursued for 15 years by many laboratories throughout the  world: to dispense with cryogenics, which until now was required  to achieve superconductivity at normal pressure."    With the results of these two teams, the wild hope of  obtaining superconductive materials at room temperature  therefore seems to be taking shape. Although no "superconductor  market" can be envisioned within the next five years, as Michel  Lagues pointed out on 17 December, nevertheless huge long-term  prospects are opening up in the low-current field, i.e. in  electronics and data processing.

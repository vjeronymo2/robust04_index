			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Italians are once again in trouble in  Somalia. Two volunteers working for the CEFA [Comitato Europeo  di Formazione Agraria, Bologna-based charity] humanitarian aid  organization have been kidnapped near Giohar. Their names are  not yet known. The Italian authorities are currently  negotiating for the two Italians to be released. The kidnapping  took place against the backdrop of an important diplomatic  initiative being carried out by Italy. Achille D'Amelia reports  from Somalia.    [D'Amelia] The news about the kidnapping of the two Italian  aid workers in Giohar, 100 kilometres north-east of Mogadishu  and where Italian Blue Helmets are based, was given by Somali  sources to Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary [Carmelo] Azzara and  the Italian delegation which is trying to create a network of  talks and mutual interest between local clans, a network that  would guarantee a peaceful withdrawal for our contingent.    The climate is tense in Mogadishu and all over Somalia. Our  friends are chiding us over our withdrawal and those who have  given their arms to us are now empty-handed, but the kidnapping  of the two Italian aid workers, whose names are still not known,  seems to have more to do with economic motives -- a banal ransom  demand -- than political ones. Specially selected units of  Italian troops and helicopters have been sent to Giohar, where  the kidnapping took place, by the Italian Blue Helmets  commander, General [Carmine] Fiore; but, above all, he has  invited village elders to show reason.</p>

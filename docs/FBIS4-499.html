			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- Eskom [Electricity  Supply Commission] said on Monday [11 April] it had agreed with  the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of  Metalworkers of South Africa and South African Iron and Steel to  conduct an urgent investigation into alleged arms sales by some  employees of the parastatal.    To be co-ordinated by the Independent Mediation Services of  South Africa [IMSSA], the investigation will focus on further  arms sales and the position of surplus arms in Eskom in relation  to security, the possibility of some employees within Eskom  supporting destabilisation, and political conflict within Eskom  in relation to possible interruption of electricity supplies.    Eskom said it and the three trade unions were drawing up  terms of reference for submission to the IMSSA commission of  inquiry. Last month, two Eskom employees were suspended after  they apparently concluded a deal to sell scores of surplus  weapons from the company to the kwaZulu Police.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> HAKEN HAGEGARD AT AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> Opera singers as recitalists sometimes disappoint through a lack of subtlety or  a failure of finesse. Hakan Hagegard, who returned to Ambassador Auditorium  over the weekend to open the hall's 1990-91 season -- its 17th -- disappoints  through other means.  </P> <P> This time, the celebrated Swedish baritone charmed his way through a program  that zigzagged around the centuries, specialized in lightness of sound and  feeling and sent at least one listener home musically undernourished.  </P> <P> There was substance in this agenda: appealing arias by Rossini, Tchaikovsky and  Mozart; Mahler's "Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen"; dramatic and touching songs  by Sibelius and Stenhammar -- even three serious encores after the program  proper.  </P> <P> But a prevailing blandness and low-energy delivery -- with a couple of strong  exceptions -- made the event seem monochromatic.  </P> <P> That judgment stems clearly from the singer's basic sound, which remained  through this evening a one-color resource. Usually smooth and ungrainy,  Hagegard's is a healthy, if slender, voice, which tends to weakness in the  lower register and never grows large, even at loud levels.  </P> <P> More disappointing is the energy and intensity with which it is used. Most of  the time, one suspects that the singer is making finely gauged and intimate  vocal sounds; the reality is that his lack of involvement through much of his  program is responsible for this impression.  </P> <P> What he sang best on this occasion -- handsomely and comprehensively supported  by the solid and colorful, if sometimes overmodest, pianism of Warren Jones --  were the characterful Finnish and Swedish art songs, and his fully engaged  singing of three arias, ending with the "Largo al Factotum" from "Il Barbiere  di Siviglia." The rest was mostly forgettable.  </P></p>

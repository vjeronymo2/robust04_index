			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / More than a third falter in further education MORE than a third of people aged 16 to 19 on full-time further education courses in England and Wales do not complete their studies or attain the intended qualifications, says a report published yesterday. This implies that about Pounds 330m a year is spent on courses that confer no qualifications on those taking them. The report by the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, and the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), finds that non-completion rates average 13 per cent for A-level courses and 18 per cent for vocational courses. Similar proportions of enrolled students complete courses but fail to gain qualifications. Both these groups are included in the UK's over-16 education participation rate, which at about 70 per cent last year is already among the lowest in Europe. The agencies recommend that funding should not encourage students 'indiscriminately' on to courses. The report says: 'The intention of current reforms is that much more of the impetus towards efficiency should be provided by the market freedoms which institutions will have. But there is a potential danger of inefficiencies arising from competition.' It is also proposed that government league tables should include non-completion rates and the relative value to students added by different institutions. Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the Audit Commission, said: 'It must be a matter of concern for students, teachers and our economic future that so many young adults do not complete or are unsuccessful in their courses. This represents a waste of both resources and talent.' The high levels of non-achievement and non-completion will strengthen the case for reforms that bring the array of over-16 qualifications into a single structure. The government remains opposed to such reform, with strong pressure from the Conservative party to maintain the so-called 'gold standard' of A-levels. The report adds that the existing system of careers guidance for pupils in their last year of compulsory schooling 'generally works well'.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our guest this morning is Edem Kodjo, the new  Togolese prime minister, appointed last Friday by President  Eyadema. The appointment of Edem Kodjo, chairman of the  Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] is being disputed by the  Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], which is the other party of  the majority. The CAR recalls that according to an agreement  made last month with the UTD, the prime minister should come  from the CAR. For his part, Edem Kodjo wants to calm things  down. Here is his reaction, speaking to Guy Mariot, our  correspondent in Togo. Listen hard: The line quality is not of  the best. It will be difficult to hear all of what he says.    [Begin recording] [Kodjo] We must try not to poison the  atmosphere, because the reaction of the CAR is a reaction that  must be integrated within the framework of the problems that we  are facing and will face. The most important thing is that the  bridges should not be broken between the two political parties  which make up the parliamentary majority. And these bridges  have not broken. As Mr. Agboyibo has himself suggested, and I  think it is not a bad idea, we should seek fresh consultations  in such a way as to make progress on the problems we face.    [Mariot] But does the UDT-CAR coalition still exist, Mr.  Prime Minister?    [Kodjo] Of course it does. And it is this coalition which is  the fruit of the victory of the Togolese people during the  recent parliamentary elections. We cannot get away from this  coalition. I believe we must do our utmost to ensure its  continued existence.    [Mariot] So when will the government be announced, and how  will it be made up? Will it be technocrats, and from which  parties?    [Kodjo] In principle the government should be made up of  representatives of political parties in the assembly,  personalities from the political world, and civilian  personalities, who can make a contribution to solving the  problems of this country, and there is no question of forming a  government of technocrats.    I think [words indistinct] a certain number of choices  (?about its direction) and this has to be taken into account.  As such, we have to appoint a new kind of government where the  main political forces of the country are represented.    [Mariot] How can you sell your government program? What are  its main outlines?    [Kodjo] First of all we need national reconciliation, in  other words, we have to ensure that conditions exist enabling  everyone to express their opinions and to feel free in a free  country. I think that to do this we need to give up our  quarrels. We will do what we can. The different players in the  political game should be associated in this game, and find  themselves free in this country.    We must do our utmost to get the problem of refugees solved,  because it is a basic aspect of reconciliation. Starting this  reconciliation, (?demanded by the people), must be carried out  [words indistinct] in such a way that the army, which is our  army, can find understanding and a total feeling of brotherhood  among the people.    After this comes the creation of a state based on law, which  is something essential in democratic systems; human rights must  be respected, we must have institutions to strengthen respect  for human rights.    Certain solutions have also been envisaged in the  constitution. We must institute it rapidly. We must quickly  move toward a state based on law, and the state based on law  should be decentralized so that the people can take a closer  part in mapping out policies concerning their future.    We also need an economic recovery. This is the main problem.  As you know, the economic situation in our country is bad, its  economic recovery can only come as a result of efforts and also  as a result of the confidence we must give the outside world so  that we can use the necessary capital sums for the development  of our industry, agriculture, and trade.    With the devaluation of the African Financial Community  franc, the problems are all the more difficult. We need to  buckle down to this problem to ensure the economic recovery of  this country. We can do it.    Finally, we need social peace, because economic development  is of itself a good thing, but we need social peace in as far as  whole strata of the people, like young people, women, farmers  try a new path [as heard]. Otherwise, young people [word  indistinct] the future.    [Mariot] What do the people of Togo expect of you today  after  such a long period of difficulties?    [Kodjo] (?First let me say) what I expect of the Togolese  people: That they should have confidence, that they should  mobilize themselves for the work we are going to do in common.    As for what the people expect of me, it is the small  contribution I can make, because in the nature of things, I have  perhaps a small degree of experience in some areas, and I could  put to use this experience and the relationships I have been  able to form here and there to solve the problems that the  Togolese people want to solve.

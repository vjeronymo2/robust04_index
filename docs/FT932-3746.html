			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Even the rich are not entirely insulated from human reality Sir, High Dickenson, Dean of Salisbury, says ('Wealth that's simply gross', May 29-30) that he often feels moral unease when in the company of the rich because '. . .they are insulated from the pain and vulnerability of the bulk of humanity', and they 'cannot bear very much human reality'. Does he really believe that the rich are insulated from the pain of bereavement, of illness, of marital break-up? He describes the rich as 'kindly, witty and urbane'. Does this not suggest that they have had more opportunities to cultivate the higher human sensibilities than those whose lives have been coarsened by deprivation? Has not this cultivation often produced great acts of philanthropy? The dean expresses his approval of a visitor from the Sudan who declined an offer of supper from his hostess after he had been given a substantial lunch on the ground that 'we only eat every other day'. He was 'a vigorous, good and happy man'. Good and happy, perhaps, but no nutritionist would suggest that such a diet is conducive to vigour. Mr Dickenson fails to appreciate that the sense of deprivation a person feels is always relative to his expectations. Someone who has never lived in comfort is likely to miss it less than someone who has experienced it and is then deprived of it by, say, redundancy and bankruptcy.

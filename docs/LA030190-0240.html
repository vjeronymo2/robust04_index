			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCCARTNEY RETURNS TO TOKYO TO PERFORM AFTER 24-YEAR LAPSE  </P> <P> Paul McCartney, in Tokyo to perform for the first time in 24 years, told  reporters today he has no hard feelings about Japan's 1980 decision to bar him  for a drugs offense.  </P> <P> McCartney last visited with the Beatles in 1966.  </P> <P> He was arrested at Tokyo's Narita Airport in January, 1980, after customs  officers found marijuana in his luggage. He was held for nine days before  leaving the country.  </P> <P> Japan normally bans foreigners with drug convictions from re-entering the  country. The Justice Ministry gave McCartney the green light this time because  he had no other convictions in the past 10 years.  </P> <P> Asked today if he has any hesitation in coming back to Japan after the 1980  incident, McCartney said: "I don't have any bad feelings . . . so it's  finished."  </P> <P> "I have four children myself and I ask them to stay straight . . . don't use  any drugs. I gave it up, I don't do it any more," he said.  </P> <P> Organizers of McCartney's six planned concerts here have already sold all the  260,000 tickets available.  </P> <P> McCartney kicked off his world tour in Los Angeles last fall.  </P></p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra Towards the Millennium, the concert series devised for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra by Simon Rattle and the late Michael Vyner, continues on its richly rewarding way in Birmingham, Cardiff and London. The latest instalment in this vast progression through the 20th century was devoted to the year 1912: a convenient peg - since closer links between the works could hardly be traced - on which to hang a superb programme of Schoenberg, Prokofiev and Debussy. Inevitably, the London visitor to Symphony Hall (where on Wednesday I caught the concert) spends much of his listening time revelling in its acoustics, and in the freedom they allow the CBSO to make real music. Already, after nearly a year's residence here, the gain in the players' responsiveness and spontaneity of detail is a cause for simple amazement. The closing performance of Debussy's three Images was a glistening tissue of feather-brushed sounds, of single lines lightly poised, of timbral combinations suspended in air. Rattle has always had a native feeling for Debussy's orchestral ethos, for its precise yet elusive flow of colours and ideas. In their home hall, he and his orchestra have been able to develop this gift steadily; the corporate achievement of these Birmingham Debussyans is now marvellous to behold. There was far less need for orchestral subtlety in the Prokofiev First Piano Concerto, earlier on; yet the accompaniment had a boldness and vitality of colour very seldom equalled. Emanuel Ax was a magisterial soloist, missing only the last degree of wit and wizardry. The first part of the concert was devoted entirely to Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire - the seminal, mould-breaking 1912 masterpiece. Giving it here, with lights down and in semi-staged form, was a brave experiment that failed to come off. The five players from the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group plus Ax as excellently stylish and communicative pianist offered a magically free and fluent account of the score under Rattle's direction; the sound-world, full of wild disturbance yet drily detached, was perfectly evoked. Yet the sheer physical space placed between many of us and the reciter, Elise Ross, robbed the experience of intimacy. The decision to speak the poems in German rather than (as Schoenberg preferred) in the language of the audience is further compromised when the printed words are rendered invisible during performance. Pierrot lunaire should transport its audience through night-worlds of fantasy. This time, in spite of innumerable delicacies and graces in Miss Ross's delivery, the journey never really began.</p>

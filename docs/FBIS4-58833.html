			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A responsible source has denied foreign media  reports, which quote the ASSOCIATED PRESS, that the forces of  the oppressive gang of al-Ahmar have reached the al-Alam area,  30 km from the outskirts of Aden. The source said these claims  were totally untrue. They were the product of the delusory  imaginings of the military gang of the [word indistinct]  al-Ahmar gang, who had succeeded in feeding these false reports  to obfuscate the great defeats inflicted on their forces in  Abyan, Qa'tabah, Radfan, and Kirsh.

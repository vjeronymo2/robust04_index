			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The Forestry Agency on  Friday [7 January] rebuffed complaints by a group of U.S.  senators concerning Japan's policy on forestry product tariffs,  saying that Japan's agreement under the Uruguay Round of market  access talks to cut tariffs on such products by an average 30  percent is in line with its previous agreement with Washington.    American media reports have said U.S. senators including Max  Baucus sent letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa saying that Japan is infringing  on a bilateral agreement to move toward a reciprocal total  abolishment of tariffs on forestry products.    The agreement referred to was one reached in June 1990. The  United States at the time requested that Japan cut tariffs by  more than 33 percent on 51 selected items.    The senators are requesting that the issue be discussed when  Hosokawa visits Clinton in February. But agency officials said  the case is closed with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.</p>

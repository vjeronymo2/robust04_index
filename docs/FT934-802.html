			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / EU cracks whip over enforcing its laws In a legal assault meant to enforce the European Union's single market, the European Community said yesterday it would take member countries to court in 184 cases where they have failed to implement EU legislation, AP-DJ reports from Brussels. The offensive reverses an 11-month truce between the Commission, which is responsible for upholding Community rules, and member states which have been slow to take in Community laws to national legislation. The Commission said it would file the complaints with the European Court of Justice, the Community's highest court, against recalcitrant members. It said it had also decided to open 103 new internal proceedings against the 12 EU governments, and send 709 'reasoned opinions', giving governments two months to bring national laws into line with EU norms. Commission spokesmen refused to give details about where the alleged breaches of legislation have occurred, or even to say which members states were involved. In a statement, however, the Commission said the move illustrates a 'co-operative rather than confrontational' approach towards member countries.</p>

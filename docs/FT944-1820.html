			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Surrealist show-cases - William Packer lifts the lid on the latest exhibition at the Whitechapel gallery We live out our lives with boxes from the cradle to the grave. By whatever they hold, they describe and define what we are and would be, our fears and hopes. We have only to lift the lid, open the box to discover who knows what treasure, or secret, or horror. 'Open the box, OPEN THE BOX]' shrieks the audience in gleeful anticipation. Christmas boxes, chocolate boxes, match boxes, tool boxes, soap boxes, toy boxes, dressing-up boxes, hat boxes, paint boxes, cigar boxes, knife boxes, button boxes, shoe boxes, jewel boxes, pill boxes, make-up boxes, fuse boxes  -we could go on with the list for ever. For boxes mean lists too, and categories and collections - boxes full of sea shells from those far-off beaches of childhood; cabinet drawers full of birds' eggs plucked and blown so carefully in days before ornithological correctness; match boxes full of beetles, spiders, moths and butterflies. There is the remembered feel and rustle of tissue paper and cotton-wool, the pulling open, the unwrapping, the oh so gentle picking up. Boxes also mean the festivals, the games and discoveries of childhood, the presents, the parties, the dressing up, the illicit searchings and adventures through attics and cupboards, dressing-tables and chests-of-drawers. Small wonder then that artists should draw directly upon this common stock of memory and experience. To surrealists in particular, including our latter-day conceptualists, the box has been an obvious and constant theme. There it is, to be taken as it is found, its contents ready-made. Or again it is taken as it is but left unopened, declared by its label only in imaginative possibility. Or yet again the label is the artist's own, and the contents to be taken on trust. Or the contents, as the artist has supplied them, are revealed or hinted at, the box itself become a stage or theatre in miniature, quite literally a show-case. The emphases and combinations are limitless in possibility, and any exhibition of such work, whether brilliantly or indifferently chosen and presented, can hardly fail to be fascinating. Indeed the material is so dense that any particular disappointment may be immediately shrugged off for the treat that follows. This show at Whitechapel, ending a national tour, is true to that form and indeed holds many not just fascinating but beautiful things. Joseph Cornell, with his quietly theatrical and ambiguous narratives, sets the pace, and from Schwitters' flattened cigarette carton, and such as Man Ray, Eileen Agar, Arman, Meret Oppenheim, Louise Nevelson, Jiri Kolar and Martial Raysse, to Earnshaw and Raynaud, surrealism supplies the substance of the show. The upshot is that interest and surprise lie less in the nature of the work than in its particular quality and in the artist who produced it. I was especially intrigued by Avis Newman's little box of snails set in waxed compartments, and delighted to see Fred Stiven's small and mysterious boxed abstractions, self-effacing to a fault, given their proper prominence at last. But all that said, and the works of some of the artists - Cornell, Schwitters, Stiven, Kolar and one or two others - excepted, one cannot but come away feeling just a little let down. For so much of it seems amusing enough, and clever, but also arch and self-conscious, easy and arbitrary, as though anything else would have done just as well. We are back to the tray of birds' eggs and the box of sea shells, and to the drawers and cabinets full of nails and screws and clips and bolts in the old-fashioned ironmonger's shop. Worlds in a Box: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1, until February 12; a National Touring Exhibition from the South Bank, sponsored by British Telecom.</p>

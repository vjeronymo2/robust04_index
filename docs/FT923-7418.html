			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Companies fooled by 'cowboy' copier salesmen SMOOTH-TALKING photocopier salesmen are swooping on smaller companies when senior staff are on holiday and persuading their deputies to sign extortionate contracts which can ruin the business. The Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday that, with the boss lying on a beach, some businesses back home are falling victim to 'cowboy' salesmen pushing contracts with penal costs and conditions. As a result, a number of unsuspecting companies are being forced to close down, unable either to honour or cancel high cost agreements to which they are committed for many years. High-pressure sales techniques in some parts of the photocopier market are well known but complaints from customers, who have found themselves on the wrong end of a salesman's slick patter, have been rising. The Campaign to Clean up Copier Contracts, which represents corporate victims of the photocopier salesmen and is supported by the CBI, backed yesterday's warning. A campaign official said:'Some small businesses have found it easier to fold than to pay the penalties arising from the copier contract.' Companies are not regarded as consumers under the Consumer Credit Act and are, therefore, unable to break contracts they have signed. The campaign also wants churches, schools, charities and other corporate bodies to be given the same protection under the law as individuals and partnerships. It is calling for a mandatory, two-week cooling off period for photocopier contracts and members plan to meet Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, to press for action. The campaign plans to publish a blacklist of companies which ignore the code of practice drawn up by the British Association of Print and Copyshops. Many companies are being caught out by the offer of a 'free' photocopying machine, along with a service agreement which provides for payment at an agreed rate for copies. Only in the small print, however, is it clear that the cost per copy can be very high and can rise by up to 15 per cent during each year of the contract. Ms Judith Vincent, the CBI's head of company law, said yesterday: 'Vigilance is vital if a company wants to avoid such extortion'. She said hundreds of companies have been taken in by the malpractices of part of the photocopying industry. She emphasised that contracts could contain costly extras and last up to nine years, compared with the average three-year lifespan of a photocopying machine.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Tory Euro-sceptics seek to broaden tough stance Mr John Major last night basked in the approval of Conservative MPs as he insisted there was no question of Britain removing its veto on the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as president of the European Commission. His statement came amid clear signs that the Euro-sceptic right of the Tory party is moving to capitalise on the reaction to the veto by insisting the prime minister take a tougher line across a range of European issues. Mr Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite chief secretary to the Treasury, used a speech in Barcelona last night to dismiss fears that Britain might be left behind in Europe's 'slow lane'. If others were going in the wrong direction, the government should be confident in staking out its own position. Other prominent Euro-sceptics said Mr Major had to be be ready to use his veto again if other European governments proposed another 'federalist' candidate for the Commission presidency. Speaking in the House of Commons, the prime minister called for a new slate of candidates to break the deadlock in the European Union. Effectively staking his own premiership on blocking the candidacy of the Belgian prime minister, Mr Major stressed he would not change his stance 'at any stage'. As ministers analysed the outcome of the Corfu summit they were confident that the prospect of an autumn leadership challenge has been greatly diminished. Mr Major had also given himself a freer hand in the impending cabinet reshuffle. To rowdy applause from the Conservative backbenches, Mr Major delivered a thinly-veiled rebuke to the German and French governments for attempting to force the issue at the Corfu summit. Relishing his best performance in the Commons for some time, he told MPs the government wanted Europe to succeed before adding: 'But being a good European does not mean signing up to everything which our partners propose.' Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, struck a discordant note by criticising Mr Major for creating a crisis in the European Union but most pro-European Tory MPs preferred to reserve their anger for private conversations. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim Labour leader, accused Mr Major of putting appeasement of the right wing of the Tory party ahead of Britain's interests. Mr Major refused to speculate on the names of new candidates for the succession to Mr Jacques Delors. But the government believes that Italy, Spain, Belgium and possibly Ireland may be among those adding names to a fresh slate. The prime minister said he was doubtful whether Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, would be a candidate. But he appeared confident that a choice could be made by the time of the proposed emergency summit on July 15. Tories applaud popular Major, Page 10</p>

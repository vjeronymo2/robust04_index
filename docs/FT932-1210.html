			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y administrator resolves US dispute THE administrator of Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property company, has resolved its bitter dispute with creditors of the US subsidiary, enabling the Dollars 5.3bn debt restructuring of the US arm to go ahead. Mr Cyrus Vance, the mediator between the warring US and Canadian branches of O&amp;Y, informed a New York federal bankruptcy judge of an agreement between the two sides, which looks to meet many of the demands of the US creditors. The US subsidiary will answer to a nine-member board, on which will sit Mr John Zuccotti, the head of O&amp;Y (USA), Mr Rob Lowe, the Canadian administrator of O&amp;Y Canada, and seven outsiders. Mr Vance will mediate any disputes over the Canadian parent's right to information on its US unit, in which it owns a 80 per cent stake. The US bankruptcy court will issue its decision on the proposed settlement on July 9. Mr Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman acting for O&amp;Y (USA), said: 'O&amp;Y and its creditors hope to move very quickly to restructure their obligations.' He was optimistic agreement could be obtained that avoided bankruptcy for the US subsidiary. O&amp;Y Developments, the Toronto-based parent, emerged from bankruptcy protection last month, and is run by the court-appointed Mr Lowe, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Secured creditors of the US arm are determined that efforts to have their debt re-paid are not hampered by the Canadian parent's responsibilities to its own creditors, and equity holders. Creditors of the US arm thus backed Mr Zuccotti in his fight for independence from the Canadian parent. The agreement announced yesterday seems closer to the aims of the US creditors, in that the new board is largely independent of its Canadian parent. The seven outside directors will serve three years, and can only be removed with agreement of US and Canadian courts. Mr Lowe had wanted power to fire them. Mr Zuccotti has also won his right to be indemnified from any lawsuits arising from the US unit's debt restructuring.</p>

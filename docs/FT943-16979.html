			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Bloomin' bureaucrats: Japan's unloved, overworked civil servants Just before 8pm, in the heat and humidity of a Tokyo summer evening, a young, grey-suited bureaucrat sits back in his chair in his office on the 15th floor of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, tugs at his grey tie and takes a breath of the stale air around him. Under the ministry's regulations, the air conditioning was turned off at 5.45pm when business officially finished for the day. But for Tatsuya Terasawa, 33, deputy director of the Americas division, work is far from over. As is the case most nights, he will be lucky to make it home on the last train, a little after midnight. More likely, he will take a cab from Kasumigaseki, where Japan's central ministries are concentrated and the cream of its civil servants work, to his flat in suburban Tokyo in the early hours of the morning. Even by Japanese standards, Terasawa's lifestyle is not an enviable one. Yet his devotion is being appreciated less and less. Once seen as the architects of Japan's postwar economic success, the country's 1.2m bureaucrats are increasingly seen by politicians, businessmen and the public as relics of an antiquated order, scheming to protect their authority and privileges at the expense of economic and social progress. Japan's uniquely pervasive web of official regulations, which govern most aspects of life and give the bureaucrats their authority and power, is criticised for stifling entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth. 'Bureaucrats say they don't have money, but they dig up the roads several times a year, build unnecessary dams, luxurious public offices and cultural halls. They are like blinking traffic lights on a deserted road,' complained one letter this week in the Nikkei, Japan's business daily. Outside Japan, US negotiators have blamed the intransigence of Japan's bureaucrats for the failure of the two countries to reach a trade agreement when President Clinton met the then Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa in February. In response to these pressures, the Japanese government is trying to weaken the influence of bureaucrats. On Tuesday, a detailed deregulation package was unveiled identifying a number of regulations, implemented by the denizens of Kasumigaseki, that could be abolished. The package aims to reduce business costs in housing, telecommunications, imports and distribution, and financial markets. Japan's new prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, has promised to continue the previous government's policy of deregulation. The powerful business group, the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, wants the government to go further. It recently asked Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who resigned last week, to halve the number of regulations policed by the bureaucrats of Kasumi-gaseki. The response of Mr Terasawa to this assault sounds almost hurt. 'We must realise that the bureaucracy has its limitations but at the same time it is critical to getting things done,' he says. The belief in his own importance, shared by many of his colleagues, has been bolstered by Japan's political turmoil, which has left the running of the country in the bureaucrats' hands while the politicians have been pre-occupied with political survival. The political vacuum has also strengthened Mr Terasawa's conviction that 'bureaucrats are the ones who make the policy options, who implement policy and, in many cases, determine policy'. He believes the role of politicians should be restricted to making a small number of decisions on controversial issues - such as taxation, opening up Japan's rice market, and national security. But it is such self-assurance that has fuelled much of the criticism of the civil service. 'The problem with Kasumigaseki today is that policy determination and implementation have become muddled together and have hampered administrative efficiency and led to the unnecessary expansion of the bureaucracy,' says Mr Shino Namikawa, secretary general of the Citizen's Forum for Renewal, an organisation set up by the government to make suggestions for administrative reform. Mr Terasawa's defence is that the Japanese bureaucracy is in fact an agent of change in Japanese society. 'Bureaucrats are often described as being like Chinese mandarins. But I think the reality is very different,' he says. Mr Terasawa, who was educated in the US, says the role of Miti is to encourage deregulation and act as a 'catalyst to speed up social change'. That, he says, is a very different attitude from that of the bureaucrats who were running Miti even a few years ago. As a further example of how Japan's bureaucracy is changing and catching the public mood, he cites the latest trade talks with the US. 'My generation does not feel that we have to bow to every wish of the US, but the US has not been able to keep up with this change. They still expect Japan to come to a summit meeting with an omiyage - a gift. That is one reason why the February summit failed to produce an agreement,' Mr Terasawa says. But the flaw in his argument is that the pressure in Japan is not for a civil service prepared to take political decisions - but for one that does not impose a political point of view at all. An elite corps of administrators which believes it has the right to make decisions of national interest and direct every detail of the country's economic and social life no longer seems relevant to a highly educated and well-informed public which increasingly seeks the freedom to make its own choices. It is a message that, if heeded, would force the the Japanese bureaucracy to rethink its raison d'etre. 'The belief that we are doing something good for the public is the source of our pride,' Mr Terasawa says, as he reflects on the modest 1960s flat he calls home and the long hours away from his wife and two chil-dren. The compensations for such self-sacrifice are meagre. As a graduate of the University of Tokyo law department with a second degree from Harvard Business School, he would probably be earning double his current salary if he had gone into banking instead of the civil service. During his two years in Miti's Americas division, dinner has more often than not been a box-meal from a local caterer. 'Unless you have a strong belief that you are doing something for the good of Japan, you won't be able to work under such conditions, he says. 'There just wouldn't be sufficient motivation.'</p>

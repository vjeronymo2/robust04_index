They also stressed during their interrogation in a  police center in Beirut that they received the order to kill  Shaykh Talib during their meeting with the Iraqi charge  d'affaires in Beirut.    According to well-informed sources, the two Iraqi diplomats  will stand trial in Beirut if Iraq agrees to the Lebanese  request to lift their immunity in accordance with the Geneva  convention signed in 1961.

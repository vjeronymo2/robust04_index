			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sylvie Maligorne] </F>   [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur starts a three-day visit to Beijing Thursday [7 April]  determined to revitalize trade after a row over French aircraft  sales Taiwan cost French firms hundreds of millions of dollars  on the Chinese market.    "The goal is to open the door and to ensure that  discrimination (against French companies) is eliminated," an  aide to the prime minister explained.    Authorities here do not expect Balladur to return bearing  fat  contracts. But they do want to see the ice broken.    "In China, as elsewhere, contracts are won by constant  presence and frequent visits," the aide explained. "Nothing can  be done without such an opening."    Forced onto the sidelines for more than a year, during which  the Chinese economy flourished, French exporters are eagerly  awaiting the first fruits of a normalization in Franco-Chinese  relations.    The two countries ended their rift in a joint communique  issued January 12.    China recorded economic growth of 13.5 percent last year,  when imports shot up 27 percent. The surge in buying was worth  nearly 100 billion dollars for foreign companies.    But French firms were in essence ruled out of the  competition  for the lucrative Chinese market after the 1992 sale to Taiwan  of 60 Mirage 2000-5s.    In Canton, where the French consulate was shut down, France  lost a subway contract to Germany. Funds totalling two billion  French francs (340 million dollars) to finance contracts for the  telecommunications group Alcatel-CIT have also been frozen.    Sources here estimated that French companies last year lost  between three and six billion francs (517 million and 1.03  billion dollars) in Chinese contracts.    As a result France recorded a trade deficit with China that  came to 12 billion francs (2.06 billion dollars) in 1993,  against 11 billion francs in 1992.    Before the row over the aircraft sales, France's share of  the  Chinese market came to three percent, a figure that had fallen  to 1.6 percent in 1993. The German share last year was nearly  six percent and the Italian 2.6 percent.    But with normalization of relations French firms should once  again be able to compete in such key sectors as automobiles,  railways, grain, water treatment and construction.    Aides to Balladur stress that China's needs are great,  noting  Chinese energy and telecommunications requirements account for a  quarter of demand in such sectors worldwide.    In addition, they added, China is seen as a reliable payer.</p>

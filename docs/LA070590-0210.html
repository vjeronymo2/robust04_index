			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> IN IRVINE, A 'BREL' TO BE JEALOUS OF  </P> <P> On the strength of just one show -- the musical revue "Jacques Brel Is Alive  and Well and Living in Paris" -- the Backstage Theatre has vaulted to the front  rank of the Orange County theatrical scene.  </P> <P> This heartfelt production possesses such charm, talent and style that it could  be the envy of any small professional company in Los Angeles, Chicago or New  York. Theatergoers in this county are lucky to have it. The show closes  Saturday, so hurry.  </P> <P> As directed by Al Valletta, the superb ensemble -- Tom Hafner, Rowanne Mark,  Bil Barratt and Christie Cooke -- displays a streety, continental flair that is  neither too polished nor too sentimental. They bring an inviting natural  quality to their performances; they don't try to overwhelm their songs with  glib show-biz glitz. And their energy never flags.  </P> <P> "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well . . . " debuted in Greenwich Village a  quarter-century ago and has been revived frequently ever since. Brel, who died  in 1977 at age 49, was a popular Belgian troubadour of the '60s whose clever  songs evoke a variety of moods, from sentimental to satiric, bawdy to bucolic.  </P> <P> The Backstage version of the revue -- a nonstop songfest of 23 Brel tunes -- is  a wonderfully intimate affair, performed on a low stage against a painted  backdrop of pastel pinks and blues depicting the dockside Cafe de la Fontaine  and an adjacent seascape. The only props are a bench, a platform and a handful  of low-tech glitter, abetted by the atmospheric orange glow of the stage  lighting.  </P> <P> The performers sing to taped accompaniment that sounds surprisingly vibrant.  They also wear lapel mikes, which seem unnecessary at such close quarters. But  even in the one instance when vocal amplification is evident, it is  unobtrusive.  </P> <P> What: "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris."  </P> <P> When: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: The Backstage Theatre, 2691 Richter Ave., Suite 105, Irvine.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: San Diego Freeway to Jamboree Road exit, head north to Richter.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: $12.50.  </P> <P> Where to Call: (714) 474-0792.  </P></p>

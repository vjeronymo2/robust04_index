			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMPANIES BILKED OF $680,000;  </P> <P> MAN IN CREDIT SCAM GETS 6-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> A Van Nuys man who bilked scores of companies out of more than $680,000 through  phony credit orders was sentenced Wednesday to six years in federal prison.  </P> <P> Thomas Leonard Balla, who pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud Jan. 9,  was sentenced by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima. The federal probation  department had recommended a five-year sentence, but Tashima said he added 12  months because of Balla's involvement in a highly publicized vice trial in  London. Balla could have received five years for each count.  </P> <P> In the London case, Balla, 24, was accused of running a sophisticated call-girl  ring that employed more than 200 prostitutes in the ritzy Mayfair district.  Balla was arrested in London on Sept. 28, 1987.  </P> <P> British authorities dropped the charges against Balla and four other defendants  June 8 amid allegations, extensively reported in the tabloid press there, that  one of the ring's prostitutes was romantically involved with a veteran Scotland  Yard detective. British prosecutors apparently believed that the publicity had  compromised their case, Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said.  </P> <P> During Wednesday's hearing, Katz cited declarations by women who had said Balla  had hired them as prostitutes in England. The declarations were provided by  British prosecutors. Tashima said they show that Balla's British escort  service, Brookwise Ltd., was really a front for prostitution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bust-Out' Scheme  </P> <P> The U.S. charges against Balla stem from his involvement in a "bust-out" scheme  that he operated in Oxnard and Canoga Park, Katz said. Balla used the good  credit rating of Knolls Vacuum &amp; Sewing, a Long Beach store he purchased in  1984, to order more than $1 million in food, clothing, exercise equipment and  electronic goods, he said.  </P> <P> Balla set up a phony storefront in Oxnard to receive the merchandise, later  resold through two warehouses in Canoga Park, Katz said. Balla was indicted in  the scheme June 4, 1986, but prosecutors believe that he was already in England  by then.  </P> <P> He was extradited from London to Los Angeles on Nov. 22, 1988.  </P> <P> In an agreement with prosecutors, Balla admitted defrauding five companies. But  Katz said authorities believe that 209 companies across the country lost  $686,786 in the scheme. Another 61 companies lost unknown amounts, he said.  </P> <P> Tashima ordered Balla to make restitution to the victims, but Katz said Balla  has no money. "Unless Balla wins the Big Spin, how's he going to pay it?" he  asked.  </P></p>

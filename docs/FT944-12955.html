			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Hot line to Opas - Calls to pension advisory service rise 20% in year Occupational pension schemes got a bad name after the Maxwell affair but, given the excesses employed by personal pension scheme salesmen, the tables have turned. The number of inquiries handled by the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, the free state-assisted scheme to help people resolve their pension problems, rose last year to 30,700 - a 20 per cent rise over 1992. Chief executive Don Hall stressed, however, that more than 28,000 of these were minor enquiries dealt with by a simple explanation. Difficult cases needing detailed examination actually fell by 4 per cent to 2,397 - a tiny fraction of the 20m or so occupational pension scheme members. The most common problem areas were unclear membership conditions, early-leaver benefits, early retirement and scheme wind-ups. In many cases, the problem was caused by complicated language which confused members. Transfers remained the largest single source of complaint. In one case, an employee who was made redundant asked for details of his pension's transfer value. After a delay, his company said it would be worth Pounds 48,000. There was another delay when the employee asked for it to be transferred. He then argued he had incurred investment loss. After Opas intervened, the company agreed it had been at fault and increased the transfer value to Pounds 52,000. Another major problem area is insured schemes - those administered by an insurance company - which tend to be the preserve of small companies. Brian MacMahon, the Opas president, said proposals that smaller company schemes should be regulated less rigorously than larger ones 'does not, in (our) experience, make sense when so many of them are apparently badly run'. Opas can also take enquiries about personal pensions as long as these are not connected with their marketing or sale. And it produces free leaflets designed to answer common problems.

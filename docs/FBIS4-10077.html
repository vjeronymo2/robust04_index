			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Maria Alicia Talavera Sevilla, assistant </F> director of the Presidency's Social Communication Directorate,  in Managua; from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast -- live]    [Text] We want to deny all information disseminated by  cable news agencies from Guadalajara implying that President  Violeta Barrios de Chamorro suffered a fainting spell at noon  today shortly before giving a speech at the Regional Forum on  Women's Participation and Development sponsored by the  Inter-American Development Bank in that Mexican city.    We talked directly with President Chamorro a few minutes ago  as she was about to leave the hospital, excuse me, the Grand  Hyatt Hotel in Guadalajara, where she and the official  delegation accompanying her are staying during their visit to  Mexico. We will now present you -- through Radio Corporacion,  which has so kindly offered us the opportunity -- a brief  statement by President Chamorro. We recorded this a few minutes  ago here at the Social Communications Directorate.    [Begin Chamorro recording] Hello, this is Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro, president of Nicaragua. I would like to deny the news  that has reached Nicaragua -- being sent from this city or  wherever -- that I fainted and am about to die. I have never  fainted in my life, thank God. There has been some confusion.  I was told about this and my blood ran cold. A lady from  Uruguay or Paraguay.... [pauses] Where is this lady from?  Uruguay, I think. Anyway, she was the one who fainted. I do  not know her and I do not know what her condition is now. I  hope she is feeling better because you feel bad when you are  sick.    Personally speaking, I have not fainted. I feel very well.  I will go and represent Nicaragua in a short while. I will  talk about women at the bank's event so....[pauses] I repeat, I  have never fainted in my life. Never, knock on wood. I have  not fainted, I am not in poor health, and I have not given up --  nor have I (?betrayed) my homeland. Please, I want all  Nicaraguans who love Violeta to know I am all right, thank God,  and that I will come home tomorrow. [end recording]    This was a brief statement by Nicaraguan President Violeta  Chamorro, who confirmed that she did not have a fainting spell  as was reported from Guadalajara. She also confirmed her return  to Managua tomorrow. Thank you and good afternoon.</p>

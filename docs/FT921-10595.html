			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Businesses urge more council aid COUNCILS are refusing to invoke a concessionary clause in local-authority finance law that would allow them to waive or reduce rates bills for businesses in difficulty, the Federation of Small Businesses said yesterday. The federation, which has nearly 50,000 members, urged local authorities to exercise a discretion available under section 49 of the Local Government Finance Act of 1988 to help small businesses facing difficulty in paying their rates. According to the Department of the Environment, only Pounds 18,000 of relief was granted in 1990-91, compared with income from the business rate of about Pounds 15bn, the federation said. Mr John Harris, policy chairman at the federation, said: 'Our survey shows how little local authorities value their small business community. With over 200 businesses closing each day it is imperative that this little-known relief is publicised and acted upon.' The federation lobbied hard during the preparation of the local-authority finance legislation for the term 'poverty', which was in the original proposal, to be replaced by 'hardship' to make it easier for businesses to gain relief. 'Now we find that all that was to no avail since nine times out of 10 local authorities have pushed aside all thought of giving the relief,' Mr Harris said. Heseltine optimistic, Page 10</p>

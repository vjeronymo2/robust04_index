			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 20 (AFP)--Israeli and PLO negotiators  Wednesday [20 April] sought an agreement on the return of all  Palestinians deported by Israel since the start of the intifadah  in December 1987, a member of the PLO delegation said.    Muhammad Dahlan, in charge of the prisoner file in the  talks,  said 11 deportees would return to the occupied territories  Thursday, following six self-exiled PLO militants who went back  on Tuesday.    The two sides are negotiating a general amnesty for all  Palestinian militants wanted by Israel, a Palestinian source  said.    Israel has expelled 1,700 Palestinians since the 1967 Middle  East war and more than 450 have been allowed back.    Of the 486 deported since the uprising started in December  1987, 415 were expelled to south Lebanon for a year in December  1992, but have been allowed to return.    Dahlan said Israel had also reaffirmed its commitment to  free  5,000 Palestinian prisoners after the signing of an overall  autonomy accord.    The pledge was in line with an agreement reached last week,  but the PLO Tuesday accused Israel of refusing to set a date for  freeing 1,000 of the prisoners.    Israel's chief negotiator General Amnon Shahaq returned to  the talks Wednesday, after a brief trip to Israel where he  informed Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the progress of the  negotiations.    Peres is due to meet PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest  Thursday and said the agenda would depend on progress in Cairo.    In addition to discussing the return of deportees and  prisoner releases, the two sides were also seeking agreement  Wednesday on water sharing and jurisdiction in the future  autonomous areas of the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.    In the past few days Israel has arrested several hundred  Islamic fundamentalist suspects in a bid to break up the Hamas  network and halt bloodshed.    Security officials said the crackdown would continue in the  coming days and offices used by the Islamic Resistance Movement  Hamas would be closed.    Palestinian sources said nearly 500 had been detained since  last Friday.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal told parliament 362  Palestinians  had been arrested since Monday in the swoop, which follows the  killing of 12 Israelis in suicide bombings by Hamas on April 6  and 13.    Dahlan said Israel had adopted a tougher line following the  attacks.    "The Israelis fear that without a Palestinian authority the  release of detainees will have negative effects on Israeli  security," he said.</p>

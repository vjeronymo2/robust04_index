			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Director General for Armaments Henri Conze </F> by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux; place and date not given: "Henri  Conze: `Increase Productivity by 2 Percent per Year'"]    [Text] [Desaubliaux] On 19 May last year you were appointed  the director general for armaments. What expertise do you bring  to the DGA [General Armaments Directorate]?    [Conze] The DGA is an organization comprising 52,000 people  spread over a good 60 different sites. Its activities are  wide-ranging. Today, its staff is asking questions, sometimes  anxiously. Why should we be surprised at this? The strategic  environment has changed, European unification is making  progress, economic constraints have increased, etc.. The DGA  has an extremely positive balance sheet; the French arms  industry has become number two in the world in terms of quality,  and number three in terms of its turnover. It owes this success  -- even if it is not consolidated -- largely to a particularly  effective dialogue between the armed forces, the DGA, and the  industrial players involved. The challenge we must meet,  without (for pity's sake) breaking the instrument of success, is  to make the organization develop so as to take better account of  the new national, international, and European data.    [Desaubliaux] Is the current period, mid-way between the  1993  general election and the presidential election in 1995, not more  propitious to procrastination than making decisions?    [Conze] For one or two years already, at least at the  European level, the defense industries have been restructuring  operations on a vast scale. Economic and budgetary constraints  are forcing them to do so. Major reorganization is under way,  involving alliances, mergers, and acquisitions. Matra, Thomson,  Giat-Industries, and others have shown the way. Today, the  process is gathering speed. Negotiations have been launched in  the missiles sector, between Matra and British Aerospace, and  between Aerospatiale and DASA [Deutsche Aerospace]. More  reorganization will follow and, in the relatively short term,  other sectors will be involved: terrestrial armaments and, why  not, the Air Force and Navy? This makes it all the more  essential to define a strategy and fix objectives meeting the  real operational needs of our armed forces.    [Desaubliaux] In the context of European cooperation, is it  sufficient to openly proclaim your willingness and determination"    [Conze] If we do not succeed in securing effective economic  cooperation, whole parts of the European arms industry will  vanish. We can no longer do everything alone. This cooperation  must leave the beaten track where, all too often, requirements  were added up, management structures were superimposed, and  national and international decisions were accumulated. What  should we do? The answer must first be left up to the  industrial parties involved. They must reorganize themselves,  then determine "who does what where." The rationalization  procedure must be implemented on an industrial basis and derive  its support from various programs. The path we should follow is  that of transnational industrial cooperation. Our priority  must be to take account of operational requirements. At the  risk of appearing slightly heretical, I would be tempted to ask  not for a law on programs, but a law on requirements.    [Desaubliaux] Let us take the future transport plane, the  FLA  [Future Large Aircraft], as an example.    [Conze] This program is essential for both industry and the  Armed Forces. I hope that it can be reorganized around the  Airbus consortium because of the consortium's know-how, because  of industrial rationality, and also because we must encourage  the development of the European aeronautics industry.  <H5>  Nuclear Sector: Rock Bottom Budget </H5>   [Desaubliaux] Will the programs already launched and new  requirements not prove imperative?    [Conze] If we continue committing the errors made in the  past, there would be a need for a considerable budget increase.  However, is it not be possible to reduce the increase required  through better organization, better relations between the state  and industry, and further developing the dialogue between the  DGA, the Armed Forces, and industrial partners? This is what  the white paper is suggesting. It is also the direction in  which the DGA is reorganizing itself. Changing attitudes and  modernized methods, e.g., by adapting the code for public  procurement contracts or contract regulations, should enable us  to fulfil the main requirements and achieve the key aspects of  the programs, all while keeping within a reasonable budgetary  framework. Increasing productivity by 2 percent each year does  not seem to be an objective that is beyond the bounds of  possibility. If we succeed in this, using a budget which is  stretched to the limit, then we should end up having no need to  resort to any major rethinking.    [Desaubliaux] What about the reform of the Naval  Constructions Directorate (DCN)?    [Conze] Our objective here is to maintain, or even  reinforce,  the role and skills of the French military naval industry in  Europe. We already have centers of excellence for this. I would  add that we have embarked on a first large-scale European  cooperation project, involving the Horizon frigate. This  represents a major challenge. Our wish is to see this project  through to the end, but nothing has been achieved yet at  present. However, the structures of the DCN -- not to mention  its status -- should further be changed.    [Desaubliaux] Various studies have predicted the loss of  110,000 jobs in the defense industry over the next two years.  And yet, you appear to brush aside all talk of dramatic  reforms. Why?    [Conze] We must endeavor to ensure that the necessary  reorganization and restructuring--what has already decided and  what is still to come--does not result in the disappearance of  either large or small companies. Their technological competence  is unique in various domains in Europe. For two years, 1992 and  1993, the arms industry paid a heavy price; representing 5  percent of industrial jobs, it accounted for 25 percent of job  losses in industry. As I said several months ago, I am  convinced that this industry will emerge from the difficulties  it has recently encountered. So I remain optimistic.    [Desaubliaux] In the nuclear sector, are there any urgent  decisions to be made?    [Conze] Modern systems are currently in service. In a few  months' time, the nuclear submarine "Triomphant" will be armed  with the M45 missile. The medium-range air-to-ground missile,  the Hades, has been operational for fewer than 10 years and,  even if it was mothballed, it is also a modern system.  Successors will have to be ready by around 2010 or 2015. So  there is no compelling urgency. The real challenge to be met is  that of maintaining the level of competence, and scientific,  technological, and industrial resources: the competence of the  CEA [Atomic Energy Commission], Aerospatiale, SEP [European  Propulsion Company], SNPE [French National Gunpowder and  Explosives Company], etc. From the national point of view and  perhaps, in the long term, the European one as well.    [Desaubliaux] Will nuclear tests remain essential?    [Conze] Having spent 17 years in the nuclear sector, I can  tell you that each test had a well-defined objective and  fulfilled a well-evaluated need. When the moratorium was agreed  in mid-1992, a series of tests had been prepared. The PALEN  simulation program has been ongoing for several years now. We  can expect a reduction, both in the number of tests carried out,  and in the cost of the nuclear programs. However, its  perfection, which ought to be accelerated, would require the  resumption of tests sooner or later.    [Desaubliaux] Can we economize in the nuclear sector?    [Conze] Funds earmarked for the nuclear sector have dropped  considerably in recent years, by something like 25 percent. We  have now reached rock bottom, if -- in anticipation of a  resurgence of threats, a scenario that we should not shut out of  our minds -- we want to maintain our capacity and, if necessary,  develop new arms. In one of the rare sectors of human  creativity which covers a considerable number of fundamental  disciplines, it is all the more important to set ambitious  targets for the teams involved -- exploratory developments,  demonstration projects -- even if there is no program to be  developed in the immediate future.    [Desaubliaux] Before returning to the DGA, you had said you  were in favor of having a ground-to-ground missile.    [Conze] Faced with certain kinds of threat, there may be  systems more or less well suited to dealing with them. The  ground-to-ground missile has its virtues, otherwise there would  never have been any! In this respect, I am sticking to my  convictions.</p>

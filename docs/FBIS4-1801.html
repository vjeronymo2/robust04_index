			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- An all-army grass-roots  political work forum was held in Beijing today. Addressing the  forum, Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission  [CMC] and director of the General Political Department of the  People's Liberation Army [PLA], emphasized the necessity of  strengthening overall grass-roots construction by firmly taking  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new  period as guidance, and meeting the overall demands put forward  by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin: "Be qualified politically and  competent militarily, have a fine work style, maintain strict  discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support."    The forum was held with the approval of the CMC, whose  leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen have  attached great importance to it by putting forward demands. The  forum's main topic of discussion was to study ways and means to  implement the "Outlines on Grass-Roots Army Building," reissued  by the CMC, so as to enhance the combat effectiveness of  grass-roots party organizations, raise grass-roots cadres'  ability to lead troops, and promote overall improvement in the  grass roots. Cadres in charge of political work in various  major PLA units and the armed police force attended the meeting.    In his speech, Yu Yongbo elaborated Comrade Jiang Zemin's  overall demands in standardizing and guiding grass-roots  construction. He said: These five phrases: "Be qualified  politically and competent militarily, have a fine work style,  maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate  logistical support" were based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thinking on army building in the new period and took into  consideration the realities of doing so. Broadly summing up the  tasks and criteria of army building, these statements fully  reflected the demands and missions of army building in the new  situation and are in complete compliance with the objective law  of grass-roots construction. Standardizing and guiding  grass-roots construction with these "five phrases" is not only a  practical application of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on  army building in respect to grass-roots construction in the new  period, but are also important measures needed for realizing the  great goal of establishing a powerful, modernized, regular  revolutionary army. Armed with this guidance, we should be able  to build a more solid foundation for army building, coordinate  various work, strengthen overall construction, and perform the  basic functions of our army. We must implement these new  "guidelines" with a new attitude and style, and proceed toward  the goals of "qualification, competence, fineness, and  strictness."    Yu Yongbo said: Party committees at company level are the  core of unified leadership and solidarity. Efforts should be  made to improve quality and grass-roots construction, enhance  party spirit and the concept of pioneering among party members;  and to strengthen party committees' ideological and political  leadership and bring into full play the role of fighting force.    Touching on vigorously promoting the fine tradition of unity  between officers and men and enhancing the troop-leading ability  of grass-roots cadres in the new situation, Yu Yongbo  emphasized: Unity between officers and men is the fine tradition  of our army; leaders at various levels, particularly grass-roots  cadres, should correct their basic attitude toward the soldiers  by genuinely understanding and loving them. In improving our  overall troop- leading ability, we should act fairly and  honestly, build a good self-image, and closely integrate strict  control and guidance with patience.    Yu Yongbo demanded leaders at various levels and political  organs strictly adhere to the "guidelines" in guiding  grass-roots construction. He urged them to always keep the  grass roots in mind, constantly think of the soldiers, and look  for new ideas and ways to help solve real grass-roots problems.    Leaders from departments connected with the General Staff  Headquarters and General Logistics Department, including Zhou  Ziyu, Du Tiehuan, Xu Caihou, and Tang Tianbiao, attended the  meeting.</p>

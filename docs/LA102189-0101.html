			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALLOUT FROM TEACHERS' STRIKE  </P> <P> I feel it is worthwhile -- and necessary -- to clarify for the public at least  a few examples of incorrect information which appeared recently in two articles  on the editorial pages ("Sour Fallout From L.A. Teachers' Bonanza," Sept. 15,  written by Supt. Ted Kimbrough and attorney Melanie Lomax from the Compton  Unified School District, and a subsequent letter on the same subject, Sept. 30,  written by United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson).  </P> <P> First, the Kimbrough/Lomax article suggested that teachers have "traditionally"  received limited salary increases which equal the state COLA (cost of living)  percentage, with the inference, perhaps, that teachers should continue to be  satisfied with that during a time of tight finances. Though it cost the Los  Angeles Unified School District nearly $50 million in very distressing budget  reductions for the current year alone to afford the raise we offered to our  teachers and other employees, we are pleased that the recent contract agreement  makes them among the highest paid in the nation.  </P> <P> In fact, for a number of years the "tradition" in Los Angeles has been to offer  higher-than-COLA increases. For the four years prior to the start of the  current three-year contract, the state COLA was 20%. In that same period, our  teachers and other employees averaged 30%. For the past six years including the  present year, the COLA totals 29%, while our district's increases have totaled  46%. Regretfully, it was inevitable that a certain number of teachers in other  local districts would opt for the higher salaries -- and a greater sense of  their own worth to the community -- offered in the Los Angeles district. It  would have been surprising had that not been one of the fallout effects.  </P> <P> We want to assure Compton Unified and other local districts that we will  continue to be very supportive of any efforts to seek supplemental salary funds  from the state to help raise the professional status of their teachers and all  teachers.  </P> <P> Second, despite our new contract with UTLA, which we had hoped would signify a  lessening of the union's gratuitous public diatribes of the past year, it is  very frustrating for us to have to rebut union President Wayne Johnson's  continuing, unabashed misstatements to his union members, parents and the  general public about the district's budget, vehicle fleet and administrative  costs. He apparently believes that merely prefacing an incorrect statement with  "The fact is . . ." will guide the public to his side of an issue, but we feel  an obligation to correct and clarify those misstatements with real facts.  </P> <P>  -- Budget reductions were needed (close to $50 million this year), and were  made by the Board of Education during three months of public hearings.  Furthermore, it is a virtual certainty that more cuts will be needed for next  year's budget, unless the state COLA grows to more than 8% from this year's  4.64%.  </P> <P>  -- Over 40 district officials have turned in their district cars at the  direction of the Board of Education; they now drive their own cars for district  business to and from work. Others who still retain the use of a district  vehicle for district business -- by board approval -- will get "new cars" only  when it no longer becomes cost effective to maintain their present used cars.  Officials car-pool to required meetings whenever possible, either in their own  cars, in assigned cars or in fleet pool vehicles. I would appreciate it if  Johnson could provide a list of the 50 administrators he claims "are provided  chauffeurs' services, some full time." In truth, a small number of district  personnel use -- on an infrequent basis -- the services of a district driver.  Even the superintendent gave up the full-time services of a driver/bodyguard  and now uses a rotating group of school district police on an as-needed basis.  </P> <P>  -- The administrative staff that Johnson calls "outrageous, bloated and  overpaid" is the same central office and region office administrative staff  that comprises only 4.4% of the district's overall budget, one of the lowest  percentages for administrative costs of any school district in Los Angeles  County or anywhere in California.  </P> <P> Rather than having to spend time answering allegations and fallacious  statements, it would be better for all if we could spend our limited time  resolving the actual and critical problems and issues facing all of us.  </P> <P> ROBERT BOOKER  </P> <P> Chief Business and Financial Officer  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified School District  </P></p>

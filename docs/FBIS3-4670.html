Mohan and Ouk Kimseng: "Arbitration System </F> To Be Established Soon for Trade Disputes"]    [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Ministry of Justice is studying  the possibility of establishing an arbitration system here to  tackle trade and commercial disputes. This is a concerted  attempt to give confidence to businesses dealing with trading,  especially international businesses and contracts.    Senior Minister Chem Snguon, in a wide ranging exclusive  interview with The Cambodia Times, said: "This arbitration  court and system must be adopted soon. Concerning the Ministry  of Justice, we want only to give confidence to investors and  businesses dealing with this country to show that if there is  any conflict, they could rely on the local justice. That is why  the arbitration system must be adopted very quickly. Contrary to  common notion, the courts here in the city have heard several  commercial cases pertaining to contracts and international  investments and judgement has already been given."    "Our courts are competent to judge all conflicts arising  from  contractual disputes from commercial courts," said Chem Snguon,  who is also the Minister of Justice. "The Ministry of Justice  would like to introduce the system of arbitration to hear  contractual disputes. In this respect, I would like to study  the problems arising from the establishment of such systems  elsewhere in neighbouring countries, so that the system when  established and enforced here will be coherent and effective,"  he pointed out.    "In the field of commerce and economics, the Justice  Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance and Trade, is  looking into the possibility of adopting the common law system."    Chem added that the judicial field in this country was  presently based on the French judicial system. "The Ministry is  now studying the common law way of procedures to see how we can  borrow some elements and possibilities which could help us solve  all the cases more quickly and efficiently."    "We have requested the assistance of UNDP [United Nations  Development Program] to provide expertise on the common law  system to help improve the system. There has been a court in  existence in all the provinces since 1982. There are a total of  21 courts at the provincial level, one Appeals Court, one  Supreme Court and one Military Court," Chem said.    "The Ministry of Justice and the judicial system here does  not have enough means to face all the cases we receive.  Nevertheless, we are striving hard to revive the judicial  system to a level which will enable our task (to be carried out)  efficiently, quickly and independently. It is the responsibility  of the Ministry of Justice to reorganise all judicial systems in  this nation to guarantee independence of Cambodian courts,  judges, prosecutors and magistrates. The Ministry of Justice  must give priority to legal formation and jurisdiction formation  to have more judges and prosecutors at all levels and at all  areas. We aspire to have between three to five judges per court  and two to four prosecutors."</p>

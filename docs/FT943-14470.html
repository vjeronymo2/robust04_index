			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Jobs and prices figures boost confidence A further fall in unemployment and slightly lower than expected inflation last month confirmed recent signs that the UK economy is maintaining steady growth while keeping prices under control. The subdued inflation numbers yesterday boosted confidence in the London equity market, as an imminent increase in short-term interest rates appeared less likely. The FT-SE 100 Index climbed back over 3,000, finishing 41.4 higher at 3,005.3. The retail prices index was unchanged in June, leaving the annual rate at 2.6 per cent, the same as in May, the Central Statistical Office said. Underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, fell slightly to 2.4 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in May. The fall brings underlying inflation back down into the lower half of the government's target range of 1-4 per cent. Reductions in the prices of second-hand cars and personal articles, such as spectacles, were offset by rises in beer prices and bus fares. Prices of seasonal food and clothing (due to the summer sales) also fell, but by less than they did in June 1993. Fears that wage increases would feed through into price rises later in the year were eased by figures from the Department of Employment, which showed that the annual growth rate in average earnings was 3.75 per cent in May, the same as in April. City bonuses pushed the annual growth rate of earnings up to 4 per cent in March, but the effect of those payments has gradually dropped out of the underlying number, which is based on a three-month average. May's underlying figure excludes a one-off payment in the coal and coke industries which pushed the seasonally adjusted rate up to 4.3 per cent, from 3.6 per cent in April. Unemployment, as measured by people claiming benefits, fell for the fifth consecutive month by a seasonally adjusted 18,800 in June, to stand at 2.64m, or 9.4 per cent of the workforce. However, these figures were greeted with scepticism by opposition politicians and union leaders who claimed that declining unemployment reflected falling participation in the labour market, rather than jobs growth. These doubts were echoed by analysts in the City, who said the 148,000 fall in unemployment since January did not appear to be matched by a corresponding growth in employment. Although manufacturing employment grew by 2,000 in May, hours worked in manufacturing fell to the lowest level for over a decade. Details, Page 10 See Lex</p>

These bonds will be offered to creditor  banks as guarantees during the exchange of old foreign debt  bonds for new ones with better repayment conditions. Cardoso  said Brazil is prepared to produce the necessary bonds to  guarantee an agreement with creditor banks on 15 April.    William Rhodes, president of the Creditor Banks Advisory  Committee and Citibank vice president, said at the end of his  meeting with the minister that he will consult with the  committee today, seeking to waive a clause in the agreement  requiring the purchase of those bonds directly from the U.S.  Treasury. He will also seek to do away with the requirement of  an IMF stand-by agreement for the purchase of those bonds.    In a note distributed after the meeting, Rhodes said: "We  are  consulting with the committee seeking the approval of the  necessary exemptions (waivers) in order to put together a  package to finance the foreign debt on 15 April, as agreed. I  trust tomorrow afternoon (today) at the latest, the committee  will be ready to recommend the approval of the waivers to the  international financial community."    Standing next to the minister in the Intercontinental  Hotel's  lobby, Rhodes said: "I trust the committee will maintain the  agreement to renegotiate the debt." The minister admitted that  the country has purchased, is purchasing, and will continue to  purchase bonds to shore up the negotiations.</p>

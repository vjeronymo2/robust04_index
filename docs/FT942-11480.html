			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nordbanken extends recovery Nordbanken, one of Sweden's biggest banks, yesterday announced a SKr1.15bn (Dollars 146m) operating profit for the first quarter, consolidating a recovery from the crisis which saw it collapse into state hands in 1992. The result includes a tripling of the bank's own profit to SKr909m from SKr304m, and a first-time contribution from Gota Bank, another state-owned bank which Nordbanken acquired at the start of the year. The government aims to privatise Nordbanken next year to recoup some of the SKr80bn worth of support which it provided to both Nordbanken and Gota Bank during Sweden's financial sector crisis. Most of the bad loans in both groups were hived off into Securum and Retriva, separate 'bad banks', which has facilitated the strong recovery in their performance. A reduction in credit losses to SKr567m from SKr1.35bn was the main reason for the bank's improved performance during the quarter. It also benefited from higher net interest income, due to the lower cost of financing problem loans. This helped to compensate for a 3 per cent fall in lending and lower margins. Problem loans totalled SKr7.6bn at the end of the quarter, down 2 per cent from the year-end. The bank expects full-year profits to be higher than last year's SKr2.7bn.</p>

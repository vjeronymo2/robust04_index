			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: BES hits a snag The dangers of property investment are highlighted this week in a letter received by 3,900 investors in Johnson Fry's SCAT (Smaller Company Assured Tenancy) business expansion scheme. The BES gave investors generous tax breaks for investment in private rented accommodation. Johnson Fry was the largest BES sponsor, and its SCAT scheme carried the added attraction of insurance, provided by Eagle Star, against a fall in the value of the property. The investors went into the scheme in spring 1989 - just before the property market collapsed. Johnson Fry estimates that the value of the fund's property has fallen by about 25 per cent. But investors were covered only for a drop in the property's cost and not for their full investment, of which 10 per cent went into expenses. Many investors now are keen to take the insurance and get out, but they cannot do so until the properties are all sold. The prospectus says disposals can take place between years four and six (1993-1995) but the insurance policy document, which the investors, would not have seen, gives March 1996 as the deadline. Investors had to borrow their Pounds 10,000 investment to receive tax relief of up to 40 per cent. Interest on the loans, provided by the Bank of Scotland has been at 2 percentage points above base rates - 13 per cent at the time - but subject to an 8.5 per cent minimum. Those in a hurry to get out will soon be offered an escape route to cut their losses with a limited offer from Eagle Star of about 84p for their shares, leaving them to make up the shortfall on the loan. Others can choose to hang on if Johnson Fry agrees some sort of claim settlement with Eagle Star on a basis which will allow any future rise in property prices to benefit investors.</p>

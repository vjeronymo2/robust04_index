			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 Jan (PL) -- At the closing session of the  Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting today, Cuban  President Fidel Castro said neoliberalism is undermining the  independence of the countries in which it is applied.    The formal independence we still have is being taken away  and  even the term is outdated, he said.    The president warned that all of this is neoliberalism, a  conflict of interests among huge economic blocs because it is a  policy that will be applied worldwide.    Any country that wishes to industrialize still has, perhaps,  the hope of acquiring industries that pollute the environment or  require lots of cheap labor, he said.    The head of state said it is unfair to make an ant compete  and fight with an elephant, and he noted that developed nations  have the monopoly on advanced technology, scientific research,  and production automation.    The Cuban president asked: The Third World asked for border  openings and a lifting of tariffs, but what did it get? They  want to buy everything in our countries, he warned. They want to  be the owners of the principal industries, with which they would  undermine our independence, not only in a real and objective  manner but also in a formal manner.    With the disappearance of the socialist bloc, the balance of  forces in the world was lost, he said.    Unipolar power is invading all fields, he said. They want us  to see what interests them through the use of advertisements and  commercials. They control newscasts through the use of  multinational news programs, he said.    They do not advertise Superbarrio (popular Mexican character  present at the meeting) but Superman, he said.    As for the application of neoliberal policies in the former  USSR and East Europe, Fidel Castro said it has created a real  disaster and people are starting to realize it was a real  mistake to brutally apply IMF and World Bank recipes there.    Social deterioration and increased unemployment have led to  the rise of strong nationalist feelings and all kinds of  reactions of the desperate people of the former USSR, according  to the Cuban president, who said not everything was deficient in  that economy.    In another part of his speech and in response to a  participant's proposal to demand the democratization of the  United Nations and the Security Council, Fidel Castro said this  UN organization should have at least two Latin American and two  African members while India deserves its own seat because of its  size and population.    Perhaps it would be unrealistic to ask at this time for the  disappearance of the veto but, in principle, we oppose the  Security Council members' veto rights.    As for the event ending today after four days of sessions,  the top Cuban leader said he was impressed with the unity shown,  especially with regard to neoliberalism, despite the wide range  of political and social tendencies represented in the more than  1,000 participants present in the event.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: VEGAS  </P> <P> Sinatra Changes Tune: Frank Sinatra says he changed his mind about crossing the  picket line at Bally's in Las Vegas and has canceled a six-day engagement  because there may be a settlement soon in a musicians strike. Sinatra had  planned to open Dec. 4 as scheduled because of the holiday season, even though  his son and musical director, Frank Sinatra Jr., has been acting as a  go-between for the casinos and the musicians, who are striking five casinos to  protest the use of taped music in showrooms. "I am informed that a settlement  of the strike is possible before the holidays," Sinatra said in a statement  issued Wednesday. "If such is the case, I do not want to jeopardize these  conversations and am deferring my decision to perform in Las Vegas at the  moment. Leave the fighting to (Roberto) Duran and (Sugar Ray) Leonard." CLAUDIA  PUIG  </P></p>

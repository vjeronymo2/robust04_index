			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS LACKS EXPERTISE TO OPERATE LOCKHEED  </P> <P> I am concerned about Harold C. Simmons' intentions to acquire large blocks of  Lockheed stock.  </P> <P> Simmons has no experience in managing a high-tech organization such as  Lockheed. If he intends to run Lockheed, this is a risky way to obtain  on-the-job training.  </P> <P> Simmons' expertise is gaining control of a corporation, then breaking it up and  selling it off piece by piece to make a profit. The United States cannot afford  to have Lockheed broken up. Lockheed is a national asset.  </P> <P> R. G. FULLER  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

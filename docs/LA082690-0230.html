			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW;  </P> <P> NADINE GORDIMER;  </P> <P> TRYING TO CHANGE SOUTH AFRICA WITH POWER OF WRITTEN WORDS  </P> <P> It has been 40 years since the white Parliament passed the infamous laws  creating "grand apartheid." During that same year, the New Yorker published a  short story by an unknown 26-year-old South African.  </P> <P> That story launched a writing career that has reached a vast international  reading audience, angered successive white South African governments and earned  the author regular mention as a leading candidate for the Nobel Prize for  Literature.  </P> <P> Through a body of work that includes such novels as "Burger's Daughter" and  "July's People," and the short-story collection "Six Feet of the Country,"  Nadine Gordimer has painted a subtle, yet powerful portrait of the effect of  apartheid on the people who live in South Africa.  </P> <P> Gordimer, 66, still writes regularly on her manual Hermes typewriter, working  in a study of the suburban Johannesburg home she shares with her husband, an  art gallery owner. Her 17th book, a novel called "My Son's Story," is due out  this fall. She spends more time these days encouraging young artists through  the Congress of South African Writers, a mostly black organization of 5,000  writers that she co-founded in 1987.  </P> <P> She is a small, gray-haired woman, only 5 foot 1 and 90 pounds, and a picture  of solemn concentration as she talks about her work and her life, even as the  family German pointer snores peacefully at her side. Playwright Athol Fugard  calls her "fiercely uncompromising, uncomfortably uncompromising for a lot of  people."  </P> <P> Her country has changed radically in a matter of months this year and, for the  first time, Gordimer says she has begun to feel more at home in this nation  that has been her lifelong home.  </P> <P> The African National Congress is legal again, after 30 years of waging a  guerrilla war from exile. Nelson Mandela, the man Gordimer considers her  political leader, is free and meets with President Frederik W. de Klerk. And  hardly a week goes by that Gordimer doesn't greet an old friend who has  returned from exile to rejoin the legal political process.  </P> <P> Gordimer joined the ANC the other day with her usual sense of quiet purpose.  She walked into a building near downtown Johannesburg, feeling a special warmth  in the rooms where she and her friends once met secretly. Then she filled out a  single-page form, pulled 12 rand (about $5) from her pocketbook and became a  card-carrying member.  </P> <P> It was the kind of simple scene that she might have used for one of her own  characters: the life-affirming act of a novelist who sees the future of which  she dreamed coming true.  </P> <P> "I had waited a very long time. It was really quite moving," Gordimer said the  next day. "I had been in and out of that office for years. It was such a nice,  familiar place for this kind of commitment to happen."  </P> <P> Question: Must a writer in South Africa today be politically active?  </P> <P> Answer: I'm not by nature a political person at all. In the early '60s, I  couldn't even get up on a platform and express an opinion about literature . .  . . I was petrified. And I think if I had lived in another country, I would  have remained like that . . . .  </P> <P> My whole lifetime here, there has been this enormous struggle coming toward the  climax it reached in the past decade or so. And to stand aside from that and  say, "No, I'm not going to pass an opinion on detentions. I'm not going to take  part in any type of protest against what happens here. I'm not going to speak  about anything." Whether this is out of reticence or out of fear of the danger,  I don't think you can work here. I don't think you have a right to.  </P> <P> Q: What is the burden of a white person, and particularly a white artist, in  South Africa?  </P> <P> A: If you're a writer, you really need to be left alone. So the burden is that  you really can't be left alone. Whatever you do here, even if you just belong  to a writers' organization, it's all intensely politicized because culture is  intensely politicized . . . . It is a burden. I feel ashamed saying so, because  then you look at other people who really sacrifice all kinds of personal  fulfillment in order to bring about change.  </P> <P> Q: Is art itself a way to bring about change then?  </P> <P> A: That's a delicate matter. All literature is . . . trying to make sense of  life . . . . And if there's any honesty in a writer at all, any self-searching  in your society, it's going to be a (social) critique . . . .  </P> <P> You get involved in your society. You cannot just be a writer. You have to be a  citizen as well. But I think it's terribly important not to become a  propagandist, even for the cause that you believe in most. If you're going to  produce anything worthwhile, you must retain the freedom to write about that  society, warts and all . . . .  </P> <P> This does not mean you have to say you have . . . an "evenhanded" approach. I  don't think, in a society like ours, if you're honest and have any moral sense  at all or any decency, you can look at apartheid . . . in an evenhanded way. If  there's anything I am absolutely sure about in my life, it is that racism is  evil . . . . Nobody can defend it. It's pure evil. Therefore, how can you have  an evenhanded view of people who practice racism against those who try to  abolish it. So I think you keep your principles -- more than your principles,  you keep your strong passionate convictions -- about what is wrong. But in your  writing you must be free to show that even those who have passionate  convictions have human faults.  </P> <P> Q: Have writers had any influence on South African society?  </P> <P> A: I think South African fiction writers have had some influence . . . . But  one must be modest about it. In how many countries do writers have any real  influence? You now have this extraordinary happening in that (Vaclav) Havel is  president of a country. But . . . it's very rare. In most countries,  intellectuals have no influence whatever on governments . . . .  </P> <P> I think we have helped in the struggle to the extent that we have been able to  express the unspoken resentments, frustrations, fears, hates, loves of South  Africans, who because of the kind of climate of intimidation here have feared  to say these things openly . . . .  </P> <P> And maybe some whites have been stirred by our writings to examine their own  lives and have doubts about the way they've been acting. But . . . it's a small  influence.  </P> <P> But abroad, I think we have done quite a lot, because . . . in scenes of  violence on a TV screen or in a newspaper report, people's lives are shown at  that point. You don't know what happened before or what goes on afterward.  Whereas in a novel, in stories, you have a deeper view of people's lives. You  see what happened after the riot, what happened after they went home, what  happened to the parents when the child fled the country, went to Swaziland and  they didn't hear of their child for two or three years . . . . All these things  are the result of apartheid and what it does to people here. But you can't see  them in a newscast.  </P> <P> So I think those of us who are read overseas have really had the opportunity to  show the people more of a totality of what apartheid means in human terms.  </P> <P> Q: What's your feeling about the changes occurring inside South Africa today?  What do they mean for blacks in South Africa and why are they, as many say, not  enough?  </P> <P> A: Of course they're not enough. Now, one cannot say that the unbanning of the  liberation movements is insignificant. It was an enormous thing. I heard about  it . . . . I'll never forget the morning. . . . My two comrades in COSAW  (Congress of South African Writers) and I had been out . . . in Soweto.  </P> <P> . . . . We went to the room where Raks Seakgwa (COSAW regional organizer)  lives. He has an enormous TV, which I haven't got. So we sat in his room there  and watched . . . the speech. It was extraordinary because Raks spent five  years on Robben Island (prison). And the other young man, . . . as recently as  1988, spent a year in solitary confinement in detention. And they're such  extraordinary young men because they seemed to have no bitterness; they  accepted it as their part in the struggle for freedom . . . .  </P> <P> So . . . to hear the unbanning of the ANC . . . was for me extraordinary -- and  very humbling. They were absolutely bowled over. They couldn't believe it. So  you can't say that this is nothing.  </P> <P> (But) now all the awful things are happening. You see (President Frederik W.)  de Klerk maneuvering toward a new dispensation here with, from the point of  view of many white people, the most extraordinary concessions to black majority  rule. But I don't think they quite realized what this would bring about,  because it's brought about the resurgence of white Afrikaner fanaticism, racist  fanaticism . . . . (This is) something that dampens one's euphoria . . . .  </P> <P> But to look on the good side, the level at which Nelson Mandela and his group  have been received in the outside world is something that, of course, should  have happened long, long ago. When you think how many years the ANC was totally  ignored by the West, I think it's terribly important that the West should give  full support to Mandela and the ANC . . . .  </P> <P> Q: How has Mandela changed the attitudes of whites?  </P> <P> A: There's something about the charisma of Mandela. Everybody fell in love with  Mandela. (They said:) "If we have to have a black man, let it be Mandela." But  what they have to realize is what he's said time and time again -- that he's  not a savior standing alone. If you accept Mandela and respect Mandela, then  you must accept the African National Congress . . . whether you like it or not.  And I think that's a move that still has to be made among whites.  </P> <P> Q: What were your feelings about joining the ANC?  </P> <P> A: It's the first time in my life I've ever belonged to a political party. I  think it's very important that whites who subscribe to the idea of a non-racial  future for South Africa should become signed-up members of the ANC.  </P> <P> Q: Do you think De Klerk is serious about reform?  </P> <P> A: His record isn't very good. He was on the right wing of the Botha  government. But I think he's a very intelligent man. He's proving that every  day. You listen to his speeches and you see how he deals with things. He's  highly intelligent, and he seems to be a worldly man. And God knows we haven't  seen many worldly men among the Afrikaner presidents.  </P> <P> I think he's just seen what I like to call the forces of history . . . . I  think he's realized that this country cannot carry on the way it was. Of  course, they will try desperately to hang onto (giving) whites . . . the final  word in everything, and this is something we have to push against all the time  . . . .  </P> <P> Q: Does the suggestion that there are political divisions among blacks in South  Africa, and even within the ANC, worry you?  </P> <P> A: Why should the world expect there to be absolute unity in the black  population? Where else is there? . . . . It will be the same as it is  everywhere else in the world. There's no unity in the Labor Party in Britain,  no real unity among the Republicans or among the Democrats in the United  States. And obviously if you're going to have a multiparty democracy, you're  going to have that here . . . .  </P> <P> Q: Some artists worry that the ANC is not committed to freedom of expression.  What will happen to artistic freedom under a black-ruled government in South  Africa?  </P> <P> A: No one can guarantee anything. Are we going to have a ministry of culture?  In one way, I want that, because it could encourage young artists. If you have  a ministry of culture, then there's government money to spend on the arts. But  one always fears if you have a ministry of culture then decisions about what is  culture will be made at the ministerial level.  </P> <P> The general feeling, in the ANC and elsewhere, is that we've had enough of  censorship and want to have complete freedom in the arts and freedom to  re-examine anything in our own lives and our own society -- anything at all . .  . .  </P> <P> Q: What do you think the future holds for South Africa?  </P> <P> A: I'm inclined to be optimistic, based on a lifetime of knowledge of the  character of blacks in South Africa . . . . But through all the terrible years  of the struggle and the repression, so many terrible things have happened.  </P> <P> I think it distorts people's character. It certainly brought about a tolerance  of violence, and a feeling that violence is part of our ordinary lives. It's a  danger . . . . There are these constant distortions of people's normal feelings  and reactions . . . . There seems to be no end to the horrors that this policy  can bring about.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there are so many encouraging signs within this awful  matrix. So many people -- black and white -- working together . . . . These  things are happening, but they tend to be overshadowed by the horrors.  </P> <P> Q: For you, how is life today different from a year ago or even 30 years ago?  </P> <P> A: . . . . I really feel -- and this is truly a novelty in my adult life --  that there is something I can openly identify with. I feel so grateful that I'm  still here. That at least I've stayed to see the changes that have come about.  </P> <P> I must keep reminding myself that in terms of the law, almost nothing has  happened. But the fact is the liberation movements have been unbanned, the fact  is that Mandela and the others are now people whose opinions matter a great  deal in national life, at all levels . . . .  </P> <P> It's difficult for Americans to understand how you could live your whole life  without belonging to a political structure, without saying I'm a Democrat or  I'm a Republican. Truly, people like myself have always felt that there was  nothing here we could officially belong to. You were always on the side of the  forbidden.  </P> <P> Q: How have the distortions brought on by apartheid been reflected in your art,  and in the art of South Africa?  </P> <P> A: It has provided a tremendous pressure, obviously. But it's in the nature of  art to resist those pressures. This is true of everybody who practices in the  arts in this country. It doesn't really matter whether they are black or white  or what they are. The distortions are there (but) I think that art exposes  them. If art doesn't expose them, if it just gives in to them, then it loses  its validity as art.  </P></p>

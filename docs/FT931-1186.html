			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome worries Worries that the pace of earnings growth at Wellcome, one of the UK market's most highly-rated companies, could be slowing, alarmed the stock market and drove the shares down by more than 8 per cent. The growth rate concerns emerged following the post-results meeting with analysts. Earlier Wellcome reported interim profits up from Pounds 204.7m to Pounds 324.6m but a slightly disappointing interim dividend. Pharmaceuticals specialists said there were indications at the analysts' meeting that the company's long term growth rates could be slowing down. 'If Wellcome is unable to maintain the high rate of earnings expansion, then the impact on the price earnings ratio can and will be dramatic,' said a London-based analyst at one of the leading US investment banks. And at least one of the top London securities houses was said to have adopted an aggressively bearish stance on the shares, because of slowing margin growth, taking the view that the stock price could easily fall below the 800p mark. At the day's worst, Wellcome shares fell to 807p, but they later stabilised to close a net 72 down at 818p. Turnover in the stock expanded rapidly during the session, reaching 8.7m by the close.</p>

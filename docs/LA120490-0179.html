			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NBC REBOUNDS TO WIN THE RATINGS RACE;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: 'CHEERS' AND A STRONG SHOWING BY THE 'DECORATION DAY' SPECIAL LEAD  THE NETWORK BACK FROM A NO. 2 SHOWING THE PREVIOUS WEEK.  </P> <P> It was only a repeat, but "Cheers" led a six-show attack that restored NBC to  the top of the ratings race last week, it was reported today.  </P> <P> After a No. 2 showing during Thanksgiving week, NBC surged back with a lineup  that included the top-rated "Cheers," the Hallmark Hall of Fame production  "Decoration Day," "The Cosby Show," "Different World," "Empty Nest" and  "Matlock" -- all in the top 10.  </P> <P> CBS's "60 Minutes" was a strong second in the ratings, and the network's  weighed in with two more top-10 shows, "Murder, She Wrote" and "Murphy Brown."  ABC's only entry among the top 10 was "Roseanne."  </P> <P> It was the eighth week out of the 11-week-old season that NBC has led the pack.  CBS won the premier and World Series weeks and ABC won Thanksgiving week.  </P> <P> The No. 7 showing by "Decoration Day," with a 17.9 rating and a 28 share, gave  NBC the victory in the Sunday night movie war, easily outdistancing CBS's  "Fatal Image," which tied for 30th place with a 14.1 rating and a 22 share, and  ABC's "Commando," which was in 40th place with a 13.3 rating and a 20 share.  </P> <P> The fisticuffs between Fox's "The Simpsons" and "The Cosby Show" went to NBC,  at least in part because "Cosby" (fifth place) was an all-new show, while  "Simpsons" (45th place) was a rerun of the season opener.  </P> <P> Among new shows, CBS's "Evening Shade" with a 14.0 rating and a 22 share, was  in 33rd place, overtaking NBC's "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," in 38th place with a  13.6 rating and in a 21 share. The two shows were a virtual dead heat the  previous week.  </P> <P> NBC's score for the week was a 13.1 rating and a 21 share, ahead of ABC's 12.4  rating and 20 share and CBS's 12.3 and 20 share. ABC, which was first the  previous week, dropped from a whopping 13.4 rating and a 23 share.  </P> <P> In the 11-week-old season-to-date statistics, NBC maintains its lead with a  13.2 rating and 22 share, while ABC has moved into second with a 12.7 rating  and a 21 share. CBS is just behind, with a 12.6 rating and a 21 share.  </P> <P> Night-by-night competition saw NBC win Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, while  ABC took Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and CBS captured Sunday.  </P> <P> THE TOP 10 The top 10 programs for the week ending Sunday, according to the  </P> <P> A.C.

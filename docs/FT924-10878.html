			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Health warning on single market: Sutherland warns subsidiarity must not go too far EC MEMBER states and the European Commission were yesterday considering how best to act on suggestions by a high-level working group about the implementation of the single European market. The committee - headed by Mr Peter Sutherland, the former competition commissioner - says in its report that the time has come to realise the practical benefits of the single market. In Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Sutherland warned that the principle of subsidiarity - taking decisions at the lowest appropriate level in the EC - should not be stretched so far as to undermine the single market. The European Commission should retain a 'significant' measure of responsibility for ensuring a level playing field, he said. The six-person Sutherland committee recommends the establishment of a 'permanent framework' for contacts between different national authorities dealing with the application of single market rules. That solution was welcomed yesterday by Commission, member states and interest groups as a way of avoiding heavy-handed centralised monitoring of the single market. But Mr Jim Murray, director of Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, voiced general fears that the looser co-operative system which Mr Sutherland proposes will be undermined if member states begin to put their own interests above those of the Community. 'There's got to be a very clear acceptance that there's a Community interest in all this and it's not just an inter-governmental idea,' he said. Senior Commission officials responsible for the internal market stressed yesterday that if confidence between member states broke down, Brussels would still have to step in. 'When it comes to such conflicts over enforcement the Commission must be there to act as an arbiter if member states are not willing to co-operate,' said one official. The Commission argues that many of the committee's proposals run in the same direction as current practice in Brussels. The report says, for example, that greater consultation should take place before and after legislation emerges, and that EC citizens should be given more information about the benefits of the market. Both are issues which the Commission is already examining, although officials admit that the Sutherland report would push the Commission 'in a faster and more decisive way'. Mr Sutherland also emphasised yesterday that much of the burden for communicating and implementing the benefits of the single market would lie with member states. National courts and the legal profession - which could handle basic complaints involving cross-border transactions - were woefully backward in their knowledge and application of EC law, he said. A more fundamental concern is that member states will not act on the committee's 'practical guide to the solution of a set of practical problems' before January 1, 1993, when the barrier-free market is supposed to come into force. As Mr Murray says 'there's no way this will be in place before January 1, or any time within stalking distance of that date'. Britain will try to press its EC partners for swift action. It has made practical implementation of the barrier-free European market a particular theme of its presidency of the EC, which will expire as the market is born on December 31. But although the report stresses that few of the proposals require legislative action, the timetable is still extremely tight. British officials are hoping that political resolutions agreed at the November 10 internal market council will 'start the process', which may be given further impetus by EC leaders at the Edinburgh summit a month later. A short delay may not matter, because many elements of the single market will not be in place on January 1, whatever the symbolic significance of the date. In addition, if the Sutherland committee's suggestions are implemented, then their success will only be measured later, by the extent to which business and consumers demonstrate their belief in the single market. Mr Sutherland and his committee are adamant, however, that if their suggestions are ignored and EC citizens' attempts to trade and move across borders are blocked or disappointed, then the Commission and member states' best legislative efforts will have been in vain.</p>

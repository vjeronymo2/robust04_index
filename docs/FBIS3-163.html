The troops are accompanied by UN military  observers.    In a communique, Gen. Inienger stated that the various  factions expressed the will to withdraw from the frontlines as  of today. "I approved this decision and ordered the ECOMOG  troops to be deployed immediately in those regions," he  explained. This initiative constitutes "a great stride toward  peace," the ECOMOG commander commented. He specified that 1,700  Ugandan and Tanzanian soldiers would be positioned in the  country's northeastern regions under the control of the National  Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main armed faction.    Concerning the deployment of the other contingents, sources  close to the ECOMOG indicate that the Nigerians would be  dispatched to the country's southeastern areas where an armed  militia, the Liberian Peace Council, has been trying since  September 1993 to be established much to the detriment of the  NPFL. The Ghanaians will be dispatched to western and  northwestern regions which are dominated by the United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia, the NPFL's rival  faction. Finally, Monrovia and its region, administered by the  Interim Government of National Union and the Armed Forces of  Liberia, will be placed under the responsibility of the Guinean  contingent of ECOMOG. The role to be played by the Sierra  Leonean, Gambian, and Malian elements of the force was not  specified.    According to the estimations of the National Readjustment  Commission, some 60,000 fighters from all sides are expected to  be disarmed and demobilized as of 7 March. Simultaneously,  transitional institutions will officially assume office, and  their mission will be to lead the country to free elections in  September. According to UN estimates, the Liberian civil war has  claimed 150,000 lives since it began in December 1989.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Trade deficit widens in US A SHARP fall in exports in July led to the largest US trade deficit for nearly two years, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The deficit rose to Dollars 7.8bn compared with a shortfall of Dollars 6.7bn in June. This was the biggest deficit since November 1990 and a worrying indication of the difficulty the US is having in balancing its external accounts, despite a prolonged slowdown in the domestic economy. The higher deficit mainly reflected a sharp fall in exports which declined 2.2 per cent to Dollars 37.3bn. US sales to depressed European markets were down sharply. However, analysts noted that a big fall in exports of civilian aircraft (a volatile component of the figures on a monthly basis) accounted for much of the overall decline. Aircraft sales surged in June. US imports fell 0.6 per cent to Dollars 45.2bn, providing more evidence of the weakness of the US economic recovery this summer. The trade deficit for the first seven months of this year was Dollars 43.4bn against Dollars 36.1bn last year, indicating that several years of progress in reducing the US external deficit has ground to a halt. The poor trade figures are the latest in a series of economic jolts for the Bush administration. Figures earlier this week showed a 0.5 per cent decline in both retail sales and industrial production in August. Consumer confidence and industrial orders have also fallen recently. The consensus view is still that the US economy is growing sluggishly at about the 1.4 per cent annual rate registered in the second quarter. However, some forecasters are growing more bearish. Separate figures yesterday for state unemployment insurance claims also pointed to stagnant economic conditions in the approach to the presidential election in November.</p>

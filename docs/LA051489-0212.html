			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAMESE WAR PASSIONS AT HEART OF ATTACK TRIAL  </P> <P> To an outsider who had not seen firsthand the brutalities of the Vietnam War,  the remarks quoted in the 1986 magazine piece may have sounded reasonable  enough.  </P> <P> "The only way to change Vietnam's repressive Marxism," Tran Khanh Van of  Westminster said in the article, "is to work with those who will become the  next generation of leaders."  </P> <P> But to fellow refugee Be Tu Van Tran -- a one-time English teacher in Vietnam  who saw family members jailed by the Marxist regime and who was forced to flee  the country after the fall of Saigon in 1975 -- the words were nothing short of  blasphemy.  </P> <P> The suggestion of normalized relations with Communist Hanoi so infuriated the  Costa Mesa immigrant that he was driven to try to kill the man who had dared to  write the words, according to Orange County prosecutors and Tran's own disputed  statements to police.  </P> <P> Tran, seen by some as an anti-Communist hero and by others as a political  extremist from a shadowy terrorist group, will soon be tried in Santa Ana  Superior Court for the attempted murder of Van.  </P> <P> The case has already been presented to one jury. In 1986, a mistrial occurred  just as the panel reportedly was leaning 9 to 3 in favor of acquitting Tran.  </P> <P> Lawyers are scheduled to seek a date for the second trial at a hearing on  Monday.  </P> <P> It is a potentially explosive case which, at its root, centers on the intense  and sometimes clashing views held by some members of the U.S. Vietnamese  community toward their homeland. Tran, 33, a truck driver, stands accused of  stalking Van for weeks and then trying to assassinate the former Saigon housing  minister because of what Tran perceived to be Van's pro-Communist views. Van, a  local real estate businessman, was shot twice in the stomach and the shoulder  in a March 18, 1986, attack near his Westminster real estate office. But he  survived.  </P> <P> Tran's defense attorney contends that Tran had nothing to do with the shooting  and only claimed responsibility to police as a "badge of honor" to demonstrate  his commitment to fighting communism.  </P> <P> But, as the defense attorney acknowledged, the implications of the Tran case  extend far beyond the guilt or innocence of his client.  </P> <P> "This case is much bigger than a few gunshot wounds; it has clear overtones of  international terrorism," said attorney Robert K. Weinberg of Irvine.  </P> <P> "And I think that for better or worse, (the upcoming trial) will put in the  spotlight the crossroads that Vietnam, and its people who have come to this  country, are at right now," Weinberg said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, defense attorneys and Vietnamese community leaders agree that the  Tran trial and its surrounding issues of nationalistic pride make the case  significant for thousands of Southeast Asians living in Southern California.  </P> <P> "This is one of the biggest and most delicate cases in our community,"  Vietnamese writer Nhat Tien said.  </P> <P> Three years after his arrest, the name of Be Tu Van Tran still elicits strong  emotions both pro and con from those in the Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> Virulent anti-Communist feelings have not softened, although 14 years have  passed since Saigon fell to the Communists. And while some Vietnamese  shopkeepers and restaurant owners denounced Tran, they did not want to be  identified for fear of retaliation.  </P> <P> Strong nationalists like Chuen V. Nguyen, a former fighter pilot in the South  Vietnamese air force, maintain Tran's innocence and consider his motivations  "heroic."  </P> <P> "You cannot measure the emotions of someone like Be Tu Van Tran, who lost  relatives and property during the war," Nguyen said. "You don't understand when  somebody comes into your village and kills your wife and your children. Are you  going to ask yourself, 'Do I have a right to shoot them?'  </P> <P> "Regardless of it happening 14 years ago or 20 years ago, this image, this  picture of what they did to your relatives is still there," Nguyen said.  </P> <P> Those close to the Vietnamese community say most people rallied in support of  Tran after news broke of his alleged attack. Some went so far as to raise money  for his defense and publish a laudatory book about him.  </P> <P> Yet some Vietnamese regard Tran's alleged actions as objectionable.  </P> <P> "We have to learn to compromise. We have to come up with different answers than  violent answers, and (to learn) that not all things are black and white. There  are shades of gray," said a Vietnamese businessman who asked not to be  identified for fear of retaliation.  </P> <P> While the subject of Vietnamese nationalism has long stirred intense feelings  among the refugee community, the Tran trial is also likely to attract a broader  interest as well.  </P> <P> The trial comes at a time of a warming trend between the United States and  Hanoi, after years of roadblocks largely over the issues of Vietnam's invasion  of Cambodia and Americans who are missing in action. And the success of the  Vietnamese refugees in their transition to this country seems to have  intensified questions surrounding the Vietnamese community and its attitudes  toward the Asian homeland.  </P> <P> Last month, for instance, Vietnamese in Orange County were angered when  Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr. told a Vietnamese military veterans' group  to "go back to South Vietnam" if they were unwilling to recognize traditional  American military holidays. Vietnamese leaders launched a recall effort against  Fry but called it off after he apologized.  </P> <P> Violence has also erupted in Little Saigon, the commercial hub of the  Vietnamese community. In February, angry anti-Communists allegedly firebombed a  travel agency that booked tours to Vietnam. A few weeks ago, the group also  allegedly set fire to a truck belonging to a television studio that showed  pro-Communist symbols -- Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum and an old Vietnamese  liberation flag -- on a television program.  </P> <P> And within and beyond the confines of Orange County, the Vietnamese Party to  Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation -- a right-wing group in which Be  Tu Van Tran is a cadet, local prosecutors say -- has been linked by law  enforcement officials to at least 11 terrorist incidents ranging from arson to  murder.  </P> <P> Members of the district attorney's staff, while declining to specify what  security precautions will be taken during the trial, say they are worried about  reprisals against both the defendant and the victim, Van.  </P> <P> Van moved to Thailand after the attack out of fear for his safety, said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Chris Evans. But he is expected to return to Orange County to  testify, as he did in the first trial.  </P> <P> Highlighting its political overtones, that first trial featured the unusual  sight of Tran, his then-co-defendant in the shooting, a defense investigator  and their former attorney all sporting emblems on their coats that read "Viet  Cong Hunting Club."  </P> <P> This time around, prosecutors have granted immunity from prosecution to Tran's  former co-defendant, Cu Ngoc Duong, who was allegedly the "wheelman" -- driver  of the getaway car -- in the attack on Van. That sets up the prospect that  prosecutors may try to get him to testify against Tran.  </P> <P> Duong's attorney, Roger S. Hanson of Santa Ana, said it is unclear whether his  client would oppose an order compelling his testimony. He said it is also  unclear what Duong would say if he was to take the stand against Tran.  </P> <P> But the single most damning piece of evidence against Tran may be his own  statements to police after his arrest in 1986: "I shoot him; I accept  responsibility," Tran reportedly told police.  </P> <P> Tran also claimed authorship of a "death sentence" order that was sent to  Vietnamese newspapers across the state on behalf of the extermination party.  </P> <P> The order labelled Tran Khanh Van a "traitor, lackey of Vietnamese Communists"  and said he must be killed for opposing the "struggle for the liberation of our  Fatherland."  </P> <P> While prosecutors link Van's comments as quoted in a January, 1986, Los Angeles  Times Magazine article to the attack, the victim himself offered a different  explanation in filing a $50-million lawsuit in 1987 against Tran, Duong, and  members of the United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam.  </P> <P> Van claimed in the suit that members of the Front were extorting money from the  local Vietnamese community in the name of fighting communism, and he said that  his refusal to give a demanded $10,000 resulted in threats and the eventual  assault against him.  </P> <P> Weinberg, defense attorney for Tran, acknowledged that his client kept Van  under surveillance in the weeks after his remarks appeared in the magazine  article, saying he was interested in finding out who associated with Van.  </P> <P> But the attorney and William Cassidy, an investigator who has worked on Tran's  behalf since the outset of the case, deny that Tran had any role in the attack.  </P> <P> Weinberg and Cassidy assert that Van's initial description of his assailant  does not match that of Tran. And they maintain that the victim's political  leanings prompted him to later identify Tran as the shooter once Tran had  claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of anti-communism.  </P> <P> "The victim was predisposed to blame his misfortunes on the opponents of  communism," Cassidy contends.  </P> <P> Van has denied favoring the Communist regime in Hanoi, but Weinberg said he  will try at Tran's trial to expose the victim's "disinformation artistry" and  to show that "Van is not who he says he is."  </P> <P> At the same time, Weinberg will try to prove that Tran was lying when he  admitted responsibility for the attack. He said he will not put Tran on the  stand at trial for fear that the defendant would again lie about his role.  </P> <P> The defense attorney said he may go so far as to inject the teachings of  Confucius into the trial as a way of dramatizing the code of honor and  self-sacrifice to which he says Tran adheres.  </P></p>

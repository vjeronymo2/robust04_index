			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Sacked staff get job-hunt help THREE quarters of companies help employees they sack to find new jobs, Cranfield School of Management has found. Independent consultants providing 'outplacement' services were the most popular with organisations, particularly for executives being made redundant, Cranfield's research, published today, indicates. Consultants were seen to help improve morale among remaining employees, as well as providing expertise for those seeking jobs, the study found. The study of more than 600 companies was carried out for the Institute of Directors and the consultancy Pauline Hyde and Associates. Unemployment is again increasing much faster among ethnic minority groups. This follows a period in the mid-1980s when the gap between white and ethnic-minority unemployment narrowed, the Commission for Racial Equality says.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (21): Setting the record straight  -Case Study:  Guinness Publishing - Claire Gooding searches the archives to discover how a database proved a winner THERE can only be one filing system in the world which has a drawer labelled: 'Sitting in liquid substances . . . to throwing.' This strange file - among several hundred other bizarre categories - belongs to The Guinness Book of Records. Unique as the book might be in its preoccupations, Guinness Publishing faced problems of data storage and retrieval which it shares with publishers of international directories, and others. The problems of wrestling with text organisation and retrieval are mirrored in all businesses where the written word is of the essence. More than three years ago, Guinness Publishing took the step of computerising its typesetting. This one change triggered off many others, not least the idea of keeping the facts and figures for the world-famous book on a database, making updates easier. There were several main problems, explaines Donald McFarlan, now editorial director of Guinness Publishing, but until recently the editor of the famous Book of Records. First, the book itself was trapped in a format that needed revision, but it simply wasn't possible to rearrange the order in which items appeared without some radical re-thinking. 'For example, the miscellaneous section, the one full of various stunts, was getting far too big. We wanted to 'explode' it out from this ghetto into other chapters.' Translating the Book of Records into 36 or so different languages resulted in a more far-reaching consequence of the item-ordering problem. The subtleties of English versus American spelling, for example, pale into insignificance next to the problems of contents. US readers expect to see records about US sports which interest few UK readers. Guinness Publishing produces the text for both the UK and the US versions of the book, which means duplicating some entries in different spellings, and allowing for categories that appear in one book, but not in the other. Further, each nation likes to see its own 'national record' appearing immediately after the world record: look up the dimensions of mountains in the French edition, and the highest mountain in France appears next to the highest mountain in the world: would one bother in a Dutch edition? The publishers with whom Guinness Publishing contracts the foreign language versions have certain amount of discretion over contents. But the fount of world-record wisdom is still in Guinness Publishing' headquarters in Enfield, ten miles north of London. And here is the third big problem: that of space. 'In the 36 years since the book was first published, vast amounts of information come our way,' says McFarlan. 'The hard copy filing system goes back to the 1950s.' One small room in the company's Enfield comfortable but compact office is given over to filing cabinets, 'but if it were all kept here, it would take up acres,' he adds. A lot of the overflow is stored off-site. Outside the small filing room sits the entire editorial team. Not, as the popular imagination might expect, a mass of people beavering away with reference books. 'People have a picture of teams of researchers. In fact, the entire editorial team is the editor and four deputies,' explains Donald McFarlan. And they have to know - or be able to find out  - a great deal. 'People expect us to know whether a specific item is in the book or not: not always easy when we don't run every category every year, and some have been dropped altogether.' As befits a publication which was first envisaged as being kept behind the bar in pubs to settle arguments, Guinness Publishing still provides the answers to telephone and written enquiries. This is a goodwill service, not one it wishes to encourage . . . 'but people expect us to know the answers.' Not knowing them, or being able to find them, was a blow to the morale of the hard-pressed team. Any cross-referencing was along with the main repository of knowledge - inside their heads. Now, in a company of 50 people, these four - and the press officer  - are the main users of the database, on which only the recent years' text is stored. The search for a database started in 1988. The company turned to Promco, which had become very intimate with the business in the process of implementing the computerised typesetting. 'We may seem foolhardy, but Promco knew us so well that we trusted them with everything technical,' says McFarlan. 'Nor was cost a huge consideration. We were more frightened of the implications of making the wrong decision.' The brief was to find a long-term solution. Simon Johnson, managing director of Promco, was well aware of the vagaries of Guinness' particular problems of text formatting. He initially researched 300 companies, in everything from text retrieval specialists to hypertext and database companies, and academic innovators. Simon Johnson spent a lot of time with the larger database companies, such as Oracle, (already in wide use at the Guin-  ness group), Ingres, Sybase and Unify, as well as exploring AI, hypercard and other innovations. The solution had to be relational, support text retrieval, and able to hold typesetting instructions. Ten potential database products were rapidly whittled down to three: Empress, Adabas, and Basis (now called Basis Plus). One important consideration was the ability to hold variable length texts. Another was the development environment on offer, and this was where Basis and Adabas lost out - 'neither had the flexibility for future development that Guinness required,' reports Simon Johnson, who chose Empress, and its C development language. This, he feels, ensures high performance as well as long life for the Guinness applications, as there is as widespread base of skilled C-programmers, far more so than in Adabas Natural. Promco had caught Empress in a net spread wide: the initial sweep of letters sent to over 300 companies. (See Empress profile, page 18). 'It's a highly flexible relational database, in terms of capability and performance. I can still think of none better, but the company is not switched on to marketing: I feel we were lucky to find it.' Promco looked after the programming and implementation, saving time by downloading the text into the database - 'Simon became an extension of the company: at one stage, leading up to the implemention, he was around at least part of every day,' recalls Donald McFarlan. A long-term intention is to get all the archived material - some of it in packing cases in the brewery - into the system. But in the short-term, the main desire was to fix the actual text, along with ways of searching it. 'We had clear idea of wanting to search the text and find every instance of a particular word. For instance, place names: we don't have an index of those, so if Leningrad chan ges its name overnight, or Peking becomes Beijing, it's a problem for us. Now we are less reliant on memory for such occurrences, and it's easy to scan the text for a spelling - such as 'ise,' to turn it into 'ize.' ' As Donald McFarlan points out, the book itself is merely a 'snapshot' of the state of records in the last week of August. 'The day it's published, it's out of date.' But, as he points out, updates and research, and most particularly enquiries, go on all year round. We don't charge for the service, but we are expected to know the answers. 'Telephone enquiries are a serious headache. It demotivates people if they can't answer them. There is a huge benefit in having the database, not just in terms of smooth running, but in morale. A quick response gives us a much more polished appearance to the outside world.' The database is also a valuable potential editorial resource for 'spin-off' publishing. For instance, another Guinness publication, Superlative Britain, would have been easier to produce had the database been up and running at the time. Now, it will be easy to respond to commercial 'novelty' requests, for subsets of data, such as that from a battery maker on 'durability' records. Peter Matthews, editor of the Book of Records since July 1991, demonstrates the database with enthusiasm. He is quickly able to answer the most unlikely off-the-cuff enquiries with a text-search. Some answers are run to ground in the filing cabinets, especially for some obscure categories which have been dropped, such as the haircutting marathon. (As one of the coiffed heads assisting in the 1985 record, this one sprang to the interviewer's mind as a test search . . . both computer and paper systems delivered impressively.) The US edition, says Peter Matthews, is now much easier to produce. Not only contents, but spelling, idiom, style and punctuation has can be converted easily. Now the system supports two separate, but linked, records. There are at least 150,000 edits made between editions: towards the end of the March-to-August review cycle, every record is flagged for publication or non-publication. Alex Reid, systems manager at Guinness Publishing, reports around 10,000 interactive queries a year on his five megabytes of data (expanded to text, it takes up around 120 megabytes). Initial problems, including a particularly alarming one which tagged random records - were quickly sorted out. And, happily for everyone, the correspondence editor and secretary are able to answer the 700 letters a month that much more easily. In keeping with the book's origins, telephone enquiries reach a peak on Friday afternoons, often topping 40. Can this be a record?</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLIVER STONE'S REMARKS  </P> <P> I cringed when I read director Oliver Stone's heartless retort to victims of  communist repression: "When are you going to find the love in your heart to  forgive and move on?" ("Vietnamese-U.S. Film Symposium Stirs Passions," by  Daniel Cerone, April 29).  </P> <P> I'm glad Stone wasn't making films in the 1940s. Would he have met with  Goebbels at a "Nazi-U.S. film symposium" and told victims of the Nazi genocide,  "You're not the only people in the world that have experienced suffering"?  </P> <P> While film makers sent by communist regimes propagandize freely here, their own  people live hellish lives. Apparently, their situations are not worthy of  trendy Hollywood film making.  </P> <P> CAROLINE MIRANDA  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

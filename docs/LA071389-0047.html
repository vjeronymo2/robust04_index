			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Ilzamar Mendes, the widow of slain Brazilian ecologist Chico Mendes, refuses to  back away from a movie deal she made with Brazil's J.N. Filmes -- a major  setback for such big Hollywood names as Robert Redford, David Puttnam and Ted  Turner, who are pursuing the film rights to Mendes' story. Mendes' widow  purchased an ad in Monday's Hollywood Reporter defending her deal and warning  other producers that their continued pursuit of the project "can only hinder  our fight for the defense of the Amazon forest." However, a lawyer for the  Chico Mendes Foundation released a statement this week confirming that a  majority of the foundation's leaders -- who are legally responsible for  administering the rights to Mendes' story -- rejected the J.N. Filmes deal at a  July 3 meeting. Despite her claim that she was acting on behalf of the  foundation, the leaders said that the widow acted "entirely without support or  approval of the foundation." The story of Chico Mendes, who was murdered  outside his Brazilian home in December, is one of the most hotly pursued film  projects in recent Hollywood history. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

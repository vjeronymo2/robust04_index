			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: New president for Northern Telecom MR JEAN Monty, the aggressive head of Canada's largest telecommunications utility, Bell Canada, is taking over as president and chief operating officer of Northern Telecom, the international equipment producer and a sister company, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Mr Paul Stern, who has been chairman and president of Northern Telecom since 1991 and has overseen its four-year international expansion, remains chairman and chief executive. Bell Canada is 100 per cent owned by BCE, Canada's largest holding company, and provides most of BCE's profits. Northern Telecom is controlled by BCE and is the second largest contributor. Mr Stern said Mr Monty 'brings us a strong financial background and strong telephone company operating experience.' He said Northern Telecom envisaged a stronger second half and full 1992 results should be better than 1991.</p>

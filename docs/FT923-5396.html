			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (9): Straight talk helps - Profile of Kurt Biedenkopf IN Dresden's fledgling state parliament, even the opposition parties are wary of attacking Kurt Biedenkopf. In spite of the severe problems affecting Saxony as it shakes off the remnants of communism and moves into the more exposed atmosphere of the free market, the state's Christian Democrat (CDU) prime minister enjoys a high degree of popularity and respect. This stems from his mixture of straight talking about the present and well-argued optimism about the future. At a time when many east Germans feel neglected by Bonn, Mr Biedenkopf is the western politician who came to offer help and has stayed to see his work through. 'There is no precedent for what we are doing', he says of the monumental task of dragging what was - if only for four decades - a separate country into the modern economic and industrial world. He believes East Germany would have collapsed anyway in a few years if its citizens had not taken to the streets and toppled the Honecker regime. Mr Biedenkopf, was one of the first to assess the real cost of unification with east Germany, whose economy turned out to be industrially and economically more moribund than most experts thought. The stagnating East German system, he says, was kept going by exploitation of the people, the economy and the environment. 'But every exploitation comes to an end, since there is nothing left to exploit'. Politically, Mr Biedenkopf, a legal professor, has always been a thorn in the side of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Biedenkopf may be a lot smaller than the towering Mr Kohl, but he is intellectually faster on his feet and is not shy of showing it. But while he is sure of his own views, Mr Biedenkopf has been careful not to appear an arrogant, know-all westerner, something of which long-suffering east Germans have had enough experience. He makes the point that Saxony, before the 1914-18 war, had the highest per capita gross national product in Germany, higher even than the industrialised Ruhr. Like neighbouring Bohemia, in Czechoslovakia, 'Saxony played a pioneering role in European industry'. Even after 45 years of communism, he believes this can be revived. Volkswagen is building a car plant near Zwickau, Siemens is investing heavily in the state and Dresdner Bank has returned to its original home. But it will be a long haul before economic and social conditions are akin to those in the west. 'It will probably take a generation'. Mr Biedenkopf is confident that the Saxons, and other east Germans, can take the strain in the intervening years. 'The problems are huge. But they have been absorbed in a way you couldn't ask of people in west Germany,' he says. Strikes and demonstrations are inevitable, although these can turn nasty as with the violence against asylum-seekers in the town of Hoyerswerda. 'Such a huge stress in such a short time, amounting to a radical change in people's way of life, is bound to cause eruptions.' He is thankful that most people in Saxony, according to opinion polls, still regard their positions as better or at least no worse than a year ago, in spite of the physical and psychological turmoil they are going through. But he believes, like Heinz Eggert, his interior minister, that unity must be regarded as a challenge for all Germans, not just those in the east.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilians cannot afford to cut aluminium losses - It would cost more to close production lines than to keep them running ANY HOPES that Brazil will this year relieve the pressure of oversupply on the languishing aluminium market by cutting its output seem destined to be disappointed. Despite a combination of low international prices and what local industry considers high domestic energy costs, the country registered record production of aluminium in 1992, and output is expected to remain at a similar level this year. The Brazilian Aluminum Association (ABAL) estimates last year's production at 1.19m , up 4.8 per cent on 1991's, and exports at 985,700 tonnes, up 18.8 per cent. The production increase was primarily due to a 16 per cent surge, to about 335,000 tonnes, by Albras, the joint venture between Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and a consortium of Japanese companies. Companhia Aluminio do Brasil boosted production by 13,000 tonnes, as it utilised its full capacity of 217,000 tonnes. The Albras increase was a consequence of a scheme launched in 1988, designed to double output, says Mr Francisco Pitella, commercial director for Aluvale, the CVRD holding company for its aluminium interests. In 1988, the plant was producing about 160,000 tonnes. Under the plan, capacity would have jumped to 340,000 tonnes in 1991. In March 1991, however, a damaged transmission line caused a 12-hour blackout, cutting production by about 40,000 tonnes, and pushing back the timetable for reaching higher production levels to 1992. There should be a slight drop in the country's aluminium output this year as Alcan's closure in November of a 27,000-tonnes-a-year production line in Aratu, Bahia state, makes its mark on the 1993 figures. The plant produces aluminium to supply its own domestic operations. But with the severe recession and dampened demand in Brazil, the subsidiary found itself exporting. 'The quantity we were producing was in excess of our needs, and at Dollars 1,400 a tonne cash cost, we were realising at least a Dollars 150-a-tonne loss,' explains Mr Joao Valiante, manager of metal planning. The output cut can be viewed as part of the company's overall effort to reduce costs in Brazil. The company now employs less than 5,000 workers, compared with 8,000 in 1989, says Mr Valiante. Efficiency has improved, as capacity was reduced by just 27,000 tonnes a year over the same period. In 1991 Alcan produced 113,600 tonnes. Other producers refuse to cut output because the cost of closing production lines is greater than that of keeping them running, according to Mr Ivo Barone, ABAL's president. 'The price level still allows companies to break even on a cash-cost basis, depending on their energy costs,' says Mr Barone. Many energy contracts are 'take-or-pay' agreements, long-term accords that guarantee aluminium producers a minimum supply for which they must pay even if they do not take it up. Some bauxite supply contracts run on a 'take-and-pay' basis, meaning that producers must withdraw their share of raw material whether or not they intend to use it. 'It comes down to what is more costly, to continue producing or to close,' observes Mr Barone. For that reason, many firms have begun working with a cash-cost philosophy, which ignores depreciation, says the ABAL president. Reducing fixed expenditures, producers try to get their cash expenses down to Dollars 1,200 a tonne, allowing them to limp through the present crisis. High energy costs are the main obstacle to the Brazilian industry's ability to compete, maintains Mr Barone. He claims that energy accounts for Dollars 450 in the price of a tonne of Brazilian aluminium, compared with an international average of Dollars 300 a tonne. Albras and Alumar enjoy discounts and price ceilings based on international prices for the commodity, part of an incentive package for building plants in the underdeveloped north of the country. Other companies, including CBA, Alcan and Valesul, generate varying amounts of their own energy. Aluminium producers in south-central Brazil, the country's most industrialised region, spend Dollars 23 per MW hour for their electricity, compared to Dollars 9 in Canada and Dollars 20 in the US, says Mr Carlos Eduardo Mariano da Silva, Valesul's industrial director. The cost of energy is a touchy subject in Brazil. Congress has just passed a Bill to give regional utility companies a free hand to set electricity prices without meddling by central authorities. Large industrial users generally pay about Dollars 45 per MW hour, compared with an average generating cost of Dollars 70 per megawatt hour. Valesul, a joint venture involving CVRD and Royal Dutch/Shell's Brazilian metal subsidiary Billiton, hopes to reduce energy costs by both increasing efficiency and boosting its own generating capacity. Currently Valesul generates about 20 per cent of its own electricity. This year it is implementing a pilot project designed to improve the efficiency of its production process. The company will invest Dollars 2.5m this year, and if the pilot project is successful, it is ready to spend Dollars 37m by 1995 to adapt its entire plant, says Mr Mariano da Silva. In terms of generating capacity, Valesul's goal is to increase its own output to 50 per cent, adds Mr Mariano da Silva. To reach that level, he estimates that the company would have to invest Dollars 55m. 'But we have to find an investment opportunity,' he says, adding that such an investment is not yet officially in the cards. Low, and falling, domestic consumption means that Brazilian producers are forced to place greater amounts of their output on the international market, despite low prices. Domestic per capita aluminium consumption dropped from 3.1 kg in 1986 to an estimated 2.1 kg in 1992, says CVRD's Mr Pitella, adding that consumption in rich countries is about 20 kg a person a year. Overall Brazilian consumption was 316,000 tonnes in 1992, an 8 per cent drop from 338,000 tonnes in 1991. 'Last year domestic production fell to the level of the early 1980s, but if it weren't for greater use of aluminium cans, we might have dropped back to levels from the late 1970s,' observes Mr Adjarma Azevedo, executive director for the local subsidiary of Alcoa. Domestic demand seems to be rebounding slightly. In December, it was 5 per cent above expectations, in January 10 per cent more than expected, estimates Mr Valiante of Alcan. 'The Brazilian market is apparently improving, but I am afraid to talk about a boom,' he says, echoing the words of other analysts. 'I don't know how long it will last.'</p>

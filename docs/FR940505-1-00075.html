Regulations for Specific Source Categories in the FIP Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Introduction_(1) Rationale for Selection of Categories and Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in section III.C.1 of this NPRM, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP should include traditional category-specific stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source rules where possible. Such rules improve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State/federal partnership, minimize federal intrusion into State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affairs, and contribute to other goals described in section I.B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this NPRM. While EPA is unable to develop rules for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary source categories, the proposed FIP includes 15 rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for specific categories as described in sections III.C.3.b-p and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 statewide area source regulations presented in section III.C.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of these rules have been adapted from regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already existing or proposed in parts of California. In such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, EPA has generally selected the most stringent requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available and relied on the technical work performed by CARB and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local Districts to estimate associated costs and emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions. While there may be additional rules that EPA could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have adapted for the FIP under this effort, EPA used the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of potential emission reductions as a primary screening device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for evaluating which rules were appropriate for the FIP proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, rules projected to reduce emissions by more than 0.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the uncontrolled attainment year inventory were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered good candidates. EPA also considered cost-effectiveness and District recommendations in selecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories and specific requirements under this effort. Examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of proposed FIP elements adapted from existing District rules are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those affecting solvent cleaning operations, wood products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings, and auto refinishing. Many of these category-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules are based on regulations adopted by the SCAQMD or CARB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's application of these rules to Sacramento and Ventura should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not discourage the SCAQMD and CARB from pursuing further emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions from these source categories in order to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress and attainment requirements of federal and State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also developed rules for source categories which have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not yet been regulated under the Clean Air Act but which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute substantial emissions in the FIP areas. For these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories, EPA worked with the State and Districts to evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various mechanisms for reducing emissions. Among the FIP rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed under this effort are those affecting pesticides,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosol coatings, and livestock waste management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Relationship to existing and pending SIP provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some stationary sources proposed for control through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category-specific FIP rules are already regulated by existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or District SIP rules. Architectural coating, for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been regulated in the South Coast by versions of South Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 1113 since 1977. EPA's proposed FIP rule (section 52.2959),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, would reduce architectural coating emissions even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further. Where a State or local rule has been approved by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the SIP (as, for example, Rule 1113 was approved in 57 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8104, August 11, 1992), affected sources would have to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tighter of each element in the two rules. <FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>  Sources will,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, need to continue to comply with applicable State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 302(q) of the Act defines the applicable implementation plan as that ``portion .&blank;.&blank;. or most recent revision thereof, which has been approved under section 110, or promulgated under section 110(c) .&blank;.&blank;.'' While the regulations discussed in sections III.C.3 and 4 of this notice may effectively supersede less stringent provisions of federally approved SIP rules addressing the same source categories, the State or local rules would remain in the SIP and be enforceable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in section III.J. and elsewhere in this NPRM,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to delegate the FIP rules and/or remove them whenever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State submits an approvable, equivalent SIP provision. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, for example, SCAQMD submits a proposed SIP amendment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes Rule 1113 an approvable substitute for the FIP rule, upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA approval, EPA would amend section 52.2959 to rescind its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability within the South Coast. In many cases, CARB and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected Districts are already developing rules similar to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in this NPRM. If these are submitted to EPA before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 1995, EPA may, upon SIP approval, simply amend or remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the analogous component from the final promulgated FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, EPA may remove FIP elements under separate action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to &sect;110(1) of the Act, State rules are not approvable as revisions to an implementation plan if they `interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress .&blank;.&blank;. or any other applicable requirement of this Act.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If, however, EPA determines that a new or modified State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule does not achieve emission reductions equivalent to the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, and no other State rule compensates for the differences,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will maintain implementation of the FIP measure. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  In such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, sources could again be subject to overlapping State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal requirements. Therefore, EPA encourages the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt approvable regulations as soon as possible to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duplicative effort for both regulators and affected sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA could also approve a substitute SIP attainment demonstration relying on a different mix of control measures to achieve attainment and interim progress that at least equals the FIP's schedule. In this case, EPA may rescind individual FIP rules that are more stringent than the substitute SIP provisions, if the particular FIP rules are no longer necessary to provide for expeditious attainment because the SIP achieves greater reductions from controls on other source categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Relationship to other applicable FIP provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the sources subject to the proposed category-specific rules described here will also be affected by the cap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations described in section III.C.5 of this NPRM. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed, the cap regulations require almost all significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary sources to reduce emissions by a specified percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reduction rates are currently the same for sources which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by category-specific rules and for sources which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not. As discussed in section III.C.5 of this NPRM, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically requests comments on whether fairness and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns justify adjusting the reduction requirements to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources credit for emission reductions required in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP rules described in sections III.C.2&hyph;4 of this NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Rule structure. These proposed rules generally follow the structure of New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in 40 CFR part 60. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain sections on applicability, definitions, specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, exemptions, reporting, recordkeeping, test methods,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and additional components as necessary. Where immediate or near-term compliance is feasible, the effective dates of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantive requirements are generally January 1, 1996, roughly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one year after final FIP promulgation is due. Issues specific to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual rules are discussed in sections III.C.3.b-p and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.4 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Solvent Cleaning Operations (Sacramento, Ventura).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(a) controls VOC emissions resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from certain solvent cleaning operations in the Sacramento and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura nonattainment areas. Emission reductions are achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by: (1) Limiting the VOC content and vapor pressure of solvents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in solvent cleaning operations; (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment in lieu of meeting the VOC content and vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure limits; and (3) prescribing procedures and requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for solvent cleaning operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule applies to facilities that use VOC-containing materials in the production, repair, maintenance, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicing of parts, products, tools, machinery, equipment, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general work areas, or that store and dispose of VOC-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials used in solvent cleaning operations. Affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities include manufacturing plants, printing presses,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipyards, and repair and refinishing facilities such as auto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garages, auto body shops and workshops for buses, aircraft,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trains and trucks. This proposed rule also applies to repair,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, and production operations at institutional facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as government buildings, schools, hospitals, sanitariums,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prisons, restaurants, health clubs, and theaters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

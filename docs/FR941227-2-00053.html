The FCA Board has concluded that institutions should have the maximum degree of flexibility possible in proposing official names for their institutions and should not have to use trade names that are more commonly accepted than their official names. At the same time, the official name of an institution should always be one that can be readily identified by the public as belonging to an institution affiliated with the System. In addition, there must be a simple way for the public and the FCA to be able to identify the name as belonging to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the FCA. To reaffirm, by formal FCA Board Action, the continuing validity of the policy statement which requires Farm Credit Banks and associations to include as a part of their official name their statutory or regulatory designation or the appropriate acronym, the FCA Board has reaffirmed its policy statement on Farm Credit Institution Names adopted by the FCA Board and stated in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of final rule published December 15, 1988 at 53 FR 50387&hyph;50388. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  October 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Floyd Fithian, Acting Secretary to the Farm Credit Administration Board, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4000, TDD (703) 883&hyph;4444. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The text of the Board's policy statement concerning official names of Farm Credit System institutions is set forth below in its entirety:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCA Board Action on Policy Statement Concerning, Official Names of Farm Credit System Institutions, BM&hyph;13&hyph;Oct&hyph;94&hyph;02, FCA-PS&hyph;63.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect on Previous Action: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Reaffirmation of the Policy Statement on Farm Credit Institution Names adopted by the FCA Board and stated in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of final rule December 15, 1988 at 53 FR 50387&hyph;50388.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Source of Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, sections 1.3(b), 2.0(b)(8), 2.10(c), 3.0, 5.17(a)(2)(A), 7.0, 7.6(a), 7.8(a); 12 CFR part 611.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA Board hereby reaffirms the policy statement on Farm Credit Institution names adopted by the FCA Board and stated in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice of final rule published December 15, 1988 at 53 FR 50387&hyph;50388.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To ensure that the public can identify the name of the Farm Credit institution as belonging to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA). To allow the maximum flexibility possible for Farm Credit Banks and associations in proposing official names for their institutions.

Also, to ensure that the official names recorded in all charters and charter amendments that are requested by the Farm Credit Banks and associations and issued by the FCA follow the policy specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating Principles: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With the exception of the provisions of section 413 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (1987 Act) regarding the National Bank for Cooperatives, the 1987 Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1971 as amended (the Act), do not expressly require any of the various types of banks and associations to use a specific name in its official title. However, prior to the 1987 Act, the Act referred to each of the different banks and associations by using specific names such as ``production credit association,'' ``Federal land bank association,'' and ``bank for cooperatives.'' Based on these statutory references, the FCA, in granting charters to institutions, has required that the official names of institutions include the appropriate name used in the statute. Thus, for instance, associations chartered under title II of the Act were required to use ``production credit association'' as part of their official name.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Effluent charges to rise 20% THOUSANDS of industrial groups, water companies and farmers face a 20 per cent rise in fees for discharging effluent into rivers and coastal waters from April. The polluting effluent comes from industrial plants, sewage treatment works and discharges from some farms. The increased charges, announced yesterday by Mr David Trippier, environment minister, are part of the 'polluter pays' principle, and are intended to cover the cost of pollution control administered by the National Rivers Authority. The total revenue the rivers watchdog receives from administering licenses and monitoring discharges will rise by Pounds 2m to Pounds 38m. It will also receive a government grant of Pounds 81.8m for pollution control during the coming year. It will be able to spend 15 per cent more on pollution control than in the current year. There are more than 86,000 licenses granted by the authority to allow discharges.</p>

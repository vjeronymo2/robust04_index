			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Hong Kong reserves fund takes stake in HIT A SPECIAL fund set up by China and Britain to provide reserves for Hong Kong when it returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 has bought a 6 per cent stake costing about HKDollars 800m (USDollars 102m) in Hongkong International Terminals, the colony's biggest container terminal operator, from Hutchison Whampoa, which is controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing. Hutchison retains a controlling 60.5 per cent stake in HIT which last month linked up with its main local rival, Modern Terminals, to develop Hong Kong's container terminal number eight at a cost of about HKDollars 7bn. The deal is significant because the fund - known as the Hong Kong SAR Land Fund - is basically a Peking-run organisation. Peking-controlled China Resources already has a 10 per cent stake in HIT and another Peking company, China Ocean Shipping Corporation, is involved with HIT. This illustrates how China is increasing its investments in Hong Kong's leading infrastructure projects, despite its current opposition to detailed plans for the colony's proposed HKDollars 100bn airport. The SAR Land Fund - SAR stands for Special Administrative Region which will be Hong Kong's status after the 1997 handover - was set up in 1986. It receives a 50 per cent share of the proceeds from government land sales.</p>

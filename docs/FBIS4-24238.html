			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Zairian Government, who was recently  appointed by the High Council of the Republic-Transitional  Parliament [HCR-PT], has just written to Frederic  Kibassa-Maliba, chairman of the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition [USOR], asking him to propose to him names of  opposition members for the formation of the next government.  HCR and radical opposition member Christian Badibangi is  unhappy about this gesture, and he spoke to Jean-Claude Medome.    [Begin recording] [Badibangi] It is just a gesture for the  outside world. It is a way of justifying the overture, as Mr.  Kengo Wa Dondo seems to be saying. However, for USOR, we know  that Kengo Wa Dondo's election is entirely illegal. USOR and  Allies have already taken the stand of telling the whole  national and international community that any existing or  supposedly existing government does not concern the opposition  especially as the government or the prime minister must be  presented by a group other than the one belonging to the head of  state.    [Medome] Some Zairians could nonetheless accuse you of going  rather too far. Do you not think that it is about time you  collaborated with Kengo Wa Dondo to enable Zaire to get down to  work?    [Badibangi] We want to establish the rule of law and  judicial  security in our country. We must ensure the security of  everybody. Even the holding of future elections will depend on  this.    [Medome] Why not accept this overture from Prime Minister  Kengo Wa Dondo, that is, to form a government and prepare the  elections together?    [Badibangi] Indeed, the problem seems simple when it is  presented at the tail end. To believe that we simply have to  allow him to form his government with the radical opposition  without knowing the actual motive of Kengo Wa Dondo, who it  would seem has assumed the premiership through a personal and  unilateral move, and to commit the entire radical opposition in  this manner, I think, is to take the wrong tack.    [Medome] What do you have to say to those who feel that USOR  is promoting the interests of one man, Etienne Tshisekedi, to  the detriment of the nation's supreme interest?    [Badibangi] No, I do not think that's true; we believe that  there is a popular will. We believe that our people decided  [words indistinct] of the Republic by the National Sovereign  Conference and that this prime minister-elect has not been able  to carry out his functions. Why this injustice especially as he  has not been able to exercise the mandate entrusted to him by  the people for two years. That is the reality. [end recording]</p>

The most  important result of this work is mathematically confident  establishment of a direct connection between morbidity and the  radiation factor on territory with low doses of external  irradiation. In a broader view, it is a matter of undoubted  radiation causality of many illnesses of the populace in regions  of ``Russian Chernobyl.'' At the same time, the discovered  causality is complicated, and cannot be given any unambiguous  interpretation in only one direction, positive or negative. Some  illnesses are typified by decreased incidence with time, and  improvement of the state of health with respect to given  illnesses (pneumonia, rheumatism), while others show an increase  (myocardial ischemia, cerebral illnesses, diabetes and so on)  for the same radiation conditions. It is important to recognize  that the general direction of change of morbidity, or the  overall direction of the change in state of health of residents  of ``Russian Chernobyl'' unfortunately is negative. This is  confirmed by the fact of an increase in morbidity, although some  stabilization, or rather a trend toward stabilization, is noted  in 1991. There is a lot of work remaining in ascertainment of  the mechanisms of radiation causality of illnesses,  reconstruction of the initially received dose of radiation,  further analysis of discovered facts of ``splitting'' of  illnesses into two (``+'' and ``-'') groups and much more.  Perhaps the developed methodology and practice of the  comprehensive approach will enable more rapid and rational  advancement in solution of the formulated problems.    The problem of the interrelationship between morbidity and  low doses of chronic radiation exposure is not only of  considerable theoretical significance, but is also of  considerable practical importance for the fates of people taking  part in cleanup of the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric  Power Plant. A large detachment of Russian volunteer miners from  Tulskaya Oblast worked on driving a tunnel beneath the exploded  reactor of the fourth power generating unit at Chernobyl Nuclear  Electric Power Plant. After receiving considerable unaccounted-  for doses of irradiation, the miners returned to their permanent  residences in various regions of Tulskaya Oblast (as well as  Orlovskaya, Kurskaya, Lipetskaya and other oblasts), where the  contamination density usually does not exceed 5-10  Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. According to traditional concepts rooted in  radiobiology, these densities of fallout of radionuclides  cesium-137 (and, correspondingly, strontium-90) are  insignificant, and they cannot form appreciable doses of  external and internal irradiation. This was indeed the position  of experts of the International Chernobyl Committee. However,  this leaves out many factors. First of all, the cleanup men who  received large doses are still living in this same Tulskaya  Oblast for the seventh year along with the native population  (who likewise received certain doses) under conditions of low  but CHRONIC constant irradiation acting on an organism that had  already experienced dose burdens in 1986. Some food products,  especially in homes, are still contaminated. Residents are not  receiving any supplemental food products rich in protein and  vitamins. There is no qualified medical assistance or systematic  observation and monitoring of the health of the population  (including cleanup workers) in regions of both Tulskaya Oblast  and other middle Russian oblasts. Under these conditions, the  possibility of existence of danger must unconditionally be given  top priority, and the impact of low doses of chronic exposure  must be taken into account as a risk factor, and not  deliberately discarded as insignificant, especially as regards  cleanup personnel still living in contaminated regions.    We have already spoken of the inadequacies of Russian  legislation in the field of social compensation, which to a  considerable extent is due to the serious economic situation of  the country. But no less important are the stereotypes that have  evolved concerning the harmlessness of low doses of irradiation.  Thanks to these notions, the ``Russian Chernobyl'' of 15 regions  did not exist, as it were, for 5 years, and it is only within  the last 1.5-2 years that work has begun on scientific  investigation of various aspects of the Russian Chernobyl  problem area. We would hope that this expert conclusion, as all  publications of ``Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster'' that  apply to the indivisible Chernobyl region of Russia, Ukraine and  Belarus, will draw attention of the public and of government  agencies of CIS nations to the need for increased activity in  work on Chernobyl, once more uniting the efforts of scientists  and specialists in solving a crucial problem of our time.    General Findings    The data given above show that in the near future there must  be a drastic increase in activity on studying contaminated  territories of the Russian Chernobyl. There is work to be done  on development, comprehensive discussion and acceptance of a  government program for organizing a permanently operating  monitoring service in each region of Russia that has been  subjected to radiation contamination.    I. The expert proposals set forth below on further  investigation of radiation conditions in Russia are aimed at  significantly increasing the extent of radioecological coverage  of the territory, and developing practical measures for  alleviating the radiation situation.    1. A proposal for aerophotographic-spectral surveys of  radioactive contamination of the locality in the European part  of Russia as a result of the Chernobyl accident includes:    -surveys of previously unstudied territories on a scale of  1:1,000,000:    Volgogradskaya Oblast; Kalmykia; Saratovskaya Oblast  (right-bank regions of the Volga); Nenets Province;    -a detailed examination of regions with elevated levels of  reserve of cesium-137 revealed as a result of work in 1991 on a  total area of 72,400 km[.sup]2[/] (Penzenskaya, Ulyanovskaya,  Saratovskaya and Novgordskaya Oblasts, and Mordovia).    2. Tracing Chernobyl contamination on the territory of  Siberia by aerophotographic spectral surveys on a scale of  1:5,000,000.    3. Setting up a computer database on radioactive  contamination and fallout of chemical products.    4. Publishing maps of radioactive and chemical contamination  in the first and second quarters of 1993.    5. Producing maps of chemical contamination for territories  where zones of radioactive contamination due to the Chernobyl  accident have been observed. This will enable an integrated  approach to assessments of the synergic (combined) effect of  anthropogenic contaminants on man.    II. Analysis of social aspects of migration of the  population  in radioactively contaminated regions of Russia, Belarus and  Ukraine suggests several general conclusions and some specific  forecasts relative to regions of the ``Russian Chernobyl.''    1. A study of the demographic situation in its various  aspects should be considered a component of the assessment of  long-term consequences of the Chernobyl accident, while  demographic forecasts should be one of the possible guidelines  of the outlook for development of the region.    2. In the near future, the demographic, economic,  psychological and political situation in the disaster zone,  especially including regions of Russia, will be determined to a  great extent by migration of the population. Efflux of the  population from rural localities and municipal settlements  constitutes the principal features of this migration.    3. Consequences of the efflux are important not just from  the  standpoint of future development of the regions themselves, but  also for the fate of several tens of thousands, and possible  even hundreds of thousands of people migrating ``at their own  peril and risk.'' This is essentially an open form of forced  migration, and the population taking part in this process should  rightfully be considered ecological refugees with corresponding  rights to housing in regions of lodging. A significant part must  be played by regions of Russia to which a flow of refugees is  coming from Belarus and Ukarine.    4. The scales of consequences of the migration go beyond the  confines of the region directly affected by the accident. The  large specific weight of movements between republics, especially  to Russia, confirms conclusions about the global nature, the  proliferation of consequences of the disaster, rather than  localization, as oficially expressed. In this connection, the  problem arises of forming reserve funds for building refugee  housing and developing a public health system. Appropriate  intergovernmental agreements are needed on arranging employment  for refugees.    5. Despite regional differences, it is by natural migration  that the populace is resolving the severe contradictions  existing since 1986. Trends of migration evidence poor  effectiveness of stabilization by compensatory measures directed  at alleviating the consequences of the disaster, especially in  the region of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' Therefore, the forecast  of migration subsumes at least two scenarios. According to the  first, the traditionally inertial scenario, events will occur in  accordance with the system set forth above. The second scenario  presumes an effective policy of compensations capable of  stabilizing the situation, and especially for the forthcoming  process of migration to the Russian Federation. The uniqueness  of the situation that has arisen as a result of the break of  economic ties and administrative structures of the former USSR,  there is no great optimism relative to the second scenario.  Nevertheless, implementation of new social guidelines of the  development of society should include as a priority a truly  effective and coordinated social policy in regions affected by  the Chernobyl disaster.    III. The consensus on results of expert work in assessing  the  state of health of the populace in the ``Russian Chernobyl''  subregion is set forth in the Conclusion of the corresponding  section. Therefore, we will limit ourselves here to a few of the  most pertinent conclusions drawn from development of a general  procedural approach and comprehensive multivariate statistical  analysis of medical demographic indicators and radioecological  factors of the habitat of the populace in radioactively  contaminated regions.    1. Contingent of people subjected to the action of radiation  and residing on various territories differ significantly in the  structure of morbidity. Ecological factors of the regions on the  whole have a noticeable effect on the state of health of the  populace residing there.    2. In regions with an elevated level of radiation  contamination, there is a considerable change in the structure  of morbidity due to an increase in the percentage of rare  illnesses: in regions of the Chernobyl zone as a whole, there is  a dramatic increase in the incidence (double or triple) of  diseases that are virtually not seen in Moscow.    3. Based on the example of Tulskaya Oblast, trustworthy dose  dependences have been discovered between morbidity and degree of  radiation contamination of regions, which serves as direct proof  of radiation causality of some illnesses.    4. Analysis of the dynamics of morbidity has revealed a  genuine change of morbidity with respect to a number of separate  nosological units both toward an increase, and toward a decrease.    5. The dynamics of the integral measure of deviation of  morbidity with respect to the totality of nosological units from  the initial (1985) state is markedly nonlinear. An assessment of  the direction of these changes shows that they are negative on  the whole: in the period following 1986, there is an increase in  morbidity, especially dramatic in 1986-1988, with some reduction  of the increase in morbidity and stabilization in 1990.    6. ``Splitting'' of the totality of illnesses into a group  with positive dynamics and a group with negative dynamics is  consistent with the concept of integrated action of factors of  the habitat on the organism as a hierarchical structure of  mutually regulated subsystems, and may serve as an argument  supporting this concept.    7. The time dependence of the integral index of  directionality of correlations between different illnesses shows  extremum behavior. The position of the maximum in 1986-1987  gives evidence of the important contribution of the radiation  component to the observed changes of morbidity.    8. Our approach allows an integral assessment of the state  of  health of the population of regions, tracking of dynamics, and  establishment of a relation between the state of health and the  degree of radiation contamination, which opens the way to  demarcation of territories of elevated risk and development of  purposeful and effective protective measures.</p>

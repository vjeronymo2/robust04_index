Muhammad  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Khalifi and Muhammad al-Mahi told  interrogators on Sudan television that their group, Takfir and  Hijrah, believes that present day Muslims are "infidels". "All  the contemporary Muslim society is infidel and has got to be  fought including the leadership of all Sudanese fundamentalist  groups," said Khalifi.    The attack on the mosque in Omdurman on 4 February claimed  the lives of 19 worshipers and wounded others.    Khalifi said the attackers wanted the head of the Ansar  al-Sunnah group, Zubayr Muhammad Hamzah, who led Friday prayers  at the mosque. He said their hit-list included a Muslim  fundamentalist who was leader of the dissolved National Islamic  Front, Hasan al-Turabi, and two leaders of the Muslim  brotherhood, Hibir Yusuf and Sulayman Abu-Naru.    Khalifi was shown on television still suffering from  injuries  he sustained in the shoot-out with security forces on 5  February, in which two other assailants, Yasir Muhammad Api and  'Abd-al-Baqi Yusuf, were killed. He said their hit list also  included veterans of the war in Afghanistan who lived and worked  with an exiled Saudi businessman, Usamah Bin Ladin, whose villa  the group also stormed.    Khalifi told an investigator that his group does not pray in  mosques, "because the mosques of today are frequented by  infidels". He said he is a descendant of a family that emigrated  early this century from the desert area of Najd in today's Saudi  Arabia and settled in Libya. He said that his father works for  the Sirte Oil Company in Libya. Al-Mahi said Khalifi's two  accomplices were originally members of the Ansar al-Sunnah  group, who broke away because of "certain differences". Al-Mahi  said he participated in the planning, but refused to take part  in the assault "because it will destroy the image of our group".    He said they targeted the Ansar al-Sunnah mosque and the  Islamic militant leaders "because these leaders did not declare  war against Muslim mysticisms (sufi Moslems), who are seen by  our group as enemies of Allah".    Worshipers at the Ansar al-Sunnah group also believe Muslim  sufis are infidels. Asked why he did not report the plan to the  police, he replied: "since the group believes all the society is  infidel, we should not deal with or come in contact with any of  its organizations, including the police."    The Ministry of the Interior, in a statement after the  television interview, said that the suspects would be put on  trial as soon as investigations were completed. It also  promised to give them a fair trial.</p>

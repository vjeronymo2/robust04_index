			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Hong Kong to leave China higher reserves HONG KONG is planning to leave to China an accumulated budget surplus nearly two and a half times the level promised by Britain last September in an accord between the two countries. Mr Hamish MacLeod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said in his maiden budget yesterday that by March 1997 the government planned to have accumulated fiscal reserves of HKDollars 71.6bn (Pounds 5.26bn). Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. Last September Mr John Major, the British prime minister, undertook to leave the new Hong Kong government with reserves of HKDollars 25bn, including outstanding debt no greater than HkDollars 5bn. This pledge came amid agreement with Beijing that the colony could build a HKDollars 100bn airport and related infrastructure projects. Mr MacLeod said that at the end of March 1997 the colony's reserves would amount to HKDollars 62.8bn and outstanding debt, which is included in reserves, would be HkDollars 4.8bn. To achieve this outcome he raised the corporate tax rate to 17.5 per cent from 16.5 per cent, despite having a large budget surplus. It is understood that the Hong Kong government wanted a sizeable fiscal cushion up until 1997 to ensure that unforeseeable events, such as a worsening in the world economy, troubles in China, or a loss of investor confidence in the colony did not leave it unable to meet its spending plans. Mr MacLeod said in his budget speech that the projected level of reserves would also have the additional advantage of demonstrating the colony's financial strength and prudence. 'This should do much to reassure potential lenders at a time when we shall be financing our infrastructural development,' he said. His forecast for the level of reserves are based on 5 per cent real growth in the Hong Kong economy over the next five years and inflation, as measured by the gross domestic product deflator, rising at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent during that period. Consumer price inflation is expected to rise at a faster rate. The forecasts appear to be based on no significant changes to the cost of the airport and related developments. Many of these projects are close to the limits of technology, and are planned on an extremely tight time scale. Some time slippage has already occurred. The government's capital spending and related equity commitments connected with the airport development are set to balloon from the 1993-94 fiscal year on. This increase in capital spending will push the colony's public finances into deficit - the first time in years that the government will run a deficit not brought about by a downturn in the economic cycle. On the capital side, the government is planning to spend HKDollars 176.5bn of which HKDollars 44bn is attributable to the airport.</p>

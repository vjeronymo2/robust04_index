			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swahili </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tanzania has strongly denied statements issued by  opponents of the ruling party in Mozambique, Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front], that Tanzania is preparing a force to invade  that country if Frelimo is defeated in the forthcoming  multiparty election. The deputy premier and minister of home  affairs, the Honorable Augustine Mrema, who is visiting  Mozambique, denied the allegations at a dinner given for him by  his counterpart, the Mozambican interior minister, Colonel Jorge  Manuel Antonio.    Speaking to Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network by  telephone  from Maputo, the Honorable Mrema said Mozambique had been led by  Mozambicans ever since it attained its independence in 1975.  Tanzania therefore had no reason whatsoever to prepare a force  to invade the country. The minister said that what the citizens  of Mozambique now wanted was peace to rebuild their country, and  that Tanzania supported all efforts being made in Mozambique to  bring that peace about. The Honorable Mrema also assured  Mozambique that Tanzania would continue to condemn any intrigues  aimed at bringing about war and disrupting peace in Mozambique.</p>

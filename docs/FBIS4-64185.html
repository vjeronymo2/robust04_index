			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Economics Affairs Minister Guenther Rexrodt in </F> the Bundestag in Bonn, in a debate on the spring report of six  leading German economic research institutes; broadcast in  progress -- live]    [Excerpts] ...points to the fact that we are on the right  track with our economic policy [applause]. The predictions  submitted by five of the six institutes are at the upper limit  of the margin predicted by the government in January. You,  Professor Jens, ought really to show some remorse here and  clearly distance yourself from your polemical remarks which were  marked by little economic understanding.    We have the chance that actual growth this year could turn  out to be even higher than predicted in the institutes' report.  The current economic indicators, and I would ask you to take a  look at them, point to a tangible improvement in the overall  economic situation. Business expectations in west German  industry, an important early indicator of future economic  developments, have improved substantially, as IFO [Institute for  Economic Research] shows.    In the autumn of 1992 pessimistic responses outnumbered  optimistic responses by 42; today the positive expectations  outnumber the negative by eight. Incoming orders in the  manufacturing sector were 2.5 percent higher in real terms  during the first two months of this year than the same period a  year ago. Incoming orders from abroad have risen 9 percent in  real terms. At the same time, the construction sector has  recorded an increase in orders of 8.5 percent, and housing  construction registered growth of no less than 30 percent.  Exports during January and February rose 2.5 percent compared  with the same period last year, and industrial capacity  utilization has been increasing tangibly since the third quarter  of last year.    In all, gross domestic product is likely to be substantially  higher during the first quarter of 1994 than over the same  period last year. Permit me to say with regard to eastern  Germany, I can only advise the ladies and gentlemen of the  opposition to gain an impression at first hand of the  determination with which people are tackling things there.  Statistics give only an abstract picture. The real picture is  positive. Construction orders have risen 37 percent, and by 85  percent in housing construction. Building activity overall is  up 20 percent. [passage omitted: Social Democratic Party Deputy  Uwe Jens criticizes earlier predictions and says unemployment  will continue to increase]    I cannot agree with you, let me say that straight away. But  your prayer wheel-like comments about poor economic prospects  are refuted by the facts I have just described. When you talk  of flourishing landscapes, the chancellor and all of us were  wrong in terms of the timescale, and we have had to revise our  estimates because we did not know the extent to which the GDR's  economy had decayed and no one knew that the Soviet Union would  not continue in its existing form. What we have achieved in  eastern Germany over the last three years, in spite of assuming  such a legacy, is something to be proud of and the people in  eastern Germany won't let you talk as if it doesn't exist. They  are confident, they know that things are getting better, it just  doesn't suit you in political terms that things are getting  better; it's as simple as that; you can talk as much as you  like, but the people involved know better. [passage omitted]    Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not dispute the fact that we  have huge problems on the labor market. We cannot sit back and  relax as a result of the signs that the recession is over. No  one would deny that strong economic growth is not sufficient to  solve the structural problems of unemployment. I can only say  we must initially keep a hold on things and the people of this  country must also be aware that we have found our feet with  regard to the economy, that interest rates are noticeably lower,  that profits are rising again and thus conditions for investment  have improved, and, particularly, that the unions and trade  unions have more understanding, also with regard to the  flexibility which is necessary.    We have structured our economic policy in such a way that,  due to the improved economic conditions, we will not hesitate  and will not ease off in our efforts to get to grips with the  structural problems which have grown, not only in our country  but also due to world economic developments. As businesses and  employers, and also as a state, we have to do a whole lot more  in the areas of research, development, and innovation. We have  to improve our presence on the booming markets all over the  world. I have just returned from the Asian-Pacific conference,  and if you can go and see what is happening outside Germany in  this region, then you will return convinced that we will not  succeed without additional stability, without additional  efforts, without changes which will lead to an end to the  paralysis. However, I am optimistic that we can achieve this.    Ladies and Gentlemen: We have a number of aims to achieve,  which we are constantly pursuing. We have -- I just mentioned  this -- made mistakes in the areas of research, development, and  innovation. The answer is not merely to put a few million marks  more into large companies for research purposes. The answer can  only be to change our education system to make it more  efficient, introduce more interchangeability, and finally  overcome the hostility to technology in this country, the  skepticism, which you are increasing every day. [applause]    The structural problems and thus unemployment can only be  overcome when we finally get round to removing and simplifying  laws and statutes, stop putting off deregulation, and put  speedier processes in place in the towns and villages --  especially in the ones governed by you [Social Democratic Party]  -- thus giving people the feeling that when they go to the  administration the people working there are working for them,  the citizens, and not the other way round. That is what we mean  by deregulation. [applause]    We want to continue privatization and believe we have made  quite some progress on this score as a federal government. Not  many states and local communities have done so; quite a lot  still remains to be done there. We have already talked about  the consolidation of budgets, Ladies and Gentlemen. The  government's consolidation course will be continued rigidly and  consistently. No one would deny that state borrowing is too  high, and no one would deny that we cannot afford to let net  borrowing go on growing as it has done in recent years. I  would, however, like to ask, as others have done, for fairness.  We would like it to be noted and appreciated why things have  developed like this. We have had to tackle a task which no  other country has had to tackle in these dimensions. We must  now simply remain consistent. [passage omitted]    Ladies and Gentlemen: I am not one to deny that wage  restraint affects incomes and influences demand in a negative  way. Who would deny that? That is an economic truism. But we  are in a situation where we must strike a balance between this  fact -- the fall in demand -- and the fact of the burden on  companies' costs. When I see that we cannot sell our products  any more and others are producing just as high quality products  at different prices in Asia, then I must give greater weight for  now to the reduction of the cost burden on companies. That is  simply the way things are. At another time and in another place  we might talk about the effect on demand; no one will refuse to  do that. These are fundamental economic truths which you [the  opposition] do not appreciate because you do not have the  competence. People can see that. [passage omitted]    The high rate of taxation amd its high increase over the  past few years was a consequence of reunification. I've already  said that. We have to return quickly to the level of taxation  we had prior to reunification and that is exactly the opposite  of what you want in the SPD [Social Democratic Party]. The  research institutes rightly stress that a high burden of  taxation affects those who make a great contribution to the  growth in the national product most. These are precisely the  people that you in the SPD want to increase the burden of  taxation on. The SPD's idea of getting additional tax revenue  wholly from the so- called higher earners is not a medicine, it  is poison for the economy and jobs. How can you promise your  clients more milk if you want to take away fodder from the cows?  [passage omitted]    We do not need another redistribution in the way the SPD  suggests, in which everyone is worse off in the end. What we  need is a high degree of investment for new jobs and we need  this over the next few years. A return to the sort of  developments we were able to achieve in the 1980's is the aim of  the German Government's economic and financial policy. In  contrast to you, the government has the right concept and  expertise for this.    I would also like to tell Mr. Klose, who finished with a  personal forecast, that your forecast will not come true as long  as you paint a gloomy and pessimistic picture and as long as you  talk down this location [Germany as a business and investment  site]. This location is a good one, ladies and gentlemen, and  we count on that location, on market forces, on our people, on  our companies. We are counting on competitive conditions  strengthening, on an improvement in those conditions. We are  counting on a drop in costs, a reduction in over-regulation, we  are counting on greater representation in the booming markets.  We are counting on flexibility and we are counting on  cooperation between the economy and state and trade unions in an  industrial policy which we are pursuing every day, in a way that  is correct -- namely, not by shifting responsibilities, but by  achieving consensus, listening to people, and making  concessions. That is our policy and you have nothing to add to  it other than a taxation of higher earners and that is too  little. People know this and for that reason this government,  Mr. Klose, Ladies and Gentlemen, has the best possible chance of  taking responsibility for the welfare of the Germans for a long  time to come.

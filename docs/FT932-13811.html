			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Balkan Conflict: Moslems begin to surrender weapons The disarmament of Moslems in Srebrenica, the besieged eastern Bosnian town, was completed and the town demilitarised by noon yesterday, UN General Lars-Eric Wahlgren said yesterday in a statement released in Zagreb. Moslem troops surrendered their weapons to United Nations peacekeepers under a ceasefire agreement between the warring Serb and Moslem sides signed last weekend. 'From reports I have received from my officers in Srebrenica I can confirm that from noon today the town has been demilitarised,' the commander of UN peace-keepers said. A spokesman for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor), said earlier there were only a handful of Moslem soldiers left in Srebrenica after months of fierce fighting in which hundreds have died. He said the remaining fighters had probably fled to the hills, taking their arms with them. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner of Refugees resumed aid convoys carrying food for the remaining 30,000 inhabitants of Srebrenica. But UN aid workers thought it unlikely the trucks would be able to resume evacuation of wounded, sick and elderly people. The UN has been using French and British helicopters to bring out the most serious cases and nearly 500 have already been evacuated by this means. Unprofor wants to fly out 100 more. In central Bosnia, sporadic clashes between Moslem and Croat fighters continued around the town of Vitez, in spite of a UN-mediated truce. Some 250 people have been killed in this latest round of fighting between the two formally allied factions. British officers of UN forces reported numerous atrocities in the area.</p>

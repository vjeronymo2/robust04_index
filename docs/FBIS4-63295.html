			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- Having met in Vilnius  Thursday [19 May], Lithuanian and Belarusian defense ministers  expect to establish permanent neighborly partnership relations.    A delegation of Belarusian defense officials, headed by  Defense Minister Col. Gen. Pavel Kazlowski, met with Lithuanian  Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius, Parliament Chairman Ceslovas  Jursenas and visited the Gelezinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) field  brigade.    Both ministers agree that the 720-kilometer  Lithuanian-Belarusian border is an incentive to cooperate. This  argument seems to be above the differences in defense concepts.    Lithuania links its security guarantees with integration  into  NATO, while Belarus is a member of the collective security  system of the CIS. But Linkevicius and Kazlowski maintain that  the fact cannot hinder bilateral cooperation.    Linkevicius told reporters that contacts would be easier if  Belarus joined NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program.    The Belarusian Government is now discussing the degree of  the  country's possible participation in the program, Kazlowski said  at a press conference.    The Belarusian minister said relations with the Baltics are  especially significant to Belarus. Kazlowski said his country  would like to learn more about Lithuania's experience in  creating its armed forces.    The two ministers agreed to set up working groups to  continue  the dialogue started in Vilnius and to determine areas for  possible cooperation.</p>

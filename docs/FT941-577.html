			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact deal likely Coffee producers and consumers are expected tomorrow to agree to set up a new five-year international coffee pact to take over from the much-extended existing accord on October 1. The council of the International Coffee Organisation is due to finalise the agreement after exporting and importing nations reached a compromise late on Friday on the question of so-called economic measures designed to balance supply and demand. The consumers, who are reluctant to revive interventionist measures such as export quotas, accepted the producers' desire to have an 'open door' to discussion of such measures in the future. Economic measures were dropped from the current agreement in 1989. The terms of the new pact state that the council may consider negotiating a completely fresh international coffee agreement that includes measures to balance the market. This means that producing countries will be free to raise the matter at future council meetings. Consumers are unlikely to show interest in resurrecting controls unless coffee prices rise substantially, said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London trade house. 'If coffee prices doubled, they might decide it's something that would be worthwhile,' he said. Producing countries have, however, helped boost prices since last October through their export retention scheme.</p>

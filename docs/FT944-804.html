			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: NatWest sells stake in Dutch bank National Westminster Bank is to sell its 78.2 per cent stake in F van Lanschot Bankiers, the Dutch bank, to a group of banks and institutional investors in the Netherlands. The sale, which ends a 21-year relationship between the two banks, follows a difference of opinion about future strategy in private banking. No financial details were disclosed but NatWest said it was 'more than satisfied' with the price. Van Lanschot, a medium-sized bank focusing on wealthy private clients, institutional investors and family-owned companies, had net assets of about Fl 340m (Pounds 113m) in December 1993. Mr Bert Heemskerk, management board chairman of van Lanschot, said the bank did not want to concentrate exclusively on private banking, as NatWest wished. The Dutch bank believed there was important synergy between its commercial banking activities for family-owned companies and its private banking aimed at wealthy clients in the Benelux countries. A stake of 21.2 per cent will be sold on December 30 to Friesland Bank, a regional co-operative bank which wants to develop commercial links with van Lanschot. The rest is being sold in smaller parcels to ABN Amro Bank, ING Group and AVCB, the insurance group, as well as to the National Investment Bank and Nederlandse Participatie Maatschappij, a venture capital group. The sale is a forerunner to a flotation over the next three to five years, when 20 to 25 per cent of the shares are to be sold on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.</p>

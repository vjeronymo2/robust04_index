			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Chinese promises lift HK to record high Hong Kong featured firmly last week, as a downward correction on Wall Street after its record-breaking run and a stabilisation in the Nikkei average around the 17,000 level caused a 0.6 per cent drop in the FT-Actuaries World index in local currency terms. Strong international buying lifted Hong Kong by 4.5 per cent to an all-time high, following a positive statement from Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, that economic reforms should be speeded up in order to boost economic growth. HK Telecom, the market's largest stock and accounting for 12.5 per cent of the total capitalisation, climbed 85 cents to HKDollars 9.40 on the week. The market was also boosted by publication at the end of the previous week of Hang Seng Bank's inner reserves, which led to a rerating of the banking sector. Pleasing results from Wharf Holdings was a further bull point. By contrast, politics took a back seat, and the appointment of Mr Chris Patten as the colony's new governor was largely ignored. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London says that while there is some short-term froth on the market, it is still cheap on a longer term basis, especially if there is further evidence of a turnround in the US economy. The second-best performer on the week was also in the Pacific region, as a survey showing an increase in business confidence boosted New Zealand by 3.5 per cent. There were no serious casualties last week, though Canada fell 2.1 per cent in local currency terms. The Toronto stock market has been depressed by Olympia &amp; York's financing troubles and the decline in gold and oil prices. The 1.6 per cent drop in US equities also weighed on their Canadian counterparts. Political uncertainty had little effect in Europe: Italy rose 0.3 per cent in spite of having no government, while troubles in Mr Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition inflicted a 0.2 per cent fall on German shares.</p>

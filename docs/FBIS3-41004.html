			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva February 2 TASS -- Now it is important to  give a good and energetic start to the U.N. disarmament  conference, which is encountering new difficult problems, above  all, the task of working out an international treaty on a  universal ban on nuclear tests, Russia's permanent  representative in the conference Grigoriy Berdennikov said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday.    Berdennikov noted Russia's principle readiness to go in for  concluding at present such a treaty, which can be subjected to  checking, and emphasised that Russia will construct its stand at  the talks in such a way that they are mainly completed, possibly  by the spring of 1995.    The Russian delegation attaches top priority to the nuclear  test ban talks in 1994, Berdennikov said. According to him, the  question of the scope of the treaty should be decided on the  basis of already existing international accords, above all, the  Moscow treaty of 1963, which bans nuclear tests in three  mediums, of course, with the inclusion of a ban on underground  tests. Russia advocates an unlimited and non-discriminatory  character of the treaty and equal rights and responsibilities of  all its participants, he said.    The agreement should apply not only to nuclear states, but  also to those which are capable of making nuclear weapons. The  treaty should come into force after the submission of  ratification deeds, provided they include deeds of all states,  which possess nuclear power plants and research reactors at the  time of signing the document. There is a need to impose the  strictest sanctions on participating countries which violate its  main statutes, right up to imposing economic or other measures  of compulsions stipulated by the UN Charter.    The delegation also favours working out a multilateral  agreement on guarantees of the security of non-nuclear states.</p>

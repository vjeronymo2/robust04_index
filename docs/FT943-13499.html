			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Opposition fails to halt Petron sale The second stage of the Philippines' largest privatisation, a public offering of shares representing 20 per cent of oil-refiner Petron, got under way yesterday in spite of attempts in the Supreme Court by the government opposition to derail it. Petron is the Philippines' largest oil refining and marketing company, with an estimated 45 per cent share of the local market for petroleum products. The latest offer of 1bn shares is intended to reduce the government's holding to 40 per cent. Last December, the Saudi Arabian Aramco oil group bought a 40 per cent stake with a bid of Dollars 502m. The new offer is being made in two batches. The first, on offer from yesterday until August 5, is for 700m shares, at a price of 9 pesos a share. This batch will be restricted to Filipino investors. The remaining 300m shares will be offered in blocks of at least 6,000 shares, with a minimum tender price of 9 pesos a share. Opposition members of Congress have initiated a case in the Philippine Supreme Court to stop the sell-off which, they say, puts local investors at a disadvantage. The minimum price of 9 pesos for the current stock offering is higher than the equivalent 6.70 pesos paid by Aramco for the 40 per cent it won last December.</p>

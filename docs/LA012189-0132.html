			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRANDAD SAYS BONE PIECES AREN'T LAURA'S  </P> <P> The grandfather of Laura Bradbury, who disappeared more than 4 years ago from a  family campsite at Joshua Tree National Monument, angrily repudiated a  televised report Friday that said skull fragments found in the Morongo Basin in  1986 were those of his granddaughter.  </P> <P> "Baloney!" Dana Winters said. "Don't you think if they had found that the  skeletal remains had matched up that they would have notified the parents?  Don't you think that's the logical thing?"  </P> <P> KCBS-TV reported Friday evening that recent DNA testing at an unnamed "eastern  laboratory" on the skull fragments indicated a "99% probability of a match"  with the Huntington Beach child, who was 3 years old when she disappeared on  Oct. 18, 1984. The station did not cite its sources for the report.  </P> <P> Winters said his son-in-law and daughter, Mike and Patty Bradbury, were  recently asked by the news media to comment on those tests. The couple were out  of town Friday and not available for comment, but Winters said they both  discredited the DNA test results.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooperation Cited  </P> <P> The missing girl's grandfather said that the Bradburys had cooperated with  investigators for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department more than 2  years ago, when the bone fragments were first discovered.  </P> <P> At that time, a forensic anthropologist at Cal State Fullerton was unable to  determine whether they were Laura's. In fact, anthropologist Judy Suchey found  that the fragments were from a child between the ages of 2 and 5 who had been  dead for less than 2 years, but she was unable to determine either the sex of  the child or its ethnic origin.  </P> <P> "And Patty and Mike also couldn't believe the skull was ever Laura's because  the location where it was found was in an unaccessible area and impossible for  a child to get into," Winters said.  </P> <P> "But isn't it interesting how whoever is quoting this latest test never reveals  the source? And if it's a testing laboratory, well, tell me which one. Doesn't  it seem odd to you? Like as if someone is trying to get publicity?"  </P> <P> Since Suchey's examination, the Bradburys have not been contacted by any  scientific laboratory, Winters said, indicating that any blood tests that would  be needed for DNA analysis had to have been taken 2 years ago. At that time,  several San Bernardino sheriff's spokesmen, including Sheriff Floyd Tidwell,  discounted the tests, saying that "not enough positive evidence" was found to  say conclusively that the skull was Laura's.  </P> <P> "The only thing we could tell was that it was a skull of a human child," Phil  Alexander, chief deputy coroner of San Bernardino County, told The Times  earlier.  </P> <P> Winters said that Mike Bradbury hasn't stopped looking for his daughter,  despite reports that he and Patty Bradbury have given up hope and planned to  get on with their lives. The couple do not believe that the fragments are  Laura's, and Mike Bradbury has expressed anger at authorities for how the  investigation was handled, Winters added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Truth to Report'  </P> <P> "As far as Mike and Patty are concerned, there is no truth to this report and  no truth that they have given up," Winters said.  </P> <P> KCBS-TV reporter Dave Lopez said that the fragments analyzed under the DNA  process were studied at the request of the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department.  That department, however, has refused to confirm or deny the report.  </P> <P> Patty Bradbury, who has waged a dispute for several years with the San  Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, has suggested she will not believe any  study that involves that agency.  </P> <P> KCBS-TV said a final report on the DNA analysis is due within the next 60 days.  </P></p>

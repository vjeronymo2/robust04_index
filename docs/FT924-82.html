			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Business failures up 31% to new peak BUSINESS failures in Britain rose 31 per cent to a record 62,767 this year, with small companies hit particularly hard, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, reported yesterday. The sharpest increase in overall business failures took place in south-east England outside London, with a 46 per cent rise, followed by Scotland and south-west England with increases of 36 per cent and 35 per cent respectively. Many of these failures are thought to have been companies founded in the late-1980s boom. More than a third of failures - 37 per cent - took place in London and the south-east. These two regions also saw the largest concentration of failures among bigger companies, with 52 per cent of liquidations of limited companies in Britain. Business failures reached a new quarterly high of 16,222 in the final quarter of this year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet noted, however, that the rate of increase in business failures slowed in 1992 compared with 1991, when the total increased by 65 per cent to 47,777 from 28,935 in 1990. Liquidations of limited companies increased by 11 per cent to 22,938 in 1992 while bankruptcies, which generally apply to small non-corporate businesses, sole traders and partnerships, increased by 47 per cent to 39,829. The statistics do not cover Northern Ireland. Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said that the slower failure rate among larger companies was reflected in the increased problems of small companies. Bigger companies had stayed in business by cutting costs, postponing investment plans and 'in many cases delaying payments'. He said: 'All of these factors rebounded on to the smaller firms, which in addition have been weighed down with the crippling burden of bad debts.' A separate Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey of about 1,500 managing directors this month found that nearly one in five companies is writing off at least Pounds 100 for every Pounds 1,000 of sales as bad debt, while one in eight is writing off more than 15 per cent of sales as unrecoverable payments. In a joint statement Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, and Ms Harriet Harman, his deputy, called on the government to take immediate action 'to remedy Britain's dwindling industrial capacity'. They said that otherwise 'thousands of companies' would close in 1993 on top of the weekly toll of 1,200 business failures shown in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet figures. But the Treasury said that business failure statistics lagged behind the cycle of economic activity and that prospects had improved. The Treasury said that not only did Britain have low inflation, a more competitive pound and the lowest interest rates in Europe, but recent consumer and business confidence surveys together with anecdotal evidence such as the strong start to the winter sales were encouraging.

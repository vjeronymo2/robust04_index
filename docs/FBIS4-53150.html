			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia is considering a request from the United  Nations to send troops to the central African nation of Rwanda  where heavy fighting is taking place. Discussions will be held  this week between the Departments of Defense and Foreign Affairs  on the UN request.    Defense Department spokesman, Brigadier Adrian d'Hage said  Australia was likely to provide a technical and engineering  support for a UN force, but peacekeeping troops were usually  sent only after some form of political settlement had been  reached.    [Begin d'Hage recording] The sort of things that will be  assessed this week are firstly the risk and security of our own  troops. There was always a risk when you put military people  in, but the risk has to be acceptable and we will also be  looking at the likely duration. So there are a lot of factors  to be considered before recommendations are made to government  and government makes a decision. [end recording]</p>

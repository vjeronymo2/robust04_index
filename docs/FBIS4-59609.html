			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter: "Jordan Ready To </F> Give Humanitarian Aid to Yemen but No Mediation"]    [Text] Amman -- His Majesty King Husayn has reiterated  Jordan's readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to Yemen  but said the Kingdom would not interfere in the internal affairs  of the war-torn Arab Peninsula country.    During a meeting with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah, who paid a brief visit to the Kingdom Thursday [12  May], the King expressed concern with maintaining the unity of  Yemen and ending the bloodshed between forces loyal to South  Yemeni leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih.    Mr. Basindwah, who is on a tour of Arab countries to inform  them of the developments in the Yemeni conflict, left Jordan for  Damascus after delivering to King Husayn a verbal message from  Mr. Salih.    In an arrival statement carried by the Jordan News Agency,  Petra, Mr. Basindwah praised the role Jordan played in trying to  mediate the crisis between former socialist South Yemen and the  Conservative North before the political crisis there erupted  into full-fledged civil war earlier this month.    "Jordan entered the Yemeni history" when in February it  hosted the signing of a reconciliation agreement between Mr.  Salih and Mr. al-Bid, said Mr. Basindwah.    He also thanked the Kingdom for treating some of the wounded  in the war, which has claimed thousands of casualties since it  started 11 days ago. Jordan has also sent a medical team to  help treat war victims.    After the war erupted, North Yemen rejected any foreign  mediation effort, insisting on a military settlement of the  conflict, but indicated it would accept a negotiated settlement  to the crisis after it had become clear that it will not be able  to achieve a military victory.    An Arab League delegation was on its way to Sanaa in a bid  to  end the conflict but Mr. Basindwah said the league did not offer  mediation. its delegation would only "review developments in  the situation in Yemen," he said.    Prime Minister Abd al-Salam al-Majali has said that Jordan  would not mediate in the conflict unless both parties to it  agree on the Kingdom's role, adding that Jordan would not  "interfere in support of either parties to the crisis."    Dr. al-Majali said King Husayn had telephoned both Mr.  al-Bid  and Mr. Salih in a bid to end the fighting but North Yemen sees  any foreign intervention as meddling in its internal affairs.    Jordan has evacuated over 750 Jordanians from Yemen on board  military aircraft, and Royal Jordanian (RJ) airliners. RJ has  halted its flights to the country, which observers say would be  dragged into a protracted civil war unless a negotiated  settlement is found.</p>

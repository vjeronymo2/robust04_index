			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Poll pledge by Yeltsin as deputies defy decree: Government says parliament action could 'trigger war' PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin announced yesterday he was likely to stand for re-election in an early presidential poll next June, as Russian parliamentary deputies met in special session to defy his decree casting them aside. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the legislature's speaker, opened the meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies despite Mr Yeltsin's decree on Tuesday dissolving parliament ahead of elections for a new-style body in December. The deputies ignored a government warning that the mutinous gathering could 'trigger war'. Fuelling tension in Moscow, Russian news agencies reported a policeman had been killed and another wounded by unidentified gunmen in a foiled attempt last night to break into the military headquarters of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor to the former Soviet Union. One agency said the gunmen were hard-line army officers who support Russia's conservative parliament in its struggle with Mr Yeltsin and the reformers around him. A crowd of 2,000 anti-Yeltsin campaigners last night cheered a decision of the Congress, meeting at Moscow's White House, to uphold a vote on Wednesday by a smaller parliamentary body, the Supreme Soviet, to impeach Mr Yeltsin. Deputy prime minister Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin, said the authorities had no intention of forcibly expelling deputies from the White House. But General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, said police and interior ministry troops 'were ready to use force against groups of bandits if provocation threatened peoples' lives' at the gathering. The government said it was cutting off financing for parliament and taking over its buildings, its newspaper and its television programmes. 'The whole question is now a war of nerves. The question is who will make the first mistake,' said Mr Andrei Fyodorov, an aide to Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president installed by parliament as temporary president. Mr Rutskoi, who last night endorsed so far ineffectual calls for a general strike across Russia in protest at Mr Yeltsin's moves, made clear he would not stand in the next poll for president. Mr Yeltsin showed his readiness to put his job on the line along with the deputies by promising an early presidential poll on June 12, six months after parliamentary elections and two years ahead of schedule. He also embarked on a strategy combining intimidation and seduction to convince deputies and regional councils to give up their resistance to his moves to break Russia's political deadlock. A majority of Russia's 88 local councils have joined deputies in denouncing as unconstitutional the decree dissolving parliament and convening fresh elections to a modern bicameral assembly. By contrast, only four of the 88 local governments - which, unlike the councils, are mostly appointed by the president - have come out against Mr Yeltsin. The government said that only those councils which actually blocked preparations for elections would be dissolved. It warned deputies they would be liable to criminal prosecution for disobeying the president's decree, but said they would be forgiven if they gave up.

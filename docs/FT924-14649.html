			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Three main parties spurn Peru election REGISTRATION for candidates in Peru's congressional elections will close at midnight tonight, three prominent parties having decided not to field candidates. Peruvians will vote on November 22 for a new, 80-member 'democratic constituent congress'. President Alberto Fujimori is hoping for a majority so as to continue economic liberalisation and structural reform. Also, the resumption of much-needed international financial assistance to Peru, frozen since the president dissolved the previous Congress and suspended the constitution on April 5, depends on a return to democracy. The parties not fielding candidates argue that the new Congress, charged with writing a new constitution, already has its hands tied by Mr Fujimori. Opposition to his regime by former presidents Fernando Belaunde and Alan Garca has ensured that their parties, Popular Action and Apra respectively, will not run. The right-wing Freedom movement of Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, defeated by Mr Fujimori in the last presidential election, has also refused to participate. MR Abimael Guzman, founder-leader of the Shining Path left-wing guerrilla movement in Peru, was found guilty of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday, after a 10-day summary trial by a closed court martial at a naval base, agencies report from Lima. He can appeal to a 'war council' and, if his conviction is upheld there, to Peru's Supreme Military Court. President Alberto Fujimori has announced an accelerated appeals procedure, to be completed within five days.</p>

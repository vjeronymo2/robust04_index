			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Baghdad breathes a heavy sigh of relief IRAQ'S offer of a ceasefire was met with relief by ordinary residents of Baghdad yesterday, who were sharply reminded of the perils of the Gulf war by Sunday night's air attack on the capital. But Iraqis are far from confident that things will change fundamentally for the better in the short term. They have been struggling under the trade embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council for nearly 2 1/2 years and there seems little reason to hope this will be rescinded soon, even with the advent of a new president in the White House. 'All presidents of the US are the same,' said an Iraqi academic yesterday. With most of its foreign assets frozen and the central bank's foreign currency reserves severely depleted, Iraq's ability to continue subsidising its self-sufficiency drive at current levelsis questionable. The severity of the economic situation in Iraq is apparent from the regime's attempts to implement an austerity programme at the same time as increasing concessions to the armed forces and the middle classes. Last month's ban on the import of 146 luxury items was accompanied by a 30 per cent pay increase for all government employees and a 40 per cent increase for the army and senior officials. The pay increases are expected to come into effect sometime this month. Amid the latest clashes between the allies and Iraq came an increase of up to 20 per cent on monthly rations such as sugar, tea, rice, flour, cooking oil, soap and detergents last Monday, and other concessions are said to be in the pipeline. Child allowances are expected to be raised from two Iraqi dinars per child per month to ID25 (Pounds 43 at the official rate) and the labour law is due for amendment to fix minimum salaries and annual pay rises. Although the drive for self-sufficiency in food is the acknowledged goal of the government, Iraq remains reliant on imports in virtually every sector apart from that of oil. In 1989 it spent an estimated Dollars 7.68bn on imports (although Dollars 2.7bn was for military purposes) and some argue it has only survived this long under international sanctions by paying out subsidies. Mr Mohammed Mahdi Salih, the minister of trade and industry, has argued that the impressive reconstruction programme since the end of the war - 90 per cent of damage from allied air attacks has been repaired, according to the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction - was paid for not in foreign currency but by using construction materials in stock and local production. But the country's gold-for-wheat deal, which took place last year when 14 shipments of imported Australian wheat was paid for by 10 tonnes of Iraqi gold, suggests that the regime's resources of hard currency are low.</p>

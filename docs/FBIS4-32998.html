			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 5 June Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella will  meet with Strobe Talbott, second in importance at the State  Department, to discuss the situation in Haiti. The meeting will  take place during a break in the OAS deliberations in Belem,  Brazil.    Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN that Di Tella wants to  discuss the scope of Argentina's participation in a multilateral  military intervention force aimed at reestablishing democracy in  Haiti, in case last week's UN resolution ordering a total naval  blockade of the country fails. [passage omitted]    Apparently Di Tella would be consulted about a U.S. idea to  create a police or military force with personnel from the entire  continent for that eventuality. Di Tella will possibly tell  Talbott whether Argentina is willing to send troops to  participate in that force. Di Tella has already told CLARIN  that the idea has the government's political support.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Graduate pay faces squeeze Expansion of higher education in the UK could force employers to change their recruitment strategies and reduce starting salaries, says a report published by the Institute of Manpower Studies today. Evidence from the US, where the number of university degrees awarded doubled between 1962 and 1972, and then continued to increase at a much slower rate, shows that real graduate starting salaries have fallen since 1969. In the UK, student numbers in higher education have increased by more than 50 per cent during the past five years, and similar trends are expected to develop. According to the IMS research, real US starting salaries peaked at Dollars 25,288 (at 1990 values) in 1969, and fell 16 per cent by 1990 to Dollars 21,319. The number of graduates failing to use their degree, or 'under-utilised', increased during the same period from 11 per cent to 20 per cent, and this proportion is projected to increase to 30 per cent by the year 2005. Such graduates ended up in jobs including retail sales, clerical work, and craft and labourer occupations not traditionally regarded as needing a degree. IMS also found profound changes in the way graduates looked for work, with students needing to be far more 'proactive' in looking for work.

Estonian government on January 7, 1993 concluded a $60  million agreement with state-owned Israeli arms company TAAS  under which the company must supply Estonia with arms by end of  1995 and Estonia must makes payments by 2000.    The deal brought about a political uproar in Estonia  resulting in ratification of the deal at Riigikogu's closed  session on December 15 last year with 57 affirmative votes  against 10 negative and two abstentions.    "The deal with Israel does not so much increase Estonian  national defence than the will to defend Estonian state," Rein  Helme, deputy head of the parliament's state defence commission,  said.    Estonia bought from Israel automatic rifles Galil (5.56 mm  caliber), machine guns Negev (5.56 mm), submachine guns  Mini-Uzi, sniper's rifles, grenade launchers, mortars,  antiaircraft guns, missiles, ammunition, radio transmitters.    First shipment arrived in Estonia last summer.</p>

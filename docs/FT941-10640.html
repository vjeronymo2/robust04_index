			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The derivatives sector saw one of its busiest days in recent sessions, with large turnover in both the Footsie futures and traded options as a firm Wall Street opening brought a turnround in the market, writes Joel Kibazo. The much feared early morning crash failed to materialise and the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at a reasonably controlled 3,403, just a five-point discount to cash. Strong selling across the board, led by the big institutions, saw March fall further, but this settled into two-way business in late morning trading. The anticipation, and later confirmation, of a strong performance in New York early yesterday helped March move firmly ahead and it finished at 3,413, a five-point discount to cash, following very heavy volume of 32,573 lots by the official close. A hectic session in the traded options brought hefty turnover of 66,805 contracts, of which 31,597 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 8,716 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Hanson led the league table among the stock options with a total of 2,556 lots dealt and was followed by HSBC at 2,264 trades. The new OMLX exchange dealing in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index futures and traded options had a poor day. . Having opened at 4,080, the March futures closed 20 ahead at 4,100 with volume a mere 272 contracts by its 6pm close.</p>

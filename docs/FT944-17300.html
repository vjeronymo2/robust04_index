			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Property: Cheer in the UK rental market - Cadogan's Place The UK market for buying and selling houses may be patchy, but the London rental market is thriving. Third-quarter statistics from Cluttons London Residential, show an average increase of 4.5 per cent in the quarter and of 10.6 per cent year-on-year. But the steep quarterly increase is unlikely to remain strong since it merely reflects the peak months when people relocate before school starts. This year, as economic recovery continues, more corporate staff are on the move than a year ago. The prime areas of Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea have led the recent charge with quarterly increases of more than 5 per cent. But, on an annual view, Fulham takes the prize with a rise of 20.9 per cent. Aylesford reports that the average rent for its lettings has increased from Pounds 480 a week a year ago to Pounds 515. Most properties are in the Pounds 400-Pounds 600 range. These increases will improve yields, which were 10 per cent in 1992 and 1993 but had fallen as property prices rose. For the prime areas, 8 to 8.5 per cent is now feasible. Investor-landlords seeking a still higher yield should turn to Battersea, Clapham or Fulham - which are not the parts of London on top of American corporate tenant lists. American tenants in the UK are usually on company lettings. These are always strong in central London, forming 36 per cent of Aylesford's tenants in 1993-94 as against 23 per cent from the UK. For 1991-93 the US proportion was higher at 43 per cent, and the UK 19 per cent. UK tenants mostly take assured shorthold tenancies, which give the landlord security of repossession under the Housing Act 1988. (Company lettings come under commercial law.) Unfurnished lettings are on the increase. Americans often prefer empty premises and the chance to ship over their own furniture and household items. Letting property abounds with quirks of law and practice, including coping with the Inland Revenue if one is a non-resident landlord. To guide landlords through the maze, Cluttons London Residential has published The Lettings Handbook, which aims to cover all the problems in a practical way. Call 071-824 8822 for a free copy. Property insurance is equally rich in difficulties, especially for listed buildings. The hugely expensive fires at Uppark and Windsor Castle, have put older properties in the spotlight. Owners who worry about what perils to cover, and how much cover they need, will find A Guide to the Insurance of Listed Buildings and their Contents helpful. This is produced by Jackson-Stops with brokers Gauntlet Heritage and Lycetts, Phillips, the auction house, Thames Valley Fire Protection and Sell Wade Postins, historic building architects. There is advice on saving money on flood, subsidence and contents insurance, types of fire alarms and what is involved in reinstating buildings after damage (since rebuilding costs vary sharply for older properties). The report costs Pounds 5 from Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff, 22 Hans Place, London SW1X OEP.</p>

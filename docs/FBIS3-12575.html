Kuwait said that it would be appropriate for the  International Committee of the Red Cross to have special  responsibility for civilians living under Israeli occupation  with a view to ensuring their safety.    In his address to the UN Security Council during a debate on  the situation in occupied Arab territories last night, Muhammad  Abu al-Hasan, Kuwait's permanent representative at the United  Nations, stressed the need to disarm Israeli settlers, some of  whom had perpetrated the vile massacre in Ibrahim's mosque in  Hebron last Friday.    The Kuwaiti representative said that the Security Council  had  to make Israel responsible for protecting Palestinians from the  recklessness of those who wanted to hinder the peace process.  He said that settlers had to be disarmed and the extremists  among them had to be put under constant surveillance. [passage  omitted]</p>

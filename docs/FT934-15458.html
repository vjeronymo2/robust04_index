			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Touche staff blacklisting to be raised in Commons THE BLACKLISTING of senior employees of a leading accountancy firm by the government is to be raised in the Commons next week. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said he would be asking questions about the blacklisting of Touche Ross staff from working on public-sector contracts. He said: 'The public is entitled to know what allegations are made against certain Touche Ross staff, and, if there are question marks over any aspect of this firm, why they continue to be instructed by the government.' Touche Ross, one of Britain's 'big six' accountancy firms, yesterday played down the impact of the government's advice blacklisting some of the firm's senior employees. The Treasury is understood to have circulated the advice in letters to senior civil servants earlier this year, after its decision last November to sue the firm over its role in the collapse of Barlow Clowes, the fund management company. Among the 13 employees affected are Mr John Connolly, the managing partner of the firm's London office. Five of Touche's 370 partners are also affected. All are either tax or audit specialists, most of whom worked on audits connected with Barlow Clowes, which was closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988. Touche Ross yesterday said it hoped to continue its public-sector practice, which has been built up over recent years. Mr John Roques, a senior partner, said: 'We are proud to be a major supplier of consulting and other advisory services to government. 'We have every expectation that we will continue to be selected on our merits to serve a wide variety of government departments.' The firm earned Pounds 58.3m from its consultancy services in the past financial year. Possibly more than half of this total was generated from public-sector contracts. Partners at other firms believe that Touche's business could be adversely affected. 'If it was us I would be desperate,' said a partner at one firm. Professionals point to the experience of Arthur Andersen, another of the big six, which was the subject of similar 'government guidance' nearly a decade ago. Andersen was auditor of the collapsed De Lorean car firm and is being sued by the government for alleged negligence. The firm has received no public-sector audit work in recent years. Touche has claimed it alerted the authorities to the fraud at Barlow Clowes and that it acted professionally.</p>

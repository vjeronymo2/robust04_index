			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Bank regulatory changes urged A BANK of England executive director yesterday told MPs that there could be a case for a single system of regulation for banks and building societies. Mr Brian Quinn, giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee's inquiry into the role of the Bank, argued that if restrictions on raising wholesale funds and making unsecured loans on building societies were changed, the case for maintaining two different regulatory regimes would need to be looked at again. Mr Quinn argued strongly that banking supervision should remain with the Bank even if it gained more independence.</p>

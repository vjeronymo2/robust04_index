			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government on Thursday expressed its regret over the recent  Amnesty International (AI) report that human rights conditions  have not improved in some sectors in South Korea under the new  administration.    Ham Myong-chol, the Foreign Ministry's director-general for  international organizations, said the government's regret was  contained in a message it delivered to the Amnesty International  through the Korean Embassy in London.    The government pointed out in the letter it was not  desirable  that AI published such a report at a time when follow-up  measures were being taken in the country to better institute the  democratic system.    "It seems that AI was not fully aware of the new  government's  democratization policies and that it observed Korea's human  rights conditions from the past's biased point of view," Ham  said.    He said it was especially regrettable that AI prepared the  report based only on the statements by those involved and their  families.    The official said the instances cited in the report were  cases of actual law violations such as espionage activities.  "There can be no political prisoners nor any acts of torture in  Korea since the birth of the civilian-led government," Ham said.</p>

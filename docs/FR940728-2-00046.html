Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Congress added a new subsection (k) to section 211 of the Clean Air Act. Subsection (k) prohibits the sale of gasoline that EPA has not certified as reformulated in the nine worst ozone nonattainment areas beginning January 1, 1995. To be certified as reformulated a gasoline must comply with the following formula requirements: oxygen content of at least 2.0 percent by weight; benzene content of no more than 1.0 percent by volume; and no heavy metals (with a possible waiver for metals other than lead). The gasoline must also achieve toxic and volatile organic compound emissions reductions equal to or exceeding the more stringent of a specified formula fuel or a performance standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(k)(10)(D) defines the areas covered by the reformulated gasoline program as the nine ozone nonattainment areas having a 1980 population in excess of 250,000 and having the highest ozone design values during the period 1987 through 1989. Applying those criteria, EPA has determined the nine covered areas to be the metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, Houston, New York City, Baltimore, Chicago, San Diego, Philadelphia, Hartford and Milwaukee. Under section 211(k)(10)(D), any area reclassified as a severe ozone nonattainment area under section 181(b) is also to be included in the reformulated gasoline program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any other ozone nonattainment area may be included in the program at the request of the governor of the state in which the area is located. Section 211(k)(6)(A) provides that upon the application of a Governor, EPA shall apply the prohibition against selling conventional gasoline (gasoline EPA has not certified as reformulated) in any area requested by the Governor which has been classified under subpart 2 of part D of title I of the Act as a Marginal, Moderate, Serious or Severe ozone nonattainment area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Subparagraph 211(k)(6)(A) further provides that EPA is to apply the prohibition as of the date the Administrator ``deems appropriate, not later than January 1, 1995, or 1 year after such application is received, whichever is later.'' In some cases the effective date may be extended for such an area as provided in section 211(k)(6)(B) based on a determination by EPA that there is ``insufficient domestic capacity to produce'' reformulated gasoline. Finally, EPA is to publish a governor's application in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . To date, EPA has received and published applications from the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Governors of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Texas. Although Vermont has requested to opt-in to the program, states without ozone nonattainment areas, such as Vermont, can not do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA promulgated such designations pursuant to section 107(d)(4) of the Act (56 FR 56694; November 6, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Marcolino Moco by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given --  recorded].    [Correspondent] In your capacity as prime minister, what  do you think about reports concerning the ongoing peace talks?  Is peace still far off?    [Moco] I believe that what I think is what any Angolan  thinks: we must fight for peace. Let it be noted that our  government has never behaved in a way to leave the Angolan  people or the international community in any doubt that we are  fighting for peace. The National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] has been the aggressor. It has  attacked the country's integrity. It has been destroying the  country and it has been doing so for no justifiable reason.  Now, we all hope that pressure from the international community  at large -- and in particular those countries which are able to  exert pressure on UNITA -- will be enough to ensure that a peace  accord will be signed in Lusaka or some other city as soon as  possible. What I have been trying to convey over the course of  my tour is that it is easy for us to reach peace on paper. It  is far more difficult to achieve real peace that will serve the  Angolan people's interests rather than UNITA's and Mr. Savimbi's  greed for power.    [Correspondent] You talked a great deal about peace during  your tour. We would like to ask whether peace is near or  whether there is just a possibility than an accord will be  signed?    [Moco] I think that real peace will hinge on how the Angolan  people organize themselves. As for peace on paper, that may  happen soon.    [Correspondent] When you held meetings with the provincial  governments, some specific guidelines were issued. Do you think  it will be possible for the provincial governments to follow  those guidelines, principally with regard to food security and  returning people to their areas?    [Moco] I do recognize that it will be very difficult, but it  is possible to do something. We must perfect organizational  mechanisms in a situation of war. This is a guideline I issued  and I believe it can be implemented. An improvement in the  [20-second break in transmission] is necessary and I will assume  a stand concerning that matter. Very often governmental  organizations have been much too kind toward UNITA. There are  many people who have been fleeing UNITA-held areas. UNITA  carries out ambushes on the roads. It even prevents aircraft  from providing help to war-displaced people in a number of  districts, notably Benguela and Huambo. I feel quite often that  nongovernmental organizations and the UN representation in  Angola do not apply enough pressure on UNITA to encourage it to  allow humanitarian aid to be extended to every part of Angolan  territory.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister: this will likely be the  last question from the People's Television of Angola, TPA, and  it is connected with the first question I asked. Will you not  be making changes in your governing apparatus before the peace  accords are signed?    [Moco] That depends. At this point, I fail to see the need,  but the government (?faces) some difficulties and it has to  fight for a good image. The head of government and the  president of the republic must ensure that each member of  government is made aware of his responsibilities in his  particular field and that is not achieved through dismissals  alone. Dismissals are often spectacular moves, but there are  other ways to go about it. Nonetheless, dismissals and  resignations are only natural in any government at any time.  Obviously, we have not planned such moves and they are not our  principal concern either. Our principal aim is to build, to  help, and to provide support for officials in government.  Though people may think otherwise, they are only human and they  experience the same difficulties all Angolans face. In fact,  that is the way we must act so we can improve the mechanisms of  government more and more.    [Correspondent] How did the government react to the UN  proposal concerning the search for peace corridors so that  humanitarian aid can be extended to people in areas [words  indistinct]?    [Moco] I believe you must put that question to UNITA. It  began the war and it has continued to make war. You are  perfectly well aware of the fact that it was UNITA that began  the war, so it is UNITA that must be asked about opening peace  corridors or whatever you may call them. The fact is that the  government has never raised problems concerning supplies to the  people or aid to war-displaced people. We have never raised  that problem, so I believe that is one question that must be put  to UNITA. It began the war and it has continued to make war.  As you know, Chongoroi, here in Benguela, and Ebo were recently  occupied. So, UNITA began the war and it has continued to be on  the offensive. It is UNITA that must be asked such questions.</p>

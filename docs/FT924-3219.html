			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Scots accountants urge audit move SMALL COMPANIES should be free from the requirement to have a statutory audit and should be allowed to disincorporate more easily, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland has recommended. An institute working party says the audit required by successive Companies Acts should be replaced by an annual accountants' report. That reflects the feeling that time spent by auditors could be put to better use, allowing accountants to advise managers on how to run their businesses more effectively. The institute says the audit is 'inappropriate' because it places too great an administrative burden on smaller companies. It adds that the commercial and fiscal environment has changed considerably since the 1960s, when many small businesses were advised to incorporate. Now many are locked into an unsuitable legal and tax structure. The Department of Trade and Industry announced earlier this year that it was considering lifting the requirement for a compulsory audit for companies below the value added tax threshold of Pounds 36,600 annual turnover. It is expected to produce a consultation paper on the subject early next year. Some other professional bodies including the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales have given support to the idea of abolishing the audit of small companies. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants has traditionally opposed abolition, arguing that the audit is the price of limited liability. It is also reconsidering its position.</p>

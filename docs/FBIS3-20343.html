			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- The French Government  sacked Jean-Yves Haberer, former president of the loss-ridden  Credit Lyonnais Bank, from his new post as managing director of  the Credit National Institution, on Wednesday [30 March].    Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said after a cabinet  meeting that he had asked that Haberer be removed from his post  at the head of the state-controlled Credit National and that the  cabinet had agreed.    On Tuesday Haberer had called for a commission of enquiry  into the way the Credit Lyonnais, which has reported a loss of  6.9 billion francs (1.23 billion dollars), had been managed.  Alphandery, in response to a question about this, replied: "This  enquiry will be held."    The conservative neo-Gaullist RPR [Rally for the Republic]  political group tabled a proposal on Wednesday calling for a  parliamentary investigation to "throw light on the real causes"  of the losses.    The leader of the RPR group, Bernard Pons, said that  "officially" the net consolidated loss for 1993 is 6.9 billion  francs but that the real sum, on the basis of press reports of  the latest study by the treasury, "might be more than 20 billion  francs."    He said: "This exceptional situation, without precedent in  French banking history, requires that the state intervene in  line with the scale of the announced loss and once again it is  the taxpayer who, in the end, will be asked to foot the deficit  of a state company."    Pons said: "The real question is to know how the Credit  Lyonnais came to make so many commitments to clients whose  insolvency was notorious or whose reputation was at the least  equivocal."    Questions should be asked about some investments made  between 1988 and 1993 and on the role played by the government  of the day, he said.    This was seen as a reference to the previous socialist  administration which was voted out of office a year ago.    Government spokesman and Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy  said  that "errors of management were committed" at Credit Lyonnais  during the period when Haberer was president.    Haberer, who ran the Credit Lyonnais until November, in a  statement on Tuesday, attacked what he described as a "media  lynching" of him over the losses.    Referring to the responsibility of the state, he said:  "Account is not taken of the recommendations which I received at  least until March 1993 from the majority shareholder" to  "support influential sectors of the economy and thereby  contribute to growth and employment, particularly during the  years of crisis which our country is experiencing."    He said that he was being blamed for risks to which the bank  had become committed before he was appointed on September 15  1988.    Acknowledging that errors had been made, and that internal  controls needed to be tightened, he said that an enquiry should  establish who had been responsible for what.    Observers noted that of problem loans, commitments to the  cinema through Credit Lyonnais Nederland Bank (CLNB) originated  under the presidency of Jean Deflassieux and were continued by  Haberer's predecessor Jean Maxime Leveque.    Another problem linked to controversial politician and  business tycoon Bernard Tapie, through the Credit Lyonnais  subsisiary SDBO, goes back many years, and problems connected  with the late British press magnate Robert Maxwell began under  Leveque.    The current president of the bank, Jean Peyrelevade, said on  Tuesday that management mistakes had been made, mainly through  subsidiaries "under several governments of different colours."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADD reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit comments from ADD Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations, specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will be considered by ADD in making funding decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making decisions on awards, ADD may give preference to applications which focus on or feature: Culturally diverse racial or ethnic populations; a substantially innovative strategy with the potential to improve theory or practice in the field of human services; a model practice or set of procedures that holds the potential for replication by organizations involved in the administration or delivery of human services; substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial involvement (either financial or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available for the proposed project; the potential for high benefit for low Federal investment; a programmatic focus on those most in need; and/or substantial involvement in the proposed project by national or community foundations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the greatest extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution of assistance among the States and geographical regions of the country, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations. In making these decisions, ADD may also take into account the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Evaluation Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the evaluation criteria below, a panel of at least three reviewers (primarily experts from outside the Federal government) will review the applications. Applicants should ensure that they address each minimum requirement in the priority area description under the appropriate section of the Program Narrative Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reviewers will determine the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal in terms of the evaluation criteria, provide comments and assign numerical scores. The point value following each criterion heading indicates the maximum numerical weight that each section may be given in the review process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Objectives and Need for Assistance (20 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extent to which the application pinpoints any relevant physical, economic, social, financial, institutional or other problems requiring a solution; demonstrates the need for the assistance; States the principal and subordinate objectives of the project; provides supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned interests other than the applicant; and includes and/or footnotes relevant data based on the results of planning studies. The application must identify the precise location of the project and area to be served by the proposed project. Maps and other graphic aids may be attached. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Results or Benefits Expected (20 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extent to which the application identifies the results and benefits to be derived, the extent to which they are consistent with the objectives of the proposal, and the extent to which the application indicates the anticipated contributions to policy, practice, theory and/or research. The extent to which the proposed project costs are reasonable in view of the expected results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Approach (35 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extent to which the application outlines a sound and workable plan of action pertaining to the scope of the project, and details how the proposed work will be accomplished; cites factors which might accelerate or decelerate the work, giving acceptable reasons for taking this approach as opposed to others; describes and supports any unusual features of the project, such as design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary social and community involvements; and provides for projections of the accomplishments to be achieved. It lists the activities to be carried out in chronological order, showing a reasonable schedule of accomplishments and target dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The extent to which, when applicable, the application identifies the kinds of data to be collected and maintained, and discusses the criteria to be used to evaluate the results and successes of the project.

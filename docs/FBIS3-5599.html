			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Australia has called on the  United States to maintain China's most favored nation trade  privileges. Speaking after talks with Mr. Christopher,  Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said he shared  Washington's concern at the detention and harassment of Chinese  dissidents. Senator Evans said protesting at this was not a  matter of interfering in China's internal affairs or applying  Western standards. But Senator Evans said Australia was against  trade sanctions, except in extreme circumstances and supported  continued privileges for China under the MFN scheme.    Meanwhile, Mr. Christopher has repeated an assurance that  Washington does not intend its trade dispute with Japan to do  harm to Australia. He gave the reassurance after talks in  Canberra with Senator Evans and the trade minister, Senator Bob  McMullan. Camille Funnell reports:    [Begin recording] [Funnell] The U.S. secretary of state told  the Australians it was not the intention of the U.S. to start a  trade war with Japan, but he repeated that America wanted  greater access to the Japanese market. He says Australia should  take heart about American assurances from the track record of  U.S. President Bill Clinton. [passage omitted] Senator Evans  says Australia still has legitimate concerns about the approach  taken by the U.S. toward Japan and will continue to express its  concern. [end recording]</p>

Ziaur, speaking at a luncheon  hosted by Japanese economic organizations, presented Bangladesh  as "an attractive country for foreign investors" and urged  Japanese investors and traders to visit the country themselves  and "make your own judgment."    Meanwhile, she called on the Japanese Government to offer  better market access opportunities for Bangladesh goods and  services, noting that the bilateral trade balance is weighted  "heavily in favor of Japan."    Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for a five-day  official  visit, said Bangladesh products are very competitive in terms of  price and quality, while they enjoy special and preferential  market access facilities in major world markets. She cited such  examples as jute, ready-made garments, leather goods, rice and  tea.    Two-way trade between the two countries in 1993 totaled  about  400 million dollars.    Japanese investments in Bangladesh by the first half of 1992  had numbered 40, totaling about 130 million yen. But this  represented only 0.2 percent of all Japanese investment in Asia.    Recognizing that some potential investors still harbor  doubts  about her country, Ziaur sought to dispel them by portraying  what she called "the true image of present day Bangladesh."    "Lack of proper information and a clear understanding about  a  country can naturally cause a degree of reservation in the minds  of those who are looking for new business opportunities," she  said.    Ziaur noted Bangladesh's location in a South Asian market of  more than one billion customers, growing confidence in the  economy shown by major international financial institutions, the  substantial growth of export industries in the country in recent  years, the establishment of export processing zones and an  emerging stock market. She also cited the stability and  convertibility of the local currency, full repatriation of  profit and various investment incentives.    "Bangladesh is poised for a new phase in industrial  development," she proclaimed. "Our industrial policies are  built around the central role of the private sector, our economy  is now fully market-friendly (and) our trade is fully  liberalized."</p>

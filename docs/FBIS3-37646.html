			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe February 22 TASS -- Colonel-General Boris  Pyankov, commander of joint peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan,  described the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border as very  complex and tense. In an interview with local television  Pyankov said that beginning from January, armed provocations  against Russian border guards turned into a series of "incessant  operations."    According to the Russian general, the situation worsened  because Russian border guard posts are being predominantly  shelled from the Afghan territory, which provokes Russian border  guards to take measures in retaliation.    "These provocations pursue far-reaching and dangerous goals  -  to involve Russian border guards in fighting directly on the  territory of Afghanistan so as to hold Russia responsible for  conducting military operations on the territory of a sovereign  state," the Russian general said. At the same time, the command  of Russian border guards in Tajikistan cannot remain indifferent  to endless shelling of Russian border guard posts and the death  of Russian servicemen. Beginning from January, border guard  posts and border guard units came under intensive rocket fire  launched from the Afghan territory 21 times. There are  casualties among Russian servicemen and considerable material  damage was caused to some military settlements on the border.    Pyankov pointed out that the Tajik irreconcilable opposition  which stakes on military settlement of the Tajik conflict has no  chances to win. Coalition peace-keeping forces stationed in  Tajikistan, including Russian border guard troops, are strong  enough to rebuff any external aggression against sovereign  Tajikistan. Hopes pinned by the Tajik irreconcilable opposition  on the support of the population are illusory, the Russian  general said.    Pyankov pointed out that there are separate anti-government  groups in Tajikistan, but the majority of the population do not  support them. "People are tired of war and they welcome efforts  made by the present Tajik leadership to stabilise the  socio-political situation, reach civil peace and prevent another  civil war in the republic," the Russian general said.    He pointed out that this should be brought home both to  leaders of the Tajik irreconcilable opposition and certain  military-political forces in Afghanistan who not only objected  to the creation of bases of Tajik militants on their territory,  but who are rendering them direct assistance in carrying out  military operations against Tajikistan.</p>

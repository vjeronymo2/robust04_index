			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dani Rubinshteyn: "Either the Settlers or the </F> Palestinians"]    [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's decision not to  evacuate the settlers (for the moment?) from the center of  Hebron forces the government to maneuver between other  proposals: to agree to an international presence in the city,  the nature of which would be a topic for prolonged negotiation;  or to muster Palestinian policemen to be placed in the city,  when it is not yet clear whether they will be fully subordinate  to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces].    In the talks now under way in Tunis, General Amnon Shahaq  and  Director-General Uri Savir will probably raise other  suggestions, the common denominator of which would be insistence  on what has become hallowed principle in Israeli policy--not one  settler will be evacuated from his home, even if that home is  sheer stupidity (in Rabin's words), no matter what the price.    This principle has important implications even now in  Hebron.  "The end of the week will mark one month since the slaughter and  the victims continue to pay the price," according to Palestinian  publications referring to the curfew, that, at the time of this  writing, has still not been lifted from the city's inhabitants.    In fact, the IDF is not strict about the curfew in  neighborhoods removed from the center of Hebron, but even in  them there are no classes, most of the services are stopped, and  few residents go to work. Occasionally the IDF removed the  curfew for a couple of hours to allow for food shopping, but  even then the center of the old city remained shut down. Last  week the military governor of Hebron told the heads of the Arab  community that the main highway serving the center of town,  which passes by Bet Hadassah, was closed to Arab traffic.    Hashim al-Natshe, the head of the Hebron Chamber of  Commerce,  tried to appeal that decision to the governor, and, according to  him, the governor told him: "this is a final decision and there  will be no debate about it." The decision will be very hard on  the lives of the city's Arabs since this street connects  Hebron's western and northern neighborhoods with the southern  neighborhoods, and thus now, in their view, makes it a divided  city.    One of the street's residents, Maher Shahada, said (in the  paper AL-QUDS) that homes in the area have become intolerable  and that the Arabs will be forced to leave. Other residents also  believe that the curfew on the old part of the city, adjacent to  the Jewish homes, will continue for a long time. Businesses  there have long been dying because of continuous friction with  the settlers, and those who can will do everything possible to  move to more distant neighborhoods.    The measures taken by the IDF commanders in Hebron are  understandable. They, like everyone else, fear Arab reprisals,  and they must provide the settlers a minimum of security and the  ability to travel. The only way to do this is to impose limits  on the Arabs and try to create a breach between the Arabs and  the Jews in the center of town.    In other words, because it is clear to everyone that there  is  no going back to the uncertain coexistence that previously  existed in the center of Hebron between settlers and Arabs, the  decision not to evacuate the Jews means that the Arabs have to  be evacuated. While the East Jerusalem newspapers describe the  increasing pressure on thousands of their Arab neighbors by the  Hebron settlers to leave the area, they also stressed at the end  of the week reports of two new Jewish families that just arrived  to settle in the heart of the Arab city.    Palestinian spokesmen like Faisal al-Husayni and Hanan  Ashrawi said after the Security Council resolution that now the  international resolutions, declarations, and various agreements  do not much matter to them; what matters is what happens in the  field. At the offices of the Palestinian delegation in East  Jerusalem they pointed to the fact that despite the  announcements of despair among the settlers, some of whom want  to leave, just the opposite kind of work is going on in the  territories, which testifies to a strengthening of the  settlements.    In Ma'ale Adumim, in Ari'el, and in other places,  accelerated  construction continues. In the most ultra-Orthodox settlement,  west of Bethlehem, they are starting to build (according to an  announcement by the Housing Ministry) 470 new housing units. In  al-Jib (ancient Giv'on), which is north of Jerusalem, the Duqa  family complained that tractors ran over 12 dunams of their  olive plantings in order to expand the settlement of Giv'at  Ze'ev. In areas east of the Jerusalem-Ramallah highway,  construction of a new Jewish neighborhood is now being completed.    A member of the delegation, Rasan al-Hatib, noted a while  back that the concession made by the Palestinians for the Gush  Qatif security arrangement actually triples the area of the  Israeli settlements in the center of the Strip. Hebron is the  most trenchant example, but from the point of view of most of  the Palestinian community, it signals that the settlements  remaining in the territories will prevent any hope of reaching  an agreement.</p>

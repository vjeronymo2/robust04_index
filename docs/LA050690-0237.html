			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME BUYERS FAIR;  </P> <P> SELECTING THE RIGHT REALTOR;  </P> <P> GOOD REAL ESTATE AGENT CAN BE BUYER'S BEST FRIEND;  </P> <P> BROKERS: FIND A REAL ESTATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO LISTENS TO WHAT YOU WANT, OFFERS  EXPLANATIONS AND KEEPS IN TOUCH -- THEN STICK WITH THE AGENT TO THE END.  </P> <P> You will meet real estate agents by answering ads, calling the numbers on lawn  signs and visiting open houses. Best of all, perhaps, is a name suggested by a  relative or friend who has had a good experience -- but only if the agent in  question specializes in the areas or type of house you want.  </P> <P> In a strange town, you can write to the chamber of commerce for maps and  information; you will probably hear from several brokerage firms interested in  working with out-of-towners. If you study the local newspapers, you will  discover which agents are active in the areas you like.  </P> <P> Remembering that you have no legal obligations to the agent, you might be  tempted to play the field, thinking that you'll get many people out there  looking for your dream house.  </P> <P> In reality, though, the buyer who works with many brokers is working with no  one. The first time an agent calls to tell you about a house new on the market  and hears "as a matter of fact, we saw that one with someone else this  morning," your name is crossed off the list. In the absence of a legal  relationship, most successful transactions flow from informal trust between  buyer and broker. When you find a good broker, stick with him or her.  </P> <P> Here are a few tests by which to judge an agent:  </P> <P>  -- Does he or she return phone calls promptly? This simple question is a good  screening device, whether you're looking for a broker, lawyer or plumber.  </P> <P>  -- Does the agent explain things so you can understand them? This is  especially important with first-time buyers. If you can find an agent who is a  born teacher, you're in luck.  </P> <P>  -- Does the agent seem ready to invest time in you? For example, when the  broker is holding an open house, does he or she just wave you on through,  asking as you leave whether you're interested in the house and letting it go at  that?  </P> <P> You want someone who, if not busy with other prospects, shows you the house in  a professional manner, asks questions about your needs and offers to discuss  other properties if the one you are looking at doesn't interest you.  </P> <P>  -- Does the broker suggest an initial session in the office, rather than  simply meeting you at the house you called about? To get good service, you need  that financial analysis and discussion of your whole situation.  </P> <P>  -- Does the agent ask questions about your finances soon after meeting you?  This may not ordinarily be good manners but it's the mark of an efficient  broker who aims to give you good service.  </P> <P>  -- Does the broker explain up front that he or she is acting as the seller's  agent?  </P> <P>  -- Do the first houses suggested show that the broker has been listening and  understands your wants and needs? If you're shown houses that have the wrong  number of bedrooms or are clearly out of your price range, forget it.  </P> <P> Once you find a broker with whom you feel comfortable, one who inspires  confidence, stick with him or her. Tell your broker about other firms' ads that  interest you, even about "for sale by owners," so he or she can investigate for  you. Ask for advice before visiting open houses on your own.  </P> <P> If you have the agent's home phone number, don't hesitate to use it. Real  estate agents are accustomed to evening and weekend calls. Service is the only  thing they have to sell, and they welcome any sign that you want to take  advantage of it.  </P> <P> The average person assumes that a real estate agent's job is to help you find a  house, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. The typical broker will spend  more time bringing you into agreement with the seller and, most important,  helping you arrange to finance your purchase.  </P> <P> Some services you can expect, even if, as is most usual, you are using the  seller's broker:  </P> <P>  -- Analysis of your financial situation. Don't be offended by what appear to  be personal questions. A good agent asks them at the beginning because a  lending institution may ask them later on. During a first conversation, the  broker is already forming a strategy for financing your purchase, based on the  various mortgage options available locally.  </P> <P>  -- Education in basic real estate principles. Brokers expect to spend extra  time with first-time home buyers. You have a right to insist that every step be  explained so that you feel comfortable with it.  </P> <P>  -- Recommendation of a specific price range. Without those parameters all  parties involved -- sellers, agents and buyers -- are just spinning their  wheels.  </P> <P>  -- Orientation to a new community. If you are moving out of town, send for the  local newspaper, read the ads and write to a couple of real estate firms that  handle property in the area or price range you might be interested in. You may  receive long-distance phone calls, maps and offers to meet your plane, arrange  motel reservations or baby-sitting. Seeing the town with a broker as your  chauffeur is one of the best ways to learn about neighborhoods, schools,  shopping and the like.  </P> <P>  -- Information about different locations. The agent is not supposed to answer  questions or volunteer information touching on any of the protected classes  under human rights law -- ethnic or racial composition of neighborhoods, for  example. But a broker may answer your questions about the location of  vegetarian restaurants and health clubs, give you factual information on  per-pupil expenditure in various school districts or pinpoint on a map the  organizations or religious institutions you are interested in.  </P> <P>  -- Screening of listings. The agent will show you any house on the market and  must be careful not to narrow your choice by the use of subtle steering based  on racial, religious or other forbidden criteria. Keep in mind, though, that a  good agent is a skilled matchmaker who listens instead of talks, then helps you  narrow down available listings for efficient use of your time.  </P> <P>  -- Showing of property. The agent will set up appointments for house  inspections and will accompany you. During the tours, don't be afraid to ask  questions. The agent will have at hand a wealth of data on each house you see,  including lot size, property taxes and assessment figures, age of the house,  square footage, heating system and the like.  </P> <P>  -- Estimation of ownership costs. When you are seriously interested in a  specific house, your agent will help you figure out how you could buy it and  what it would cost you each month.  </P> <P>  -- Negotiation. The agent will prepare a "purchase offer" that reflects your  proposed purchase price and other terms. Unless you're offering to pay the  seller's full asking price, the seller will likely make a counter-offer. The  negotiations will continue until you and the seller finally reach agreement on  terms of the transaction.  </P> <P>  -- Financing expertise, which is probably the most important, and certainly  the most time-consuming, of the agent's activities. A skilled agent keeps in  close touch with local lending institutions and helps you find the one that  best suits you, out of what may be hundreds of different mortgage plans.  </P> <P>  -- Mortgage application assistance. In many localities, the agent expects to  make an appointment for you with a lending institution and help you prepare for  the application interview, perhaps accompanying you. While you're waiting for  loan approval, the agent will keep in touch with the lender to straighten out  any hitches that develop.  </P> <P>  -- Settlement. Local customs vary, but in many areas the broker attends the  closing session, and in a few places actually effects the transfer of title.  </P></p>

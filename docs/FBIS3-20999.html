Telecooperation and a  multimedia datalink are supposed to keep the travelling frenzy  within bounds.    Albert Noltemeier refuses to accept at least one argument  from those opposed to the government's partial move from Bonn to  Berlin: "Effective cooperation is also possible over great  distances," maintains the expert from the Society for  Mathematics and Data Processing (Gesellschaft fuer Mathematik  und Datenverarbeitung mbH, GMD) in Sankt Augustin near Bonn.    Noltemeier knows what he's talking about. The national  research institute itself has long been testing work in  "distributed organizations." As early as last summer, the  society set up more than 30 teleworkstations at its headquarters  in Schloss Birlinghoven and in locations in Darmstadt and  Berlin. The datalink functions via telecom's switched broadband  network with a bandwidth of 140 megabits per second. The  workstations are each equipped with a computer, audio and video  accessories, and the necessary applications software.    This is testing the future of the "innovative Bonn-Berlin  datalink" (Informationsverbund Bonn-Berlin, IVBB), developed for  the Federal Ministry of the Interior by the GMD together with  partners at universities and in industry. The project bears the  name POLIKOM. The term is a combination of the Greek polis  (cities) and communication. Prof. Dr. Dennis Tsichritzis, GMD's  chairman of the board, sees implementation of the link as an  "outstanding opportunity for the exemplary use of cooperation  and communication technology in Germany."    POLIKOM, for which the federal government will spend at  least  120 million marks by 1997, should give Germany a leading  position in the area of multimedia technologies. Economic  researchers estimate that the market for high speed  communication systems will boom. With components for this  technology, sales could grow from almost $20 billion to about  $55 billion by 1997.    US President Bill Clinton declared the national networking  of  the states with data connections as being among the most  important tasks in building up the infrastructure. Total cost:  $500 billion over 15 years. Whether or not Clinton can mobilize  these gigantic sums in view of pressure to cut costs in the  American budget remains to be seen. Germany, however, with Bonn  and Berlin as separate seats of government, needs a modern  communications link. Industry is also urgently seeking  possibilities for faster data transfer.    And in a united Europe, it would be almost essential for  survival. "European integration will put demands on all forms of  government to coordinate and integrate their functions," says  Dr. Nigel W. Horne of KPMG Management Consulting in London.  However, this sort of cooperation and communication can hardly  succeed with today's methods, which, along with telephone and  fax, are characterized in particular by automobile, airplane,  and train travel. In Great Britain alone, according to a traffic  study, job-related car travel amounts to about 170 billion  kilometers each year. Depending on the size of the company car,  that corresponds to billions of liters of gasoline, which,  moreover, are increasingly often frittered away uselessly in  traffic jams. Horne is not the only one convinced that  "effective communications systems, which reduce the need to  travel, can contribute to energy conservation."    POLIKOM managers have already outlined a scenario of how  that  could function: A member of the Bonn Bundestag who wants to lead  talks in his district, see how construction is coming along in  Berlin, and take part in a committee meeting usually needs two  to three days to do it now, suffers a lot of stress, and travels  many kilometers. With POLIKOM technology, the representative  could manage this all in a single day, largely stress-free and  without having to leave his office.    Telepresence and telecommunication are the technical terms  for this. In the future, says Dr. Josef Schaefer, program  manager of the project, telepresence techniques should make it  possible "to hold working meetings with participants in  different locations using the same databases, transparent  presentation media, and with joint work on the same document."  That is far more than today's videoconferences already offer.    Figure 1. Telepresence: Collaboration hundreds of kilometers  apart. [Figure not reproduced]    In general, the systems must assure the exchange of  information between partners in different locations, facilitate  collaboration between widely scattered sites, and support the  cooperation of groups over relatively great distances.    Through joint viewing of documents, telepointing, and joint  editing, mediated by data lines, this should operate as if the  coworkers were sitting in a single building on several different  floors, as commonly happens today.    In telegroup work areas, it must be possible for discussions  to take place in which everyone has rapid access to the same  archives, records, and documents. Personal teleworkstations  should facilitate rapid contact with each other over hundreds of  kilometers at any time.    In this way, telecooperation, the shared performance and  coordination of tasks, should become possible. In POLIKOM, a  sort of personal assistant is supposed to organize tasks, manage  and monitor deadlines, and perform secretarial duties.  Information can be obtained quickly from a multimedia archive.  Encoding functions and electronic signatures should provide for  data security.    Figure 2. Datalink: Multimedia documents from the electronic  archive. Features include: decentralized information sources;  records and written document management; multimedia archives;  organizational knowledge bases and other sources of information;  distributed telecooperation workstations; personal files; data  switching; network access. [Figure not reproduced]    All are functions which are available at least in the early  stages today, but which must still be integrated into a whole.  In today's prototypes of POLIKOM teleworkstations at the GMD--  cost per workstation about 50,000 marks--some of these functions  are already being tested: video-tools, multi-media-mail, an  organizational knowledge base, an activity assistant, or the  security system SECUDE with chip card terminals for electronic  signatures.    The technical basis of the system will not only be cheaper  in  the future, but also considerably more powerful. The most  important point however: The systems must be so reliable and  easy to use that they are accepted.    This is what GMD wants to test in practice. In the  Cologne-Bonn area, it is currently working on a project in the  area of industrial development. A structural development  company, founded in 1991 on the basis of the Berlin resolution,  is to insure the future of the region together with several  industrial developers--soon supported by multimedia functions  and telecooperation.</p>

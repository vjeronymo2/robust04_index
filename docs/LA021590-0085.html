			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTCHESTER;  </P> <P> BUILDING CONTROLS EXTENDED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously approved a one-year extension of  temporary controls on development in the Westchester Bluffs area.  </P> <P> The extension through March, 1991, will give city planners a chance to complete  a permanent plan to regulate building on the scenic bluffs in Westchester and  Playa del Rey.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said the extension "will give us the time we need to  carefully draft a law giving permanent protection to the area."  </P> <P> A draft of the permanent plan is expected to be available in two to three  months with final action anticipated by early next year.  </P> <P> The temporary controls, imposed in September, 1988, are intended to limit the  construction of large homes while planners determine how best to protect the  scenic resources and natural features of the bluffs.  </P> <P> The interim control ordinance imposes limits on the height of buildings, the  distance between structures, the type of landscaping and the amount of land  coverage that can occur on a lot in the bluff area.  </P> <P> Landowners seeking a building permit will be required to conduct a survey of  their property to determine the maximum height of a proposed building.  </P></p>

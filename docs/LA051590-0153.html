			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TAIWAN DOLLAR DROPS RECORD 4%  </P> <P> Taiwan's foreign exchange market plunged into chaos in the last 10 minutes of  trading today as the local dollar sharply depreciated in its biggest fall ever,  dealers said.  </P> <P> They said in the last 10 minutes government banks, which in the past had tried  to slow the depreciation, changed and started to encourage it.  </P> <P> "The market was in chaos. It was a change of policy," said Tarsicio Tong, chief  dealer at Banque Nationale de Paris.  </P> <P> The local dollar closed at 27.50 to one U.S. dollar from 26.4351, a  depreciation of about 4%.  </P> <P> "The pressure had built up for too long because of capital outflow," Tong said.  </P> <P> In the past two months more than $4 billion has flowed out of the country for  investment, migration, travel and speculation, bankers said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interviews with Olof Johansson, environment </F> minister and Center Party leader, and Dan Ericsson, Christian  Democratic Party secretary, by Elisabeth Crona and Anita Kratz:  "Center Party Would Remain in Government Despite a No to the  EU"]    [Text] "If our party congress says no to the EU [European  Union], we Center Party ministers will tender our resignations.  Then it will be up to Prime Minister Carl Bildt to decide if we  should go or whether we can put our divergent view on record."    Olof Johansson, environment minister and Center Party  leader,  has his strategy clear. This was apparent in an interview with  SVENSKA DAGBLADET.    [Johansson] I have the biggest responsibility to the party  conference. I have not yet discussed in the circle of ministers  what a no will mean for our actions in the government. But I  did think the thing through carefully when we joined the  government.    We might be offered the possibility of putting our  reservations on record. In the event of a no to the EU, the  question whether we should do that or resign raises its head.    This is something the prime minister must decide.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But could you stay and be opposed to one  of the cornerstones of the government declaration -- membership  of the EU?    [Johansson] The question is no longer quite so important  because it is to be decided in a referendum, after the Riksdag  election.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The possibility of a government party  expressing its reservations on an issue where it takes a  divergent view was brought back onto the agenda in connection  with the conflict surrounding the Oresund bridge -- an issue  which will soon be back on the government's desk. Now Olof  Johansson is pointing to the same possible solution in the even  of an EU no from the Center Party.    The Center Party leader has taken part in four local party  meetings.    How do you see the outcome of the extraordinary party  congress vote on the EU, now that the local party organizations  have had their say?    [Johansson] Reporting is loudest when the answer is a no....  But I believe that we will see the same positions as at past  party congresses -- only a little clearer.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] However, Olof Johansson expects that now  that the question is being brought to a head, uncertain  delegates could slip over onto the no side.    Has the result of the negotiations influenced Center Party  opinion in the direction of a yes?    [Johansson] I myself have not drawn attention particularly  strongly to the result from the negotiations. But I think that  it can give greater credibility. It is important that people do  not undermine this result here at home by implementing spending  cuts in the national support for agriculture and regional policy.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The Center Party's government colleagues  are cautious when it comes to drawing any conclusions about  continued government cooperation, before the party's congress  has reached a decision.    Christian Democratic Party [KDS] secretary Dan Ericsson said  that up to now the government has been united in working for  membership.    [Ericsson] And Center Party ministers in particular have  worked to achieve a good agreement with the EU countries.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] During the membership negotiations, the  Center Party's ministers were responsible for some of the most  heavyweight areas -- the environment, agriculture, and regional  policy.    Dan Ericsson is amazed that Olof Johansson is thinking in  terms of resignations.    [Ericsson] A remarkable situation is arising. The Center  Party is not itself coming to a decision about the continued  existence of the government. It is leaving it to the government  head to think about what should happen if the government  suddenly contains a party that argues against membership.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] KDS sympathizers are just as divided in  their attitudes to the EU as Center Party voters and Social  Democrats. But the party leadership has methodically worked for  a yes. At the three most recent KDS national conferences, the  party's active members have voted for Swedish membership.    Dan Ericsson pointed out that Christian Democrats elsewhere  in Europe have been in favor of a European community ever since  the creation of the coal and steel union, the first step toward  what today is the EU.    Moderate Coalition Party secretary Gunnar Hokmark takes a  much more wait-and-see approach than Dan Ericsson.    [Ericsson] We are assuming that the Center Party will follow  in full the policy we agree on in government cooperation. If  something different happens, we will have to reach a decision  then.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Hokmark stressed that the ultimate goal  of Swedish membership has been part of the package ever since  the nonsocialist four-party government's first government  declaration in the fall of 1991. In it Prime Minister Carl  Bildt (Moderate Coalition Party) said that the first major task  "is to lead Sweden fully into European cooperation through  negotiations on membership of the European Community."    Liberal Party secretary Peter Orn was unwilling to comment  on  the Center Party's internal processes. "They must be allowed to  see to them in peace. I have always disliked the way Carl Bildt  has attacked the Social Democrats because they have not yet  reached a decision on EU membership."    Sten Olsson, the opposition Social Democrats' assistant  party  secretary, thinks that a situation in which a government's  composition can remain the same if Center Party delegates vote  no to the EU is difficult to reconcile with Sweden's  parliamentary principles; Swedish ministers have a collective  responsibility for the work of the whole government.    "It is the same debate as the debate about the Oresund  bridge. Can the government reserve judgment on a question of  such central importance?" Sten Olsson asked, answering his own  question by saying that this is hardly possible because of the  demand for joint responsibility.    For his own part he is happy with the way the Social  Democrats have handled the EU question -- the Social Democratic  leadership has come out in favor of membership. On 18-19 June  the adjourned congress will then recommend to to voters whether  to vote yes or no.    "If we receive the support needed to form a government in  the  election in September we will already have put our cards on the  table on the EU question," Sten Olsson said, adding that as a  result the party does not find itself in the same boat as the  current government.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: The Wynton Marsalis Septet - Jazz TRUMPET player Wynton Marsalis was put on a pedestal early. The hot-housed progeny of a New Orleans jazz nursery headed by father Ellis, young Wynton had accumulated three Grammy awards for best soloist by the time he was 25. A precocious student of the Juilliard School of Music in New York and apprentice to Art Blakey, he has since toured the world with his own small groups and with symphony orchestras. Now 30, he is generally regarded as the most complete trumpeter bar none. But the slow-talking southerner has begun to attract brickbats as well as acclaim, usually from those who are eager to see a successor to Miles Davis. Wynton is a perfect technician with honeyed tone and the control of a yogi, they say, but he hasn't done anything new. He is to the development of jazz, what the compact disc is to vinyl. The snappily dressed septet he leads these days is a self-assured and controlled group which slides through arrangements for suites and set pieces without a blip. Where there might be spontaneity, there are quick fire changes and perfect articulation instead - from flaring trombone to sopranino. Although there are no blazing hellfire solos, there are simmering exchanges between the horns and the piano which are turned down by a stern rhythm section lest the arrangements boil over. Far from offering a new way with jazz, Marsalis continues to delve into the past for inspiration in his writing and playing. On Monday night, we had new charts and deft changes for a standard, 'Indiana', part of a moody original score for a ballet and a grand Ellingtonian orchestral suite describing life in the city, 'City Room'. To close, and to show he really can play it all and loud, Marsalis went back to the beginning invoking the spirit of trumpet legend Buddy Bolden, and the early marching bands. From the fragile and muted notes of a cool ballad through to the contrived study of New Orleans wailing fanned by a bowler, Marsalis's golden sound hangs by a thread. If he can improve on this with age, who cares if he does nothing new. In gloriously contrasting support, the Julian Joseph Quartet stormed through a selection from their impressive debut album The Language of the Truth (East West 9031-75122) showing an innocent lack of restraint. British pianist Joseph does little that is 'new' in his compositions either, but has a percussive and full handed way with the keyboard that is exciting and vital.

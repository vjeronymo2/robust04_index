			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The KKE [Greek Communist Party] Political Bureau  issued a statement today calling on the government to use its  veto at the NATO conference, even at the last moment, as it  says, to prevent any decision to undertake military operations  in the area of Bosnia. The KKE Political Bureau also demands  the immediate convening of the Chamber of Deputies to debate the  situation.    KKE's assessment is that military intervention has been in  preparation for a long time and it holds the government  responsible for putting its signature on the latest decision by  the European Union's foreign ministers, which it describes as  criminal.</p>

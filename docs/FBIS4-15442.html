			<p>BFN     [Text] Dialog between Lithuania and Russia has been  virtually suspended, Latvian [as received] Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius said at a press conference in Vilnius on  Thursday.    In the words of the prime minister, Russia "is conducting an  aggressive economic policy in relation to the Baltic states."  The regulation of export and import introduced in the Russian  Federation on March 15 is "bluntly discriminating", Slezevicius  said.    The Lithuanian premier also said that he had a meeting with  the head of the Kaliningrad regional administration Yuriy  Matochkin who in the near future is scheduled to meet with  Chernomyrdin. Slezevicius asked him to inform the Russian  premier about Lithuania's position. Its essence is that "if  Russia has no intention of changing its decision and continues  the policy aimed at reducing imports, Lithuania will have  nothing to do but to resort to adequate measures in relation to  the Kaliningrad region."    The Lithuanian premier also noted that Russia is not  repaying  its debt for the transit of electricity. "We would not like to  resort to limiting this transit," Slezevicius said.    According to the premier, Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin  about the problems in relations between the two states.</p>

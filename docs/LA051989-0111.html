			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> An all-white jury in Mobile, Ala., convicted a former Ku Klux Klansman of  murder for supplying the rope and pistol used to abduct and kill a black  teen-ager who was strangled and strung up in a tree. The conviction of Benjamin  Franklin Cox, 27, was the third successful prosecution in six years in the 1981  slaying of 19-year-old Michael Donald. A federal jury in 1987 ordered the  United Klans of America, then the nation's biggest klan organization, to pay $7  million to Donald's mother. Cox whispered, "I love you" to his weeping wife,  Gail, before he was led away in handcuffs. Cox, a truck driver, could receive  10 years to life in prison. Circuit Judge Michael Zoghby revoked Cox's $28,000  bail and set sentencing for June 23.  </P></p>

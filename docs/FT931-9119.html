			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: Polling error Perhaps the most ignominious part about George Vassiliou's defeat in Cyprus's presidential elections is that his own Middle East Marketing Research Bureau failed to predict the outcome. Admittedly, it was a close-run affair, with Vassiliou - the incumbent and favourite - beaten by just 1,988 votes. Even so, his polling team had forecast that he would win by a margin of at least 4 percentage points. What made it worse was that the bureau had produced the only accurate forecast for the first-round ballot. As Vassiliou has no political party of his own, he will probably return to running his old company. However, there could be a happy ending. When he was president, Glafcos Clerides was one of his main political advisers. Now that Clerides has got Vassiliou's job, the roles might be reversed.</p>

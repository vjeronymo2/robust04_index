			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Expectations 'too high' for return on capital Companies are demanding too high a return on capital when considering investment projects, according to Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of economics and strategy at BZW, the securities house. His comments accompanied yesterday's publication of BZW's annual equity-gilt study, which looks at returns from UK shares, government bonds and cash since 1918. He said that companies had not adjusted to lower inflation rates in their appraisal of capital spending. Typically, he added, they expected returns of 20-25 per cent, but they should be looking at a return of 10-15 per cent before inflation. If they did, investment could rise. The real return on equities from 1918 to the end of 1993 had been 7.9 per cent a year on average, Mr Hughes explained. BZW estimates the real cost of equity capital to have been 7-10 per cent on average and sees 8 per cent as a benchmark. Assuming a future inflation rate, implied from the relationship between index-linked and conventional gilts, of about 3 1/2 per cent, a nominal return of 10-15 per cent would allow companies to approximately cover their cost of capital. The study also suggested that UK shares, which produced a total real return of 25 per cent in 1993, were modestly over-valued compared with a model of equity valuation based on dividend yield and expected growth in income. This follows a prolonged period of undervaluation between 1973 and 1985, while from 1986 to 1992 equities moved much in line with the model. Mr Hughes said that the shift to being overvalued in 1993 did not signal an end to the bull market. From 1958 to 1972 equities were overvalued to a much greater extent. If the market returned to the peak overvaluation of 1968 the FT-SE 100 index would stand at 5,500. There were two key conditions for equities to be re-rated, both of which held at present, Mr Hughes stated. These were a stimulative monetary policy and profits rising as a proportion of gross domestic product. If these persisted, he said, equities should remain overvalued and could become more overvalued. Gilts marginally outperformed equities in 1993, producing a return of 26.4 per cent, and making gilts the winner in three of the last five years. Lex, Page 22</p>

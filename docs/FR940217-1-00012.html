			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ii. Custodians or nominees. As discussed in the Proposing Release, institutional investors engage the services of different investment advisers and executing broker-dealers, yet the trades effected by these persons may be settled and the investment assets may be deposited centrally with one custodian bank, trust company, or broker-dealer that is sometimes referred to as a prime broker. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes, based upon its experience with broad-based trade reconstructions, that the increased size and specialization of market participants has led to the increased use of these multi-layered accounts. Typically, these accounts fragment or obscure the information about large trader accounts and activity that the Commission needs to analyze market trading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42554, at nn. 47&hyph;49 and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Substantial comments were received with respect to the inclusion of custodians or nominees within the definition of ownership. The commenters all questioned the appropriateness of including passive custodians or nominees. These commenters argued that passive custodians or nominees, which merely act as a conduit for delivery/receipt versus payment (``DVP/RVP'') settlement of transactions, should not be included within the definition of a large trader. However, the comments regarding custodians and nominees acknowledged that many custodians or nominees act as a discretionary agent or fiduciary for the execution of trades and thus may be large traders that control accounts owned by other persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inclusion of custodians and nominees also caused broker-dealers, banks, and trust companies to question the capture of multiple LTIDs for a single account or transaction. These commenters asserted that the cost of keeping and reporting multiple LTIDs, for a single account or trade, would be unduly burdensome. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  It also was suggested that the capture of multiple LTIDs may cause duplication or distortion of total reconstructed trade activity. Many of these commenters also noted the possible applications of the ID System. Lastly, the commenters confirmed that, in these multi-layered accounts, the participants usually do not have knowledge of each other's activities and, individually, none of the participants may know or have access to all of the information that the Commission needs to analyze market trading activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section III.C.2. and III.D.3., for discussions of the reproposed LTID recordkeeping and reporting requirements, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the inclusion of custodians and nominees in the definition of ownership would serve three important purposes. First, it would assure that banks and broker-dealers, both foreign and domestic, are treated consistently under the reproposed rule. Second, it would assure disclosure of the appropriate LTIDs for each account. Finally, the inclusion of custodians and nominees would enable the Commission to efficiently characterize trading activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The problem that the Commission has sought to address with respect to custodians and nominees is its inability to obtain information about the ultimate or actual beneficial owners and controllers of omnibus accounts or accounts otherwise undisclosed as to ownership. Although the number of these accounts may be small in relation to fully disclosed accounts, the Commission believes that the nature of large trader activity causes a significant percentage of this activity to be effected through these accounts. Accordingly, the definition of ownership in the reproposed rule would include only those custodians or nominees that maintain omnibus accounts or accounts otherwise undisclosed as to ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes would work in conjunction with the other modifications to the definition of ownership to assure that the fully disclosed owner of an account, or the custodian or nominee of an omnibus account, is deemed to be the owner of that account, not the broker-dealer, bank, or trust company that acts only as an agent for settlement of transactions effected through a fully disclosed account. Moreover, reproposed Schedule 8 to Form 13H has been designed to capture information about a custodian or nominee large trader and the undisclosed large traders that effect trades in or through his omnibus accounts, not small or otherwise infrequent traders whose trades may be effected through such accounts. Reproposed Schedule 8 is designed in a manner that the Commission believes would approximate existing ID System practices and procedures for maintaining such information. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Essentially, the ID System captures information regarding the capacity of the participants to a multi-layered account. Participants are grouped and numbered as agents, broker-dealers, institutions, and interested parties. The term ``Agent'' is defined as the entity appointed by the buyer and seller to clear their trades. The term ``Broker-dealer'' means the entity that executes a trade on behalf of the buyer or seller. The term ``Institution'' means those parties that initiate the trade as buyer or seller, on its own behalf or on behalf of another. Finally, the term ``Interested Party'' is defined as those entities, other than the Agent or Institution, which receive a confirmation because they have a role to play in the settlement of a trade. It is important to note that these capacities are not mutually exclusive and one participant may perform the tasks associated with any number of these capacities. See ID System Directory, Volume X, Number 9, September 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the revisions to the reproposed definition of ownership would significantly clarify the obligations of persons that own and/or act as custodians or nominees for large trading accounts. The Commission also believes that the reproposed definition of ownership would minimize the burden of the identification requirements on such large traders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of control.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with the definition of ownership, the commenters uniformly criticized the sweeping impact of the proposed definition of control when combined with the proposed rules for aggregation. Some commenters questioned whether merely controlling the accounts or trading of a large trader would, by itself, cause such controller to be a large trader.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the commenters also indicated that the persons or entities that control trading activities usually have the most knowledge of large trader accounts, activity, or objectives and, therefore, should be the focus of the identification requirements. Finally, one commenter questioned the appropriateness of the inclusion of limited discretionary investment authority within the definition of control. This commenter asserted that the definition of limited discretion would force broker-dealers to aggregate the activity of all customers for whom they executed not held orders. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Not held orders relieve the executing broker of responsibility with respect to the time and price of execution, if the broker uses ``brokerage judgment'' when executing the order. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 123A.44, NYSE Guide (CCH) &para;2123A. Not held orders may be characterized as: (1) defensive orders required by brokers in times of unusual market volatility ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> fast markets); or (2) consideration provided by a customer to a broker for the commitment of capital or expertise in the execution of large ``block trades.'' See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 127.10, NYSE Guide (CCH) &para;2127 (definition of block trade).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of control has been modified in paragraph (a)(5) of the reproposed rule. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  These revisions would emphasize that the focus of the reproposed concept of control is ``control of the accounts of a person,'' not control of the person itself. The reproposed rule also would provide that the owner of an account, as well as any person with full or limited discretion over an account, is deemed to control that account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42561 (proposed text).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reproposed rule would clarify that a person's mere exercise of control over a large trader's accounts or transactions, without effecting the requisite level of transactions, would not cause such person to be a large trader under the reproposed rule. Additionally, new paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of the reproposed rule would add the definitions of full and limited discretionary investment authority suggested in the Proposing Release. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  With respect to the execution of not held orders, the Commission would interpret their execution to not fall within the reproposed definition of control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42553, at nn. 34 and 35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

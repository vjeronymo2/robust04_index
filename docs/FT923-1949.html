			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Gardening: It's a hip scene in the bushes THE HIPS on my rugosa roses have never been finer or more plentiful. I am not sure why because the crops of berries and other fruits in my garden are rather patchy; but, of course, the hips set quite late and the flowering of rugosas continues for a particularly long time and this year was very prolific. I grow two varieties of Rosa rugosa, both single-flowered. One named Alba has white flowers and the other, Rubra, is magenta; both have the good rugosa perfume. Both flower from late spring until autumn but the hips are usually taking over by July. These are big, flattened globes, rather like little tomatoes except that each has a distinctive green top-knot composed of the old calyx segments of the flower; this gives them a very distinctive appearance. They are carried in good clusters. These two fine roses must not be confused with the rugosa rose that is used by nurserymen as a root stock for standard rose trees. This is closely related but is probably a hybrid. Certainly, it is a very inferior garden plant with quite a different habit, taller and laxer and with a pernicious habit of producing suckers very freely. By contrast, the true Rosa rugosa is about as wide as it is high, well-branched and sturdy. Although it does sucker, it is not anything like so wide-ranging as the root-stock. I like my rugosa roses not only because of their long flowering season and good crops of hips but also for their thick-textured, deeply-veined, dark green leaves which I have never seen marred by disease of any kind. This good health seems to be universal; even the pests keep off, as if the leaves contain something obnoxious. I prune late in winter with a hedge-trimmer and cut back only as far as necessary to keep the bushes from spreading too far. Hybrids between Rosa rugosa and other roses tend to be sterile, which has limited the number of garden varieties made with this parentage. But there are some good ones, most notably Blanc Double de Coubert, Frau Dagmar Hastrup, Roseraie de L'Hay and Scabrosa. The first, as its name implies, is white. The flowers are semi-double and the habit is sturdy and bushy, but it does not produce hips freely like the single-flowered varieties. By contrast, Frau Dagmar Hastrup does produce lots of hips and they are of a particularly deep colour which contrasts well with the pale pink, single flowers. It is also shorter and more compact and so is not suitable for making a big hedge, but it can be used for a low one: say, 3-4 ft. Roseraie de L'Hay is the best of the lot for flowers, which are semi-double and have a particularly rich perfume. Only in its relative lack of hips is it inferior. Scabrosa is extra-vigorous and everything about it is large - flowers (which are magenta), leaves and hips. Apart from these, there are a number of roses that are related to Rosa rugosa but do not look anything like it. This, no doubt, is due to the sterility of most of its hybrids. But there is one notable exception, a rose now named Rosa kordesii. This has a remarkable history since it virtually amounts to the production, in cultivation, of an entirely new species. German breeder Wilhelm Kordes was attempting to raise seedlings from a rose named Max Graff, which is a hybrid between Rosa rugosa and the vigorous, climbing species R. wichuraiana. For a long time he failed to get any fertile seed but, eventually, he produced two hips from which he managed to raise two seedlings. One of these proved to have double the usual number of chromosomes and, on that account, to be fertile. This was the plant that was named R. kordesii, and Kordes has used it to produce a number of new roses, all of which, I think, are climbers.</p>

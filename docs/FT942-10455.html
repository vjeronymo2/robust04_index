			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Darwin's Flood - Fringe theatre Snoo Wilson's comedies - far-fetched, scatty-intellectual, black and often scabrous - can hardly be an 'acquired taste', for one cannot imagine anybody acquiring it. Either you find that you already had it, very possibly to your surprise and embarrassment; or you sit there stony-faced; or you veer queasily this way and that. The press-night audience for Darwin's Flood at the Bush represented the entire spectrum. A few people, perhaps scandalised, did nothing but wince; some others flinched and guffawed; still others - a few at a time, never quite the same few - went into sudden spasms of uncontrolled hilarity. No critic could tell you where you might fit (I laughed a lot). Here are the premises: - we are in Sir Charles Darwin's retirement home on the Downs, soon to be inundated by the second Great Flood. The year being 1885, Sir Charles is already dead, but he carries on bravely (in the person of John Kane, disarmingly a-tremble with scientific detachment and decent concern), though he doesn't want visitors. Visitors come nonetheless, welcomed by his lusty young widow Emma (Alex Kingston). First the philosopher Nietzsche, with his monstrous sister Elisabeth (Rosemary McHale, faultlessly Teutonic and intense) and her husband (Paul Bentall), who set out in 1890 with 150 dogged Swabians to found a pure German colony in South America. Nietzsche (Bob Goody) is already mad, speechless and virtually legless - Elisabeth wheels him in a barrow - but since they are time-travelling backwards there is hope of a retroactive recovery. She wants to verify the agreement of Darwinianism with her brother's will-to-power, devil-take-the-loser philosophy before pressing on to Paraguay. Meanwhile Jesus Christ drops in, a chunky Ulsterman in biker's Lycra (James Nesbitt) who performs the odd miracle between offstage sessions of prayer and comfort with Mrs Darwin; and then red-leathered Mary Magdalene (Barbara Barnes) with a mobile call-girl's phone, who soon finds herself flagellating scraggy old Nietzsche in crucifixion pose and loincloth, to his hungry satisfaction. Some viewers might find this in dubious taste. As one loopy episode succeeds another, Robin Don's witty set disgorges surprise after extravagant surprise, exceeding the little Bush arena's limits beyond anything one might have imagined. Though it must plainly be admitted that Darwin's Flood is a very, very silly piece, its special kind of silliness is worth appreciating. Not silly-intellectual, because Wilson never pretends to elevate the central idea - the validity of 'social Darwinism', I suppose - into a Shavian debate; instead it keeps prancing off into comical quicksand. Not silly-facetious either (as the above summary might suggest, like almost any summary of a Wilson play); because the undergraduate snook-cocking is just scaffolding for his inspired flights of cogent, deadpan craziness for every character. They may not extend far - construction is not a Wilson strength, and his second act falls short of the riotous climax of the first - but they keep coming, knitted neatly into the airy texture and never far from the point. Stokes's cast carry them off with unabashed bravado, abetted by Chahine Yavroyan's hi-tech lighting and Simon Whitehorn's apocalyptic-romantic sound as well as Don's sensational designs. The morning after, you may find the details lost beyond recall but a delighted glow still lingering. Do not take a maiden aunt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kontantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Fribourg (Switzerland), 27 Feb -- According to  Sergey Filatov, the head of the Russian president's  administration, it is necessary to clarify the legal aspects of  the decision by the State Duma on political amnesty. "This is  not a matter of the individuals to whom the decision applies.  This is a matter of principle. A precedent is being created in  society when the article `Political Rehabilitation' is extended  to criminals or people charged with committing crimes," he told  an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "This is incomprehensible to  Russian society and to the rest of the world, and it is this  aspect that should be clarified first and foremost."    Filatov, who is in Switzerland to take part in a  Russian-Swiss academic seminar organized by the Institute of  Federalism of the Fribourg University, said in the interview he  regretted that the Constitutional Court was not working. In his  words, the court ought to decide whether the decision of the  Duma was constitutional. "If we have decided to live according  to the Constitution, then this ought to be justified by the  Constitution."    The concept of "political amnesty" presumes that there was a  political offense. "But what is at issue are people that have  committed a criminal offense," Sergey Filatov continued. "And  this criminal offense cannot be given an amnesty by the said  resolution. Because neither the carrying of arms, nor the use or  keeping of arms, nor calls to use violence -- all the things  that these people are accused of -- can be given an amnesty.  That is the craftiness of it. In general, it has no legal  precedent."    The head of the Russian Federation Presidential  Administration reminded that two people who used arms have  already been convicted by the court. "The court has ruled and  they are already in prison. What kind of political amnesty can  one talk of here?"    The intentions of those who initiated the decision are  clear:  "To reach peaceful accord, to refrain from stirring up the  things that happened. They must be stirred up," Filatov  believes. "The culprits should be identified by name. We have  been moving toward this goal for longer than 24 hours.  Unfortunately, we have been moving toward this goal for almost  a year, starting from the Seventh Congress. All the  conciliatory initiatives by the president were met with a  categorical rejection, there was aggression and hostility that  put one part of society at loggerheads with another. Somebody  must answer for that."    "When people speak about political amnesty, I would like  first of all to define its meaning," the head of the  presidential administration remarked. "If there are political  crimes in our country, those guilty must be found here, too. Is  it somehow related to the political rehabilitation of people who  were sentenced and repressed at one time? No, the situation is  totally different, and I believe therefore, that a full stop  should be put here in a legal appraisal."</p>

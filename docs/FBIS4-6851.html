			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker  criticized the ruling coalition on Monday for the lengthy  wrangling among its members over key policy issues that caused a  delay in selecting the new prime minister. Yohei Kono,  president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said, "it took  a long time since Prime Minister (Morhihiro) Hosokawa announced  his intention to resign."    "That created concerns and caused troubles for the people."    The seven-party coalition agreed on key policy issues last  Friday and decided to select Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as  its candidate to succeed Hosokawa, two weeks after Hosokawa said  he would step down because of a Diet stalemate over his  financial impropriety.    Hata will be elected new prime minister Monday afternoon.    "The coalition should have a serious soul-searching over the  political vacuum," Kono told reporters.    The LDP chief also blasted the Hosokawa administration,  which  came to power with a vow to clean up politics, for its failure  to restore the credibility of the Japanese politics. "The  people's distrust in politics deepened instead," he said.    "Mr. Hosokawa was himself not so enthusiastic about  clarifying the suspicions" over his past financial deals "and  the coalition members clammed up on the issue," Kono said.</p>

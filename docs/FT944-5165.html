			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rothmans parent ahead at midterm Richemont, the Rothmans tobacco and luxury goods group, has reported a 13.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 352.9m (Dollars 550m) in the six months to September 30, thanks largely to strong growth for its products in far eastern markets. The Zug-based group said sales advanced 7.6 per cent to Pounds 1.88bn, and operating profit was up 11 per cent to Pounds 339m. It looked forward to 'satisfactory' trading results in the full year. Sales of the tobacco division rose 4.3 per cent to Pounds 1.27bn. The volume of cigarette sales was slightly ahead, with the main gains coming from Japan and the UK. Operating profit from tobacco jumped 15.1 per cent to Pounds 249.5m, thanks to higher UK sales, price increases in France and higher sales and production cost reductions in Malaysia. Revenues of the Vendome luxury products subsidiary rose by 15.3 per cent to Pounds 605m, and its operating profits gained 10.8 per cent to Pounds 98.2m. All the company's major product lines, including Cartier jewellery and watches and Dunhill leather goods, increased their sales. Growth was strongest in far eastern markets. Losses on other activities widened to Pounds 2.5m from Pounds 2.3m, as the costs of developing the company's pay-TV interests in Europe more than offset a Pounds 5.2m profit from the US catalogue retailing investment. Additional investment in the pay-TV networks would be needed. Group operating profits were reduced by Pounds 3m in goodwill write-offs in the half year. In the comparative period last year, there was Pounds 0.9m in goodwill write-offs and Pounds 12m in restructuring costs. Pre-tax profits were boosted by net investment income of Pounds 16.9m, down 8 per cent. Attributable profit was up 16.8 per cent to Pounds 112.8m or Pounds 19.64 per unit of shares in the Swiss company and its main Luxembourg subsidiary.</p>

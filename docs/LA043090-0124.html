			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MOVIE ON GM AMUSES EAST BLOC  </P> <P> The movie "Roger and Me" is a hit in Eastern Europe because it shows audiences  what 80 years of capitalism have done to the General Motors Corp. company town  of Flint, director Michael Moore said.  </P> <P> But Moore said Warner Brothers, which distributed his documentary film about GM  layoffs and his comically futile efforts to interview Chairman Roger Smith, is  happy with "Roger and Me" for reasons different than his.  </P> <P> The film has grossed more than $7 million since its release in January and  still plays in 35 U.S. cities, Moore said Saturday at a fund raiser for a  legislative candidate.  </P> <P> "Warner Brothers is not promoting the film because they are at the forefront of  political revolution," he said. "They're doing it because they think it will  make money."  </P></p>

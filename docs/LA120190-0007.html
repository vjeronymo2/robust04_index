			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN'S SENTENCE  </P> <P> Milken is lucky he lives in the United States. In three to six years, he will  go home a free man and a millionaire as well.  </P> <P> Even if much of his billion-dollar empire is liquidated by legal expenses,  fines and operating costs, a few million remaining in 1993 or even 1996 would  still ensure a reasonable and comfortable lifestyle as compared with working  people making $35,000 or even $50,000 a year.  </P> <P> His 10-year sentence is hardly a deterrent. History has shown that no matter  what punishment is extracted by the law, it does not deter similar crimes in  the future. Crimes are motivated by greed, anger, revenge and other compelling  factors. Even if he were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of  parole, some other junk-bond clone would emerge to do as he had done -- or even  worse.  </P> <P> SOL TAYLOR  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

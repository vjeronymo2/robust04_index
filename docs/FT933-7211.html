			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Nouvelle to reconstruct for property expansion NOUVELLE, whose main business is now that of a property company and whose shares have been suspended since the beginning of last December, plans a reorganisation, placing, rights issue, acquisition and a change of name. It is anticipated that suspension will be lifted on implementation of the proposals, and dealings will start on September 14. The group also released accounts for the year ended March 31 1993 showing a significant cut in pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 219,000. The discount stationery retailing subsidiary was sold in April 1992 and the office products distribution operation disposed of in August. There were extraordinary charges of Pounds 3.69m (Pounds 5.15m) for asset write downs and other costs. Losses per share were reduced from 3.1p to 0.28p. After a capital reorganisation which includes cancellation of part of the deficit on the profit and loss account, it is planned to raise Pounds 920,000 net through the placing of 11.2m new ordinary 1p shares at 5p apiece; and shareholders are offered a like number of shares at the same price on the basis of 1-for-10 ordinary and 1-for-2 convertible preference. Nouvelle proposes to purchase Regent Corporation, and take that name. Regent is a recently-established house building company of which Mr Carl Turpin and Mr Christopher Johnson, two experienced property developers, are directors and shareholders; they will join Nouvelle as chief executive and deputy chairman respectively. Maximum consideration is Pounds 500,000 and initial payment will be Pounds 100,000 settled via the issue of 2m ordinary shares, and up to a further 8m shares depending on results for the period to March 31 1995. Regent has two completed developments in Charlwood, Surrey, and Wandsworth, London. It has bought land at North Cheam, London, with planning permission, and exchanged contracts on a site in Sutton, Surrey.</p>

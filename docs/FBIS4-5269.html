			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that in an agreement statement  for the Japan-U.S. negotiations on mobile phones released by the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on 6 April, there is an  expression that might be interpreted as that the Japanese  Government has guaranteed the implementation of the agreement.    The expression in question is the word "oversee" used in an  official statement written in English. The word is used in the  expression that the Japanese Government will "oversee" [kantoku]  to help the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation [Japan Mobile  Communications Corporation] (IDO) complete actions to enlarge  the U.S. Motorola-compatible mobile phone system. In its  Japanese- language version tentatively translated from the  English original released on the same day, the Ministry of Posts  and Telecommunications translated the word "oversee" as "watch  it to the end" ["mitodokeru"], thus using a weaker nuance than  in the original. Therefore, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications maintains its position that "the government  will not guarantee the private sector's implementation of  investment in mobile phone systems and facilities" (according to  a senior Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications official).    It seems, however, that the United States is basing its  contention that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has  guaranteed the private sector's numerical targets on the word  used in the agreement. It has also been disclosed that in the  recent accord, it is specified that Japan "will take all  available measures" if IDO fails to implement its pledged  action. Such a difference between the two nations's ways of  interpreting the statement described in the accord on mobile  phones is another "vague" point in a Japanese-U.S. agreement.  It is likely that such a difference in interpretation will have  a delicate impact on Japan-U.S. negotiations on other trade  sectors.</p>

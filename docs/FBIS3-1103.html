			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph Rwegasira left  Kigali yesterday afternoon after a weeklong visit to our  country. The mission came within the framework of the  implementation of the Arusha peace agreements and met the  requests for President Mwinyi's intervention made by the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] and the president of the Republic.    During his visit, Minister Rwegasira held talks with the  main  political forces of the country, forces which are to take part  in the transitional institutions. He met the president of the  Republic, the two prime ministers, RPF officials, and  representatives of the Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development [MRND], the Republican Democratic  Movement, the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic  Party, and the two Liberal Party [PL] factions.    Rwegasira said before his departure that the only remaining  obstacle to setting up the transitional institutions lay with  the PL party, especially in the lack of coordination by the two  factions on how to distribute their ministerial portfolios.    On behalf of the facilitator, President Mwinyi, Minister  Rwegasira urged all the parties involved to assume their  responsibilities in the implementation of the Arusha peace  accord. Before leaving Kigali, Rwegasira met with the political  parties due to take part in the broad-based transitional  government, as well as diplomats accredited in Kigali. The  Office of the President, the MRND, and the Mugenzi faction of  the PL were not represented [words indistinct] at that meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/4/1994 -- Geza Entz, member of  the Hungarian Government, paid his Romanian visit in spite of  the fact that the Romanian Foreign Ministry was emphatic about  abstaining from this until Romanian authorities agreed. "It is  regrettable that the Hungarian dignitary chose to ignore the  Romanian authorities", said Ambassador Traian Chebeleu during a  news conference on 8 April, in answering a ROMPRES question.    Referring to the same aspect, the presidential spokesman  showed that the Romanian authorities were worried by that  gesture "that accounts for a very serious brake in the efforts  to normalize the Romanian-Hungarian relations and conclude the  basic treaty between the two countries," as the Budapest  official's behaviour defied the principles of inter-state  relations.    Referring to the pardoning of the ethnic Hungarians involved  in the crimes at Zetea and Dealu, Harghita County, presidential  spokesman Traian Chebeleu said it was not complete. It was made  in such a way as to have the convicts eligible for parole while  the final decision would be made in keeping with the existing  procedures by the local court.    As regarded the treaty envisaged to be concluded with the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Ambassador Chebeleu said it was  part of Romania's policy of equal treatment of all states in the  territory of former Yugoslavia.    The statement of Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli,  who  did not name Romania among the countries that gave the Republic  of Moldova support, accusing it instead of failure to fulfil its  obligations, was termed as "ununderstandable" by Traian Chebeleu  who said the Romanian authorities waited for "the necessary  explanation" that would be requested through the Romanian  Embassy in Chisinau.    The spokesman also said President Ion Iliescu was  represented  at the funeral of playwright Eugen Ionesco by Romania's  Ambassador in Paris, Anton Vatasescu.    Requested to deny or confirm an alleged meeting between  President Slobodan Milosevic and American General George Joulwan  during the Serb head of state's stay in Bucharest, Ambassador  Traian Chebeleu definitely denied it: "The meeting did not and  could not occur because of President Milosevic's very busy  schedule, he said. [no closing quotation mark as received]    Romanian President Ion Iliescu will pay a state visit to  France over 14-11 April, 1994, presidential spokesman Traian  Chebeleu also announced in his news conference.    The schedule of the visit includes, apart from talks with  President Mitterrand, an interview with Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, meetings with Senate President Rene Monory and  President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin, with other  politicians.    He is also expected to meet at the National Council of the  French Employers with representatives of business circles and to  visit the GEC-Alsthom works.    The presidential spokesman assessed the visit was "a natural  moment in the evolution of the Romanian-French relations after  the revolution and at the same time it is meant to boost them."  Stressing that in the four years after the revolution France has  given Romania decisive support in its efforts for rapprochement  and integration in the bodies of the European democratic states,  Ambassador Traian Chebeleu highlighted that Romania's president  attached great importance to the forthcoming political  consultations with France, that would cover a wide area of  issues, from ways to further develop the bilateral relations and  the speeding up of Romania's integration in the European  institutions to the current questions of security in our zone  and in Europe generally.    The visit will have also an important economic dimension,  the  result of which we hope to be an ever more significant presence  of the French companies in the Romanian economy, the  presidential spokesman said.</p>

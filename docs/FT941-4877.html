			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ADT net income little changed at Dollars 111.7m ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group which does much of its business in the US but retains a UK quote, yesterday reported net income of Dollars 111.7m (Pounds 76.5m) for 1993. The result was little changed from the Dollars 109.1m recorded in 1992, the first year that the Bermuda-registered group reported under US GAAP rules. Earnings per share were unchanged at 80 cents despite a higher Dollars 21.2m (Dollars 6.8m) tax charge and the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the Dollars 1.25bn refinancing package completed in August. Operating income after goodwill amortisation of Dollars 26.5m (Dollars 27.9m) increased by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 197.4m (Dollars 181.9m) on net sales of Dollars 1.38bn (Dollars 1.35bn) led by the electronic security services business which lifted its profit contribution to Dollars 154m (Dollars 141m) on sales of Dollars 937.3m (Dollars 901.1m). Commenting on the results, Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said they were 'on target with the electronic security services division successfully adding 145,000 new residential customers during the year and the vehicle auction division having continued success in encouraging new and used vehicle dealers to attend the company's auctions on a regular basis.' Net interest costs increased to Dollars 47.3m (Dollars 42.7m) mainly reflecting a decline in interest income. Mr Ashcroft said the refinancing, which lengthened ADT's average debt maturities to over seven years, provided 'a firm base for the continued development of the businesses.' COMMENT ADT's two core businesses continue to perform solidly if not spectacularly with net cash flow from operations increasing to Dollars 271.4m (Dollars 221.9m) last year. ADT's residential security operations continue to benefit from growing concern about crime on both sides of the Atlantic while the car auctions business should benefit from the revitalised new car market. The group has been investing heavily to cut costs and the few remaining non-core operations are slated for sale. Offsetting these positives are the higher interest costs associated with the debt refinancing and the continued increase in ADT's reported tax rate, which will leave earnings virtually unchanged this year. ADT's shares continue to underperform the market, reflecting investors' concerns about the group's chequered history.</p>

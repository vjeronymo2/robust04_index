			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>   [Text] Washington June 21 TASS -- The establishment of a  Russian-American petroleum club -- a new nongovernmental and  nonprofit organisation -- was announced by Yuriy Shafranik,  Russian minister of fuel and power, here on Monday.    This organisation will promote an accelerated development of  Russia's petroleum sector and establish cooperation between  Russian and American companies, Shafranik told ITAR-TASS.    One of the main tasks of the club will be to establish  direct  contacts between large petroleum companies of the two countries,  which will render unnecessary go-betweens which quite often only  discredit joint projects, he said.    "Yet another project which, I hope, will be discussed within  the framework of the club envisages transition from the sale of  American oil-well equipment to Russia to its manufacture in our  country.    "With the availability of relatively small financial  resources, the Russian side can turn out a very large array of  such equipment at defence-industry enterprises subject to  conversion to civilian production. Large American petroleum  companies support this idea," the minister said.    Final details of the work and organisational structure of  the  club are to be discussed in the coming days within the framework  of the Russian-U.S. intergovernmental commission for economic  and technological cooperation, Shafranik emphasised.    The club is expected to include directors of petroleum and  investment companies of the two countries. Its headquarters is  to be in Moscow and its missions will be located both in Russia  and the U.S.    Shafranik also mentioned as very important events at the  forthcoming session of the bilateral commission the final stage  of discussion and a probable signing of an agreement under a  Sakhalin-2 project which will for the first time give access to  Russian oil- bearing shelves to an international consortium.</p>

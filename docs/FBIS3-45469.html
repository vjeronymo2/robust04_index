Shanghai will have an increase of 12 percent in its gross  domestic product (GDP) this year, lower than 1992 and 1993 but  higher than the national average and, according to Hua Jianmin,  director of the Municipal Planning Commission. The city's  average annual growth rate in the 1980s was 7.4 percent.    The industrial sector, which accounts for some 60 percent of  the municipality's GDP, will try for a growth rate of 15  percent, Xu Zhiyi, director of the Municipal Economic Commission  said.    He said that the industrial sector would emphasize the  development of automobiles, telecommunications, power stations,  computers and household electric appliances. Some 18 projects  with an investment of more than 200 million yuan or an output  value of more than one billion yuan each were designated as key  projects.    The growth rate in foreign trade is expected to surpass last  year's 12 percent. Sha Ling, vice-mayor in charge of foreign  trade, said that foreign trade should become the impetus of the  economic restructuring and the sustained, healthy and rapid  development of the economy of Shanghai.    In 1994, Shanghai will invest more than 20 billion yuan in  the service industries, more than the total for the primary and  secondary industries. The service industries are expected to  yield 40 percent of Shanghai's GDP.    Pudong New Area, one of the largest development areas in  China, is expected to produce more than 25 billion yuan of GDP  this year, an increase of 30 percent over last year, according  to Zhao Qizheng, head of the Area Management Commission.    The area will also produce 1.25 billion U.S. dollars worth  of  exports, an increase of 25 percent over last year. Both targets  are double those of the municipality's average.    In addition, the commodity retail sales volume will surpass  83 billion yuan, an increase of more than 27 percent.    Some economists are worried that bottle-neck problems,  mainly  in capital and raw materials, might hamper the economic  development of Shanghai to some extent.    But the listed targets will be realized if there are no  major  changes in the macro economic environment, most economists said.</p>

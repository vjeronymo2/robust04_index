			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING ABSTINENCE TO PREVENT AIDS  </P> <P> It is hard to argue with the concept of sexual abstinence as the most important  means of preventing AIDS, but to insist on celibacy as the only formula for  teaching teen-agers about this dread disease indicates a tenuous grip on  reality.  </P> <P> True enough, celibacy will absolutely prevent all sexually transmitted  diseases, but that begs the question of how to handle those who can't seem to  resist the raging torrent of adolescent hormones.  </P> <P> I suppose this same group of parents would prohibit teaching about the dangers  of drunk driving because, after all, their sons and daughters will obviously  not imbibe before the age of 21.  </P> <P> ROBERT E.

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / US places China ban THE Bush administration has banned the export to China of parts for a domestic communications satellite, called Dong Fang Hong 3, on grounds of proliferation concerns. However, President Bush approved export of components for an Australian communications satellite and a Swedish weather satellite to be launched from China. These were to be controlled by 'others' before and after the launches, a US official said. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said the US was encouraging China to observe internationally accepted guidelines on missile exports.</p>

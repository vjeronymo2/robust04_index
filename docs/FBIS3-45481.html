Accompanied by Vice Governor Zhou Shichang as well as  provincial and Changsha City grain bureau leaders, Vice Minister  Bai Meiqing went to grain shops in Wuyi Zhonglu, Renminlu, and  Taipingjie, where he carefully checked the price tags as well as  the grain and oil quality and asked about grain and oil sales.    To implement instructions of the State Council, 400.5  million  kg of grain has been dumped onto the markets throughout the  province to control grain prices. Grain departments have been  active in transporting grain and in ensuring variety, quality,  quantity, prices, and service. Since the period before the New  Year, all grain departments have openly sold their grain with  price tags, thus speedily reducing grain and oil prices  throughout the province.</p>

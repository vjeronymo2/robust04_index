			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / German pay talks on verge of breakdown A BREAKDOWN of wage negotiations between the German government, the 16 federal states, and trade unions representing 2.3m public sector workers looked increasingly possible last night after union leaders rejected a government pay offer of 3.5 per cent as 'absolutely unacceptable'. Mrs Monica Wulf-Mathies, leader of the OTV trade union, was described by reporters covering the talks in Stuttgart as 'raging' after the offer was tabled by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, on behalf of the federal, state and local authorities. Unions representing 240,000 postal workers, and 110,000 on the railways also rejected the package, which comes in response to their pay claim of 9.5 per cent, plus increased holiday pay. Alongside the pay negotiations of the nation's 4m engineering workers, which began on Wednesday, the public sector deal is seen as critical to a wage round which could tip the German economy firmly into recession. Already the ill-organised banking workers are organising strikes, although without any apparent effect as yet on the banking system.</p>

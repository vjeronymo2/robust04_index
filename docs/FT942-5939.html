			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Number fever leaves Pepsi drinkers cold - Why 349 was so unlucky for the drinks company in the Philippines Albert Yeban lives in hope. Yeban, who works in the canteen at a Manila golf club, has nine Pepsi-Cola bottle tops with '349' printed on the underside. That number was announced as a winner in a Pepsi promotion in the Philippines two years ago, and Yeban reckons his bottles tops are worth a total of 4.4m pesos (Pounds 108,000) in cash prizes. He has joined a group of thousands of other 349-claimants and is hoping that an American lawyer will be found to win the money for him in a court case against PepsiCo in the US. PepsiCo wishes it had never heard of 349. In one of the more ill-fated announcements in marketing history, the number was declared a winner on May 25 1992, at the height of a highly successful 'under the crown' promotion called Number Fever. Printed on each bottle top was a three-digit number, a sum of prize money to be won if the number turned out to be a winner, and a security code. Such was the campaign's success in its first three months that it had been extended for a further five weeks. Unfortunately for Pepsi, and for thousands of Filipinos who thought they had become peso millionaires overnight, the number 349, chosen by a computer as a winner in the second stage, turned out to be a common non-winning number from the first stage. There were no fewer than 800,000 bottle tops imprinted with 349, of which half carried 1m peso prizes. Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines Inc (PCPPI), 19 per cent owned by PepsiCo, could not possibly pay; the sum would amount to more than Dollars 15bn, dwarfing the Pounds 48m lost by Maytag, parent of Hoover of the UK, in its disastrous 'free flights' offer to boost sales of vacuum cleaners. Amid angry demonstrations in which several people were injured and Pepsi trucks were vandalised, Pepsi officials explained that there had been a 'computer glitch' and insisted that only 349 numbers with the correct security codes (in other words those from the new series) would be honoured as winners. PCPPI decided to pay each 'old' 349 crown holder 500 pesos as a goodwill gesture, an offer which cost the company Dollars 10m, in addition to the Dollars 4m of prize money and advertising spent on the whole campaign. But many Filipinos, including Yeban, refused to accept the offer, joining pressure groups such as 'United 349' and '349 Consumers Organisation' that have sought payment in full and tried to keep the issue alive in the Philippine courts and in the media. Claimants also believe that wealthy PepsiCo in the US is a better target than its relatively insignificant affiliate PCPPI. One group has sought help from Robert Swift, a US lawyer who helped to win a class suit (a case brought by a class of people who share a grievance) in Honolulu on behalf of 10,000 victims of the regime of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos; the jury awarded Dollars 1.2bn from the Marcos estate to the victims, although the money has yet to be paid. Vicente del Fierro, a former advertising executive who heads another group called 'Coalition 349' from a house in the Manila suburbs, says he represents 3,000 of the 349ers. 'It's about third world countries being exploited by multinationals,' he declares, saying he is on a 'crusade for justice' over the company's 'deception' and 'malice'. Del Fierro charges the 349ers an annual fee and says he plans to file a class suit in the US against PepsiCo, although Jeffrey Glen, the New York lawyer with whom he is in contact, says that his company Berwin Leighton has done only 'a little preliminary work' and that no decision has been taken on whether to pursue the matter in the US. In the Philippines, which inherited a habit of litigiousness from the US, its former colonial power, more than 15,000 cases have been filed against PCPPI, but almost all have been dismissed. In one case earlier this year, a provincial court ordered the company to pay 1.1m pesos to a 21-year-old claimant, but the judgment is being challenged. PepsiCo - as keen to distance itself from the 349 affair as claimants are to implicate it - says Number Fever was 'a local promotion'. There haven't been any suits filed in the US, according to Ken Ross, PepsiCo's vice-president for public relations. 'It's not the proper venue.' During Number Fever, Pepsi increased its share of the soft drinks market in the Philippines from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, luring customers from the dominant Coca-Cola brands and smaller local manufacturers. After the 349 fiasco, however, Pepsi's share plunged to 16 per cent. Now the company's market share is recovering, although Pepsi-Cola itself, perhaps because it is identified by name with the 349 affair, has not done as well as non-cola drinks such as 7-Up or Mirinda. Pepsi says sales in the Philippines rose 40 per cent in the year to April, and market share is back to about 20 per cent. Filipinos say they are great ones for forgiving, whether it involves political enemies or companies such as Pepsi. Asked about Pepsi, one Manila stockbroker said: 'We even forgave Imelda (Marcos's notoriously extravagant wife) and let her stand in the presidential election.' PepsiCo, locked in combat with Coca-Cola for dominance in Asia's fast-growing markets, is keen to lay the 349 controversy to rest. 'The vast majority of consumers in the Philippines understand that this was an honest mistake,' says Ross. 'A small but vocal minority of people have chosen to pursue the matter. That's their right and the matter is in the courts.'</p>

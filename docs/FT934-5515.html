			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / More falls in German steel production West German steelmakers said production of hot-strip steel would fall by 15 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with the same period last year, because of continued depressed demand, the German steel association said yesterday. The reduction is higher than had been anticipated, reflecting dire market conditions, a spokesman from the association said. The reduction in hot-strip output for the whole year will amount to 12 per cent. Steelmakers have complained that the failure of the European Commission to reach a European-wide agreement on reducing over-capacity in steel markets would lead to drastic consequences in the recession-hit industry.</p>

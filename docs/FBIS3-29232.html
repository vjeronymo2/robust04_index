			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Japan's postal minister  Takenori Kanzaki expressed regrets Wednesday [16 February] over  the U.S. finding that Japan has breached a 1989 bilateral  agreement designed to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones. In  a written statement, the posts and telecommunications minister  said the finding, a move that could result in punitive action  unless a settlement is reached, was "unilateral."    Kanzaki said his ministry has taken necessary action to  boost  imports under the accord. He said Japan would deal with  possible U.S. punitive action against Japanese imports under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other  international trade rules.</p>

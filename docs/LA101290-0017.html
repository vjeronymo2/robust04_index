			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Serious Issue: Dan Quayle briefly considered running for President in 1988. In  an interview in the Baltimore Sun, Quayle said: "I think Marilyn and I had a  one-minute conversation one time whether I would even perhaps, maybe, sometime  run myself in 1988.  </P> <P> And in this one-minute conversation, I just dismissed it, said no, not this  time. George Bush is there; we'd have to take two years away from the family."  </P> <P> Right Reception: Sen. Ted Kennedy showed up Tuesday night at the Heritage  Foundation, that bunker of conservatism, but it wasn't anything sinister, and  Kennedy wasn't bolting his party. He attended a reception for conservative  columnist Cal Thomas' new book, "Uncommon Sense." Kennedy once signed one of  Thomas' books, "Cal Thomas usually says the far right thing instead of the  right thing, but I like reading him anyway."  </P> <P> Big Stick: Syndicated columnist Jack Anderson is now seen about town,  especially near his offices downtown, carrying a walking stick. It isn't an  affectation or meant to help him walk. Anderson was mugged last month and  robbed of $100 in the mid-afternoon near his office; the cane, with a heavy  brass handle, is his equalizer.  </P> <P> Driven to Expand: Gourmet stores will no longer be the only place to get  Chrysler Corp. chief Lee Iacocca's olive oil. Villa Nicola oil, made from  olives from the Iacocca family estate in the Tuscany section of Italy, will be  mass distributed later this month. "What started out as a hobby, a labor of  love . . . quickly grew into a project that requires the efforts of the entire  family," said a company spokesman.  </P></p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exchange rates hit Flogas profit Flogas, the supplier of liquefied petroleum gas in the UK and Ireland, has blamed turbulence in exchange rates as the principal cause of a drop in profits in the year ended June 30 1993. Pre-tax profit reported for the year was down from IPounds 7.16m to IPounds 6.52m (Pounds 6.1m). But Mr Jim Flavin, chairman, said had the same exchange rate been used throughout this year profits would have been IPounds 440,000 higher. Start-up costs associated with natural gas business in Britain, R&amp;D expenditure, the introduction of a twin share scheme which were written off, had also created exceptional costs of IPounds 270,000. Earnings per share were 23.31p (23.92p). The final dividend is 4.98p for an unchanged total of 7.92p. DCC, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, owns 60 per cent of the capital.</p>

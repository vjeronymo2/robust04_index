			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 20 May (EFE) -- Business people from the  Andean Group (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela)  garment industry and textile companies disagree over the textile  industry's request to restrict Asian clothing imports.    The Andean Textile Federation proposed the establishment of  minimum quotas and prices to the Cartagena Agreement Board  (Junac) to restrict Asian textile imports that enter the region  with undervalued prices. The Andean Garment Federation openly  opposes that proposal because it believes the free market "is  enough to face the unfair competition."    The garment industry also believes the quota system "is  self-defeating because just as quotas would be imposed on Asian  products, quotas could also be imposed on buying raw material in  those countries and that would hurt us."    An organization spokesman said Junac experts, who apparently  will meet in Lima today to discuss the issue, will resolve the  disagreement as a last resort.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Credit Shareholders Name Board, End </F> 11-Hour Meeting"]    [Text] (ANSA) Genoa, April 17 -- Shareholders of Credito  Italiano, which was privatized in December, concluded their  first assembly early Sunday morning [17 April] after meeting for  11 hours, listening to 513 speeches, approving the 1993  financial report and electing a new board of directors.    The new 11-member board includes Giampiero Pesenti  (Italmobiliare), Roberto Gavazzi (Allianz-Ras), J.G.T. Carter  (Commercial Union), Achille Maramotti (Max Mara), Franz Schmidt  (Nippon Life), Leonardo Del Vecchio (Luxottica), Wolfgang  Graebner (Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank), Leopold Henri  Jeorger (Societe Generale) and Roberto Bertazzoni (Smeg). The  two other board members, Lucio Rondelli and Egidio Giuseppe  Bruno, on Monday will be elected formally chairman and managing  director, respectively, it was announced.    Aside from the two top board members, the nine others  account  for an estimated 223 million shares of Credit stock, for a total  market value of between 600 and 650 billion lire (up to 397  million dollars).    The bad weather apparently kept away many of the 5,800  Credit  shareholders expected to attend and the meeting in the end saw a  total of 3,316 shareholders represented (personally or through  mandates), accounting for 32 percent of company stock. The  total number of company shareholders in the books on February 28  was 56,737.    The 1993 financial report showed profits increased 5 percent  in 1993 to 219 billion lire (133.8 million dollars) from 208  billion lire the previous year. Gross operating profits grew 96  percent to 1.336 trillion lire (816 million dollars) and  dividends were unchanged at 85 lire per ordinary share and 100  lire per savings share. For this year, Bruno forecast higher  profits because of lower taxes and illustrated the bank's  four-point strategy: increasing the number of low-cost branches,  more managed savings, a higher production rate (with about 200  job cuts a year) and expansion into merchant banking activities.</p>

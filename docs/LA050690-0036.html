			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UPGRADING PIER AREA  </P> <P> Your article (April 30) on Huntington Beach's Pierside Village project leaves  the impression that those of us who oppose the project want the area left in  its present state.  </P> <P> That is not true; it is obviously a blighted area and needs to be upgraded.  </P> <P> The disagreement is over what should be built on the site. The Downtown  Specific Plan passed by the Planning Commission and City Council specified that  commercial uses in this area are to be beach-related. Businesses that can be  accessed by beach-goers in bathing suits and sandy feet, and that would not  diminish views along Pacific Coast Highway would surely be supported by a  majority of area residents.  </P> <P> KAY SERAPHINE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

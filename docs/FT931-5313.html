			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: JFB makes Dollars 12.3m buy JOHNSON &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering group, has expanded in the US with the acquisition of Viking Metallurgical Corporation from Quanex Corporation for Dollars 12.3m (Pounds 8.6m), writes Peter Pearse. Based in Reno, Nevada, Viking manufactures seamless rolled rings and forgings and electron beam-melted materials, mainly for the aerospace engine components, industrial gas turbines and general engineering industries. Viking's pre-tax profits for the year ended October 31 1992 fell to Dollars 1.03m (Pounds 720,000) against Dollars 1.95m due to sales falling to Dollars 28.7m (Dollars 34m). Half the consideration will be paid in cash and the balance in a non-negotiable interest-free note maturing on February 28 1994. Quanex also received Dollars 500,000 representing cash movements at Viking since December 31.</p>

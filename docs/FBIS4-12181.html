			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting in Damascus today with the leaders of  the 10 Palestinian groups, Deputy Majles Speaker Hasan Ruhani  stressed: The massacre of the Muslims at al-Khalil Mosque shows  that the Zionist regime will never shed its savage streak.    The secretary of our country's Supreme National Security  Council added: The demonstrations on International Jerusalem Day  show that not only did the Zionist regime not achieve its cursed  aims in the al-Khalil incident but that the affection of the  world Muslims for the Palestinians has increased.    Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of the  Lebanese  revolutionary movement Hizballah, at a meeting with the deputy  Majles speaker this morning, thanked the esteemed leader  [Khamene'i], the president, the Majles speaker, and the people  of Iran for their attention to the justice-seeking struggles of  the Muslim people of Lebanon.</p>

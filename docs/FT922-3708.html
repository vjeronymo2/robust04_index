			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Regulator must act on water Sir, In your article, 'And not a drop to spray: The water crisis in the UK' (May 30), you commented on the profits and dividend increases being reported by various water companies. Pride of place was awarded to the East Surrey Water Company, whose profits and dividend increased by 42 per cent and 19.5 per cent respectively. These figures should come as no surprise given that increases applied at April 1 1990 and April 1 1991 resulted in a cumulative increase of approximately 69 per cent: the Retail Prices Index increase was only a fraction of this figure. In my view competition in the marketplace is an essential ingredient of the free enterprise system. Water companies enjoy an absolute monopoly in their supply area and were not appropriate candidates for privatisation. It is not surprising that, at a time when many large companies subject to the rigours of competition in a severe recession are reporting markedly reduced profits, the water companies are prospering. Unless there is some really effective action by the industry regulator the prospects for the customer are bleak indeed with ever escalating charges and little to show for it.

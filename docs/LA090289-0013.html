			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PUSH TO RECYCLE OUR MOUNTAINS OF TRASH  </P> <P> We have always recycled our newspapers to save the trees. Now, for the first  time, I can't recycle. At $5 a ton, it is not worth it to the recycler and his  receiver. They are refusing to accept newspapers.  </P> <P> I have canceled my daily paper and kept it Sunday, only because I can't stand  to give up The Times completely.  </P> <P> The idea of recycling has struggled so hard to survive and catch on. We can't  lose that momentum, if only because the dumps are filling up so fast.  </P> <P> GRACE GAFFNEY  </P> <P> Yucca Valley  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 9 May (DPA) -- Ernesto Perez  Balladares, virtual Panamanian president-elect, confirmed today  that Gabriel Lewis Galindo will serve as foreign minister in his  cabinet.    Galindo, brother of Samuel Lewis Galindo -- beer businessman  and one of the six presidential candidates who lost in  yesterday's elections -- was one of the Panamanian negotiators  of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977 and one of the main  opponents of former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.    Perez Balladares, who confirmed the report published by LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA about the list of possible ministers, said  the posts of attorney general; comptroller; and ministers of the  Presidency, agricultural development, education, health, and  foreign relations will be offered to political figures who do  not belong to his Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). The  victorious candidate said the Housing, Public Works, Labor and  Social Welfare, Commerce and Industries, Planning, and  Government and Justice Ministries might be occupied by PRD  members. In this way, the future president kept his campaign  promise to appoint a cabinet with an undetermined number of  opposition and independent members.    Perez Balladares said current magistrates Eduardo Valdes,  Dennis Allen, and Guillermo Marquez will be retained in the  Electoral Tribunal. Jose de los Santos Chen Barria of the  Christian Democratic Party may be confirmed as comptroller. The  Attorney General's Office will be occupied by Jose Antonio  Sossa, another PDC member, and Oswaldo Fernandez, who was  appointed by President Endara as head of the Public Force, will  retain his post.    Stanley Muschett, president of the Justice and Peace  Commission and rector of the private Santa Maria la Antigua  University, will occupy the post of education minister, while  Carlos Souza, former president of the Cattlemen's Association,  will hold the post of agricultural development minister. Also,  veteran Liberal Party politician Raul Arango will be designated  Presidency minister and Carlos Garcia de Paredes, former dean of  the School of Medicine of the University of Panama, will be  appointed health minister.    Two PRD members will be appointed commerce and industries  minister and government and justice ministers: livestock  businessman Felix Gonzalez and the PRD's leftist First Assistant  Secretary Mitchel Doens, respectively. Two women will be named  to the posts of labor and social welfare minister and economic  planning minister, but their names were not disclosed by Perez  Balladares.    After learning of his triumph, Perez Balladares said: "The  era of electoral confrontation has passed, and we must enter the  21st century with a vision of the future and with the commitment  to our children and grandchildren, without returning to the past  and without links to the past."</p>

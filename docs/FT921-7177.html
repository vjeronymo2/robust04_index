			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Confectioners fear Gatt effect BRITAIN'S confectionery ex-porters have attacked the dearth of information available from the European Community to measure the impact on their industry of proposed world farm trade reforms. They fear they are to be made 'sacrificial lambs' as European Community farm ministers - forced to cut agriculture subsidies - try to spare farmers at the expense of exporters of processed foods. Mr Paul Williamson, vice-president of the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance, said 6,000 jobs could be at stake - almost 7 per cent of the 90,000 staff employed by the alliance's 200 members companies. Anxiety focuses on a draft proposal for liberalisation of the world trading system, released just two months ago by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). In the report Mr Dunkel has proposed a 20 per cent cut in domestic support for EC farmers, but a 36 per cent cut in subsidies for farm exports. The export subsidy cuts, still fiercely contested by EC farm ministers, are intended to stem the European practice of dumping farm produce on the world markets as a means of reducing surpluses arising from the heavily subsidised domestic industry. Association members, which include companies like Cadbury, Lyons and United Biscuits, fear EC ministers will fudge the figures, shifting the weight of subsidy cuts on to processed food exporters, which at present can reclaim the difference between European and world prices for sugar, milk and cereal when they sell outside the EC. Mr Williamson said: 'These are the most important trade negotiations of my working lifetime. Twenty per cent of our business is affected, and we just don't know what the data is underpinning the Dunkel proposals. How can we evaluate the likely impact of the proposals? World leaders are going into negotiations not knowing what the proposals mean.' Fears were heightened in the House of Lords two weeks ago when Baroness Trumpington, minister of state for agriculture, conceded that 'internal prices would come down very little (under the Dunkel proposals) so that community processors would continue to face higher raw material costs than their overseas competitors. But export refunds might be so constrained that they would no longer bridge the gap.'</p>

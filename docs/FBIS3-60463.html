			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Ivanov report: "Influenza Passed By"] </F>   [Text] Only one case of influenza was registered last week  in Moscow, while the week before there were several cases,  Nikolay Malyshev, Moscow's chief infection specialist, told  INTERFAX. From what he said, the overall level of cases of  influenza does not exceed the normal level. The number of cases  is not increasing, but decreasing. According to N. Malyshev's  prediction, in the near future you can scarcely expect a big  surge in the number of cases of influenza. By way of preventive  measures, he recommended that the inhabitants of the capital  should toughen themselves up, take fresh air, plenty of fluids,  lemon, and honey, and by way of medicines -- Dibasol.    At the same time, according to Moscow's main infection  specialist, "I find diphtheria a far greater headache." N.  Malyshev reported that between the beginning of this year and 25  November 2,001 patients with diphtheria have been registered in  Moscow, including 458 children. In the same period of time, 86  people have died of diphtheria.    A total of 316 new people suffering from diphtheria have  been  registered in November alone, including 188 children. The  number of people with diphtheria has trebled in comparison with  the same period last year. Fatalities from this disease are  increasing even more. "The only effective preventive measure is  vaccination," N. Malyshev stressed.    According to figures from the Russian Federation State  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, the  level of intestinal diseases has risen again since June 1993  following a number of very favorable years in Russia. In 1992,  for instance, the lowest level of cases of dysentry was recorded  in the whole period of the official registration of this disease  (since 1970).    However, in the first eight months of this year, the number  of people suffering from dysentry has risen in the Russian  Federation in comparison with the same period last year by 21.2  percent. The greatest increase was in the northern and  northwestern regions. In all, during the eight months,  information about 30 outbreaks has come to the attention of the  Russian State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological  Supervision.    Cases of cholera have also been registered. In July-August,  11 Russian citizens who returned from India, Pakistan, and  Turkey were diagnosed as having cholera. Two cases have been  identified in Dagestan and Stavropol Kray.</p>

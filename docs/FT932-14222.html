			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: US economy Profit taking may have pulled Wall Street lower after Friday's record high, but retail investors are clearly still keen on equities. This enthusiasm sits somewhat oddly with the wider markets' sceptical attitude to the dollar. If the economy is picking up fast enough to produce the earnings recovery which the equity market needs, then the dollar might be expected to do well too. Part of the answer may lie with the nature of the US recovery. Growth has slowed from the 4 per cent expansion seen in the last quarter of 1992. The expansion is also biased towards investment and productivity gains and away from consumers. Indeed, with individuals still retrenching and personal incomes growing slowly, a consumer boom looks unlikely. Inflation is subdued and expectations of interest rate rises have eased. That both encourages investors to continue switching funds out of deposits into equities, particularly capital goods stocks, and reduces the dollar's attractions. Modest growth and low inflation may also allow bond yields to fall further if the deficit reduction process keeps going. If it fails, private investor liquidity is a poor support for a market which looks historically expensive.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Letter: Water should stay privatised Sir, the Labour manifesto says 'the provision of water is so fundamental that it is a priority for return to public control'. Such a reversal would be a tragedy for many customers, shareholders and employees. It is a proposal which ignores the massive improvement in the water industry since flotation two years ago when government put ownership and management into the more efficient private sector while retaining its true role as regulator, with powers to punish failure. Water is a business. Like coal, oil and any mineral, water is a natural resource. But laboratories, treatment works, thousands of miles of pipes, reservoirs and trained skills are not. Water is a continuous process industry that plans for water, collects it, stores it, treats, it distributes it, re-cycles it and disposes of it - all to very high legal standards. Since flotation, investment, previously neglected, has proceeded apace and with certainty. New standards have been achieved, new technology implemented, the pace of change increased, skilled staff attracted and rewarded, international business secured. Alongside this, water bills have remained low - in the case of Thames an average of 40p per day per family. There are no arguments for changing an efficient, highly-motivated business. I hope all those involved, including those in the private sector companies whose employees benefit from taking part in the Pounds 30bn industry capital programme, will reflect on Labour's proposals.

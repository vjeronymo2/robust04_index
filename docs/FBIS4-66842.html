			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by editor in chief, Hasan Sabra] </F>   [Text] It is not unusual for President Hafiz al-Asad to  receive his official guests early in his office at Tishrin  Palace. But Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of Arab-Zionist  negotiations, was set to meet the president at 1100 on  Wednesday, 23 March 1994. However, the appointment was moved  back to 0800, because President al-Asad would be going directly  to the airport after receiving Ross to fly in his private plane  to al-Qardahah. There, he was to find his distinguished family  waiting to accompany him to the grave of his late son, Basil, to  read the Surat-al-Fatihah [the opening passage of the Koran] for  Basil's virtuous soul. This occurred on Basil's 32d birthday,  the first at which he would not be present.    Basil's father opened his hands toward the sky, reading the  Surat-al-Fatihah, praying for mercy for his eldest son's soul.  He then murmured an apology to his son, Bashshar, for his late  arrival at the grave to commemorate his son Basil, now under  God's protection, two months and one week after Basil's  departure to his maker. The meaning of the garden of eternity is  that, after death, one is reborn in the hands of God.    No one except for his family saw al-Asad's tears, shock, and  emotion as he stood, head bowed, his eyes fixed on the ground,  as if he were reading there the phrase of [the Syrian poet]  Abu-al-'Ala': "Tread lightly. The ground, I believe, is composed  but of these bodies."    Dr. Bashshar accompanied his father back to the car, which  would take them to their home, so that he could hear from the  president what the premature spirit of responsibility had placed  upon his shoulders following his older brother's death.    Al-Asad's sons had perceived their brother Basil's  shouldering of responsibility upon their father's direction.  They had overflowed with happiness over the eldest son's  preparation for assuming responsibility based on his worthiness,  competence, enterprising spirit, initiative, excellent  reputation, rectitude, and noble character--characteristics that  honored the family. Each son had devoted himself to his work and  independently chosen post, satisfied and confident. Bashshar's  hobby and passion has been ophthalmology, which he began  studying at the University of Damascus. He excelled in this and  then went on to continue his specialization in London. The other  son, Mahir, joined the armed forces, where he distinguished  himself for his bravery, which is not unusual for the al-Asad  family.    However, the trusteeship fell upon Bashshar and his hobby  and  academic studies.    Major Basil al-Asad was killed on the morning on which he  had  been scheduled to meet his brother Bashshar in London. Basil had  been en route to the Damascus Airport to fly on a civilian plane  to Germany and then to London to meet his brother Bashshar. But  fate was faster than the speed with which Basil drove the car.  "We are nearer to you than the jugular vein." "It is but like  lightning."    Bashshar was notified of the need to interrupt his studies  in  London to go to Damascus before President al-Asad learned of his  eldest son's death. Bashshar had called his father from London  to ask him why he had been summoned to Damascus at daybreak on  that densely foggy London morning. Bashshar had made that call  before the president received another telephone call from two  officials in the capital, Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi  and Lt. Gen. Mustafa Talas, who had asked to see the president  on that tragic morning. The president/father made a connection  between the two calls. He asked the two officials: Did something  happen to Basil, oh my God. The father's heart and feelings told  him that something awful had happened to his son, whom he knew  was to have left for Europe on a plane.    Yes, Basil has passed on.    And Bashshar came to Damascus to bear responsibility.  <H5>  The Intelligentsia's Questions </H5>   When news of Basil al-Asad's death became known, the hearts  of millions in the Arab world, specifically in Syria and  Lebanon, trembled in anxiety and grief, as never before, over  the loss of this young public servant. Their political and  emotional sympathy stemmed from the pain, which they felt over  the loss of a young politician considered a model of responsible  youth, and from the fact that he was the son of a leader to whom  millions have given their trust out of love and conviction, even  after that leader had made difficult decisions, which might not  have been popular at first (e.g., his historical, strategic  positions regarding Lebanon and the Gulf).    This sad public consensus was the outcome of a previous  poll,  which paid homage to Basil in the presence of his father, may  God prolong his life. When Basil left to be at God's side, the  people wanted to tell al-Asad that their homage to Basil stemmed  primarily from their homage to al-Asad and from al-Asad's trust  in Basil, trust that reflected the people's trust in this  promising young man.    When Basil died, the people saw that a dream of the leader  had been buried, and that the dream goes beyond the strictly  human aspect to the political continuity that President al-Asad  found embodied in his eldest son, and that he mentioned with  each step taken by Basil in his youth.    Continuity in any regime, especially after it has been  established and tested, safeguards the accomplishments that that  regime achieved in the period of its establishment and testing.  The Syrian regime is the creation of al-Asad's hands, effort,  intellect, and calculations. It is Hafiz al-Asad's regime in  every sense of the word. If we now wish to assess this regime,  we have only to look at Syria's position on the political map of  the Arab east, the Arab world, and the world. It is no surprise  that, according to the assessment of the majority of prominent  Western political writers, Hafiz al-Asad is one of the most  skillful politicians of this era, and Syria has been at the acme  of its role and radiance in al-Asad's era. The man acknowledges  his stature modestly, confidently, and with the strength of  character of an enlightened person. He allowed his eldest son to  become familiar with the regime's intricacies and role by  serving as a model father, distinguished political and strategic  leader, and brilliant political visionary.    Basil's father was correct to think well of Basil. Hafiz  al-Asad was truly proud of his son and the effort made by his  son, who spared no action or skill for the sake of success.    Basil's success was a guarantee of continuity in the sense  that we have depicted above. With Basil gone, the hope is that  Bashshar will take up the banner.    Some of the intelligentsia have questioned, publicly and  perhaps privately, the advantage and rightfulness of a son  succeeding his father in a republican, presidential system. They  have also asked whether the opportunity, circumstances, and  superior effectiveness of Basil guaranteed continuity, and  whether this means that Bashshar can embody the same continuity!    Some have posed these questions based on their fundamental  opposition to hereditary succession in a republican,  presidential system. Others have asked them based on their  criticism of al-Asad's regime and their objection to its  foundation.    However, we examine this question from a different,  objective  angle in this quickly compiled report. We maintain that the  issue of who was to succeed Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was earnestly  and agonizingly posed during two historical stages in the life  of Egypt and the Arabs after the death of that Arab leader.    The first was immediately after Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's death,  when Anwar al-Sadat assumed power in his capacity as the vice  president temporarily on 28 September 1970.    The second was after Anwar al-Sadat's coup against  'Abd-al-Nasir's regime on 13 May 1971.    We were in the prime of life. Everyone's deepest anxiety  after 'Abd-el-Nasir's death concerned the search for continuity.  Some of us had delusions about 'Abd-al-Nasir's institutions  serving as the basis for continuity. These institutions included  the Arab Socialist Union with its pioneering organizing work,  legislative and executive organizations, the security and  intelligence agencies, the armed forces, the Interior Ministry,  and the information agencies. These institutions were supposed  to have filled the vacuum.    The popular sentiment--and I am closer to party restraint,  ideological inquiry, philosophy, and theorization--was  autocratical. The people asked, why Anwar al-Sadat? Where are  the sons of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir? Where is Khalid  ['Abd-al-Nasir's son]?    We laughed at the "naivete" of the people's questions. We  maintained that continuity lay in organization, institutions,  and.... However all of this collapsed suddenly in one cunning  coup engineered by Anwar al-Sadat, a man who turned his back on  all institutions and was able to arouse the people's emotions  with several slogans, in the absence of any role for his rival,  'Abd-al-Nasir's lieutenants. Al-Sadat filched power, and our  theorizing proved wrong. The people's intuition remained more  reliable. Why is it that Khalid 'Abd-al-Nasir did not succeed  his father and take power?    The answer is that 'Abd-al-Nasir did not prepare any of his  sons for power. Moreover, he did not permit any of them to  engage in political activity. He did not place them in any  organizational, institutional, security, or military cadre. They  learned only those military matters learned by other compulsory  conscripts. 'Abd-al-Nasir had his opinion regarding this  exclusion.    'Abd-al-Nasir died, and power was transferred to  institutions. A man named Anwar al-Sadat came and stole the  government, imprisoning everyone, including the institutions. If  only there had been a moment of regret.    Hafiz al-Asad did not exclude his children from politics.  Rather, they have been immersed in political activity their  entire life, since their earliest awareness. As a head of state,  he provided them with everything that can benefit them in their  political training, fundamental orientation, knowledge of  secrets, and knowledge of the shortest, soundest routes to sound  decision making and logical thinking.    Hafiz al-Asad did well to find someone who shared his home,  dining table, and the corners of his office with whom he could  debate and discuss the issues based on love, without hypocrisy,  fawning, fear, dread, hesitation, or calculations. Leaders  throughout the ages have tended to develop such relationships.  The almighty God addressed his most noble, Arab Prophet, God  bless him and grant him salvation, about bringing hearts  together and about those whose hearts are bought with money.    There is thus nothing strange in Basil being the main person  with whom his father could be open and candid and with whom he  could examine the issues without having to be calculating. Why  should Bashshar not play the same role? No one in the world can  for a moment doubt Hafiz al-Asad's good education and guidance  of his children.    If it was fortuitous that a difference in age briefly  granted  continuity to the martyr Basil, it was also fortuitous that fate  itself granted continuity to Dr. Bashshar after his older  brother's death.  <H5>  As for Now </H5>   I have been leading up to Bashshar. From the very outset,  this young man has possessed the basic elements that embody  continuity.    In his first meeting with Lebanese President Ilyas  al-Hirawi,  Bashshar made an outstanding impression on the president with  his incisive personality, disciplined spirit, and scientific  mind.    Bashshar came to the Guest Palace to meet President  al-Hirawi, who had personally asked to meet him--after he left  his camp for his home to put on his civilian clothes--in order  to address him confidentially and to give him an attentive  audience, a primary characteristic of success being that one  excel at listening before excelling at speaking.    Those who know the two brothers say that Basil was both shy  and self-confident, and that Bashshar is bold and decisive.    It thus comes as no surprise to see the continuation of the  Basil's course of pursuing violators of the law and smugglers of  narcotics and goods over the Lebanese-Syrian border, without  hesitation and tirelessly with respect to narcotics dealers.    Perhaps the most curious incident seen by the security  agencies in the Lebanese governorates of al-Biqa' and al-Shamal  [North Lebanon] is the following: On the evening of 17 January  1994, two days after Basil's death, a Lebanese security officer  received a report over the radio about three smuggling and  kickback operations in Tripoli. His first comment when he heard  the report was, "What has broken loose? The man [Basil] has been  gone only two days."    However, the security officer regained his composure after  Dr. Bashshar took up his responsibilities. He no longer reads in  the security reports anything to the effect that anything has  changed in Basil's absence, for Bashshar represents continuity.</p>

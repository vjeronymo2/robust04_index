			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / SNP leader hits out at southern 'subsidy junkies' THE NEED to stave off the mounting threat to the Conservative vote in the south of England will lead to more government decisions favouring that region, Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, predicted yesterday. Speaking a week after the Tories lost their traditionally safe seat of Christchurch, Dorset, to the Liberal Democrats, Mr Salmond used a keynote speech on the Scottish economy to brand the inhabitants of south-east England as 'the subsidy junkies of the UK'. The 'myth' of the subsidised Scot had been 'substantially scotched', he said, arguing that the UK defence budget represented 'an effective regional policy five or six times as powerful as the whole official regional aid expenditure'. Much of the government's economic policy was 'a loosely disguised ramp' for the south. In the second of a series of five or six speeches leading to the annual SNP party conference in Dunoon, Strathclyde, next month, Mr Salmond said Scotland would be substantially better off as an independent nation. Constitutional change was the key to Scotland's economic prosperity since it would enable it to escape the UK's 'inevitable decline'. Mr Salmond resisted the temptation to gloat over Scotland's recent comparatively buoyant economic performance: 'I find little cause for celebration just because we are suffering slightly less economic misery than many of our English neighbours.' He said Scottish gross domestic product might be 10 per cent lower in 1997 than would be the case in an independent Scotland.</p>

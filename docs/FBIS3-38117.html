			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and Sinn Fein  leader Gerry Adams tonight said they knew nothing of reports  that the IRA might declare a three-month ceasefire.    Their comments followed reports from Belfast that the IRA  was  considering declaring a brief truce to try to wring concessions  on the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland.    A REUTERS news agency report quoted republican sources in  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as saying a three-month  halt to attacks on British troops and police in the province was  under consideration at a series of secret IRA meetings. The  sources said the ceasefire was being floated to put pressure on  Britain to take a more active role in uniting Ulster with the  republic, according to REUTERS.    But Mr Adams told the Irish Republic's RTE broadcasting  network that he doubted there was any validity in the ceasefire  report.    Mr Reynolds, commenting after a meeting of his Fianna Fail  party in County Mayo, said the vast majority of people were  anxious that there should be an end to the violence. But he  stressed that a temporary ceasefire would not bring about a  renegotiation of the December 15 joint Anglo-Irish statement.    Mr Reynolds said the peace declaration could be  authoritatively explained by either the British or Irish  Government. But, in an apparent signal of growing Dublin  impatience with the failure of hard-line republicans to respond  to the initiative, he warned it would be unrealistic and  unacceptable to suggest the political issues could be resolved  in bilateral talks between anonymous British Government  representatives and Sinn Fein.    In the latest of a series of comments on the peace  initiative, Mr Reynolds claimed "fairly comprehensive  clarification" had now been given in a series of speeches and  public statements by him and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir  Patrick Mayhew. He added: "I would ask everyone to address  themselves to that clarification and to the document itself --  so that we do not keep going round and round discussing points  that have already been dealt with."    The fundamental problems of Northern Ireland had to be  resolved democratically around a table between all the parties  and the two governments, he said, adding: "We would all soon  like to move on to that stage."    The end of terrorist violence would produce a large peace  dividend that would have a major impact on prosperity throughout  Ireland.    Meanwhile, Mr Adams tonight spoke of his ambition to "bring  an end to the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics." But  he insisted that the Downing Street peace declaration had fudged  the issue of Irish self-determination. Mr Adams, on RTE  television, claimed there were several "matters of text" in the  declaration that required clarification. The document first  addressed the self- determination issue, then went on to fudge  it, he said.    The Sinn Fein president's 20-minute interview was recorded  shortly before it was broadcast. It was shown in line with  official guidelines circulated earlier this month when the  Dublin government dropped a ban on TV and radio interviews with  members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups with paramilitary  connections.    Mr Adams said: "I am totally committed to moving out of the  conflict situation into a peaceful situation. What I want to do  -- and this is a judgment from me -- is to bring an end to the  Irish Republican Army, be part of taking the gun totally out of  Irish politics now."    He added: "It is a long time since a republican was ...  interviewed in an RTE studio. With 20 years of disinformation  to catch up on, I can tell you now that I am absolutely  confident that this generation of republicans will be part of  bringing about a lasting peace.    "This Sinn Fein leadership is totally committed to bringing  that about ... The opportunity for peace will not be squandered  by republicans and we will not let the British Government  squander it."    In Londonderry tonight, another Sinn Fein leader insisted  the  republican movement wanted "a permanent peace, a peace built on  justice and equality and on democratic rights, including our  right as a nation to self-determination."    Tom Hartley called on the British Government to withdraw the  Unionist veto to political change if it wanted a solution.    "Unionists must be persuaded that their real strength lies  not in threats and vetoes, but in their place as a substantial  minority on the island of Ireland," he told a rally.    The Government had created the Unionist veto and had the  power to remove it. The veto had "promoted intransigence and an  absolute unwillingness to consider any proposal for political  progress."</p>

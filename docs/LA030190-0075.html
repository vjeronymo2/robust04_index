			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOLAN FACES HIS TOUGHEST ELECTION RACE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: CAPITOL CORRUPTION PROBE HAS LEFT THE GLENDALE REPUBLICAN UNDER  A CLOUD THAT MAY GIVE A DEMOCRATIC RIVAL A CHANCE TO UNSEAT THE ASSEMBLY  VETERAN.  </P> <P> Facing his most difficult election in 12 years, Glendale Republican Pat Nolan  kicked off his campaign for a seventh term in the Assembly last week with a  rousing endorsement from Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Addressing 600 Nolan supporters at a $150 per person reception in Pasadena,  Deukmejian praised the former Republican Assembly leader as a close personal  friend and key player in his administration.  </P> <P> "While I'm not going to be there next year and the years after, I sure will be  able to sleep better if I know that Pat's going to be reelected," Deukmejian  told a cheering crowd at the Doubletree Hotel.  </P> <P> The staunchly conservative Nolan, 39, has easily carried the heavily Republican  41st Assembly District, which includes Glendale, Eagle Rock, a large part of  Pasadena and Altadena since winning it in 1978.  </P> <P> However, he now faces uncertainty as a result of being named in an FBI  investigation into corruption in the Legislature. Though Nolan has neither been  charged nor indicted, he remains a target for prosecution, according to sources  close to the investigation.  </P> <P> Nolan has no Republican challenger in the June 5 primary election, but could  face harsh attack from a seasoned Democrat in the November final.  </P> <P> Vying for the Democratic nomination in June are Jeanette Mann, a trustee for  the Pasadena Community College District, and Rod McKenzie, professor of  Geography at USC. Peace and Freedom candidate David Velasquez is not opposed.  </P> <P> Mann, 53, said she plans to hit Nolan hard on ethics.  </P> <P> "I believe that Mr. Nolan will be indicted," she said.  </P> <P> So far, Mann appears to have the jump on McKenzie, 52, who characterizes  himself as "just a classic academician."  </P> <P> But McKenzie said he hoped to appeal more widely to voters than Mann, because  of her liberal posture. He said he will refrain from talking about possible  prosecution of Nolan.  </P> <P> "My presumption is that until he has been proven guilty, the man is innocent,"  McKenzie said.  </P> <P> It is possible that Nolan's status in the investigation will not be resolved  until after the November election, rendering it an inevitable question during  the campaign.  </P> <P> Nolan remains a target of the federal political corruption investigation that  surfaced in August, 1988, when his Capitol office was raided by FBI agents. The  investigation, which included an elaborate sting operation, led to the  indictment of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who was convicted in  February of seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money laundering.  </P> <P> Among the key pieces of evidence that emerged during Montoya's trial was that  Nolan, then the Assembly Republican Leader, was arranging with Senate staffer  John Shahabian, a government informant, to receive campaign contributions from  a dummy shrimp company set up by the FBI.  </P> <P> Also, last November a former top Nolan aide, Karin Watson, pleaded guilty in  U.S. District Court to extorting $12,500 for Republican lawmakers in exchange  for help in passing a bill to benefit the bogus shrimp company.  </P> <P> Besides Nolan, four other elected officials were targeted in the same  undercover sting operation that led to Montoya's indictment.  </P> <P> Nolan has said he did nothing wrong.  </P> <P> "No one has accused me of doing anything," Nolan said in an interview this  week. "I say when the investigation is concluded, I think I'll be completely  exonerated."  </P> <P> But the probe, coupled with Republican setbacks in the 1988 elections, led to  Nolan losing his position of GOP Assembly leader. That position gave Nolan a  statewide profile and took him all around California as a spokesman for his  party. "I had to be from one end of the state to another," Nolan acknowledged.  </P> <P> Though winning his own district again easily in 1988, Nolan suffered a  discernible erosion of his margin of victory two years earlier. In his second  run at Nolan, Democrat John Vollbrecht increased his vote tally more than 50%  from just under 30,000 to more than 45,000, while Nolan added only about 3,000  votes to 69,508 in a presidential election year when more voters traditionally  go to the polls.  </P> <P> One source close to Nolan, who asked not to be identified, said that the  assemblyman was buoyed by the outcome of a recent special Senate election in  which Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), also a target of the FBI  investigation, won the GOP nomination. The success of Hill, the source said,  "confirmed Pat's belief that things aren't that bad."  </P> <P> Some of his colleagues say that veteran lawmaker Nolan, faced with the federal  probe, is acting more like a freshman lawmaker popping up at a variety of  events in his district, sometimes several in a day. Now, relieved of his  statewide duties, which included fund raising for other candidates, Nolan said  he "can spend that time in the district."  </P> <P> Indeed, since he lost his leadership post, Nolan has been involved in more  issues that are popular with leaders in his district -- pushing for legislation  to block parole offices near homes, toughen the penalties for auto theft and  equalize state funding for school districts.  </P> <P> Nolan acknowledged that his district is becoming more ethnically diverse with  an influx of Latinos, Armenians and Koreans, diluting his primary power base of  conservative, middle-income whites. And he noted that Democrat Michael Dukakis  carried Pasadena in the last presidential election.  </P> <P> But Nolan said that his constituents continue to like his brand of conservative  politics. "I feel that people feel that I've been a good solid representative,"  Nolan said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian played on that sentiment in his endorsement last week, praising  Nolan's contributions to the Republican agenda of the '80s: holding down the  budget, building the economy and getting tough on crime.  </P> <P> "Pat has had a very vital role in ensuring that we have been able to have a  balanced budgets each year," Deukmejian said.  </P> <P> "What I like about Pat . . . is that he states his beliefs, he has strong  conviction, he's not wishy-washy, he pursues those goals. He sticks to his  principals. He's committed. And, he is very persuasive and effective. . . . He  articulates his common sense philosophy and that's been instrumental in  engineering in California a transformation that we have seen."  </P> <P> Among Democratic party operatives, there is disagreement over whether Nolan has  become vulnerable.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson), who explored the possibility of recalling  Nolan about two years ago, asserted that Nolan's conservative record is not in  tune with the state's voters. Floyd remains angry about Nolan's alleged  involvement in the preparation of phony presidential endorsement letters mailed  on behalf of Floyd's GOP opponent in 1986.  </P> <P> But other Democrats acknowledge that would be difficult to unseat Nolan, unless  he is indicted in connection with the federal investigation before the November  general election.  </P> <P> With the investigation "over his head," Nolan must go out and talk to voters,  said Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who also represents Pasadena.  But, he said, "it's a tough district for Democrats to win because of the  registration" edge. According to the Jan. 2 report of the Registrar of Voters,  Republicans outnumber Democrats 78,805 to 64,745.  </P> <P> A Democratic strategist who asked not to be identified said it appears unlikely  that Democrats will pump large sums of money into a race against Nolan because  even if they were successful, it "will be difficult to retain" such a  Republican district in the 1992 election because of the registration  differences.  </P> <P> Both Democrats seeking the nomination said they are counting on isolating Nolan  on the far right, especially on the question of abortion and family planning,  which they believe will attract Republican voters  </P> <P> "I'm sure there are a lot of Republican women, particularly professional  Republican women, who support choice," Mann said. She said she believes they  would consider crossing over on the issue now that the U.S. Supreme Court has  allowed state legislatures to adopt laws restricting abortion.  </P> <P> Democrat McKenzie, who coincidentally taught Nolan in his geography class at  USC in the 1970s, said his strategy is to develop grass-roots support based on  his central position  </P> <P> "I hope the voters will see that I stand where they do, in the center," he  said, "a little right on foreign, a little left on domestic."  </P> <P> McKenzie said he thinks the abortion and family planning issue will be the most  significant of the campaign, even though Nolan recently supported a measure to  restore cuts to family planning agencies. "I think Pat's position against  pro-choice is fairly clear. I don't think one fairly recent vote makes a  convert out of him."  </P> <P> Neither Nolan or a spokesman could not be reached for comment on his position  on the abortion issue.  </P> <P> Nolan said he has joked with his former professor about the possibility of  their being opponents. Nolan predicted it would "be a lively dialogue" should  McKenzie win the Democratic primary.  </P> <P> "Pat will characterize me as a liberal," McKenzie said. He said he thinks it  would "come down to which candidate comes closer to the center position."  </P> <P> McKenzie, however, has conceded that his Democratic rival enjoys a considerable  advantage through her past political experience.  </P> <P> "I'm running in a weakened posture because Jeanette is an old pro," he said of  Mann.  </P> <P> Mann, director of affirmative action at Cal State Northridge, got her first  taste of politics as a "precinct man" in the Illinois system of Chicago's first  Mayor Richard J. Daley.  </P> <P> In her first crack at elected office, Mann in 1983 unseated a former mayor of  Sierra Madre, Gary Adams, from the Pasadena City College District. She was  reelected in 1987.  </P> <P> Mann has recently completed two years as co-chairman of ACT, a Pasadena  political action group that has been successful in 26 out of 30 of its  municipal endorsements since 1980.  </P> <P> Mann set a goal of raising $100,000 to $150,000 locally to show Democratic  Party leaders that she can beat Nolan. Then, with an infusion of party money,  she plans to strike on ethics and abortion.  </P> <P> "I believe that the people in the 41st District need to be represented by  someone who shares their ethical and moral values and I do," she said.  </P> <P> Doug Smith reported from Pasadena and Mark Gladstone from Sacramento.  </P></p>

But the poll found also that more than half of the Hong Kong  public believe that China will overturn the whole three-tier  political structure in 1997 and that there will be no "through  train" arrangement for those selected next year to sit beyond  the changeover.    The survey, conducted by Asian Commercial Research Limited,  found that up to 30 percent of respondents would vote for  candidates of the United Democrats if an election were held  tomorrow.    In all, United Democrats and the other candidates considered  to be liberals would command 56 percent of the votes, compared  with 21 percent for the Liberal Party and pro-China forces.    However, up to 23 percent of 604 people interviewed by  telephone this month said they had no opinion on who they would  vote for.    The strong support for the United Democrats is despite  China's labelling as subversive its chairman, Martin Lee  Chu-ming, and veteran member Szeto Wah. Both have been warned  repeatedly that they will not be allowed to sit on the  legislature of the Special Administrative Region.    There are 13 United Democrats in the 60-member Legislative  Council. The party swept the 1991 elections by winning 12 of  the 18 directly elected seats contested then.    Support for the Liberal Party is running at only 12.6  percent.    The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood  managed  to be the third most popular party 9.2 percent of the poll's  respondents said they would vote for association candidates.    It was followed by the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong, with a score of 5.4 percent, and  another liberal party, Meeting Point, which scored 4.3 percent.    Up to 12.6 percent of respondents said they would vote for a  pro- Hong Kong independent candidate in an election, compared  with 2.6 percent who said they would support a pro-China  independent.    A third of respondents maintained that the Legislative  Council should delay voting on the remaining parts of Governor  Chris Patten's electoral package, despite chances for the  resumption of talks seeming unlikely. A total of 12 percent  said the electoral package should be amended to make it  acceptable to China.    However, another 28 percent of respondents said the package  should be passed, compared with the nine percent who said the  whole package should be voted down.    The same poll also showed that 42 percent of the respondents  believed the Governor's political reform proposals would have a  negative effect on Hong Kong's political situation after 1997,  compared with the 31 percent who say they would make Hong Kong  better.    Only two percent said they would have no effect.    The remaining 25 percent said they held no opinion on the  question.</p>

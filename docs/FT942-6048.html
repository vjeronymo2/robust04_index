			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper miners need to raise Dollars 10bn by 2000 International copper miners require more than USDollars 10bn by the year 2000 for projects which have been announced but for which funding has not yet been secured, according to an analysis by the MetalsFinance newsletter. It suggests that the scale of demand for capital means not all mines will obtain immediate financing. 'Developments are likely to be tiered according to their level of project, political and economic risk, among other factors. It is unlikely that projects in southern Africa will be developed ahead of mines in Latin America, while deposits in the Commonwealth of Independent States also face near-term uncertainty,' it adds. According to the newsletter, Latin American projects are seeking a total of Dollars 6.555bn, Africa requires 'a conservative' Dollars 2.5bn, while smaller amounts will go to Australia and North America.</p>

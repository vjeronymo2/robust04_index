			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is type certificated for operation in the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kept the FAA informed of the situation described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and after reviewing all available information including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that received from Transport Canada, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that AD action should be taken to eventually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by AD 83&hyph;18&hyph;03, and to prevent tailplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure caused by cracks in either the outboard hinge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arm or the hinge plate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes of the same type design, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD would supersede AD 83&hyph;18&hyph;03 with a new AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would (1) initially retain the requirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitively inspecting the tailplane outboard hinge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly for cracks, and replacing any cracked part;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) eventually require modifying the tailplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outboard hinge arm and tailplane hinge plate with parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of improved design (Modification No. 1799) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating action for the currently required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished in accordance with de Havilland SB No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6/421, Revision B, dated November 11, 1983.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would take approximately 35 workhours per airplane to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the proposed action, and that the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $4,400 per airplane. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. operators is estimated to be $916,500. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figure is based on the assumption that no affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes that are in commercial service without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely impacting private operators. Of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 141 airplanes in the U.S. registry that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that approximately 40 percent are operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in scheduled passenger service. A significant number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the remaining 60 percent are operated in other forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed AD allows 2,400 hours time-in-service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TIS) before mandatory accomplishment of the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification. The average utilization of the fleet for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those airplanes in commercial commuter service is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 25 to 50 hours TIS per week. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, operators of commuter-class airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in commercial operation would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the proposed modification within 12 to 24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar months after the proposed AD would become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective. For private owners, who typically operate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 100 to 200 hours TIS per year, this would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 to 24 years before the proposed modification would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following paragraphs present cost scenarios  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for airplanes where no cracks are found and where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracks are found, utilizing an average remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane life of 15 years and an average annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. A copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full Cost Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determination for the proposed action may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 91&hyph;CE&hyph;46&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> City, Missouri.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No Cracks Scenario: Under the provisions of AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 83&hyph;18&hyph;03, an owner/operator of a de Havilland DHC&hyph;6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series airplane in scheduled service who operates an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average of 1,600 hours TIS annually would inspect every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,200 hours TIS. This would amount to a remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane life (estimated 15 years) amount of $4,769;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this figure is based on the assumption that no cracks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are found during the inspections. The proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would incur the same 1,200-hour TIS inspection until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2,400 hours TIS where the operator would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace the tailplane outboard hinge arm assembly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (eliminating the need for further repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections), which would result in a present value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of $6,574. The incremental cost of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD for such an airplane would be $1,805 ($6,574^$4,769) or $1,309 annualized over the 1.5 years it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS. An owner of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a general aviation airplane who operates 800 hours TIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually without finding any cracks during the 1,200-hour TIS inspections would incur a present value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incremental cost of $3,843 ($5,990^$2,507). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would amount to a per year amount of $1,327 over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cracks Found Scenario: Under the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD 83&hyph;18&hyph;03, an owner/operator of a de Havilland DHC&hyph;6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series airplane who found cracks during an inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to repair the crack prior to further flight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and resume inspections every 1,200 hours TIS. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD would require immediate replacement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arm assembly if cracks were found as terminating action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the repetitive inspection requirement. The repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost is the same as the replacement except that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair does not terminate the inspection requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, the proposed AD would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present-day cost savings, which would continue to grow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the remaining life of the airplane since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive inspections would not be required. Using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assumed 15-year remaining life, the cost savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be $4,409 for scheduled service airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners/operators and $2,149 for general aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane owners/operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

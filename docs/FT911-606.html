			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / BP earnings rise 44% in quarter BRITISH Petroleum first-quarter profits rose 44 per cent on the back of improved performance by its refining operations. However, Mr David Simon, chief operating officer and deputy chairman, warned that the uncertain outlook for oil prices could undermine performance later this year. BP's pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 521m on a replacement-cost basis which strips out gains and losses made on oil stocks. This increased from Pounds 361m in the same quarter last year. The sharp fall in the oil price in January caused BP to make a Pounds 511m stock loss, reversing gains of Pounds 472m in the whole of last year. This left the company's profit at just Pounds 10m on an historical cost basis, narrowly missing its first ever quarterly loss. Mr Simon said oil prices had moved from an average of Dollars 32 a barrel in the final quarter of last year to Dollars 20 a barrel in the first quarter. He said oil prices now seemed to have settled at the Dollars 20-a-barrel level. High refining margins in the first quarter boosted the company's results. Pre-tax profit for refining and marketing more than doubled to Pounds 385m in the first quarter from Pounds 115m last year. This followed an increase in average refining margins in Europe to Dollars 7 a barrel and Dollars 11 a barrel in the Far East after a surge in demand for jet fuel from troops fighting in the Gulf. These margins have now dropped back to Dollars 4 a barrel. The company's exploration and production arm also reported a strong pre-tax result of Pounds 483m on a replacement-cost basis compared with Pounds 454m in the same 1990 period. Production rose to 1.42bn barrels a day (b/d) from 1.39bn b/d in the final quarter of 1990 as Alaskan output increased to its highest level for two years. Chemicals showed some improvement from the disappointing performance in the last quarter of 1990 to Pounds 54m, but this was still below the Pounds 63m made in the first quarter of last year. The results proved higher than many City forecasts, prompting some analysts to raise their expectations of the group's performance for the full year to around Pounds 1.35bn - an increase from last year's Pounds 1.2bn. The company said it would pay a dividend of 4.2p compared with 3.95p. Lex, Page 16</p>

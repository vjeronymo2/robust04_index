			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Larisa Beloivan and Leonid </F> Vinogradov]    [Text] Vladivostok, 23 Apr -- Russia does not yet have the  resources to build purification installations, but the problem  of utilizing waste from nuclear submarines must be tackled  immediately, said Yuriy Maslakov, the director of the Zvezda  nuclear submarine repair yard, at a briefing devoted to the  completion of Russo- Japanese consultations on utilizing nuclear  waste.    Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy,  who attended the consultations, told journalists that there were  three possible solutions to the problem: Build a purification  complex on the territory of the yard itself; set up the same  system in an isolated area of the Maritime Kray; or introduce  advanced purification plants. As has already been reported,  Russia and Japan have signed an agreement on an allocation by  the Japanese side of $70 million toward converting Russia's arms  enterprises. There are plans to use part of this money at the  Zvezda yard.</p>

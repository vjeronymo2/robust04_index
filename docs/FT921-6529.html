			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Higher prices are being paid for wool in all markets, and auction clearances are practically full. There is more active trading in semi-manufactures as a result of the rising price trend, and retailers are said to be showing more interest in planning ahead. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached 643 cents on February 26, 12 per cent higher than at the opening sales in January. Prices being paid for some widely-used wools are now higher than the old floor price levels which were abandoned with the scheme a year ago. The overall AWC indicator level was 700 cents at the time.</p>

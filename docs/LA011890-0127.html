			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORRIED U.S. SENDS AIDE TO COUNSEL WITH AQUINO  </P> <P> The Bush Administration dispatched Deputy National Security Adviser Robert M.  Gates to Manila on Wednesday after U.S. officials privately concluded that  President Corazon Aquino's position is so fragile that she may not be able to  survive in office through this year.  </P> <P> Officially, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters at a  White House briefing that Gates' mission is "to convey to President Aquino  President Bush's continuing strong commitment to democracy in the Philippines."  </P> <P> However, there were indications that Gates also has been given the job of  warning Aquino of the need to make dramatic changes quickly. The sudden trip is  reminiscent of those made in 1984 and 1985 by senior officials of the Reagan  Administration, and by then-Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), in an effort to convey  to President Ferdinand E. Marcos the high-level U.S. concern about events in  the Philippines.  </P> <P> In addition, a pessimistic U.S. evaluation of Aquino's prospects -- carried out  in the wake of the nearly successful December coup attempt against her -- says  that the young military officers who spearheaded the last two coup attempts in  the Philippines still pose a major threat and could topple Aquino before the  end of 1990. The group is known informally as the "Academy of '71," because  many of the officers graduated from military academy that year.  </P> <P> The U.S. analysis predicted that democratic government in the Philippines could  give way to some form of authoritarian regime, along the lines of the one  headed by Marcos. Salvador H. Laurel, Aquino's estranged vice president, could  help provide the basis for such a regime, U.S. officials concluded.  </P> <P> One U.S. source familiar with the evaluation was critical of Aquino's  leadership style. "Her tendency is not to engage either in confrontation or,  unfortunately, in decisions," this official said. "She procrastinates on key  issues." The source noted that there has been a narrowing of the group of  advisers surrounding Aquino.  </P> <P> U.S. officials also are concerned that the New People's Army, the Philippine  insurgent movement, seems to be taking advantage of divisions between Aquino  and the Philippine armed forces. The NPA is said to be targeting more Americans  and other high-profile personnel for assassinations because a terror campaign  would dramatize Aquino's vulnerability.  </P> <P> Last month, during the early hours of the attempted coup against Aquino,  President Bush authorized American F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers from Clark Air  Base to pin rebel planes on the ground. Aquino had requested the help, and she  also sought unsuccessfully to have U.S. planes bomb and strafe military targets  in and around Manila.  </P> <P> The attempted coup came just as the United States and the Philippines were  scheduled to begin negotiations on the future of Clark Air Base and the Subic  Bay Naval Base, two of the largest and most important American military  facilities outside the United States. The talks were quickly postponed and are  now scheduled to open in March or April.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, the Philippine ambassador to the  United States, Emmanuel Pelaez, said: "That there is a possibility of another  attempted coup cannot be denied. But I don't think it can succeed. The  circumstances of the last coup are no longer there."  </P> <P> Pelaez said the December coup was fueled by the death of Marcos last September,  the sudden return to the Philippines of Marcos' wealthy friend, Eduardo  Cojuangco and joint exercises between American and Philippine marines, which  gave some Philippine marines special access to new weapons.  </P> <P> At the White House, Fitzwater said that the future of the U.S. military bases  in the Philippines is not on the agenda for Gates' trip.  </P> <P> "This is on more general areas -- her programs for rebuilding the economy and  restructuring the government," he said, adding that the mission had been "in  the planning for some time." Asked whether Gates would offer a "strong  commitment" to the Aquino government, Fitzwater responded: "Absolutely,  absolutely."  </P> <P> Regarding the stability of the Aquino regime, Fitzwater said: "Well, we, of  course, very strongly support the Aquino regime. At the time of the coup  attempt, you'll recall our efforts on behalf of her government. This trip is to  make sure there is no question about that. There, of course, are continuing  reports of problems in terms of security forces, and so forth. She is taking  measures to deal with those, to prevent future coups, and we simply want to  consult with her on those efforts."  </P> <P> Fitzwater made it clear that Aquino could expect continued U.S. military  support in the event of another coup attempt. Responding to a question about  whether Gates would pledge greater U.S. support in such a case, he said he  could not speculate on specific actions, "but he certainly will be pledging our  support and our continued policy support, and you know how we have responded in  the past."  </P> <P> Gates is scheduled to meet with Aquino today and leave Manila on Friday,  Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush initiated the trip and that Aquino had not requested the  visit.  </P> <P> Gates led the committee of senior national security deputies in Washington  during the coup attempt in December, when Bush flew to Malta to meet with  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this report.  </P></p>

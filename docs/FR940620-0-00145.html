			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.2&blank;Protruding Objects [14.2.4 in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These provisions parallel those of ADAAG 4.4 (Protruding Objects) and are applied to public sidewalks and the areas adjacent to them. An appendix note clarifies the application of these provisions to the full public sidewalk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM sought comment on the effectiveness of the 27 inch maximum height limitation for protruding objects on public sidewalks and about the discernibility of wall-mounted and post-mounted objects. Most comments on these provisions came from persons with vision impairments, organizations representing persons who are blind or have vision impairments, and from mobility instructors responsible for training persons in wayfinding techniques. A majority felt that current ADAAG requirements for buildings and facilities were not adequate for public sidewalk environments, where pedestrians may be forced to adopt a restricted cane sweep technique in congested areas. Several commenters added that the speed with which people walk outdoors may cause them to encounter protruding objects before the cane sweep can detect them. Although there was considerable support for lowering the maximum height of 27 inches, there was no clear consensus. Many commenters urged further study of this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A majority of commenters were opposed to the provision permitting post-mounted objects to overhang their supports by up to 12 inches. These commenters noted the common practice of installing telephones, signs, and similar objects on poles, rather than projecting them from building faces, where the four inch limitation on wall-mounted elements would apply. Most felt that the determination of what was a protruding object should not be affected by mounting conditions. Many commenters recommended additional study of this issue as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, almost a third of commenters who identified themselves as persons who are blind or have vision impairments or who represented local, State, and national organizations for persons with vision impairments opposed any change in the requirements. They noted that there is no compelling evidence of a need to change current ADAAG provisions nor any data on which to base a change for conditions along a public pedestrian right-of-way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters addressing the headroom provision recommended that landscaping elements be included in coverage. Several noted that overhanging tree branches are a major hazard along public sidewalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters from State and local government jurisdictions were largely concerned with policing and enforcement issues and requested clarification of who would be responsible to ensure that clear headroom was provided along a public sidewalk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision permitting a 12 inch overhang for post-mounted objects is well-established in accessibility regulations and has always been applied to frontal approaches only, as shown in Figure 8(d), and not to parallel or side approaches. Although ADAAG provisions for protruding objects may not adequately serve all segments of the pedestrian population, no data were provided on which to base a change to the provision. The provision remains substantially unchanged, with only editorial modifications. The appendix note has been expanded to reference the provision regarding the maintenance of accessible features in the Department of Justice regulation implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.133). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.3&blank;Fixed Street Furnishings [14.2.3, 14.3 and 14.2.1(5) in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains scoping and technical provisions for items installed on or adjacent to a public sidewalk. It covers drinking fountains, telephones, toilet facilities, fixed seating, tables, and benches, bus shelters and stops, pedestrian signage, and similar items, where provided as a public improvement or private franchise, and requires a connection to the continuous passage. Such items may not reduce headroom or the width of the continuous passage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.3(1)&blank;Drinking Fountains <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14.2.3(2)&blank;Public Telephones <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (1) requires that drinking fountains at a single location provide accessibility both to persons who use wheelchairs and to persons who have difficulty stooping or bending. Paragraph (2) requires that all public pay telephones newly installed on or along public sidewalks be hearing aid compatible and have volume controls. Where a single unit is installed at a location, it must be accessible to a person using a wheelchair. Where a bank of telephones is provided, one unit per bank must be accessible to persons using wheelchairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM proposed that 50 percent of drinking fountains and public telephones provided in a public improvement project be accessible. This would have required that half of all such items installed in a project be accessible and be dispersed throughout a project area. As noted above, the term ``public improvement project'' has been deleted. When drinking fountains, public telephones, and similar items are installed along a public sidewalk, they are typically dispersed rather than clustered and are considered public and common use elements. Therefore, the scoping provision has been changed to require accessibility at each location where a drinking fountain or public telephone is provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One municipality indicated that its outdoor drinking fountains were largely provided in parks and playgrounds and sought guidance on whether ADAAG 14 applied to such installations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Drinking fountains in parks and playgrounds are located on public sites and are therefore covered by the scoping provisions in ADAAG 4.1.3 (Accessible Buildings and Facilities: New Construction) and 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings and Facilities: Alterations) and not by this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed that 75 percent of public telephones have volume controls. One municipality and several organizations representing persons with hearing impairments recommended that all public telephones installed along public sidewalks have volume controls because of the high incidence of hearing loss in an aging population. Other commenters noted that the cost of such an adaptation is low. Providing public telephones with volume controls is becoming common practice in noisy environments such as public rights-of-way. Several other comments from organizations representing persons who are deaf recommended that public telephone scoping be expanded to require exterior TTYs. A manufacturer of such units submitted technical data and encouraged the Board to require TTYs on public sidewalks, noting that interior installations in buildings and facilities are not generally available after business hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

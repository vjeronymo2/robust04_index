			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Thousands flee India's killer plague About 200,000 people have fled from the western Indian city of Surat, where plague has killed at least 44 people and left scores more sick in hospitals. The government put health authorities in Delhi and Bombay and other cities in northern and western India on alert amid mounting fears that the exodus from plague-infested Surat might spread the deadly disease. Mr Madhusudan Dayal, the health secretary, said the government was 'seriously concerned' about the threat. Mr Dayal, who put the death toll at 44, said the situation was under control and there was no cause for alarm. However, reports from Surat, a city of 2m people about 160 miles north of Bombay, put the number of dead at over 100, with hundreds more desperately ill. Buses and trains were crammed with people fleeing their homes, ignoring instructions from the authorities not to leave the city. Police were trying to seal off the slums worst hit by the plague, where the first deaths were reported on Tuesday. Many residents stayed indoors, while people in the streets moved about with cloths covered in white DDT powder wrapped around their faces and municipal workers sprayed roads with chemicals. Doctors in Surat said that at least 24 people had died of pneumonic plague - a particularly dangerous variant of bubonic plague, the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Unlike bubonic plague, which is spread by the bite of an infected rat or of a flea which has previously been infected by a rat, pneumonic plague is air-borne and highly infectious. The Health Ministry in Delhi is trying to determine the exact nature of the disease and had called upon technical help from the US and Russia. The authorities in Surat are distributing tetracycline, an antibiotic which acts as a prophylactic against plague and is also used in treating the disease. Supplies are also being made at available at railway stations in Bombay and other cities to which Surat residents are fleeing. The government has rushed 10m capsules of tetracycline to the region. The outbreak in Surat follows another last month in central Maharashtra, where 81 people have contracted bubonic plague in villages hit by an earthquake last year. Officials have as yet not established any link between the two outbreaks, the first in India in about 30 years. Surat, a wealthy centre for diamond polishing and textiles, attracts many migrant workers. During the monsoon this summer, the city suffered floods which may have helped the disease spread.</p>

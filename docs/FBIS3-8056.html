			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Foreign Minister Jozef </F> Moravcik by SMENA correspondent (bg) in Bratislava on 25  February: "It Is a Long Way to the President"]    [Text] Jozef Moravcik, who submitted his resignation to  President Michal Kovac on Wednesday [23 February], gave a  briefing at the Foreign Ministry yesterday for "select" members  of the media. He discussed many domestic and foreign policy  issues. We have selected the most important questions and  answers. J. Moravcik said the following in connection with our  image abroad:    "Foreign countries are monitoring our situation very  carefully, and one thing is becoming clear to them from our  domestic political situation--a trend toward the introduction of  certain elements of an authoritarian regime. This is one  negative factor. If this were confirmed--and I have the  impression that current political developments are confirming  these forecasts--we would thus create for ourselves an  unfavorable position for our integration into Europe. Another  factor is the quite frequent ambiguity of the statements made by  certain politicians, first and foremost of whom is the prime  minister. This all creates a less than perfect image for the  "legibility" of our domestic policy. This, of course, in turn  also influences the conclusions that foreign countries come to  as far as their relations with our country are concerned."    [Question] Mr. Minister, you have said that you do not want  to cause any problems for the president by your  resignation--that is, problems with regard to relations between  the government and the Castle. Could you expand on this?    [Moravcik] I was mainly emphasizing that it is necessary to  deal speedily with the issue of appointing a new minister. This  is in the interest of the Slovak Republic, which I consider to  be the most important thing. It is not expedient, within the  framework of Slovakia's foreign policy interests, to prolong  such a state of uncertainty. So, this was my main reason for  submitting my resignation.    [Question] It seems to me that the Slovak foreign minister  is viewed as follows: Either he is good but not loyal, or he is  loyal but not good. Do you think Slovakia needs a good foreign  minister or a loyal one?    [Moravcik] I think Slovakia needs a minister who is, despite  everything, capable of asserting the Republic's foreign policy  interests, interests that are specified objectively and  geopolitically. There is sufficient support for this in  parliament; our foreign policy line was formulated with the  participation of all of the political entities. The foreign  minister should respect this and he should assert this line.    [Question] In this case, must he end up like Milan Knazko  and you?    [Moravcik] It is necessary to create the domestic political  conditions so that this does not happen. I feel that we are  going through a period in which the domestic political situation  is preventing us, to a broad extent, from implementing our  foreign policy interests.    [Question] Could you explain why the visit to Bratislava by  your Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, has twice been  postponed?    [Moravcik] The two sides agreed that they would portray the  postponement of this visit as a mutual decision.    [Question] Will you be able to give us more details when you  are no longer in office?    [Moravcik] I must respect Slovakia's interests abroad, even  when I am no longer foreign minister.    [SMENA correspondent] In reply to a question on the future  orientation of Slovak foreign policy, Minister Moravcik said the  following:    "The orientation of our foreign policy evolved on the basis  of a general consensus; it has support in parliament. If  someone were to want to alter it, he would obviously meet with  resistance in parliament. For this reason, I think that the  fundamental line of our foreign policy should and will be  maintained."    [Question] Andreas Kohl, general secretary of the European  Democratic Union, has said that holding a referendum on the  withdrawal of mandates from deputies in parliament is at  variance with all norms and democratic criteria and incompatible  with Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe. In your  opinion, what could the real repercussions of this situation be?    [Moravcik] I agree with this assessment; this would really  be a considerable step backward. The principle proposed in the  referendum is incompatible with the political thinking in  democratic Europe and is incompatible with the  parliamentarianism that has evolved in Europe over several  centuries. This is a well tried system, and such an element, if  we were to introduce it, would mean its destruction.    [Question] So you think it is possible that Slovakia could  be expelled from the Council of Europe?    [Moravcik] I think it is likely that this would be  discussed.    [Question] Mr. Minister, in your opinion, is the  nonappointment of ambassadors in key Slovak embassies the fault  of the Foreign Ministry or were the "brakes applied," in this  context, outside the ministry?    [Moravcik] This is a very complicated situation. If the  ministry itself had decided on the appointment of ambassadors,  all of the posts would have been filled long ago. However, a  consensus among three entities--the Foreign Ministry, the  government, and the president--is necessary for this.    [Question] Where did it get "tied up" most?    [Moravcik] It is a very long way from the ministry to the  president.    [Question] Mr. Minister, you are obviously thinking about  establishing a new political entity. In this context, I would  like to ask you whether an alliance with--I will say this very  pejoratively--the so-called turncoats from the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party is possible.    [Moravcik] We will try to consolidate all of the forces  oriented toward the center of the political spectrum, including  Cernak's National Democratic Party and the Alliance of Slovak  Democrats, and, as the case may be, we will also seek other  entities. We are thinking about a possible coalition, not a  merger, with the social democrats, under the condition that they  progress more to the center of the political spectrum. That is  the basis. In addition, we will also look for other ways of  involving, if possible, some important personalities in  political life, people who have such an inclination. I think  that a strong center bloc could provide the basis for domestic  political stability in Slovakia.    [Question] You say "we." Can you tell us who this is?    [Moravcik] Those of us who came up with the Alternative for  Political Realism initiative are keeping in touch.    [Question] Would you like to go into the elections as a bloc  with these entities?    [Moravcik] It would be ideal if a common entity were to come  into being and if a merger were to take place. If this does not  happen, we would consider it effective and expedient, at least,  to form such a bloc, which means an electoral coalition.    [Question] Classified material was discussed at a government  session a few weeks ago. It was submitted by Deputy Prime  Minister Sergej Kozlik, and, according to some reports from the  lobbies, it dealt with Slovakia's geopolitical position. Could  you be more specific about this material?    [Moravcik] It is classified material, which means I cannot  make public its contents; however, I can venture to express an  opinion on it. It is so naive and imperfect that it cannot be  utilized. It is muddled, and, in my opinion, there is no point  in discussing it.</p>

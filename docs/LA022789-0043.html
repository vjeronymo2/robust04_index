			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : LAIBACH BREAKS REGIMENTAL RANKS  </P> <P> So much of Laibach's advance publicity has painted the Yugoslavian rockers as  grim, regimented neo-Nazis that it wasn't surprising to find a few misguided  fans throwing out stiff-armed "Seig Heil" salutes as the band took the stage  Saturday night at the Scream Club. How stupid. Because for all their theorizing  and their use of allegedly fascist imagery, Laibach is no more Nazi than, say,  Queen -- whose anthemic "We Will Rock You" brand of stadium-rock was employed  by Laibach in its reductionist interpretations of songs from the Beatles' "Let  It Be" album.  </P> <P> Milan Fras' stiff, commanding stance and Roto-Rooter growl fit the group's  authoritarian image as he threateningly intoned the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy  for the Devil" against what sounded like an industrial-rock version of the  "Anvil Chorus." But one of the two bare-chested snare drummers flanking Fras  broke regimental ranks, pouring water on himself, swigging beers and acting  like a clown -- actually having fun. Which might have diminished the sinister  effect of the loud, pummeling, multimedia presentation but proved that even  totalitarian visionaries can be as sloppy as decadent capitalists.

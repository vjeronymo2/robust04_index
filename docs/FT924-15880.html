			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Italy seeks EC loan to boost lira: Rome begins talks with partners on L10,000bn stand-by loan THE Italian government yesterday said it had begun discussions with its EC partners on a special stand-by loan to boost the lira and sustain confidence in plans for an early return to the European Monetary System. According to unofficial estimates last night, the loan could be the equivalent of L10,000bn (Pounds 4.5bn). The surprise move was announced along with Italy's 1993 budget which was approved yeterday by the cabinet and promises to reform the country's deteriorating public finances. Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, said the aim of the loan was partly political. At one level, he said Italy wished to demonstrate its continued commitment to the EMS, but at the same time the loan appears designed to provide a rigid external framework for Italy's economic performance. It would make it more difficult for parliament to water down the budget. Officials declined to reveal the amount of the loan but said it was different from the UK's move earlier this month to go to the markets for an Ecu loan to help protect sterling. It is expected to take up to four or five weeks to negotiate and would not be drawn down until after the 1993 budget was approved. There was speculation yesterday that the stand-by facility might not be fully used if granted, providing the currency markets stabilised and interest rates began to fall. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said the facility would be a 'super-certification' by Italy's EC partners of the country's credibility. The lira was still under pressure yesterday, hovering around L880 to the D-Mark. Officials in Brussels predicted a sympathetic response to the Italian loan request. Mr Amato is viewed as the best hope for tackling the country's budgetary crisis and restoring international confidence in the economy, but he needs outside help, an EC official said. An EC loan would support his efforts to win parliamentary approval for his economic package, rather than a potentially contentious loan from the International Monetary Fund. 'We would be keeping the problem within the family,' the official said. Brussels expects Mr Amato to seek financial aid under Rule 1969 adopted in June 1988 allowing the EC to help countries which experience balance of payments problems or adverse capital movements. Some Ecu16bn (Pounds 12.59bn) has been set aside for support. Greece is the only EC member to have applied, securing a Ecu2.2bn stabilisation loan in February 1991, to prepare the country to join the next phase of monetary union. Under the deal, the Community goes to the capital markets to raise the money on the best possible terms, using its own guarantees. A maximum of Ecu14bn can be raised this way, with Ecu2bn or more coming as medium term credits from member states. Before 1988, Ireland, France and Italy all received European Community funds to help them tackle balance of payments difficulties. Italy's problems come amid the debate within the EC about the pros and cons of a 'two-speed Europe.' In this sense, Brussels' support is viewed as an important sign that all countries can at least aspire to monetary union, if they take the necessary painful austerity measures.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LUKAS HAS IT ALL -- EXCEPT FOR SLEEPING IN  </P> <P> He's already got the jet, the Rolls, the Rolex and the Armani suits. More  trophies, more titles and more money than the Trumps, even reunited. So how  come D. Wayne Lukas still sleeps only five hours a night?  </P> <P> Critics, and there are still plenty, say he needs the rest of the time to keep  the wheels of his juggernaut turning. Lukas says otherwise.  </P> <P> "Because I don't wake up every morning, look around and say, 'What's left?'  Because other people have to find things to replenish themselves," he said. "It  happens to me every day."  </P> <P> Waking and winning or waking and preparing to win; it seems sometimes that he  would have a problem drawing the line between the points on the map or the days  on a calender.  </P> <P> This particular Thursday began with a 4 a.m. arrival at California's Del Mar  race track, where Lukas surveyed his well-manicured grounds and a  better-manicured stable of horses. It will end sometime around 10:30 p.m. in  Oklahoma, where he will look at a host of pricey yearlings with any eye toward  deciding which horse gets plugged into which division of the Team Lukas  operation.  </P> <P> Friday, the road show shifts to Chicago. There, he will personally administer  the finishing touches on Steinlen, the defending champion and current favorite  to win the Arlington Million on Sunday, which, coincidentally, is Lukas' 55th  birthday. The gift, it seems, is already wrapped.  </P> <P> By now, anyone with a passing interest in thoroughbred racing could draw the  broad outlines of Lukas' career, or be asked to draw a flow chart for the sport  and turn back a reasonably accurate one by always pencilling in Lukas' name at  the top.  </P> <P> If he is not the most beloved trainer in the world, he is, without argument,  the winningest by every measure. In fact, it is precisely because of his  success that people who follow the racket know what a flow chart is. But when  he arrived on the thoroughbred scene 11 years ago, Lukas inspired little more  than ridicule.  </P> <P> A former basketball coach, he brought organization and an obsessive-compulsive  personality into a world of gypsy crones and world-renowned savants. Lukas  didn't arrive at a track so much as beautify it; he had assistants rake the  gravel and attach planters outside his barn. He favored expensive cowboy boots  and flashed even more-expensive jewelry, whereas the already-monied deans of  the profession still walked around in the zippered models, hands stuck deep in  their pockets so as not to encourage any more thievery than was necessary.  </P> <P> Everyone else was waiting for luck or money or magic to deliver just one good  piece of horseflesh stretched over the right configuration; Lukas was  collecting as much as he could beg, borrow or steal. Everyone else wanted one  horse who could win everywhere; Lukas wanted a hundred, some of whom were bound  to win somewhere.  </P> <P> Everyone else was building a career; D. Wayne Lukas, even then, was building an  empire. What made it so hard to swallow is that he turned out to be so right so  fast.  </P> <P> Lukas won the Preakness after just two years and his first Eclipse Award as the  nation's leading trainer four years after that. And even if the speed with  which he achieved success was just impressive, the size of his successes were  unprecedented.  </P> <P> In 1984, Lukas broke Charlie Whittingham's earnings record, then nearly doubled  it the following year and has bettered his own record every year since. In  1985, he won a record 70 stakes. In 1986, he became the first trainer ever to  collect more in purse earnings than the nation's leading jockey. In 1987, he  saddled a staggering 1,700 horses and won 92 stakes and some of his colleagues  continued to whisper behind his back that he would win twice as many races "if  he were any good."  </P> <P> That determination, Lukas said, depends on your definition.  </P> <P> "Anybody who's still criticizing our program is looking pretty silly by now,"  Lukas said matter-of-factly. "The bottom line is to win, make money and develop  champions. Those are the things that are supposed to be done in this game and  we've accomplished all those.  </P> <P> "What some of the old-timers took 50 or 60 years to accomplish, we've done in  10. And so the criticism," he added, "is less and less. ... You can hammer  somebody only so long."  </P> <P> Indeed. Handicappers likely would bet his name more if they didn't see it so  often, and so often on different horse's lines in the same race. As of two  weeks ago, Lukas had saddled 827 horses this year and won in the neighborhood  of $10 million. His closest pursuers had 578 and $3.6 million, respectively,  and the disparity only promises to grow.  </P> <P> He has been hammering the competition so mercilessly for so long now that most  of the rest of the racing world wishes he would take up golf, take a few days  vacation, stay out late going to a movie, sleep in once in a while, just kind  of ... chill out.  </P> <P> It won't happen anytime soon.  </P> <P> "Every day is a vacation for me. If I lose, it's still a good day, just not as  much fun. ... I like the finer things in life, but I don't need them to keep  score," Lukas concluded, "and I don't feel like I have to apologize for any of  it.  </P> <P> "I don't think God looked down one day and said, 'Give this Wisconsin boy all  the runners in the world.' I earned them."  </P></p>

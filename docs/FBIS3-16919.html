			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Yet another "top Russian  official", who was said to be involved in an alleged coup  planned to oust Boris Yeltsin, denied the accusations calling  them a "clumsy political joke".    "I laughed when I saw my name among the (coup) plotters",  Mikhail Poltoranin, a former aide of the president and currently  the chairman of the State Duma commission on information policy,  told TASS on Tuesday.    The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA said last week Poltorainin and several  other top officials were involved in plotting to oust the  president. The office of the Russian prosecutor general said it  was checking whether the report corresponds to reality and  threatened to bring criminal charges against the newspaper if  the information turned out to be false.    Poltoranin said that the report was "especially silly", all  names listed there were politically incompatible and plans  unrealistic. He said he was confused by the fact that the  Russian press paid so much attention to the report. "Only  limited and incompetent people can get on such a bait", he  stressed.    On Monday another "plotter" denied his involvement in the  "coup". First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets asked the  prosecutor's office to clear up the accusations against him.  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov was also on the list. He was the  first to deny the allegations in a Sunday TV interview.</p>

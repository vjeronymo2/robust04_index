			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Favourable economic statistics and the Bank of Japan's manoeuvres on the money markets have increased expectations of a rise in short-term money market rates. With the new reserve maintenance period starting today bond market investors will this week be focusing on the central bank's operations and the level of the overnight call rates. A rise in the call rate above the 2.25 per cent at which it closed last week, could increase upward pressure on short-term money market rates. Expectations of higher domestic short-term rates have resulted in Japanese banks switching their fundraising from the certificate of deposit market to the Euroyen market. Banks are wary of a further rise in CD rates, to which short-term prime rates (lending rates to first tier clients) are linked when demand for funds remain weak. Meanwhile, institutional investors are reluctant to increase their holdings of long-term government bonds. Life assurers and other large investors are continuing to buy bank debentures because they are unlisted and investors are not required to disclose their positions at the end of the interim term. This has resulted in rates on five-year bank debentures falling below those of government bonds with the same maturity.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: South Korea car challenge in US Kia Motors, the second-placed South Korean carmaker, is to begin selling cars in the US next month in the first step towards building a coast-to-coast US franchise by the end of 1995. South Korean carmakers are rapidly expanding domestic production capacity and developing a growing presence in export markets, particularly in Europe and North America. Kia's production capacity has risen from 60,000 units a year 10 years ago to 650,000. This is due to rise to 1.25m units by 1997, supported by a Dollars 7.75bn (Pounds 5.23bn) investment programme in 1993-1997. The company, in which Ford of the US and Mazda of Japan hold stakes of 10 and 8 per cent respectively, has previously supplied small cars to Ford (formerly the Festiva and now the Aspire) for distribution under the Ford badge in the US. It is now setting out to build its own independent franchise in North America, however, with the launch next month of its Kia Sephia small family car. It plans to add a small four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle, the Kia Sportage, in the autumn. This will be followed by the introduction of an executive saloon range in 1996. Kia will be the second Korean carmaker to establish its own franchise in the US, one of the most competitive car markets in the world. It is following Hyundai, which launched its cars in North America in 1986 and enjoyed wildly fluctuating fortunes, with sales rising to 264,000 units by 1988 but falling to only 109,000 vehicles in the US in each of the last two years. Mr Greg Warner, executive vice-president of Kia Motors America and former chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor America, said that Kia was aiming to carve out a presence in the US by selling on low prices. It was aiming directly at taking market share from the small cars sold by Japanese producers in the US. Japanese carmakers have been forced to raise prices more rapidly than domestic US producers because of the appreciation of the yen.</p>

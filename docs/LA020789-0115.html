			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH S&amp;L BAILOUT PLAN WOULD COST $90 BILLION;  </P> <P> THRIFTS, TAXPAYERS, BANKS TO BEAR BURDEN  </P> <P> President Bush, revealing his $90-billion plan for rescuing depositors at  failed savings and loan associations, proposed Monday that banks and healthy  S&amp;Ls should pay more for federal insurance and that taxpayers should  contribute about $3.5 billion a year.  </P> <P> Bush rejected a direct fee on depositors' checking and savings accounts,  although he conceded that banks and S&amp;Ls might pass on some of their new  costs to their customers.  </P> <P> "We intend to restore our deposit insurance system to complete health," Bush  told a news conference at which he announced a plan to issue $50 billion in new  bonds to shut down crippled S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Future Security Assured  </P> <P> "Your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits before, it  does today, and it will do so at all times in the future," Bush said.  </P> <P> He said that federal regulators immediately will begin seizing all 350  insolvent S&amp;Ls so that their future losses can be held to a minimum. Before  ultimately selling or liquidating them, the federal regulators will manage the  S&amp;Ls with full powers over investments and interest rates.  </P> <P> Both S&amp;L and bank deposits up to $100,000 are guaranteed by federal  insurance. The S&amp;L insurance fund lacks the cash to shut down insolvent  thrift institutions and pay off the depositors, however.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration plan, which requires approval from the  Democratic-controlled Congress, would raise the insurance premiums paid by  financial institutions as part of a complex plan to dispose of the 350  insolvent S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> The taxpayer contribution, estimated at approximately $3.5 billion a year over  the first five years, would be primarily limited to paying part of the interest  on the bonds. The taxpayer contribution over the first 10 years, starting with  1989, would be $40 billion, but that figure could rise if the economy does not  behave as well as the Administration predicts.  </P> <P> S&amp;Ls, which now pay a federal insurance premium of $2.08 for every $1,000  in deposits, would pay $2.30 starting in 1991. The fee would drop to $1.80 per  $1,000 in 1994.  </P> <P> The bank premium, 83 cents per $1,000, would climb to $1.20 in 1990 and $1.50  in 1991 and subsequent years.  </P> <P> "There is no guarantee of passing this on to the consumer, nor is there a  guarantee it won't be passed on," the President said. "Nothing is without pain  when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fears for Small Depositors  </P> <P> However, House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Henry B.  Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said that Congress should protect small depositors from  facing additonal expenses because of the higher premiums. Gonzalez said he  fears that "the little consumer will pay in the form of higher fees on checking  accounts, bigger charges for returned checks, new fees for automatic tellers  and a myriad of other charges."  </P> <P> For the Administration and many members of Congress, higher insurance premiums  on banks and S&amp;Ls are much more politically acceptable than an earlier  proposal under consideration for a direct fee on depositors of 25 or 30 cents a  year for every $100 in deposits.  </P> <P> "I will not support any new fee on depositors," Bush said, effectively killing  an idea first proposed by his own Treasury Department.  </P> <P> The President called also for tough new regulatory and safety standards for the  S&amp;L industry.  </P> <P> "We will see to it that the system is reformed comprehensively so that this  situation is not repeated ever again," Bush declared.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Shift Regulators  </P> <P> Specifically, Bush proposed that regulatory control of S&amp;Ls be shifted from  the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which  already runs the bank insurance system. The Bank Board, which would still  charter savings institutions, would lose its independent status and become a  unit of the Treasury Department.  </P> <P> The FDIC would operate like a family with two checking accounts, one for the  bank insurance fund and one for S&amp;Ls, with no mingling of the money. The  Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. would continue to manage the deposit  insurance funds for S&amp;Ls under the FDIC's direction.  </P> <P> The additional bank premiums would be used only to beef up the banks' deposit  insurance fund, not to shut down any S&amp;Ls. However, the additional  contributions from the banks would count as revenue for federal budget purposes  and thereby would reduce the overall budgetary impact.  </P> <P> Under its new supervisor, S&amp;Ls by 1991 would have to double their capital  -- their net worth -- from the 3% of assets required now to the 6% that will be  required of banks. Many of the weaker S&amp;Ls, unable to raise the cash to  meet the higher standards required by 1991, may be forced to merge or go out of  business.  </P> <P> During a period of budget stringency, members of Congress would prefer to spend  funds on education and social programs rather than on paying to clean up the  S&amp;L debacle.  </P> <P> Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle  Jr. (D-Mich.), although predicting bipartisan cooperation, warned that there  would be pressure to make corresponding cuts from such popular programs as  Medicare and the war on drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Be Unacceptable  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that the taxpayer burden of the  Bush plan might be politically unacceptable, "especially if we're going to be  crowding out some programs like education."  </P> <P> Federal regulators already have committed $40 billion to dispose of more than  200 insolvent thrift institutions. This money will come from insurance fees  paid by S&amp;Ls and from cash gained from the sale of assets in failed  institutions.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration calculates that another $50 billion should take care of  the rest of the problem, although some experts say that the total cost will  prove to be even greater.  </P> <P> The other $50 billion in the Bush plan would come from a new Resolution Funding  Corp., which would issue $50 billion in 30-year bonds. The interest would be  paid by a combination of taxpayer and thrift industry contributions, and the  principal would be repaid entirely with industry funds.  </P> <P> The $50 billion would go to a new Resolution Trust Corp., which would handle  the liquidation or sale of insolvent S&amp;Ls during the next five years.  </P> <P> Bush's decision to seize insolvent S&amp;Ls immediately was recommended last  week by Congress' General Accounting Office. Comptroller General Charles A.  Bowsher, the GAO's director, said that the crippled institutions were hurting  the rest of the industry by offering unusually high interest rates to attract  deposits.  </P> <P> Under the plan announced Monday, federal regulators will "assume supervisory  control of insolvent S&amp;Ls," according to a White House fact sheet. The  regulators -- the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp. -- could close branches, dispose of investments and  bring interest rates back down to market levels.  </P> <P> These immediate steps are being taken as an administrative action by federal  regulators and do not require congressional approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prosecutions Pledged  </P> <P> Citing "unconscionable risk-taking, fraud and outright criminality" as factors  contributing to the wave of S&amp;L failures and the collapse of the insurance  fund, Bush proposed also a $50-million increase in Justice Department spending  to prosecute crooked S&amp;L managers.  </P> <P> "I make to you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to recover assets  diverted from these institutions and to place behind bars those who have caused  losses through criminal behavior," Bush said.  </P> <P> "Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at risk the  savings of American families anticipate that we will seek them out, pursue them  relentlessly and demand the most severe penalties."  </P> <P> Related stories in Business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUSH BAILOUT PLAN  </P> <P> Here are the key points in President Bush's plan to rescue the savings and loan  industry:  </P> <P> Taxpayers would pay $40 billion over 10 years.  </P> <P> Government would issue $50 billion in bonds to finance the cost of failed  institutions, with $40 billion committed by regulators.  </P> <P> A newly created Resolution Trust Corp. would isolate insolvent thrifts and  resolve their affairs within five years.  </P> <P>  S&amp;Ls would be required to meet the same capital requirements as commercial  banks by June, 1991 -- doubling to 6% of assets.  </P> <P> Justice Department would get $50 million more to fight fraud, and regulators  would get expanded enforcement authority.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which oversees 13,000 banks, would become  the insurer for S&amp;Ls as well.  </P></p>

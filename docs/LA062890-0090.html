			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT OKS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AT FEDERAL LEVEL  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, in a surprising finale to its 1989-90 term, ruled Wednesday  that Congress may order the use of affirmative action in awarding federal  contracts, including radio and television licenses.  </P> <P> On a 5-4 vote, the court said that the federal government may use a "benign  racial classification" system to give preference to blacks over whites. Such a  federal policy need not remedy past discrimination but rather may seek simply  to give blacks and other minorities a greater share of federal benefits, the  court said.  </P> <P> This open-ended endorsement of minority preference policies by the federal  government comes just a year after an increasingly conservative Supreme Court  appeared ready to ban government affirmative action.  </P> <P> Last year, in the case of Croson vs. Richmond, the high court said that states  and local governments may not give preferences to minorities except in the rare  instances in which they are making up for a history of blatant exclusion.  </P> <P> But, on Wednesday, a different court lineup announced that Congress may do what  the states may not.  </P> <P> It is "within the power of Congress" to undertake "benign race-conscious  measures" so as to "serve important government objectives," Justice William J.  Brennan Jr. said for the court. Brennan was joined by his three fellow liberals  on civil rights issues -- Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul  Stevens -- and Byron R. White, who usually votes with the conservatives.  </P> <P> However, White is known for regularly voting to uphold acts of Congress without  regard to ideology. "He is a strong nationalist who defers to congressional  power," said Harvard law professor Laurence H. Tribe.  </P> <P> The ruling was based on the post-Civil War amendment to the Constitution that  gave Congress the power to remedy discrimination in the South against the newly  freed slaves.  </P> <P> The decision gave congressional Democrats and civil rights activists a major  victory. For the Bush Administration, it was a surprising defeat. The decision  gave a boost to Democrats who are pressing legislation to overturn a series of  Supreme Court rulings last year that limited the reach of federal civil rights  laws.  </P> <P> Legal experts said they were stunned.  </P> <P> "This is genuine landmark opinion that comes at exactly the right time in  American history," Tribe said. "It is crucial that Congress have the elbow room  to deal with this nation's racial problems at a time when the court has seemed  no longer interested."  </P> <P> The four conservative dissenters said that the talk of "racial classification"  smacked of Nazi and South African discrimination. "I regret that, after a  century of judicial opinions, we interpret the Constitution to do no more than  move us from 'separate but equal' to 'unequal but benign,' " Justice Anthony M.  Kennedy said.  </P> <P> The case before the court focused on a policy used by the Federal  Communications Commission to award radio and television broadcast licenses.  Because less than 1% of the nation's radio and television stations were  minority-owned in 1978, the FCC said that it would consider it a "plus factor"  if future license applicants were minority members.  </P> <P> The Ronald Reagan Administration tried to reverse this FCC policy in the early  1980s, but Congress enacted a bill freezing it in place.  </P> <P> With the "plus factor" in effect, Metro Broadcasting, a predominantly white  Florida firm, lost a bid for a new television station in Orlando to a company  owned by Latinos. Metro filed suit, challenging the FCC policy as  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The federal appeals court in Washington upheld this FCC policy.  </P> <P> When the case (Metro Broadcasting vs. FCC, 89-453) reached the Supreme Court,  it appeared to give the court's conservative majority a chance to wipe out  minority preference policies throughout the federal government.  </P> <P> Instead, thanks to White's vote, Brennan and his allies on the court revived a  long-forgotten liberal view of the 14th Amendment.  </P> <P> In 1868, three years after the Civil War ended, the Reconstruction Congress  approved the 14th Amendment to give itself the power to protect blacks in the  Southern states. It said that no state "may deny to any person . . . the equal  protection of the laws." Its final passage said: "The Congress shall have power  to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."  </P> <P> In recent decades, the amendment has been understood to require that all  Americans have a right to equal treatment by government at all levels: local,  state and federal. Bush Administration lawyers said that the 14th Amendment  required the federal government, as well as the states, to adopt colorblind  policies.  </P> <P> But liberal lawyers replied that the amendment allows Congress to enact  preferences for blacks, even if the states may not.  </P> <P> "The central purpose of the 14th Amendment was to give Congress the power to  improve the status of blacks. That's just what Congress was doing here," said  Georgetown law professor Louis M. Seidman, who filed a friend-of-the court  brief in support of the FCC.  </P> <P> Equally important, according to some lawyers, the court said that a minority  preference program need not be a remedy for past discrimination.  </P> <P> "This means you don't have to dredge up what happened in the past, but rather  say this would make things better in the future," said New York University law  professor Burt Neuborne. Based on this rationale, Congress could mandate  affirmative action in a variety of areas.  </P> <P> "I don't see that they have set any limit," Charles Cooper, a Reagan  Administration lawyer, said ruefully.  </P> <P> Justice Stevens may have set one limit. Although he joined the five-member  majority, he said in a concurring statement that minority preference programs  should be reserved for "extremely rare situations."  </P> <P> In a 30-page dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the Constitution demands  that all persons be treated "as individuals" and that "racial classifications"  are repugnant. She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  Justices Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.  </P> <P> Kennedy, in a separate dissent joined by Scalia that went even further,  lambasted the court for upholding legal racial classifications. He cited both  Nazi measures and South Africa's apartheid policies and compared the ruling to  the infamous Plessy vs. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the court endorsed the  "separate but equal" doctrine.  </P> <P> CHILD ABUSE -- High court rules that victims may testify without actually  appearing in court.

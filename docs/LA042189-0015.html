			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENANTS ALONG BOULEVARD JOIN FORCES TO FIGHT CRIME  </P> <P> About 50 Sepulveda Boulevard apartment dwellers on Thursday night formed the  first tenant crime-watch group to fight prostitution and drug dealing along the  thoroughfare.  </P> <P> Mary Lou Holte, a Sepulveda Boulevard tenant who was mugged and beaten in  October, organized the meeting.  </P> <P> "Instead of moving, I'm going to stay right here, and I'm going to watch what  goes on around this place," she said. "People are going to get busted."  </P> <P> And from the sentiments expressed by others at the meeting at her apartment  complex in the 6600 block of Sepulveda, Holte isn't alone in wanting to get  tough on crime.  </P> <P> The crowd clapped and cheered when Holte asked, "We have to do something about  our neighborhood. Right?"  </P> <P> Holte, who dubbed the new neighborhood watch group the Town Keepers, said  members will inform police and apartment managers when they suspect tenants are  dealing drugs or are involved in prostitution, a longtime problem in the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Share Information  </P> <P> Apartment managers agreed to share information to better screen out undesirable  tenants.  </P> <P> "We have every right to refuse to rent to a person who has been a nuisance at  another building," said Charles Erdell Sr., who manages an 83-unit complex in  the 6600 block of Sepulveda. "We are going to try to keep criminals out of our  buildings."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council recently passed a law that makes it easier for  landlords to evict tenants suspected of dealing drugs, said Deputy City Atty.  Marcia Gonzales, who supervises the city's narcotic abatement unit. The  ordinance makes such activity a public nuisance.  </P> <P> Gonzales said landlords are within their rights to refuse to rent to people  based on their references from a past landlord.  </P> <P> Several managers said that crime problems are driving tenants away.  </P> <P> "Pimps were using vacant apartments for prostitution . . . It was scary to just  walk past the people hanging out in front," said Toni Murrow, manager of the  56-unit Sepulveda Terrace Apartments. "If we don't stand tough now, we are  going to lose the buildings up and down this boulevard."  </P> <P> Police encouraged residents at the meeting to join Apartment Watch, a  4-year-old program designed to teach apartment dwellers to look out for  suspicious activity in their complexes.  </P></p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Labour urged to shift on pensions Labour's commitment to increase the basic pension for everybody should be replaced by greater targeting of the state pension scheme, says the Commission on Social Justice. In a paper published today, the commission, which the party set up to advise on policies for the welfare state, recommends options to focus pensions and benefits on those with little or no income from occupational pensions. The options include integrating benefits with the income tax system for pensioners, a guaranteed minimum pension and higher benefits for older pensioners who are less likely to have occupational pensions. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, indicated at a recent seminar on pensions organised by the Fabian Society that he was thinking along similar lines. The paper, by Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that the basic pension is falling as a percentage of average earnings. It has fallen to 15 per cent of male average earnings from 20 per cent in 1978. By 2040 it will amount to just 6 per cent if it continues to be increased in line with prices rather than earnings. Yet raising the basic state pension enough to lift all pensioners out of poverty would be expensive - increasing it to the level of income support would cost Pounds 4.5bn a year. This increase would fail to help the poorest pensioners, with the benefit going only to those above the poverty line. However, it rejects a simple switch from the basic pension to means-tested income support. This would create disincentives to save, the paper says. There are also problems of take-up with means-tested benefits, which many pensioners see as stigmatising them. The Pensions Dilemma.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Macedonians get scent of an identity: Athens concessions over a name for the former Yugoslav republic GREECE is finally making concessions in its dispute over the name of Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic. It follows a year of aggressive posturing that has infuriated its European Community partners and Balkan neighbours. Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, Greek prime minister, has accepted the idea of a United Nations-sponsored arbitration process to find a name by which the republic can be recognised internationally. So far only a handful of countries, among them Russia and Turkey, have recognised Macedonia. Mr Mitsotakis is willing to accept one of the compound names suggested last year as a way of distinguishing a sovereign Macedonia from the adjoining Greek province of Macedonia. The consensus among historians and intellectuals on both sides of the border is that Vardar Macedonia, named after the river that flows through Skopje, the Macedonian capital, would suffice. A draft Security Council resolution, put forward by Britain, France and Spain, tries to set the framework for a settlement by proposing that Macedonia should join the UN under the temporary name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairmen of the Yugoslav peace process, have agreed to oversee the arbitration procedure. Efforts would be made to introduce confidence-building measures, some of which have already been agreed in previous attempts by the EC to resolve the dispute. The Macedonians would drop their propaganda campaign aimed at convincing outsiders that northern Greece belongs to a Greater Macedonia. The Greeks would provide economic aid and a border guarantee for Macedonia. Macedonia's near-isolation has caused a sharp economic decline, with GDP shrinking 14 per cent in 1992, and unemployment rising to over 20 per cent of the workforce. A Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.5m) loan from Mr George Soros, the international financier, to cover fuel purchases and essential imports, is now keeping the economy afloat. Joining the UN, even under a temporary name, would bring recognition from Macedonia's trading partners, enabling banks in Skopje to start borrowing abroad again. Membership would also speed up financial aid from international organisations. Macedonia has already joined the International Monetary Fund with the prefix of 'Former Yugoslav Republic', assuming responsibility for its 5.4 per cent share of the ex-Yugoslav debt, amounting to Dollars 11m. While withholding recognition for Macedonia, because of Greek objections, the EC has pledged Ecu100m (Pounds 81m) aid, much of it to be delivered through the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, Macedonia's closest outlet to the sea. Most Greek politicians now accept Macedonia will soon be recognised under that name, Mr Mitsotakis' attempts at conciliation over the Macedonia question have angered the nationalists in his own New Democracy party as much as opposition socialists. Mr Kiro Gligorev, Macedonian president, faces pressure from the hardline faction in the VMRO party, the largest group in parliament, not to accept a temporary name. But he knows that if Macedonia joins the UN with the interim name, it will probably not be hard to drop the prefix at a later date.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / France sees recovery signs The French economy is on course for a progressive return to growth this year, according to the economy ministry, with gross domestic product set to increase by 1.4 per cent in 1994 and by 2.7 per cent next year. At present the French economy is still in a fragile state. Business surveys in recent months have registered an improvement in confidence, but there is no sign of a pick-up in economic activity and unemployment is still increasing, albeit at a slower pace. The economy ministry expects the situation to improve steadily during the coming months and to see 'significant signs of recovery' in the second half of the year as 'reductions in interest rates stimulate consumer demand and industrial investment'. France, said the ministry, should also benefit from the pick-up in other European countries. However, the employment situation is not expected to improve until the second half of this year, when there may signs of job creation in the service sector. Retail price inflation should remain low, with the ministry forecasting a 1.6 per cent increase for 1994 and 1.7 per cent next year.</p>

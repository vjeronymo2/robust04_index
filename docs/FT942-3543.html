			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: St Modwen property sales to raise Pounds 37m St Modwen Properties, the Birmingham-based property development and investment company, is to sell Pounds 37.3m of properties, which should bring in total net profits of close to Pounds 8m. It has sold the Octagon Shopping Centre in Burton-on-Trent to Scottish Amicable for Pounds 22.9m, representing a yield of close to 7 per cent. In addition, it has disposed of a retail development project to Mercury Property Fund for Pounds 14.4m. Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, said: 'I believe that the property market in many areas has reached a peak in prices'. St Modwen's share price reacted favourably to the sales, rising 3p to 49p. The disposals were in line with the company's strategy of focusing on second grade properties where it can enhance the rental income through intensive management. The proceeds will reduce gearing to 50 per cent, although acquisitions are likely to follow. The sale of Octagon will realise a Pounds 3m net profit, after writing off Pounds 700,000 for the winding down of a related interest rate swap. It will repay Pounds 11m of connected debt. The sale of the Oldbury Green development site in the West Midlands was expected, after the company signed up tenants for the 12.5 acre site, with Sainsbury's Homebase as its anchor. The net profits are believed to be close to Pounds 5m.</p>

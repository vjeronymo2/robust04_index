			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The Messages"] </F>   [Text] Whatever the interpretations given by PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and New Democracy to explain  the significant decrease of their electoral support over the  last eight months, one thing is certain: The electorate sent,  via the election, a clear message to the two big parties that  alternate in the government.    PASOK lost a significant part of its support and should deal  with it, even if the voter's attitude is different in the  elections for the European Parliament. There are many reasons  that the voters looked elsewhere and did not vote for PASOK  again. The main reason is PASOK's economic policy.    Therefore, the following question is raised: Will PASOK  change its policy, and if so, how? Will it implement the same,  or a more correct program with greater consistency and  determination, or will it hand out benefits in order to regain  its lost ground?    Seeing the problem from a wider spectrum, Acting Foreign  Minister Theodhoros Pangalos acknowledged, while commenting on  the election result, the government should not ignore the  message it has received. He stressed that the government should  continue implementing its policy in accordance with its  preelection program. "We did not promise benefits," he said,  and stressed: "We should implement our program with  consistency."    The message to New Democracy, whose leaders did not manage  to  prevent a further decrease in the party's support, is of another  kind. It is a message that will create a very serious problem  for [New Democracy Chairman] Miltiadhis Evert.    New Democracy lost support, mainly to Political Spring,  which  has doubled its support in eight months. Political Spring has  thus become an accountable factor not only in in terms of the  opposition, but in the country's political landscape because of  its role in the presidential election. That will determine  whether or not the country will go to general elections in May  1995. Probably, Political Spring will chose the former in  order to increase its support.    The ballot also sent a message of optimism to the smaller  parties whose approval ratings increased. The electorate wants  the presence of small political parties. Yesterday's vote for  the small parties was not merely a vote of sympathy or temporary  support to prevent their disappearance. Of course the small  parties should utilize the voters' support and react properly.    The government and political parties should carefully  analyze  the election results and not undermine the value of messages  that came out of the ballots.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPRING BREAK IS WEEKEND WEATHER OUTLOOK  </P> <P> San Diego is having nothing to do with the rapidly dwindling weeks of winter.  As if impatient for the vernal equinox March 20, this weekend's weather is  expected to plunge headfirst into very spring-like behavior.  </P> <P> Warm temperatures and gentle sea breezes will reign today and Saturday, with  slightly cooler conditions Sunday, the National Weather Service predicts. Night  and early-morning low clouds will give way to mostly sunny skies through the  weekend.  </P> <P> This spring break is courtesy of a large low-pressure system extending from the  Gulf of Alaska and a mild southwesterly air flow over San Diego, forecaster Dan  Atkin said.  </P> <P> Highs along the coast today and Saturday will be in the upper-60s, dropping to  the mid-60s Sunday. Overnight lows will be in the mid-50s both nights, Atkin  said.  </P> <P> The ocean temperature is 57 degrees. The surf is 2 to 4 feet.  </P> <P> Inland highs today and Saturday will be about 77 degrees, dipping slightly into  the low 70s Sunday. Lows both nights will be about 48, the forecast says.  </P> <P> The mountains are expected to have highs in the mid- to upper-60s, and  overnight lows in the upper-30s.  </P></p>

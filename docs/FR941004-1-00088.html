			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples of indicators on the State's (or the Indian tribe's, as appropriate) service delivery capacity: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The extent to which child welfare, family preservation, and family support services are available and being provided (e.g., number and percentage of families served, waiting lists, etc.); the extent to which child welfare workers' caseloads (intake, protective, foster care, adoption, etc.) permit adequate protection of and service delivery to children and families; the availability of out-of-home care and placement (including adoption) resources; the availability of prevention and intervention services; the availability of critically needed services such as housing, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment; the extent to which existing services are coordinated with the provision of other child and family services, particularly child protective services and independent living services (e.g., indicators of successful referrals); and the funding resources and expenditures, geographic availability, numbers of persons served, and insufficient service capacity (unmet needs) related to these services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples of indicators States or Indian tribes, as appropriate, might use or seek to develop relating to strengthening the delivery of services and accomplishing goals and objectives: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The extent to which resources are available for training, technical assistance, and consultation, including leadership development, staff development, and interdisciplinary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training; the existence and utilization of quality assurance measures, program development and management and data analysis; and the implementation, expansion, and utilization of management information systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian tribes will want to obtain a general picture of the well-being of children and families in their area of jurisdiction and use available data in determining goals, objectives, and services in the CFSP. Indian tribes should use the examples of indicators and suggested sources of information as it meets their needs and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement in paragraph (k)(2) for the collection and analysis of statewide information on family preservation and family support services is an extension of the requirement in the FY 1994 Program Instructions. Most States and Indian tribes have begun to identify existing family preservation and support programs as a part of their consultation, coordination of services, and planning processes. Specific information on geographic availability; mismatches among scope, availability, and family needs; and the identifications of both public and privately funded programs must be known as the basis for State decisions on future services funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the collection and analysis of data is related not only to the priorities and outcomes the States and Indian tribes want to achieve but should be used in the consultation and coordination processes to identify what additional data are needed, which data will serve as baseline information on which to measure progress, and what future goals and objectives the CFSP should address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We ask States to comment on their experiences identifying and gathering existing statewide baseline information including information on the well-being and needs of children and families; the quality and usefulness of the information gathered or expected to be gathered; information on the nature, scope, and adequacy of existing child- and family-related social service programs; and data on existing family preservation and family support services (including important gaps in service and mismatches between available services and family needs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicit comment not only on the proposed indicators and their usefulness in planning, but also recommendations on how the indicators might be improved. We also seek comments on the usefulness of defining indicators more concisely so that uniform definitions can be developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

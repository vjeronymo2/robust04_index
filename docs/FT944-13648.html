			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Markets fall as dollar hits new lows: US currency and bond weakness blamed on Fed - European stocks suffer setbacks The US dollar slipped to fresh lows against the D-Mark and the yen yesterday, while European bond and equity markets fell in the wake of Monday's rise in the US Treasury long bond yield above 8 per cent. The US currency touched a post-second world war low of Y96.35 and a two-year low of DM1.4845, before recovering to close in London at Y96.86 and DM1.492. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, whose reported comments last week hurt dollar sentiment by apparently ruling out intervention to support the US currency, yesterday said: 'We would like a stronger dollar.' Traders have blamed the recent weakness in the dollar and the US Treasury bond market on the belief that the US Federal Reserve was acting too slowly to combat inflation. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, said: 'Sentiment towards the dollar remains pretty unanimously negative.' But Mr Alan Blinder, the Fed deputy chairman, said he did not believe the Fed was 'behind the curve' in fighting inflation. 'I think we're very close to riding the curve,' he said, implying that the Fed's actions were up with events. However, Mr Blinder added that the economy was 'showing fewer signs of deceleration than I would have thought several months ago.' Financial markets gained a small amount of relief yesterday from figures on US consumer confidence and employment costs, which appeared to show subdued inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, European markets reacted negatively to the rise in the US long bond yield, with the 8 per cent level seen as a watershed for the markets. 'Previously 8 per cent was seen as fair value for Treasury bonds,' said Mr Michael Hughes, global strategist at UK securities house BZW. 'But there is a growing concern that markets are headed for an overshoot.' UK investment bank Kleinwort Benson is predicting that the long bond yield will rise to 8.5 per cent. German government bunds and UK gilts dropped about three quarters of a point and bond fed through to shares. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 28.2 points down at 3,000.9, having at one point fallen 43.5 points to 2,985.6. A weak US dollar also hurts European shares by damaging prospects for export-led growth and reducing the local currency value of the earnings of US subsidiaries of European companies. In Frankfurt, the DAX index closed 1.3 per cent lower in after-hours trading yesterday while in Paris, the CAC-40 index closed just under 1 per cent down. In New York, the 30-year Treasury bond had slipped a further sixth of a point by 2.30pm and was yielding 8.06 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 21.2 points lower at 3,834.10.

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMIC CRISIS LEAVES POOR HUNGRY, DESPERATE IN PERU  </P> <P> It is 6 a.m., a Sunday, still dark and chilly on the coastal desert plain. But  food lines are already forming outside bread shops and people's markets across  the Peruvian capital.  </P> <P> A bakery opens in the Pueblo Libre (Free People) district, a treeless swath of  older, tidy brick homes owned by teachers and technicians alongside the flimsy  grass-and-reed shacks of newly arrived squatters from the Andes highlands. A  line forms, the people oblivious to the stench of garbage from the dusty edges  of Tomas Valle Avenue.  </P> <P> The middle class and the poor mingle in the line, sharing a reality that over  the past six months has taken hold everywhere but in the handful of well-to-do  sections of this city of 6.1 million people: More often than not, if you want  something in Lima, you have to wait in line for it, if it is available at all.  </P> <P> "The economic crisis is drowning us," Guillermo Torres Valle, one of the  original householders in Pueblo Libre, said after buying a few bread rolls. "We  are up to our eyes. These paquetazos (government austerity packages) are  killing us.  </P> <P> "In some areas, there are people who eat a bit of bread for breakfast, and  again for lunch, and drink water to fill their stomachs."  </P> <P> Torres Valle watched his sullen neighbors waiting in line and observed: "People  are passive, too accepting. But there is going to come a time when things  explode. They are going to be sacking the markets."  </P> <P> Peruvians are no strangers to frustration. Governments have been breaking  promises here since the Spanish conquered the ruthlessly efficient Inca empire  more than four centuries ago. Public buses are a trial for commuters trying to  get home to the slums, and bank transactions can take hours. Patience is not  just a virtue but a necessity.  </P> <P> But an economic program gone wrong is indeed straining the traditional  resilience of Peruvians, who endured inflation of nearly 2,000% last year.  Medical supplies are often unavailable, even for those with money. Strikes by  hundreds of thousands of workers turn routine chores into daylong ventures. One  of the longest lines is outside the passport office -- people who want to flee  the country.  </P> <P> Rumors of a coup have eased once again, and President Alan Garcia, his  popularity in tatters, maintains that he is on the verge of righting the  economy after a spending spree that lasted nearly four years and almost  bankrupted the country.  </P> <P> The hardships, his government says, are the necessary result of a series of  reforms imposed since September. They include the near-elimination of  government subsidies, a move that has more than doubled the price of fuel and  some staple foods since September.  </P> <P> The importance of food for the future of democracy in Peru has not escaped the  surging Maoist guerrilla movement, Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path. Earlier  this month, the guerrillas exhorted dozens of shantytown residents to carry out  an illegal potato harvest on a private farm on the outskirts of Lima -- and  killed a guard who tried to stop them.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Peruvians of all classes share a pervasive despair -- and try  to cope.  </P> <P> "Tell your people that we are dying of hunger here," a young man shouted to a  foreign reporter as a food line inched forward in Trebol, an old section in the  city's north. After buying his rice, the man, Andres Villanueva, elaborated:  "The people are getting desperate. Communism is growing stronger in these poor  areas. It is very dangerous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shortage of Staple  </P> <P> Hundreds of people had gathered at dawn outside the Trebol people's market,  without even knowing whether there would be any rice, a Peruvian staple.  </P> <P> Every Saturday, usually by mid-morning, a government truck arrives at each  market and dumps a load of one-kilo bags of rice (2.2 pounds each) at the curb  to be sold by municipal workers. On Sundays, the chances that a truck will  arrive are only 50-50.  </P> <P> On this Sunday, the people were fortunate. A truck appeared at 10 a.m. and  deposited 3,000 bags, enough rice for 600 families. The workers sold each  customer up to five bags for 375 intis each (about 25 cents). Schoolteachers  are paid about $25 a month.  </P> <P> In Jesus Maria, an older Spanish colonial section of Lima north of the downtown  area near decaying Inca ruins, tension infused a rice line that stretched  around a block of closed shops.  </P> <P> A day earlier, the supply had run out before half of the people were served,  setting off scuffles that came close to being a riot.  </P> <P> Women in the line, their faces taut with anxiety and their eyes hawkishly  attentive, kept a lookout for any sign of cheating or cutting in. Several  people, many with relatives in the line, formed a semicircle around the pile of  rice bags on the sidewalk to monitor the sale.  </P> <P> "Don't sell five bags, sell four!" one woman shouted. "There isn't enough!"  </P> <P> The government worker in charge, nervous that the sale would collapse in chaos,  vainly pleaded with the people to move back.  </P> <P> Segundo Perez, who works as a technician in a pharmaceutical laboratory, was  able to buy his five kilos of rice on his second day of trying.  </P> <P> "When I arrived yesterday at 6 a.m., there were already 600 people in the  line," he said. "At noon the rice ran out, and people were furious."  </P> <P> Perez, 47, said his family of seven needs 1.5 kilos of rice a day, "so this  lasts us three days. Then we have to use pasta or something else for the rest  of the week. And pasta is terribly expensive," the equivalent of nearly $1 a  kilo.  </P> <P> Perez earns 90,000 intis a month, the equivalent of about $75, far more than  most Peruvians. He takes on odd jobs, such as house painting and welding, in  order to get by. In the past six months, he said, "my buying power has fallen  50%. We usually cannot eat meat or chicken or fish. We are up against the wall,  with a sword pointed at our bellies."  </P> <P> Fermin Saladeriaga Arrazabal, who was running the sale, said: "The people  finish in line and go to the end to wait again. There is a hoarding mentality,  whether there are real shortages or not. And they know that with inflation like  it is, they have to spend their money right away or it will be worth less.  </P> <P> "Some of these people buy rice or powdered milk -- although we haven't sold any  milk for weeks now -- and send their children out to the streets to resell it  for twice the official price. And the police do nothing."  </P> <P> He said there are some markets where people start lining up a day in advance.  Lining up, he said, is a way of life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attacks by Rebels  </P> <P> At one of the stalls in the adjacent market, a crowd had lined up to buy  potatoes, which is another staple and one of the few crops Peru has managed to  keep raising in abundance. But landslides in the Andes had cut the main highway  to Lima, and people feared there would be a shortage.  </P> <P> The sun grew fierce as noon approached, and the line of customers huddled  against a block-long brick wall, trying to stay in the shade.  </P> <P> The shortages are the result of a complex set of problems shared by other Latin  American countries. But nowhere are they as acute as in Peru, partly because  the guerrilla warfare frustrates what attempts there are at development. A few  weeks ago electric power outages were routine because of attacks on power  transmission lines. Now the blackouts have stopped.  </P> <P> Food is the sorest point. Rice growers here must sell to the state rice agency,  and they complain that they are paid too little and months late. So supplies  dwindle. Until recently, currency-exchange rules discouraged exports, so the  government's reserves evaporated. Rice-laden ships wait offshore until there is  money to pay for their cargoes. Foreign lenders, unpaid for past debts, refuse  to make new loans, so roads and transport deteriorate.  </P> <P> Peasant rice growers in the eastern jungle around Pucallpa went on strike last  month because they had been paid too little, or not at all, for their last five  months of production. At a protest rally Feb. 9, police opened fire and killed  at least 10 farmers.  </P> <P> Peru literally has a shortage of money, too: A lack of paper for the presses  that turn out currency has led to a scarcity of small-denomination bills. The  lack of change has helped slow rice sales at the markets to a crawl.  </P> <P> Skilled personnel have been leaving the country, and this has caused a  personnel shortage that seems sure to worsen. Fearful of guerrilla warfare that  has claimed more than 12,000 lives in nine years, and worried about their  economic future, an estimated 150,000 Peruvians left the country in 1988 --  three times the previous year's total.  </P> <P> To survive, the poorest Peruvians sort through the garbage tossed out by the  well-to-do. On a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a man spent his Sunday  picking up scraps of cardboard boxes from a garbage dump near several decaying,  abandoned former mansions of the colonial era.  </P> <P> On the beach to the south, below the sand-colored cliffs and the  upper-middle-class suburb of Miraflores, the contrast was sharply drawn: Young  men dressed in multicolored swimwear joined in a surfing contest as organizers  called out the results over a loudspeaker. In the Costa Verde restaurant on the  beach, well-off people sipped cocktails under umbrellas and ordered $20 plates  of shellfish.  </P> <P> Farther along the coast, in Huacho at the southern edge of Lima, the scene  became typical again: more pueblos jovenes, or young towns, home to poor  Indians who have migrated here from the mountains in search of a better life.  </P> <P> For those in Huacho, however, even the beach has provided no respite in this  Southern Hemisphere summer. Dozens of people, mainly children, have suffered  burns in recent weeks from toxic chemicals dumped illegally there. The  municipality paid for the funeral of a boy who died from such burns because his  family did not have the money.  </P> <P> The cost was the equivalent of $20.  </P></p>

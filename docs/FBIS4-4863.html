			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Monday [4 April] he will do his utmost to put into  force a recommendation by the national personnel authority to  raise civil servants' salaries. Hosokawa made the remarks  during a meeting at his official residence with labor unions'  leader Akira Yamagishi.    Yamagishi, head of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation  (Rengo), urged the government to raise public servants' salaries  fully in accordance with the recommendation. "If a  recommendation is offered, I will respect it and make utmost  efforts to realize it at an early date," Hosokawa said.    The premier was also positive about the idea of granting  Japanese firefighters the right to organize and engage in labor  movements. Among industrialized nations, only Japan has refused  to grant its firefighters such a right.    Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi, who also attended the  meeting, proposed the establishment of a new consulting body  with representatives of the government, labor unions and  employers to exchange views on promoting employment.    Yamagishi invited Hosokawa to a Rengo-sponsored "May Day"  assembly on May 1 as the government representative.</p>

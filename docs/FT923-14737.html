			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Observer: On trial The run-up to this month's Olympics is proving to be just as tricky for athletic footwear makers as for the athletes they are sponsoring. It will need some fancy footwork if the sneaker advertisers' heavy investment in great names who stumbled in the race to Barcelona is going to be protected. The collapse of Reebok's Dan-and-Dave advertising battle to find the world's greatest athlete - Dan O'Brien flunked his pole vault trial - has been the most dramatic upset. But there are plenty of other advertisers who don't seem to be getting value for money. Sports shoe maker Nike can be forgiven for feeling let down by German sprinter Katrin Krabbe and her colleagues. Having loyally stood behind them during accusations that they fiddled their drug tests, Nike now finds Krabbe et al have decided to skip the Olympics despite being cleared. Meanwhile, Japanese running shoe maker Mizuno has had to scale back its Carl Lewis advertising campaign, after the superstar failed to make it into the US sprint team. With prices of some sports shoes being slashed by up to 40 per cent, vulnerable European companies like Adidas and Hi-Tec must be hoping that bigger rivals, like Nike and Reebok, will start dumping some of their expensive advertising stars, rather than just their surplus stock. If they don't watch out Nike and Reebok may soon be entered into the Marketing Hall of Shame along with some other famous losers.</p>

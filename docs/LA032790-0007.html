			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE'S MOUNTAIN LANDS  </P> <P> It is interesting to note that Times writer Alan Citron is exercising "freedom  of the press," Margot Feuer (member of Save the Mountain Park Coalition) and  Mary Wiesbrock (environmental activist) "freedom of speech," (Part A, March 7)  and cartoonist Conrad "freedom of artistic venom" ("Faith, hope and damn little  charity," March 16). However, it appears they would have us believe that "free  enterprise" is a dirty word.  </P> <P> Free enterprise is an important element in our democratic form of government;  an element being embraced throughout the world now more than any time in  history.  </P> <P> Bob Hope is an extremely charitable man. Few have given so much to so many so  often. Hope's concern for his fellow man is near legend.  </P> <P> It is impossible to calculate how many millions he has raised for charitable  causes by performance, presence, name and direct donation.  </P> <P> And, unless something has happened overnight that I'm unaware of, I believe it  is the "right" of the donor to indicate the recipient of the gift.  </P> <P> If Citron had investigated a little further he would have found out about the  provision in the sale of Hope's property (7,400 acres in the Santa Monica  Mountains) which calls for a donation of 1,000 acres of prime land to the  National Park Service.  </P> <P> WARD GRANT  </P> <P> Public Relations for Bob Hope  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

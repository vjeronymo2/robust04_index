			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling slips on rates moves THERE was very thin trading on the foreign exchange markets yesterday as most of continental Europe was on holiday, writes James Blitz. But sterling captured most attention as the Bank of England signalled through its money market operations that it may wish to see a cut in UK base rates by at least  1/4 per cent next week. As news filtered out from the UK markets in the morning, sterling dipped to DM2.9291, although one economist said that this had more to do with traders speculating on another hike in German interest rates rather than uncertainty in the pound. In the afternoon, the pound picked up again but still finished at DM2.9300, down from a previous close of DM2.9325. According to Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at Citibank in London, the prospect of a  1/4 per cent drop in UK interest rates would strengthen the pound rather than weaken it. 'A drop of  1/4 per cent would show that large base rate movements will not be a prominent part of UK policy in future,' he said. In the past, the British government has regularly signalled adjustments in rates by a half or one per cent. The dollar continued to suffer on European markets after America's political and economic difficulties had lost the currency some ground in overnight trading. Asian markets had pushed the dollar down to DM1.6430 on rumours that the Federal Reserve was about to ease interest rate policy still further. By yesterday afternoon in London, the dollar was skidding further to test support around DM1.6400, as the market chose to focus on the negative aspects of yesterday's economic data from the US. Both March construction spending and the Michigan University consumer confidence survey showed stronger growth. But they were outweighed in the market's eyes by a surprising fall of 51.3 in the National Purchasing Management survey in April as opposed to 54.1 in March. By the time trading had opened in New York, confidence in the dollar was being tested further by news of the continuing riots in Los Angeles. One currency dealer in San Francisco said that the rioting was adding to the negative dollar sentiment now. Investors, he said, were concerned about potential financial pressure on municipal and federal governments from the costs of rebuilding and from tourism loss. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6410, down over a pfennig from its previous close of DM1.6525. In early trading in New York, it was testing the downside of DM1.6355. The US currency was also down on the yen, closing in London at Y132.70, down Y133.35 on its previous close.</p>

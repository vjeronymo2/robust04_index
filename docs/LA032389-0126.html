			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEATTLE SEAHAWKS CATCH RAMS' JOHNNIE JOHNSON IN FREE AGENCY  </P> <P> The winds of change, blowing briskly through Anaheim these days, swept out  another Ram Wednesday when veteran free safety Johnnie Johnson announced that  he was taking the money and running his 32-year-old body to the Seattle  Seahawks.  </P> <P> Johnson, a nine-year veteran and a mainstay of the Ram secondary for nearly a  decade, has agreed to terms with the Seahawks on a two-year contract. Johnson  was one of 19 Ram players left unprotected last month when the National  Football League loosened its chokehold on the terms of "free agency." Johnson,  thus, was free to negotiate with any team and was not subject to compensation.  Terms of his deal were not immediately known, though he will reportedly earn at  least double his annual Ram salary of $200,000, which Johnson was to receive  this year and next. His total package, including reachable incentives, could be  worth in excess of $500,000 a season.  </P> <P> It was an offer Johnson couldn't refuse.  </P> <P> "I would have been really disappointed if I would have played 10 or 12 years  and never got the chance to at least test the free-agent market once," Johnson  said. "I was lucky enough to come off a good enough year where there were teams  that were interested in me."  </P> <P> Of course, it wasn't as easy as that. Johnson said he anguished over his  decision to leave the Rams, mostly because his roots are firmly entrenched in  Orange County, where Johnson has recently married and started his own real  estate company.  </P> <P> "I have strong feelings for the Ram organization," Johnson said. "I have strong  feelings for (owner) Georgia (Frontiere). I feel I've got one of the better  images of any athlete around here. I'd like to thank the fans and the coaching  staff for being as great as they have to me in my nine years. But I'll be down  here to play the Raiders."  </P> <P> The Rams could have prevented Johnson's escape by including him among the 37  players they were allowed to protect. They chose not to, gambling that  Johnson's age and community ties would keep him in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "I can see why they did it," Johnson said. "But it backfired. It didn't work  out for them."  </P> <P> The Rams didn't seem quite so stunned.  </P> <P> "It was expected," Ram Coach John Robinson said from the NFL owners meeting at  Palm Desert. "Johnnie was nearing the end of his career. This is a real  opportunity for him. When players come to the end of their careers, sometimes a  new environment is a catalyst for them. He's been a great Ram, and a great guy.  It's probably in his best interests. We expected him to have offers. He's still  got some quality years left in him."  </P> <P> The Rams are presently in the roster-clearing business, having to make room for  five more first- or second-round draft choices again this summer. As Johnson  moves out, James Washington, 24, and Michael Stewart, 23, form the line that  leads to his vacated job.  </P> <P> Still, Johnson started all 16 games at free safety for the Rams last season and  even played cornerback in a pinch. He led the team with four interceptions and  was the team's third-leading tackler with 47.  </P> <P> Johnson said he gravitated to the Seahawks. The first attraction was Chuck  Knox, the former Ram coach, who holds nothing against players born in the  1950s.  </P> <P> "Knox loves veterans, and I can still run," Johnson said. "That had the biggest  impact on them."  </P> <P> The second incentive was the Seahawks' recent hiring of former Raider coach Tom  Flores to run the team's football operations. And the clincher? Seattle's  defensive backs coach is none other than Rod Perry, the former Ram cornerback  and Johnson's close friend.  </P> <P> "If somebody gave me deck of cards, I couldn't have picked a better hand,"  Johnson said. "And I'm confident they're only a couple of players away (from  the Super Bowl)."  </P> <P> Johnson created quite a stir in 1980 when the Rams made the University of Texas  star the 15th pick in the NFL draft. His six-year, million-dollar contract  prompted the famous training-camp holdouts of angered veterans Jack and Jim  Youngblood, Larry Brooks and Dennis Harrah. Johnson, though, soon proved his  worth and became one of the team's most consistent players of the decade.  </P> <P> Johnson played strong safety until Robinson arrived in 1983 and switched him to  free safety.  </P> <P> "I owe quite a few things to Coach Robinson," Johnson said. "He allowed me to  become the player I am. He made the move from strong to free; it was the best  move anyone could have made for me. And he did not hesitate to move me to  corner, which allowed people to see what I could do."  </P> <P> Johnson had perhaps his best season in 1983, when he made some All-Pro teams.  He leaves the Rams with 21 career interceptions.  </P> <P> "It'll be weird, not being a Ram," Johnson said. "But that's something I'll get  used to. I played here nine years. But this is an excellent opportunity for me.  They expect big things out of me."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Johnnie Johnson becomes the seventh unprotected Ram to sign with another NFL  team, upstaging reserve cornerback Mickey Sutton, who said Wednesday that he  has agreed to a two-year deal with the Green Bay Packers. Sutton, who earned  $115,000 last season, said he will more than double his salary with the  Packers. Sutton will also be asked to return punts. But what about that  weather, Mick? "The snow doesn't bother me," he said. "I'll still keep my place  in Irvine. I couldn't let weather hinder my decision." If you've lost track,  other Rams lost to free agency were receiver Michael Young (Denver); defensive  linemen Gary Jeter (New England), Greg Meisner (Kansas City) and Fred Stokes  (Washington); tight end Jon Embree (Seattle), and running back Keith Jones  (Cleveland). That leaves 11 unprotected Rams with seven shopping days left in  free agency. All deals must be completed by April 1. The remaining free agents  are linebackers Jim Collins, Carl Ekern and Mark Jerue, quarterback Mark  Herrmann, running backs Charles White, Tim Tyrrell, Buford McGee and Mike  Guman, tackle Mike Schad, tight end Eric Sievers and snapper Mike McDonald.  </P></p>

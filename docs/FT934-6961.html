But the African National Congress called for further investigation of the possibility gunmen had tried to kill Mrs Mandela, the estranged wife of the ANC leader. A total of 18 shots were fired in the fight which took place in a street crowded with revellers attending a festival. Mrs Mandela was unharmed.</p>

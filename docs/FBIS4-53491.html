			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  received an initial report on the situation of the replacement  of the fuel rods from the inspection team which started  inspection activities in Yongbyon, North Korea, on 18 May, and  discussed measures regarding this matter.    The inspection team consisted of three people who are  conducting a detailed examination of whether the fuel rods were  replaced at the five megawatt-class atomic reactor. It was  learned that the inspection team made an initial report to the  IAEA on the progress of the replacement of the fuel rods and on  its future prospects.    In this connection, a well-informed source reported that  high- ranking policy-makers in the IAEA closely analyzed the  initial report, and discussed in detail on whether to seek ways  to resolve this issue through negotiations with North Korea.  However, the details of the inspection team's report to the  IAEA on the situation regarding the replacement of fuel rods  were not revealed.</p>

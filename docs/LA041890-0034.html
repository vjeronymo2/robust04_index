			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISLAM, THE WEST'S IMAGINARY MENACE;  </P> <P> MUSLIMS: THEY ARE A PRESENCE IN MANY MATTERS TROUBLING TO THE WEST, BUT THE  CAUSES ARE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC, NOT RELIGIOUS.  </P> <P> Now that the Cold War is over and communism is collapsing, what more is there  to fear? For many Western commentators, the answer is Islam. They see its rise  as the new principal threat to Western security and values, a menacing force in  an area extending from Yugoslavia to the deserts of Central Asia -- the  so-called Crescent of Crisis.  </P> <P> This view is as wrongheaded as it is popular.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that, for some time, Islam has been a potent political force.  The disintegration of the Soviet empire is unleashing forces in Muslim Central  Asia that could be destabilizing. And large-scale Muslim migration to Europe is  proving to be disruptive. For some areas, then, the Islamic "menace" is close  indeed.  </P> <P> Yet it is both false and facile to attribute all new instability in Central and  South Asia to Islam, or to explaining European problems with immigrant  communities in terms of their Islamic character.  </P> <P> It is simply incorrect to contend that recent troubles in Azerbaijan, Kashmir  and in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo were all caused by Islam. In Kosovo,  a part of the Serbian republic, the primary causes of strife are ethnic  differences and resentment over Serbian dominance. Azerbaijan's dispute with  Armenia is basically over territory and is only one element of a national  crisis stemming from rancor over two centuries of Russian/Soviet imperial  domination. Even Kashmir's troubles are due more to nationalism than to Islam,  as most Kashmirians seek independence from India rather than merger with Muslim  Pakistan.  </P> <P> Similarly, Europe's problem with Muslim immigrants derives primarily from the  economic and social crisis of their native countries. Even if these people were  not Muslims, many European countries would find the mass influx of poorly  educated, untrained peoples stressful; witness the longstanding tensions over  non-Muslim African and Caribbean immigration.  </P> <P> In most instances, it is also not true that the Islamic movement is intolerant  or exclusionary. Muslims in Lebanon, for example, are not guilty of intolerance  because they refuse to continue accepting Christian dominance; nor are  Palestinians because they demand part of their ancestral homeland; nor are  Soviet Muslims because they reject Russification and state-ordained atheism.  </P> <P> For the past 200 years the Islamic world has been largely a passive recipient  of foreign cultural influences, often resulting from imperial expansion. This  passivity led many Western Orientalists to disdain Muslim societies as  fatalistic, gripped with inertia, lacking in dynamism.  </P> <P> But during the past two decades there has been a steady rise in Muslim cultural  consciousness, leading many intellectuals to question the wholesale adoption of  foreign value systems and to reach into their Islamic culture for new models.  An outward manifestation of this movement has been the insistence of many  Muslims, including immigrant communities in Europe, on adherence to a strict  dress code. This phenomenon recently led to the widely publicized head-scarf  controversy in France, when the government prohibited Muslim schoolgirls from  covering their hair. In this case, parochialism was on the Europeans' side,  reflecting limits of Western tolerance regarding peoples who resist total  assimilation and a European desire to maintain domestic culture free from  foreign influence.  </P> <P> In general, for the first time, Western societies have to face what the Islamic  world has undergone in a much more extensive and systematic way for nearly  three centuries: an assertive penetration of their societies by an alien  religion and culture. The West finds this difficult to accept.  </P> <P> To be sure, there is an extremist dimension to the Islamic resurgence, but it  affects only a small part of a large movement. Moreover, it derives primarily  from political, social and economic factors other than Islam. Once stripped of  their Islamic symbolism, the extremists' political views and agendas, both  domestic and international, closely resemble other secular radical movements in  the Third World. Even if Islam were to disappear, popular grievances and  aspirations would incite radicalism.  </P> <P> In short, the problem that both the West and the Soviet Union face in dealing  with the Muslim world does not derive from Islam the religion. It is rooted in  the social and economic crises of most Muslim countries, exacerbated by a  population explosion, and in the Muslims' rising political and cultural  assertiveness. If the West would see the Islamic phenomenon for what it is --  essentially social, economic, cultural and political -- the best approach  becomes obvious: The West should use such tools as economic assistance to help  Muslim countries create better living conditions for their citizens, which  would serve European interests by helping to limit emigration; and it should be  sensitive to Muslim desires for political and cultural autonomy.  </P> <P> Of course, Muslim extremism must be countered. But considering Islam to be the  West's new enemy, lapsing into a medieval parlance of Crusade and Jihad, or  imposing Western values on Muslims is no answer. It can only benefit Muslim  extremists.  </P> <P> Above all, there is critical need for an ecumenical Christian-Muslim dialogue,  to lay the foundation of a future relationship based on mutual respect for the  beliefs, values and legitimate concerns of both communities.  </P></p>

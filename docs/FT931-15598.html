			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: D-Mark bonds That Italy plans to join the roster of European governments borrowing in D-Marks comes as no surprise. A large budget deficit, a weakened currency and depleted foreign currency reserves are features in common with other recent borrowers - notably Norway, Sweden, Finland and the UK. The Italian issue will doubtless be seen as a signal of the government's belief that the depreciation of the lira against the D-Mark has run its course. The lira rallied yesterday on such sentiment. In fact, the timing looks pragmatic. The demise of the Ecu bond market last year has narrowed the field for governments seeking overseas funds. Aside from dabbling in the likes of sterling and yen, serious borrowers are restricted to D-Marks and dollars. Since the Bundesbank stoked expectations of lower interest rates again last week, the German currency was a natural choice. All the more so since last year's events established the D-Mark as the most potent weapon in the European central banker's armoury. Intervention in dollars is hardly a reply to speculators betting in D-Marks. The Bundesbank will doubtless have mixed feelings about the enhanced international status of the D-Mark bond market. Given its preoccupation with controlling the money supply, it can hardly welcome an overhang of off-shore D-Marks. It might equally be enjoying some quiet satisfaction at the downfall of an Ecu market of which it was always suspicious.</p>

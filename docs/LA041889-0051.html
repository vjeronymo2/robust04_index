			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROL DATA IS GETTING OUT OF SUPERCOMPUTERS;  </P> <P> MOVE TO HURT U.S. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH JAPANESE; 3,100 JOBS WILL BE CUT  </P> <P> In a move viewed as an embarrassing blow to U.S. technological strength,  financially ailing Control Data Corp. on Monday announced that it is closing  its supercomputer business and cutting 3,100 jobs overall from its work force.  </P> <P> Analysts said the loss of ETA Systems, the Control Data subsidiary that is the  nation's No. 2 supercomputer maker, would, over time, hurt U.S. efforts to stay  ahead of Japanese competitors and remain the world's dominant supplier of  supercomputers. With the departure of ETA from the business, only one U.S.  company, Cray Research, is producing supercomputers.  </P> <P> "This won't immediately result in the sale of another Japanese supercomputer,  but it will provide another argument for customers who are already angling to  'buy Japanese,' " said Chris Willard, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose  technology market research firm. "It shows the world that another U.S. company  didn't make it."  </P> <P> ETA Systems will account for 800 of Control Data's 3,100 layoffs. The rest of  the cutbacks will come at its other computer equipment divisions. About half of  the 3,100 people being laid off work in the Minneapolis area, where Control  Data is based, and the others are scattered across the country. The company  makes everything from mainframe computers to computer storage devices to  electronic lottery equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Uses  </P> <P> About 410 supercomputers have been installed worldwide, not counting the  supercomputers used by manufacturers of the machines themselves. They are used  for such complex technical tasks as developing weapons systems, designing  advanced aircraft and breaking secret codes. They also are used to simulate and  calculate such things as the flow of air over an aircraft wing or the  interaction of volatile chemicals, along with other processes that require more  computer processing speed than other types of computers can provide.  </P> <P> The market for these machines, which first appeared less than a decade ago,  once was thought to be vast, but analysts say growth has been slower than  anticipated. For example, Cray Research, which controls about two-thirds of the  worldwide market, has seen its sales growth slow from a red-hot 66% in 1985 to  just 10% in 1988.  </P> <P> "If the market had been more robust, perhaps Control Data could have made it,"  said Patricia Laupheimer, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.  </P> <P> Laupheimer said the "easy sales" of supercomputers to the government,  universities and aerospace companies have already been made. "Now the  supercomputer makers need to get into new markets, and it will be harder and  the initial purchases won't be as large," she said.  </P> <P> Dataquest, which had at one time forecast a 25% annual growth rate for  supercomputer sales, has revised the projection downward to less than 21%.  </P> <P> Control Data, which had been making supercomputers -- and losing money on them  -- since 1983, cited its ongoing financial problems for closing the business.  </P> <P> Analysts said Control Data was under severe pressure from its lenders to stem  its continuing losses, which have amounted to more than $800 million since  1985. One analyst said ETA Systems, whose total losses since 1983 exceed $350  million, was viewed as the most logical target for the cost cutters.  </P> <P> The company said its streamlining moves would result in a one-time charge of  $490 million, including $350 million from liquidation of ETA Systems. The  company said most of the restructuring costs will be charged against earnings  in the second quarter of this year.  </P> <P> A Control Data spokesman said after months of studying its choices for ETA  Systems, the company decided it could no longer "afford to continue product  development across such a wide section of products."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neglected Software  </P> <P> Asked if Control Data attempted to sell ETA Systems, spokesman Frank Ryan said:  "We looked at all options. The shutdown was the most practical."  </P> <P> Analysts said ETA Systems had never developed a reputation as a strong player  in the supercomputer business, largely because it focused too much on building  the machines and neglected the all-important software that customers needed to  operate the powerful systems.  </P> <P> "The market wants a solution but ETA was delivering fast boxes," said Gary  Smaby, an analyst analyst with the Needham &amp; Co. brokerage firm in  Minneapolis. "That's a whole lot like building a racing yacht with only one  sail."  </P> <P> Analysts said a likely beneficiary of Control Data's pullout is International  Business Machines, which is actively developing its first supercomputer  technology. The computer giant is backing the efforts of supercomputer designer  Steve Chen's new venture, Scientific Systems Inc., to build an advanced  supercomputer and has other projects in the works as well.  </P> <P> Smaby said without Control Data, the U.S. government, which has been a major  customer for supercomputers, for the time being no longer has a domestic second  source for its purchases, a position that IBM could fill as soon as its  products are ready for market.  </P> <P> Control Data stock closed at $21.50, off 87.5 cents a share, in active trading  on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The company's chairman, Robert Price, said the restructuring would allow the  company to operate profitably for the remainder of the year and should set the  stage for sustained future growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SUPERCOMPUTER MARKET  </P> <P> Boxed Numbers are super computers installed worldwide but do not include those  being used by the manufacturers themselves. Dollar figures show estimated  factory revenue for 1988.  </P> <P> Cray Research (220), $613.4 million  </P> <P> NEC (22), $87.5 million  </P> <P> Hitachi (26), $33.0 million  </P> <P> Control Data/ETA Systems (58), $58.2 million  </P> <P> Fujitsu (83), $174.8 million  </P> <P> Source: Needham &amp; Co., Dataquest  </P></p>

The idea is to implement it once the Real Value Unit [URV] is  transformed into currency. This will only occur if the  government can substantially reduce inflation. The goal of the  new plan is to implement an income distribution policy during  President Franco's term in office.    The economic team's main concern expressed during a meeting  on 12 February was to ensure that none of the proposed measures  modify the current income distribution.    For the time being, the economic team does not want to touch  anyone's money. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso wants  it clearly understood that the income policy has been left for  another stage of the plan, thus avoiding the difficulties that  made previous plans fail.    The creation of the URV will not mean the workers will have  more money in their pockets. The economic team does not want  consumption to grow as this may entail problems of speculation  with stocks and shortages.    If the workers do not have more money at their disposal,  they  will not lose it either. That is why, at the 12 February  meeting, the economic team once again discussed the need to end  excessive price hikes and anticipated mark-ups that have taken  place in the last few months in some sectors.    The economic team believe by acting in this way they will  give credibility to the economic program. Following the  institution of the URV as currency -- which will take place  during the first half of this year -- the problem will be  preventing its "contamination" by the inflationary process  occurring in real cruzeiros. Once this is achieved, the new  program will speedily be implemented.    The centerpiece of this new program is, for the time being,  a  mandatory profit-sharing scheme.    Profit-sharing is contemplated in the Constitution and has  already been implemented by many companies, especially the  multinationals, and this may facilitate its acceptance by more  conservative businessmen.    Brazil has one of the highest income concentration ratios.  It has always been President Franco's objective to correct this  distortion and he has repeatedly said so to the economic team.  Franco believes the new economic program is of paramount  importance and must be implemented soon so that it can yield  results during his administration.</p>

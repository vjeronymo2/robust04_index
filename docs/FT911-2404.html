			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Spitfire bids fail to reach for the sky: Saleroom A SPITFIRE aircraft that saw active service in the Second World War was unsold at a Christie's auction yesterday. Bidding for the Mark IX aircraft, which shot down two enemy aircraft on one day in May 1944 over Italy, reached Pounds 720,000. The finely restored aircraft was built in 1943, and is one of only a score or so of surviving Spitfires likely to appear on the market. The aircraft was regarded as superbly restored and repainted. It was flown frequently last year during the Battle of Britain 50th anniversary celebrations - hence its pre-sale estimate of Pounds 750,000-Pounds 850,000. This estimate was well above the record Pounds 680,000 paid privately for a Spitfire. It is possible there will be a private sale after the auction. Christie's sale at the Science Museum at Wroughton, near Swindon, offered historic aircraft, engines and aviation memorabilia. Only two of the 13 aircraft on offer found buyers. One was a T31 powered glider, which sold for Pounds 1,650, and the other was a Dewoitine D514LP, a French prototype fighter of 1938, which made Pounds 55,000, well below its estimate although prototypes usually find their way into museums and rarely come up for sale. A full-sized replica of a de Havilland DH88 Comet, which was made last year in Australia for a TV film, and which can taxi but not fly, failed to sell at the auction but was later sold privately for Pounds 16,500. The collection of airship memorabilia acquired by Heinrich Kubis, who was chief steward in the Graf Zeppelin and who survived the destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937, sold for Pounds 35,508, three times Christie's estimate. The highest price in the group was the Pounds 5,500 paid by the London dealers J. Franks for the Graf Zeppelin logbook. On Sunday Sotheby's sold motorcycles and brought in almost Pounds 400,000, but with 30 per cent unsold. A 1927 Brough Superior 680cc solo motorcycle made the top price of Pounds 18,700.</p>

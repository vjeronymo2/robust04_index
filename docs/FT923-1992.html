			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Canadian power utility trims staff ONTARIO Hydro, North America's second-biggest power utility and one of the most active international borrowers, is to cut 2,000 jobs and pare capital spending amid growing public criticism over its economic management. The utility, which is owned by the Ontario provincial government, fuelled anger among business and individual consumers this week by announcing a 7.9 per cent rate increase for 1993 at a time when Canada's inflation rate is less than 2 per cent. Electricity rates went up by 11.8 per cent this year. The planned staff cuts amount to about 7 per cent of the total workforce. In addition, the utility is considering cutting its capital spending by about CDollars 10bn (USDollars 8.10bn) over the next 10 years, equal to about a quarter of its planned investment budget. The financial squeeze stems partly from the recession's impact on demand for electricity. But Hydro has also suffered heavy cost overruns on the CDollars 14bn Darlington nuclear power station, now in the process of being commissioned. The utility has said that rate increases could be limited to about 2 per cent if it was not burdened by Darlington and by the cost of repairing its other nuclear reactors. A growing number of municipalities and large commercial users are investigating construction of their own power generating facilities to provide cheaper electricity. Mr Marc Eliesen, the utility's chairman, earlier this week warned that siphoning revenues away from Hydro in this way might require even higher rate increases in future.</p>

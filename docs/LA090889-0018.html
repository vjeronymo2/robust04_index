			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITHOUT REFORM OF PRICES SOVIET ECONOMY CAN'T RISE  </P> <P> Those who believe that it is in the West's interests for Soviet economic  reforms to succeed have misdirected their attention.  </P> <P> They have proposed Western credits, direct investments, joint ventures,  technology transfer, most-favored-nation benefits and Soviet participation in  international economic organizations. But prospects for the success of  perestroika do not depend on these instruments. Success instead depends on  rapid price reform: moving speedily from reliance on administered prices toward  market-determined ones. With price reform -- and regardless of Western help --  Soviet resource allocations will improve and output, productivity and living  standards will rise. Without it, external help will be ineffectual.  </P> <P> Administered prices reflect "priorities" and "social needs," as judged by  central authorities -- ultimately, the criteria are political. Market prices  reflect the choices of users and the costs to producers -- ultimately, the  criteria are economic and technical. Administered prices frequently provide  perverse incentives that lead to surpluses in some fields, shortages in others,  waste of resources and deteriorating quality. These are the precise  characteristics of the Soviet economy. Few have described them more starkly  than Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself. Market prices, including  the prices of labor and capital, provide positive incentives that generally  lead to equalization of supply and demand (rather than shortages and  surpluses), improved product quality and more efficient use of resources.  </P> <P> These points about price reform and its effects are familiar and widely  accepted by such Soviet economists as Nikolai Shmelyev, Abel Aganbegyian,  Vasili Selyunin and others, no less than by most Western economists. The  problem, and the disagreement, that arises at this point concerns "how to get  there from here."  </P> <P> Specifically, there is a worry that severe inflation would be unleashed by a  recourse to market-determined prices. This worry is based on a misunderstanding  about the nature, causes and symptoms of inflation and its relation to price  reform. And this misunderstanding, in turn, obscures a readily available remedy  for the actual problems that rapid price reform would entail in a command  economy like that of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Inflation arises when there is an increasing quantity of money seeking to buy a  relatively fixed or reduced supply of goods. Inflation comes in two variations:  "demand-pull," in which an increase in money supply creates a gap between  monetary demand and the unchanged supply of goods and services, resulting in  price increases across-the-board; and "cost-push," in which nominal labor and  other production costs begin to rise without a corresponding increase in  productivity (and with an ensuing increase in the money supply to facilitate  the initial cost increases). Once again, the result is pervasive and  self-reinforcing price increases.  </P> <P> Neither of these conditions accurately describes the circumstances associated  with price reform in the Soviet Union. Moving from administered prices toward a  market system doesn't in itself imply or generate an increase in the money  supply, a diminished supply of goods or a rise in production costs. Hence,  inflation is not the real problem to be feared. In the transition from  administered to market prices, the real problem lies elsewhere.  </P> <P> Under the existing Soviet system of administered prices combined with rationing  of essential commodities, much of the currently earned income simply cannot be  spent because the supply of goods is deficient -- both in quantity and quality.  Hence, income that isn't spent accumulates as holdings of ruble cash or savings  deposits. As a result, total holdings of cash and savings deposits are three or  four times larger, in relation to Soviet gross national product, than the  corresponding holdings in the United States.  </P> <P> In some instances, accumulations held by individuals are extremely large,  having been amassed over many years. This presents a serious problem for an  abrupt shift to market-determined prices, because these holdings could become  active sources of monetary demand, boosting prices across the board, as well as  resulting in major changes in relative prices among different commodities.  </P> <P> The concern this creates is that, with the ensuing rise in market prices, the  existing supply of goods -- especially consumer goods -- would be commandeered  by holders of cash or deposits, resulting in distributional inequities, labor  unrest and political stress. To the extent this concern is warranted, an  effective remedy is readily at hand -- one that a command economy like that of  the Soviet Union is singularly well-equipped to apply.  </P> <P> The remedy lies in an immediate reform of the monetary system -- exchanging all  large holdings (say, above 5,000 rubles) for long-term (say, 10 to 15 years)  nontradable ruble bonds, and converting all small holdings of "old" rubles into  "new" rubles. Such a monetary reform would enable price reform to succeed by  sterilizing the bulk of the monetary overhang, allowing the market mechanism to  determine relative commodity prices and providing enterprises with clear  signals as to where and when to increase, decrease or terminate production.  </P> <P> Incidentally, this proposal carries no implication concerning the state's  continued production and provision of "socially necessary" output. Such  production by and for the state would simply entail costs determined by market  forces, would be purchased at market prices and would be financed by taxes or  other revenues and endorsed by the Congress of People's Deputies.  </P> <P> The success of perestroika need not wait for an indefinite future. It is  readily at hand if the Soviet leadership makes use of the state's power to move  rapidly toward effective price reform.  </P></p>

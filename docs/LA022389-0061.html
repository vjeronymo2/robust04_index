			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS CAGERS BATTLE FOR HOST HONORS IN CCAA  </P> <P> The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team can secure its playoff  future with a pair of victories this week.  </P> <P> Wins over visiting Cal State Bakersfield tonight at 7:30 and Cal Poly San Luis  Obispo on Saturday night at 8:05 will assure that the Toros will play host to  the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. postseason tournament March 4-5  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills (18-7) is tied with UC Riverside (21-4) for the CCAA lead at  10-2. If the conference race finishes in a tie, the tiebreaker would come down  to each team's record against Bakersfield, which is in third place. Riverside  lost at Bakersfield last week, so a pair of Toro wins over Bakersfield would  put the tournament in Carson. PAUL McLEOD  </P></p>

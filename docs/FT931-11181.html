			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Trade News: IMF puts terms for Moscow loan NEGOTIATIONS on a standby programme which could unlock an extra Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) International Monetary Fund loan could start as soon as Russia confirms it will take decisive action on macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reform, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said yesterday. He told Izvestiya newspaper that the world would 'not understand' if Moscow repeated what it did last year: agree an ambitious programme but not implement it. But he added that western financial support would only be forthcoming if Russia took action to strengthen monetary and financial policy. It would also have to take steps to ensure that 'the money stays in Russia and does not immediately end up in bank accounts in Zurich, Paris or London'. Mr Camdessus also called on the government to stop hyperinflation 'at any price', saying that many democrats around the world had been 'killed' by it. In a likely reference to the political backlash against the IMF in Russia last year, Mr Camdessus was also at pains to stress that any programme would have to suit not just the Fund, but would need to be trusted and accepted by Russian society. He said the west had delivered all the Dollars 24bn package promised to Russia last year except for a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund. Russia had received debt relief worth Dollars 7.2bn, plus Dollars 12.6bn fresh credit from other countries, the EC, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and finally a first Dollars 1bn from the Fund. Russian exports fell 25 per cent last year to Dollars 38.1bn in sales outside the former Soviet Union, the official Goskomstat statistics agency reported yesterday. The final results for 1992 crown a year which started with initial government hopes for an export boom, soon followed by an attempt by the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry to suggest that exports had stabilised to 1991's level.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / As They Say in Europe: Confused by the lessons of war - James Morgan asks if Bomber Harris would stamp out crime There was a fairly interesting editorial in the London Sunday Telegraph last week on the subject of crime and punishment, an Anglo-Saxon obsession these days. Its main thrust, if I understood it, was that in western societies the (criminal) enemy at home resembled the enemy abroad of past times, that is to say Germany. And enemies have to be severely punished, not understood. That was aimed at Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party, who once said he would be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. The Telegraph said the background to criminal behaviour should be a secondary matter of concern and concluded with a reference to 1914: 'Germany's illegalities then, as again in 1939, were defeated by force, not by inquiring into their causes.' This argument suggests bizarre conclusions and on this day, the 55th anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war, it is worth seeing what they are. Let us start with the Great War, which Le Monde celebrated all last month with a series of illuminating studies of lesser known aspects of that event. One of the last pieces was headlined, 'The army distressed by a beaten and shocked Germany.' It dealt with the reception given to the armies of the Kaiser on their return to the Fatherland in November 1918. The army believed it had not been beaten. The last message of the commander, Field Marshall Hindenburg, ran: 'Thanks to victorious attacks as well as determined defence we have been able to keep the enemy far from our borders. We have saved our country from terror and destruction.' The population disagreed and greeted the solders with hostility, which Le Monde called la fete refusee. The troops believed they had been sold out by traitors at home. Then came the Treaty of Versailles which, in another article, Le Monde called, 'The antechamber of the next catastrophe'. At Versailles, Germany was punished in a manner that would gladden the heart of a Sunday editorialist. She was found guilty in the dock of world opinion, lands were lost and huge fines imposed (which were not paid). To cut a long story short, Hitler played on the myth of the stolen victory and the stab in the back, launched the second world war and tried to murder the Jews whom he held responsible. These 'illegalities' eventually met with a firm response. The anniversaries of that action now flood the newspapers. But the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung celebrated the anniversary of the liberation of Paris in an unusual manner. One item started: 'In this year is there no end to the commemorations of the events of 50 years ago. They will continue until May 1995. Fifty years ago many in Europe experienced horror. 'In Germany it was above all the allied bombardment which the people had increasingly to suffer. Almost every day towns were the target of heavy attacks, some places were bombed again and again, for example Kiel with its harbours and U-Boat depots. Not only were military installations hit by the allied air fleets, but also, systematically, residential districts. What happened in one such attack is reflected here in the matter-of-fact words of the record kept in the war diary of a marine auxiliary on August 26 1944.' The report was a hair-raising account of nearly six hours of heavy bombing in which both sides suffered substantial losses. But, having read Le Monde just a day before, one was struck by a resounding fact: how different things were in 1945 from 1918. At the end of the second world war no German could think his country had been spared 'terror and destruction' nor could he think it had not been defeated. And Germany, as the FAZ implicitly pointed out, suffered a similar fate to that of its victims in the second war. One conclusion might be that we must all thank Lord 'Bomber' Harris for half a century of peace in western Europe. The controversial head of the Royal Air Force is regarded as a war criminal in some circles in Germany because it was he who implemented the policy of so-called carpet bombing of German cities. But one must recognise that Germany, where memories of the raids are as vivid as ever, has presented no threat to anybody for the first time in 100 years. And still does not today. That looks likes one up to the Sunday Telegraph. Yet there is another side to the story. After the second world war there was no Versailles. Germany, at least the western bit, was given a shiny new constitution and pots of money. No huge fines, no isolation from the community of nations, instead a willingness on the part of the victors to learn from their past mistakes. If there is a lesson in terms of domestic law enforcement in all this, which is doubtful, then it is a peculiar one. The police should be extravagantly violent in their pursuit of the criminal, but the judicial agencies must exercise extreme leniency in the imposition of penalties. In other words, in English terms, the accused should be beaten up in the remand cell before the trial and given an unconditional discharge after it.

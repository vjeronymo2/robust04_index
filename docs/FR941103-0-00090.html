			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 11:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program would divert scarce resources from NMFS Highly Migratory Species (HMS) program's more urgent needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data collection and analysis of any kind require an investment of program resources. For the HMS Division, the requirements of collecting the data and giving the specimens to the needy take no more effort than collecting the data and disposing of the specimens after the data are collected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS must address Executive Order 12898 to insure that minorities will not be adversely affected by mercury contamination of swordfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mercury is cumulative with size and age in swordfish. The Food and Drug Administration has set 1.0 parts per million (ppm) as the action level for methyl mercury in fish products. Swordfish at the minimum size and lower test in the 0.2 ppm to 0.6 ppm range. Based on available data, swordfish consumed through charitable programs will not result in a contamination problem. Additionally, NMFS will test for methyl mercury levels in donated swordfish each semester throughout the first year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This pilot program would take away any incentive for longline fishermen to reduce the incidence of juvenile swordfish being hooked and killed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The pilot program volunteers will encompass less than 3 percent of the longline fleet when fully in operation. Restrictions and requirements are included in the program to prevent any increase in juvenile swordfish mortality beyond what would have occurred without the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes From the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Changes in this final rule from the proposed rule include some operational changes. The responsibility for tagging donated fish now rests with the owner or operator of the volunteer vessel, and all donated fish must be tagged prior to offloading. Volunteer vessel owners or operators must notify NMFS enforcement 24 hours prior to landing and offloading the donated fish. NMFS plans in the first year of operation to place observers on all participating vessels. The number of vessels selected in the first year is not expected to exceed six vessels. Volunteer vessels who have been issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment may be excluded from the program. All unused tags must be accounted for by the vessels owners or operators. In addition to operational changes some minor changes were made in wording of the text to make the meaning of certain passages more clear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is published under the authority of the ATCA. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has preliminarily determined that this final rule is consistent with the recommendations of ICCAT and is necessary for management of the Atlantic swordfish fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule contains four new collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, specifically, application to participate in the donation program, 24-hour advance notice of landing donated swordfish, tagging and reporting of undersized fish for voluntary participants, and submission of bills of lading and landing receipts by Second Harvest headquarters to dealers and to NMFS. The public reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 10, 3, 2, and 15 minutes, respectively, per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Requests to collect this information have been approved by OMB (OMB Control number 0648&hyph;0277). This final rule also involves three collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act that have previously been approved by OMB, specifically, fishing vessel reports (OMB Control Number 0648&hyph;0016), dealer reports (OMB Control Number 0648&hyph;0013), and tagging requirements (OMB Control Number 0648&hyph;0247). The public reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 6, 30, and 2 minutes, respectively, per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, to NMFS or OMB (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 630  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Treaties.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles Karnella,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

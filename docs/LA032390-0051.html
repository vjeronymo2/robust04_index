			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> TIVOLI IN PACIFIC PALISADES: ITALIAN NEVER TASTED SO HEALTHY  </P> <P> "Mom," asked the young boy at the next table, "can I have a Diet Coke?"  </P> <P> His parents, dressed as if for a hike in the Rockies, beamed indulgently. We  were in Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> Basically, you'd have to call Tivoli Cafe a sort of Italian diner. It's a  crowded, brightly lit place with tiny tables where you pick your wine not by  poring through a printed list but by grabbing one of the bottles stacked around  the wall. But as the diet-conscious family was wearing the best quality hiking  gear, you'd have to call Tivoli a high-class Italian diner. Even a diet Italian  restaurant.  </P> <P> It starts out with very good bread, which could be expected, since the  proprietors' husbands own Il Forno in Santa Monica. The soup might be mushroom:  a pure, intense mushroom puree, with no cream. Or it might be corn with a  fragile hint of cilantro.  </P> <P> Tivoli's version of calamari is distinctive, the squid mixed with shrimp,  yellow and red sweet peppers, black olives and capers. The white bean salad is  a wholesome item that could certainly be recommended to the diet-conscious  hiking family: cold Italian white beans and tuna with basil, mild red onions  and vinaigrette. The vegetable plate is doubtless healthful: carrots, squashes  and a broiled tomato, not grilled as one might expect.  </P> <P> Mostly what's going on here, though, is pizzas, a long list that incidentally  includes a dietarily inspired model called the Ken: shiitake mushrooms and  tomato sauce, but no cheese. Whatever you order, you may get handed a sample.  The idea of a cheeseless pizza takes getting used to, but it's actually light  and enjoyable on its own terms.  </P> <P> The pizzas, all on tasty medium-thick dough, include most of the designer  favorites of recent years: "Popeye" (spinach and goat cheese), quattro  stagioni, quattro formaggio and so on. Several have local names. The Santa  Monica uses low-fat cheese; the Malibu is topped with quite smoky mozzarella  and lamb sausage; the Palisades is a very tasty model combining duck sausage,  dried tomatoes and sharp goat cheese.  </P> <P> The non-pizza entrees include some sandwiches, including a very satisfying lamb  sandwich on a crusty bun with lettuce, tomatoes and brown gravy. There are  always some specials as well, possibly whitefish with a slightly spicy sauce  consisting of chopped tomatoes, red bell peppers and a little bit of hot  pepper. The version of Dijon chicken comes in a somewhat peculiar sauce that  tastes slightly of mustard and strongly of chicken broth.  </P> <P> There's a cheesecake with a lot of integrity, and certainly a lot of cheese  flavor. As an alternative to the usual tartuffo ice cream dessert, there are  some fruit sherbets of impressive purity: just frozen fruit pulp, with no sugar  or dairy products. The papaya ice comes in a hollowed-out papaya, and tastes  pretty good for something so blamed healthful.  </P> <P> The best dessert, though, has no health excuse at all. It's the tirami su made  by the mother of one of the owners: ladyfingers soaked in espresso, mixed with  creamy sweetened mascarpone cheese and stacked like cordwood. It is one of the  most authoritative versions of tirami su around. No health excuse at all.  </P> <P> Madam, listen to me. Give your son a break. Just once, give him a little tirami  su. There'll be time enough for papaya ice.  </P> <P>  Tivoli Cafe, 15306 Sunset Blvd., Pacific Palisades. (213) 459-7685. Open for  lunch and dinner Monday through Saturday. Wine only. Street parking. MasterCard  and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $22-$48.  </P> <P> </P></p>

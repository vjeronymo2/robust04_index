It can also play a  role in ending the dissension between India and Pakistan.  Therefore, she wishes to improve relations with the United  States. She was addressing a news conference on Thursday in the  chamber of the National Assembly, and said that she had promised  the people that there will be no roll back [of the nuclear  program]. She said that bilateral talks with the United States  have started and the government was trying to resolve the  difference without any roll back. She said that pushing Pakistan  in the corner will not benefit anyone since Pakistan has already  presented a proposal for stopping proliferation of nuclear  weapons. However, India wants to reject this proposal  unilaterally. The prime minister said that the Pressler  amendment gave India a kind of veto power which is being using  unfairly against Pakistan. She said that the United States must  adopt an impartial stand if it wants to resolve the Kashmir  issue and end the nuclear weapons race in this sub-continent.  She said that we needed F-16 fighter planes badly in the past,  and still do, however, we are also investigating other fighter  planes that are more appropriate for Pakistan's defense. She  said that we will neither roll back [the nuclear program] nor  will we allow them to inspect our installations just for getting  F-16 fighter planes. She said that we are old allies of the  United States and understand why Pakistan is always pressured.  The prime minister said that Pakistan wants a regional agreement  to control nuclear weapons. She said that there was a  nation-wide agreement that we should not open our nuclear  installations for inspection, however, we will reconsider this  stand if India takes the initiative.    The talks with Pakistan and the United States over regional  problems and weapons are being held at a time when India has  openly disagreed with the United States, the U.S. Deputy  Secretary of State could not even meet with the Indian prime  minister, and the BBC has declared these talks a failure.  Meanwhile, the United States has threatened military action  against North Korea and has expressed its intentions to put  pressure on North Korea with the help of China and Japan. North  Korea has refused to accept U.S. conditions. India has also  adopted a similar attitude and has not shown any interest in the  proposals for stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The  coolness towards the U.S. proposals expressed in New Delhi is  heralding a new fearful situation in this region. Pakistan has a  well-known stand on nuclear non-proliferation and regional  problems. Still, there are fears that Pakistan might become a  prey of U.S. pressure. The situation demands that the United  States should have the same attitude towards India as it has  adopted about [North] Korea. This kind of arrogance and defiance  can endanger the safety of the whole region. It is true that the  United States can play an important role in establishing peace  and resolving issues in South Asia, however, U.S. interests and  preferences are also clearly written on the wall. Although the  government has shown a realistic attitude, we feel that there  are some sensitive issues involved in the present U.S.-Pakistan  talks. Political observers have special interest in seeing the  confrontation between India and Pakistan end, and the safety of  this region now depends on Pakistan-United States talks. This  will test our government's judgment, shrewdness, diplomatic  skills so that it is successful in explaining its side to the  United States. It is generally believed that the U.S. deputy  secretary of state has come here from Washington with a definite  plan which includes some undesirable proposals for Pakistan. The  prime minister has adopted a strong stand on closing the chapter  on Pakistan's concerns regarding F-16 planes and has respected  the nation's desires by refusing to compromise over the nuclear  program. The government's stand is appropriate that any  agreement in South Asia must be bilateral, and there is no use  of binding one country with restrictions imposed by the other  side.</p>

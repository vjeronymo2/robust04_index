			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] African National Congress leader Mr. Nelson Mandela  says he is still prepared to negotiate with right-wing  Afrikaners about their fears, but there will never be a homeland  -- not because the ANC is unsympathetic to the feelings of the  right wing, but because the organization is opposed to such an  idea in principle.    Mr. Mandela was speaking today at the eighth national  congress of the National Union of Mineworkers in Pretoria. He  said the ANC is not prepared to conduct discussions under  pressure from threats of violence.    [Begin Mandela recording in English] It is our task to  address the concerns of all our people, even those who regard us  as enemies. We are, therefore, prepared to sit down with the  leadership of the right wing in order to address these problems.  Our main problem is that the right wing really does not  understand the implications of their demands. If they come out  with a proposal which ensures that there will be movement  forward, we are still prepared to sit down with them. But we  are not going to continue for years discussing the same things  which we discussed last year. [end recording]</p>

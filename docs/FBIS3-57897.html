			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sudanese Ambassador to Britain 'Ali Muhammad </F> 'Uthman Yasin by Jon Snow; Snow in London, Yasin in New York;  from the Channel 4 newscast -- live]    [Text] [Snow] Ambassador, the British foreign secretary  said that your expulsion represents the end of the episode, is  he right?    [Yasin] Well, I'm happy about this, when the minister says  so, because this will stop any further deterioration of  relations between Sudan and Great Britain and everybody knows,  you know, the relationship is an old one and is a strong one.  We don't want the relationship to be affected by diplomats  being expelled here and there. It is a heritage and legacy of  long relationship, so I'm really happy that the gist of the  minister's speech will curb any further deterioration of  relations between my country and the United Kingdom.    [Snow] On the other hand, you must be unhappy that it needs  the expulsion of yourself and your British counterpart in the  first place.    [Yasin] Well I'm really sad for being expelled from the  United Kingdom because of the retaliation to what has been done  by my government, but it is known in international practice in a  situation like this, but I thought the British Government would  have thought otherwise by substituting Peter Streams with  somebody else.    [Snow] Let's get to the nub of this, because Peter Streams  is  accused of basically having hammered the human rights issue,  which very many people feel very strongly about. Not just  Britain but many other Western nations in particular, have  voiced their concerns, and surely that, at the end of it, has  made him an unpopular ambassador with you?    [Yasin] Well, in fact he was stressing human rights issues,  but he was very much exaggerating on issues which were only  based on heresay. You know, he doesn't have direct evidence to  condemn my government. He was just a good and observant  listener of people from the opposition and he was making  prejudgments in cases which could not be proved.    [Snow] Well, he was hardly a lone voice. The Amnesty  International has a list of cases of grave concern in Sudan and  of course the civil war itself is thrown up the most awful  realities of human rights abuse.    [Yasin] Well, I must tell you maybe some people are  exceeding  the polls here or there but it was under absolute control of my  government, and my government has opened the doors and all the  avenues for any person from outside to see for himself, and the  archbishop has been given the opportunity to see for himself the  tolerance and freedom for everybody to worship whatever religion  he chooses. The situation in Sudan is, we are not hiding  anything.    [Snow] Is there now a sense of regret that the Islamic  fundamentalism practices that the government indulged in up  until the last year or two have perhaps gone too far?    [Yasin] Well, I can't see any sort of fundamentalist  practices that would be reproached or blamed in Sudan; it is  just an allegation. Sudan is living in a very civilized  situation now. We are far better than any other country in the  continent of Africa or even the Middle East. If you can name  any country better than the Sudan now, I will admit to what you  have said.    [Snow] Ambassador, on that note, thank you very much.</p>

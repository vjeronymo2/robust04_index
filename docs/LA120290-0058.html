			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NEWS: $450,000 GRANT GIVEN TO HELP RECRUIT FACULTY  </P> <P> The James Irvine Foundation of San Francisco has awarded $450,000 to Pomona  College to establish a fund to help recruit and retain science faculty, the  school announced recently.  </P> <P> The grant will be used to help pay for laboratory costs for new faculty  members, and will also fund ongoing research at the Claremont institution.  </P> <P> "The competition among top research universities in California for the  brightest candidates is fierce," Pomona College President David Alexander said.  "This competition is especially acute in the sciences, where employment offers  can include laboratory start-up and research funds which often reach levels  that few, if any, undergraduate institutions can match."  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Mercedes in talks on bus group Kassbohrer, the loss-making German bus-maker, may shortly surrender its independence to Mercedes-Benz and Canada's Bombardier group. Mercedes said at the weekend the three companies had launched a feasibility study for a deal to secure Kassbohrer's future. The Daimler-Benz automotive arm is interested in the tour bus division, which this year plans to make 2,200 vehicles. Bombardier has an eye on the smaller, specialist 'piste-basher' business which makes equipment used to prepare ski slopes. Mercedes said in January it had no interest in the company, which lost DM56m (Dollars 32.7m) in 1992 and recorded an unspecified deficit last year. However, it now says it aims to save the Setra marque and factories at Ulm, Neu-Ulm and Ligny in France. Since Mercedes has an estimated 38 per cent share of German bus output, compared with Kassbohrer's 20 per cent, the competition issues raised suggest a joint venture rather than a takeover as the most likely solution. The start of the feasibility study could mark the end of a rocky phase for Kassbohrer, which this year was forced to ask its banks for fresh credit lines. It blamed the liquidity crisis on the the DM67m spent in 1993 to fund lay-offs and early retirement measures. As part of the conditions attached to the cash injection, the family owners are believed to have agreed to take on a partner with the necessary financial strength. Mr Heinz Ahrens, the chairman who had already agreed to quit at the end of last month, said at the time he had been pressing for such a solution for eight years. Mr Ahrens, who a year ago handled the disposal of the group's trailer and commercial vehicle divisions to Kogel Fahrzeugwerke, gave notice of his planned departure after he saw his job advertised in a newspaper last November. Recent reports suggest Mercedes and Bombardier might also be signing up a bank as a partner in any rescue venture.</p>

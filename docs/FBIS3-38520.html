			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Paul Goossens: "The Unanswered Question of </F> General Briquemont"]    [Excerpts] "This much is clear," European Commissioner  Karel Van Miert said last Saturday [29 January] at a SP  [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] study day on the European  Union. "The bungling in the former Yugoslavia cannot continue  much longer. The various member states will draw their own  conclusions and once again intervene on their own initiative.  There is a danger that the bad game of alliances will start  again." [passage omitted]    Claes undoubtedly agrees with Van Miert that things cannot  continue like they are in the former Yugoslavia. But the  question of how things should be done remains unanswered --  including by Claes. In the most recent issue of DOEN, the SP's  party journal, the minister is painfully clear on this issue.  "How should things go from here?" he wrote. "I have no precise  answer. There are few alternatives to what we have tried, and  what we are still trying: On the one hand, continuing to  provide the maximum amount of humanitarian aid possible , and on  the other hand bringing together the warring parties and trying  to reach a peaceful settlement." In short, Claes, who also  added that he has always opposed a military solution, does not  know what to do. Under the Belgian presidency, he tried with  great persistence to make something of the European recipe for  Yugoslavia. Despite his efforts, the attempt was a complete  failure. There was a great deal of talking, and cease-fires and  Christmas cease-fires were agreed upon, but, as in the past,  they held up for at most a couple of hours. The only, very  relative success of 1993 was that a blazing row did not break  out between Europe and the United States. Clinton, who as  presidential candidate dreamed for a time of air strikes, under  heavy European pressure gave up the idea. Since then the U.S.  Government's interest in the conflict has chiefly declined.    Clinton won the U.S. elections with a domestic program, and  he is sticking to that consistently. In his State of the Union  address last week there was no doubt that domestic affairs are  the most important ones. There is not much leadership coming  from the United States, except in the economic field. The  Clinton Administration played an active role in the GATT  negotiations: It took initiatives and was very active, on the  audiovisual question among others. Ultimately that is so much  more specific, especially in terms of jobs, than a risky peace  operation in Bosnia. The Americans, certainly the Clinton  generation, are a long way from forgetting Vietnam. Troops are  only sent abroad for blitz operations, like in Panama and the  Gulf. The Somalia experience has strengthened the convictions  of the Washington war lords and political strategists that this  approach should not be changed for the time being. If order has  to be restored in the South and a long-term military presence  becomes necessary, then this job should be contracted out to  "third parties" -- if necessary to Belgians, but just as well to  "legions" from Pakistan, India or former Third World countries.    It is a new situation for Europe. During the Cold War it  got used to energetic leadership from the United States, which  took the initiative continually. That was not always equally  pleasant or nice for the European allies, because it was  frequently bad for the European ego but it was comfortable. All  that was required was to stand in line and carry out what had  been thought up in the Pentagon or State Department. Now things  are happening differently. In contrast to the past, the United  States is letting Europe take initiatives itself. In fact if  there are problems in the Balkans, Europe's backyard, then the  United States expects Europe, the economic great power, to clear  things up. Washington will watch, but in contrast to the past,  it no longer wants to organize everything unilaterally. The  heaviest burden is now on Europe's shoulders. Partly as a  result of the changed world situation and the end of the  partition of Europe, the Union now has to deal with it. Up to  now it has not proved capable of doing so. As long as the  Maastricht Treaty had not been ratified, it could still be  argued that the Union did not have the instruments to conduct  efficient foreign policies. In the meantime it has been  possible to observe empirically that this explanation does not  hold true. Maastricht is now operational, and the indecision was  not reduced but has, on the contrary, increased.    For the United States, and the United Kingdom too, the  Balkans remain an insignificant piece of land of little  strategic importance. The area contains no useful raw materials  and does not lie on the major sea lanes. Therefore its  importance is very relative. Continental Europe should know  better. For centuries the Balkans have been the continent's  weak underbelly and if there is grumbling there, the entire  European Constitution is undermined. That was once again proved  at the start of this century when a Serbian nationalist's  bullets caused the start of World War One. Nevertheless, the  European leaders have assessed the disintegration of Yugoslavia  wrongly, and above all they have underestimated it. It was  catalogued as a regional conflict which did require some  attention but did not in the least require inclusion in  "intensive care." Wasn't it Marx who said that history never  repeated itself, unless as a caricature? Therefore Sarajevo  could never start a new world war. The end of the Soviet Union  and the unanimity in the Security Council were other good  reasons to not take the events in Bosnia too dramatically. This  time the fire could not threaten the neighboring properties.    This view remains, although little is left of the  self-assurance of two years ago. "There is a very real risk of  the conflict spreading, of so-called internationalization,"  Claes said. In recent days that risk has increased strongly.  The prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan are shortly to visit  Bosnia, where there is something like an Islamic International.  The fact that the Muslims are now better armed and able to  adopt a more offensive attitude than a few months ago is not  unrelated to this. And Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and the Russian  nationalists have rediscovered the Serbs and will not permit any  air strikes against their traditional ally. Daily the conflict  is becoming less local, and more and more foreign powers are  starting to get actively involved. Europe itself is not capable  of making a coherent initiative. If the Germans, British, and  French are not on different wave lengths, they are emphasizing  different things. In any event that is the case with the  present holder of the European presidency, Greece. Long before  the European Union existed, this country chose its camp. Like  the Russians, they are unconditionally on the side of the Serbs.  Then, there is the question which General Briquemont formulated  so urgently. "How is it possible that Europe, with 300 million  inhabitants, is not capable of sending 40,000 troops to Bosnia?"  According to Briquemont the move is absolutely necessary, in so  far as the logic of peace and negotiations is followed.  Briquemont left Sarajevo because his question was not answered.  And the longer the United Nations and Europe continue to leave  Briquemont's question unanswered, the greater the chance becomes  that this Balkan conflict will in the end also become  unmanageable.</p>

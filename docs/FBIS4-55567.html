			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(mh)": "The Democratic Union: We Reject the </F> Opposition's Attempt To Discredit Parliament"]    [Text] Bratislava--In connection with the merger process,  it is impossible to specify the exact number of members of the  Democratic Union of Slovakia (DU), said DU First Deputy Chairman  M. Knazko, following the party's Republican Council session on 7  May. He explained that DU has representatives throughout  Slovakia, apart from in four districts. "I am convinced that we  will not struggle to enter the parliament," he added in  connection with the prognosis for electoral preferences. He  rejected the possibility of discussing open lists of candidates  in the case of DU; nevertheless, he did admit to negotiations on  a preelection coalition, but not until after the publication of  the June public opinion poll. The DU Republican Council  endorsed J. Kosta as the head of its election team. He is a  sociologist and an external adviser to the prime minister.    In their resolution, the members of the Republican Council  expressed their distaste at the attempts by the current  opposition to discredit the parliament by vulgarizing their  parliamentary appearances. The attempts to scandalize  government members are nothing other than a well-thought-out  tactic aimed at deliberately detracting attention from the  parliament's routine work and, subsequently, at destabilizing  the situation in the National Council of the Slovak Republic,  states the resolution.    DU Deputy Chairman V. Vaskovic said that, at the moment,  there is no specific view about the amount of property that  should be included in the second wave of privatization.  According to him, it is important to reach an agreement on the  philosophy of the privatization process; however, in no way  should the volume of coupon privatization decline below  one-third of the overall volume of privatized property.    In connection with the withdrawal of the trade unionists  from  the General Agreement, DU Deputy Chairman R. Kovac described as  crucial the fact that social conciliation has not been  endangered. He discounted the possibility that the trade  unionists will increase the pressure on the government, for  example, by strike action because they realize that such a  course would not resolve the issue. The DU Republican Council  approved a change in the party's logo from the original DEUS to  the new DU. Kovac justified the change by revealing the  reservations expressed by linguists and heraldists.</p>

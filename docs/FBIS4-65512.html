			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Clinton Sends Berlusconi Best </F> Wishes"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 13 -- United States President Bill  Clinton has sent a letter of congratulations and best wishes to  Italy's new Premier Silvio Berlusconi on the formation of the  new government. The letter was delivered to Berlusconi Friday  evening [13 May] by the American ambassador to Rome, Reginald  Bartholomew, and in it Clinton wished Italy every success in the  renewal process underway in the country.    The U.S. President said he was looking forward to working in  close contact with the Italian head of government to further  strengthen the strong bilateral partnership that exists between  the two countries.    Clinton recalled that he would be meeting with Berlusconi in  Rome next month and again in Naples in July during the Group of  Seven summit there. These encounters will offer excellent  opportunities to develop that cooperation aimed at enlarging the  democratic community, at spurring world economic growth and at  promoting collective security, the message added.    During his meeting with Bartholomew, Berlusconi confirmed  the  intention of his government to work to strengthen civic society  and political democracy in Italy. He urged that his government  be judged on its actions and concrete results.    The premier also noted that the important international  appointments in the offing will afford an opportunity for him  and Clinton to take a deeper look at the many topics of mutual  interest to them, also with a view to strengthening the firm  partnership that already exists between Italy and the United  States.    Foreign Minister Antonio Martino, who was present at the  Bartholomew-Berlusconi encounter, will be going to Washington  the last week in May to prepare for Clinton's Rome visit.</p>

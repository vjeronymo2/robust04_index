			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Networking Europe Europe cannot afford to be left behind in the construction of fibre-optic grids, or in the development of inter-active services to run over them. The report of the EU's industry group on the Information Society, chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, must offer a clear framework of policy and regulation to promote both goals. From the summary of its recommendations published this week, the group appears to be leading in the right direction. But it has left crucial questions unanswered - notably the regulatory framework for competition in service provision, and the protection of intellectual property. Most of the principles for action laid down by the group are laudable. It places the onus for the construction of 'superhighways' on the private sector, and urges that state telecommunications operators be freed from 'non-commercial political burdens' - notably the duty to act as tax collectors for their national governments. The group coyly urges 'practical measures' with 'clear timetables' to achieve this. The best measures are, in fact, privatisation and the separation of the regulatory function from national operators and their sponsoring government departments. These are proceeding painfully slowly across most of the EU. The report is also right to call for greater harmonisation of equipment standards and acceleration of the pace of telecoms liberalisation. On formal occasions the Commission continues to pay lip service to the 1998 deadline for 'voice' telecoms liberalisation agreed by EU ministers last June. Effective policing In practice, that timescale is being progressively eroded: multinationals are being encouraged to contract with single operators to provide pan-European 'private' networks; the Commission is toying with further deregulation of the cable industry; and operators in the corporate sector are discovering numerous ways to evade existing restrictions. If competition is to flourish, the former monopolists will require effective policing. Even in the UK, whose government has made competition the cornerstone of its telecoms policy, British Telecommunications commands nearly 90 per cent of the market 10 years after the abolition of its monopoly. Without a regulator to attend to the critical nuts and bolts of competition, notably the terms under which rivals inter-connect to BT's national network, BT would be more dominant still. In EU states with governments less ardently committed to competition, fair access to national telecoms networks is unlikely to be secured without external leverage. The Bangemann group ducked the issue: 'an authority should be established at European level whose terms of reference will require prompt attention', it noted. Independent agency What 'authority'? A highly legalistic and bureaucratic Federal Communications Commission on the US model is not an attractive proposition. Yet, with all due respect to subsidiarity, a college of national regulators  -the other extreme - is unlikely to be adequate to the task. An independent EU agency is essential. Whether it takes the form of a free-standing agency, or is integrated within the Commission's existing competition directorate, is an issue which needs to be resolved soon. Whatever its form, the agency's terms of reference should include a duty to promote access to national networks, on terms consistent with efficient competition. It might also be desirable to give it power to increase the downward pressure on Europe's damagingly high cross-border telecoms tariffs, the aim being equality with tariffs for similar internal traffic. On intellectual property, the paper says EU-wide protection must have a 'high priority' and 'rise to the challenge of globalisation'. Its diffidence in this field is more understandable, given the complexity of the issues at stake. It is important, however, that resolving them does not delay progress towards telecoms liberalisation and the extension of fibre-optics into local networks. For the benefits of competition and fibre networks apply as much to existing telecoms services as to the new information and inter-active products, where protecting intellectual property is essential. In setting its eyes on the multi-media horizon, Europe must not stumble over the immediate steps ahead.</p>

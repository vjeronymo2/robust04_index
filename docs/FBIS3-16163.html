			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of </F> Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), by Vasil Popov; place and date  not given: "Every Intelligent Person Knew About the Amnesty"]    [Text] [Popov] How do you explain the surprise of certain  politicians and statesmen after the adoption of the decree on  the political amnesty?    [Shakhray] Every intelligent person in Russia knew already  on 12 December -- the first day after the elections -- that  there would be a decree on amnesty in Russia. The text was  discussed several times. Representatives of the presidential  administration attended the meeting at which the last variant  was discussed. Therefore, President Boris Yeltsin knew  precisely about the text and the attitude of the parliamentary  forces. The 18 affirmative votes of the PRES could not change  anything. The reaction and confusion show that, as before, at  the federal level, there is no coordination between the  president, the government, and the prosecution.    [Popov] Do you think that the amnesty would also have been  adopted had it been outside the package of documents?    [Shakhray] Without any doubt. This amnesty was not a goal  in itself, but a step toward civic peace. However, I would like  to draw your attention precisely to the package of documents. I  do not understand why people only speak about the amnesty  decree. First of all, there is the memorandum. On the basis of  this memorandum, political forces must sit together, negotiate,  and reach certain agreements about accord, which will guarantee  that those who have been released will not provoke civic  clashes. Then, there are certain judicial guarantees that sound  as a warning, namely, that each of the released could be  imprisoned again. Only afterward were they allowed to leave  their cells. However, even in itself, the political amnesty is  an element of civic peace. We bear responsibility for our  decisions and for not allowing any bloodshed.    [Popov] Your party congress has just ended. How do you view  your place in political life and your party's influence?    [Shakhray] We are one of the five leading parties and  perhaps even more than that. We are trying to construct an  all-national party. We have 64 active regional organizations  and several dozen are in the process of registration. This is a  conservative party based on traditional values -- the state,  family, property, and morality.    Our formula for Russia's renewal contains a socially  oriented  market economy, federalism, and local self-government. Our main  task is not only to represent the regions in the federation  center but also to influence the formation and implementation of  all-state interests.    [Popov] Do you expect a reshaping of the Russian political  space and what direction will this take?    [Shakhray] We think that two or three all-national parties  are needed, and one of them is our party, which represents a  conservative regional idea. Sooner or later, an all-national  social democratic party will emerge. It could have various  names, but its prospects are promising. It is more difficult to  speak about the third party because Zhirinovskiy already uses a  popular name for his party [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia].  However, conservative, social-democratic, and liberal ideas  will crystallize in the form of three major parties. The  emergence of those three economic and political currents depends  to a large degree on election legislation. If the percentage  barrier is raised, such blocs will emerge sooner. In any event,  elections remain the only way for these parties to emerge.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Bosnia must be saved THROUGHOUT THE civil war in Croatia, the central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina managed to stay on the side-lines. It was not easy. Whenever federal units withdrew from Croatia, they were transferred to Bosnia. As a result, this ethnically mixed republic of Moslems, Serbs and Croats has one of Europe's largest armies stationed on its territory. Moreover, this army is perceived as an ally of Serbia, and could be called upon to fight on the side of the Serbs if Bosnia's turn for full-scale civil war, far bloodier than that in Croatia, cannot be avoided. In addition, the governments of Croatia and Serbia have repeatedly said parts of Bosnia should be annexed to their respective republics. If both claims were satisfied, little or no territory would be left for the Moslems, the largest ethnic group, who make up 43 per cent of the population. Fears of such a partition or civil war have prompted the Bosnian government to adopt three measures. It has assured all citizens of the republic that their ethnic, cultural and political rights will be respected. It has guaranteed that the army will be housed and paid. And, on the recommendation of the European Community, it held a referendum on independence last weekend. The hope was that the outcome of the referendum would finally establish the republic's status, and bring stability. Alas, not so. Serbs' boycott The Serbs - one third of the population - boycotted the referendum, contesting the right of the other two communities to split them from their cousins in Serbia and force them to join a new state. For their part, Moslems and Croats overwhelmingly voted for independence. Once the result was known, armed Serbs threw up barricades around Sarajevo, the capital. Several people were killed. In the north of the republic, where Serbs have established an autonomous region, Croats and Serbs have already been fighting each other. Rather than risk plunging the republic into civil war, the Bosnian government earlier this week made some concessions to the Serbs, promising them more access to the media and more representation in the police. But it also appealed to the EC again for recognition. The EC is faced with a difficult choice. If it recognises the new state it may fire the starting-gun for civil war, since Serb leaders have said they will fight rather than live in an independent Bosnia. But if it delays recognition, it will be perceived as yielding to Serbian intimidation. More worrying, delay is likely to radicalise the Moslems, and encourage nationalist Croats to seek unity with Croatia. Territorial integrity Independence for Bosnia will be meaningless unless the territorial integrity of the republic can be guaranteed. Therefore the EC, if it goes ahead with recognition, must serve notice that it will not countenance claims on Bosnian territory by either Croatia or Serbia. And it must send a clear warning to Serbia that the Bosnian Serbs should not be encouraged, still less materially aided, in any attempt to thwart by force the expressed wish of the majority of the republic's citizens. It should be clear to Serbia's leaders that interference in Bosnia will delay the lifting of EC sanctions against Serbia. The EC peace conference on Yugoslavia has already set up a committee aimed at reaching consensus among all the ethnic groups in Bosnia. This should be convened immediately with the aim of assuring the republic's Serbs that they will not face any discrimination, and of trying to stop the violence. Meanwhile, the UN peacekeeping troops should be sent as soon as possible to Sarajevo, which has been designated as their headquarters. Although their mandate is to keep the peace in Croatia, their presence in Bosnia should help to discourage violence there. Serbia must realise that escalating the tension in Bosnia will only delay the deployment of UN troops to protect the Serbs in Croatia. In short, the UN as peace-keeper and the EC as peacemaker must continue to work in parallel. The barricades in Sarajevo should not deter either from acting quickly.</p>

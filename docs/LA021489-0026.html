			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK STAFFING;  </P> <P> AIRPORT BOOSTS SECURITY AFTER NEWS REPORT  </P> <P> Airlines using Burbank Airport will increase security staffing for about 30  minutes a night in response to a television news report that charged a loophole  in security procedures could be used by a plane hijacker.  </P> <P> In a report Monday night, KNBC-TV maintained that there was a dangerous  security lapse because the screening stations, where metal detectors scan  passengers for weapons, have not been staffed after the last outgoing flight  departed about 9:40 each night.  </P> <P> People entering the terminal could go to the boarding area without being  screened to meet any of several flights that arrive before the airport ceases  operations about 10 p.m.  </P> <P> An airline security committee voted Monday afternoon to increase security after  the station gave airport officials an advance look at its videotape. Metal  detectors will be staffed until the last passenger has left the building, said  Michael Kean, customer service manager for Alaska Airlines and chairman of the  committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lock Access to Runway  </P> <P> Before leaving, metal detector personnel will lock the access to the runway in  the USAir terminal and the corridor leading to the boarding areas in the main  terminal, Kean said.  </P> <P> Under Federal Aviation Administration rules, the airport is responsible for  providing police officers, but the eight airlines that use it are responsible  for operation of the metal-screening checkpoint, airport spokesman Victor Gill  said. Airport police remain on duty all night, Gill said.  </P> <P> The KNBC-TV report showed one of the station's cameramen setting off the metal  detector's alarm with a hidden camera in a large shoulder bag and walking on  unchallenged because the metal-detector workers had gone.  </P> <P> The station suggested that the bag was large enough for weapons and that a  hijacker could enter the boarding area, force his way onto the airfield and  board a jetliner after it landed. It might also be possible, the report  suggested, to hide a weapon in the boarding area to be retrieved before getting  onto a plane the next day.  </P> <P> The airport and the airlines were in compliance with FAA requirements, "which  focus on screening boarding passengers," Gill said. Kean said the airport's  security system "went through a two-week FAA inspection in December and we  passed with flying colors."  </P> <P> "We don't agree that the security of the system was compromised," Gill said. He  and Kean charged that the TV station did not report that its crews had been  stopped twice -- once by airport police and once by an airline employee --  while making the videotape, which purported to show that they entered the  secure area unchallenged.  </P> <P> KNBC-TV news director Tom Capra disagreed. He said the airline employee merely  "waved at" the crew, "like waving hello," and that the crew members were not  questioned by airport police until after they had completed two nights of  filming and had left the terminal.  </P></p>

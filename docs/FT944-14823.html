			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Jump in housing starts fuels inflation fear A sharp rise in US housing starts and evidence of higher personal incomes yesterday reawakened market fears of higher interest rates. Housing construction returned to the high levels of last year with a 4.4 per cent jump in September to 1.53m units, and personal income rose by 1.9 per cent in the second quarter, a yearly rate of 7.7 per cent. Jobless claims for the week ending October 15 fell by 3,000 to 326,000. Merrill Lynch said the job market remained healthy, but it expected increases in employment to slow during the fourth quarter. The figures came the day after US trade figures for August showed a narrowing of the trade deficit, and record exports of almost Dollars 60bn. This good news for the 'Main Street' economy alarmed the bond market and revived expectations of further tightening by the Federal Reserve after the November 8 mid-term elections. Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, tried to discourage inflation fears. Although housing activity has returned to the high levels of last year, he said, 'this, in conjunction with moderate September increases in consumer and producer prices, is further evidence that the economy will continue to expand in the near term with no significant increase in inflation.' Economists had expected a decline in housing starts. Even more surprising was a 6.5 per cent increase in recorded building permits in September, a third consecutive monthly advance. It indicates future strength in the sector. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said mortgage rates averaged 8.68 per cent in September, up from 6.74 per cent a year earlier. The higher rates had been curbing construction, but some economists believe that these are being countered by growing employment and income, and expectations of further rises. The rebound in housing was led by construction of single family homes. Building increased in the midwest and west, while slowing in the south and the north-east. Although starts have fallen since last December, the total for the first nine months of this year is almost 16 per cent higher than in 1993.</p>

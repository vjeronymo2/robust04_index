			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow dips slightly on bad jobs data Wall Street US SHARE PRICES fell yesterday in the wake of an unexpectedly bad August employment report. The markets' decline, however, would have been worse but for an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and a big fall in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.27 at 3,281.93. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down 0.89 at 417.09. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.44 to 573.44, and the Amex composite 0.25 to 384.85, although trading on the American Stock Exchange was disrupted for most of the day by a fire in a neighbouring building. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 126m shares because of the Labor Day weekend. Trading opened amid difficult conditions. At 8.30am the Labor department reported August non-farm payrolls had declined by 83,000, a figure that shocked the market, which had been expecting a substantial rise in payrolls. The fall would have been 100,000 larger but for the impact of a Federally funded summer jobs programme. The jobs data triggered heavy selling of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, sending the US currency more than two pfennigs lower against the Deutschmark to just below DM1.40. Despite the bad employment news and the dollar's fall, stocks opened broadly unchanged, helped by expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates and by a big fall in bond yields. The Fed did eventually cut interest rates just before noon, but not by much  -it lowered the fed funds target from 3 1/4 per cent to 3 per cent. Although the move was welcome, it was not the fully-fledged discount rate cut that the market had hoped for. Among individual stocks, selected banks were steady or higher on hopes of lower interest rates. Chemical rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 33 1/4 , JP Morgan added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 60 1/4 , Banc One put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 , Bankers Trust rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62 1/4 , and Chase Manhattan was unchanged at Dollars 22 3/4 . The main exception to the trend was Citicorp, down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 16 3/8 and still troubled by the revelations earlier this week that regulators had severely criticised the bank for poor management and supervision of its mortgage operations. USX-Marathon, the energy subsidiary of USX-Steel group, fell Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 18 1/8 in heavy trading after Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the broking house, lowered its investment rating for the stock to 'neutral' from 'long-term buy', citing a belief that second-half earnings will be pressured by the closure of a refinery and speculation that the company's annual dividend may be cut. Canada TORONTO finished the last trading day of the summer session with typically somnolent activity, but it is expected to pick up after the Labour Day weekend. The TSE closed up 3.13 points to 3,456.37 on active volume of 32.2m shares. Advances led declines by 311 to 241 and transactions were valued at CDollars 267.6m.</p>

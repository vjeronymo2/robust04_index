Ten Questions to the 14th Army Commander"]    [Text] The person of Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed,  commander of the 14th Russian Army, has long attracted  attention. The year before last, largely thanks to his efforts,  the war between Moldova and the Dniester Region was halted.  People on the left bank of the Dniester literally idolized  Lebed. But now Dniester Region newspapers have started to  become full of materials depicting the former hero almost as the  main opponent of the unrecognized republic.    [Knyazkov] Love is one step away from hatred, is it not,  Aleksandr Ivanovich?    [Lebed] The situation in the Dniester Region is complex. I  would say it is an impasse situation on many counts. The  political impasse comes from the participation of  representatives of the DMR [Dniester Moldovan Republic] in last  October's events in Moscow and the passing of the death sentence  on the Ilascu group. It is an open secret that Ilascu is a  scoundrel. But the death sentence was passed on him against a  background of protests from the United Nations, the CSCE,  Amnesty International, Russia, the United States, and Britain.  Appeals by the Pope and by Aleksiy II were ignored.... Thus,  the political isolation of the unrecognized republic was  exacerbated.    The economic impasse.... National currencies, at the very  least, have been introduced everywhere, and here they have  decided to go "their own" way: Onto old Soviet money they have  stuck stamps with a picture of Suvorov, and they say that this  is a local currency with a certain degree of protection. But in  my view this is not money but trash, and even if your pockets  are full of it it is not used anywhere but in this region. It  is, of course, primarily the ordinary people who suffer as a  result. Pensioners receive 14,000 local rubles a month (1,000  Russian rubles are equivalent to 4,500-5,000 "Suvorovs"). For  comparison, 1 kg of beef costs 35,000 "local" rubles in the  market. In short, the situation in the Republic is serious.    [Knyazkov] Why, after all, have your relations with the  Tiraspol leadership become aggravated?    [Lebed] I would not say that our relations are entirely bad,  although you could not call them good either. How can they not  be strained if there is one provocation after another in respect  of the Army and its commander? On 13-14 January, for example,  leaflets were pasted up in the city of Tiraspol calling Lebed  "the Judas of the Dniester Region, preparing a military coup."  Next, incidentally, the newspaper PRAVDA specified the date of  the military coup -- 15 January -- and published a report  claiming that leaflets calling for the overthrow of DMR  President Smirnov had been pasted up all over Tiraspol. On 15  January I was holding a surgery on personal questions, and I  received 62 people. No soldier was sitting there in a  bulletproof vest, and they were all engaged according to the  combat training plan. I have not contemplated and do not  contemplate any military coups, if only because of a number of  very simple considerations. The DMR was created by the will of  the people who live here on the basis of the decisions of the  second congress of deputies at all levels. For me, the will of  the people who live here is the supreme form of legitimacy of  the adopted decisions. The people have a right to reelect their  leaders, but I have nothing to do with this. I am the commander  of the 14th Russian Army, I am a Russian general!    [Knyazkov] The impression is gained that it is  advantageous to someone to remove you from the Dniester Region.    [Lebed] You are right. Flexible and soft generals, who are  inclined to make total compromises, are convenient for appanage  principalities, which is what the DMR is now. I do not count  myself as one of these and, naturally, I am unwelcome with some  people.    [Knyazkov] What about the Army Military Council's 8 February  statement, which says that in the event of a large-scale armed  provocation in the Dniester Region the Army reserves the right  to cool hotheads on both banks of the Dniester? The Moldovan  Foreign Ministry viewed that as gross interference in the  Republic's internal affairs....    [Lebed] I cannot gainsay Moldova's right to make just such  an assessment of the statement by the 14th Army's Military  Council. But account must be taken of the fact that I monitor  carefully the development of the situation. On the eve of the  parliamentary elections in Moldova the situation was tense. I  had been seeking and, it seems to me, I found quite a successful  way out, if I defused the situation with the help of that  statement.    [Knyazkov] The fact that, according to your words, passions  subsided somewhat on both banks of the Dniester following the  statement by the 14th Army's Military Council attests not only  to the timeliness of that document but also to a real force  whose opinion Chisinau and Tiraspol politicians are obliged to  take into account. What kind of a force is this -- your army,  Aleksandr Ivanovich?    [Lebed] The Army's personnel complement stands at 85.4  percent -- very high for these times. I had been planning over  the next four-six weeks to attain a level of 94-96 percent, but  we were obliged to suspend the recruitment of contract  servicemen owing to a lack of clarity with the military budget.  But even what we do have is quite sufficient. Visit a training  ground and see for yourself how the guardsmen drive and fire.  Last year we took examinations on Russian training grounds, and  nobody got less than a "good," although they were operating on  unfamiliar terrain.    [Knyazkov] From where do the Army's reinforcements come?    [Lebed] I recruit only volunteers. There are volunteers  from Russia. There are, let us put it this way, local draftees,  but it is necessary to understand the situation in respect of  them. Some 80,000 Soviet Army pensioners and approximately  17,000 national economic specialists, who at various times,  after graduating from corresponding higher educational  institutions, were sent here to work and took up permanent  residence here, live on the territory of Tiraspol alone. They  have children and grandchildren, and the majority of these  youths have no wish to go and serve in the Dniester Army, still  less the Moldovan Army. Where are they to go? They come to me.  Each of the volunteers signs a corresponding document  confirming that he considers himself a citizen of Russia and  pledges to take an oath to the Russian Army and to obey Russian  laws. This document is inserted in his personal file. But I  emphasize once again that only volunteers serve in the 14th Army!    [Knyazkov] But what idea rallies the Russian servicemen in  the Dniester Region?    [Lebed] A patriotic, power idea! But the power itself must  also meet its defenders halfway. We do not need a great deal,  we are undemanding. But a person must serve and feel the power  behind him even at a "down-to-earth level." An officer must  have an apartment and pay that which enables him to keep his  family and not eke out a miserable existence. Then his children  will not fall ill, and his wife will not "nag" him -- then he  will devote all his strength to service.    [Knyazkov] A question in regards to this: How are the  social problems of officers discharged to the reserve being  resolved in the Army?    [Lebed] It cannot be said that everything has been done, but  we are tackling housing construction with the utmost intensity.  I will not hide the fact that we have scored some successes.  Precisely 222 apartments have already been constructed in  Rybinsk, Rostov, Smolensk, Kostroma, Lobnya, Zelenograd, Tula,  Penza, Voronezh, and Berdsk. Pensioners are actively moving in.  If there is prompt funding, then in 1994 we will attain the  target of 904 apartments. These will be in the cities of  Krasnodar, Novorossiysk, Anapa, Engels, Saratov, Belgorod, and  Vyatskiye Polyany. I will not hide the fact that the process is  proceeding as planned, and all the contracts have been  concluded. They are meeting us halfway, and I am endeavoring  not to let them down. The supreme principle in the Army is that  not one officer or ensign will be discharged into the reserve  until he has received housing.    [Knyazkov] How do you see the prospects for the 14th Army  today?    [Lebed] As is known, the leadership of the Republic of  Moldova unequivocally advocates the Army's withdrawal from its  territory, but the situation is highly complex. The point is  that it is now impossible, in my view, to withdraw the Army.  There are very many reasons, starting with the fact that there  is still no political solution to the past bloody conflict  between Moldova and the Dniester Region -- accordingly, there  are no guarantees of peace and stability in this region. The  possibility of a relapse into hostilities has not been exhausted  -- people are simply afraid. They see the 14th Army as the  guarantor of peace and stability, capable of preventing war or,  if war is nonetheless unleashed, of halting bloodshed.  Therefore, the Army's withdrawal must be preceded by a very  long, delicate, and wise political process, which,  unfortunately, has not yet begun. But it is possible and  necessary to speak of reorganizing the Army. Following the  breakup of the unified Union Army, many units of central and  district subordination became subordinate to me. Some of them  are simply not needed. Therefore, great reorganization awaits  the 14th Army.    [Knyazkov] To conclude our conversation: What would you  like to wish your fellow servicemen and, of course, yourself?    [Lebed] There is nothing more terrible than a general who  has not fought. Generals who have not fought and particularly,  politicians who have not smelled gunpowder, unleash all kinds of  conflicts with uncommon ease in the hope of some ephemeral  victory. There are quite a few such conflicts on the territory  of the former Soviet Union now, but there will be and there can  be no victors in them. Armenians have been fighting  Azerbaijanis for umpteen years and have thereby set back their  development 30 or even 50 years. The Georgians have not  defeated and will not defeat the Abkhazians, nor will the  Abkhazians defeat the Georgians. These civil wars have no  beginning and no end. So I would wish all who have experienced  evil in them to be able to restore peace with all their reason  and, if necessary, by force. All pretensions to a large-scale  civil war must be stopped in a very tough manner. It seems only  to the evil and fools that "now we will do a little bit of  fighting here, and then all will be well"... a dangerous  delusion that is fatal for society.</p>

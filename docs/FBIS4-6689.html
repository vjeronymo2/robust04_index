			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Defense Agency Director  General Kazuo Aichi offered Thursday [21 March] to take  legislative action if the United Nations adopts economic  sanctions against North Korea over its rejection of full  international inspections of its nuclear facilities, Japanese  officials said. Aichi told U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry, however, that the action will be within the framework of  the pacifist Constitution which bars the country from resorting  to the threat or use of force as a means of settling  international disputes.    The defense ministers of Japan and the United States agreed  that the U.N. Security Council will respond if diplomatic  efforts fail to settle the North Korean nuclear issue.    Perry arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day from Seoul for a  two-day visit to Japan. He will meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata on Friday.</p>

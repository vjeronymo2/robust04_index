			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: THIS IS WHAT BEING A PARENT IS ALL ABOUT  </P> <P> It came as no surprise to me that "my son" took the car keys back with him to  California after a recent visit home. It is something "my son" has been trained  to do by me throughout the years. If he had taken the car back with him,  there's no doubt my husband would have granted me permanent custody of him for  the rest of my life.  </P> <P> It's something I've never really understood. How is it a child can be sectioned  off at birth like the steer on the poster at the frozen meat locker? Mothers  get the rump and fathers get the good stuff. It's one of those divisions we  seem to accept without question.  </P> <P> "The baby needs changing/wiping/powdering."  </P> <P> "That's Mama's part."  </P> <P> "The baby is hungry/cranky/bleeding."  </P> <P> "It's Mama's son."  </P> <P> We have discussed it. "Why is it," I asked my husband, "that 'your son' never  needs a laxative -- it's always 'my son'?"  </P> <P> "For the same reason," he explained, "that 'your son' never needed shoes. Just  try to remember that every time his feet were flapping out of a pair of gym  shoes and it cost $80 to cover them, you said, 'Your son needs shoes.' "  </P> <P> I thought about that a moment. "Yes, but when the same feet were all over the  furniture and never on the floor, they became my son's feet again."  </P> <P> "Not always," he laughed nervously.  </P> <P> "And when he stepped in something disgusting, they were always my son's feet to  clean off. ALWAYS!"  </P> <P> "Make your point."  </P> <P> "I am saying," I said, "that you can't have one part one day and trade it off  the next. Do you want the hair or not? If you say yes, remember he's your son  when his hair is down to his shoulders and he's your son when it's short. Make  up your mind."  </P> <P> "I'll think about it. What else is up for grabs?"  </P> <P> "He's always my son when he's out of a job."  </P> <P> "That seems reasonable," my husband said. "You always seem to have so much  patience."  </P> <P> "You always said that when he was throwing up. I bought it then, but I'm not  buying it now. Besides, we had the children together. Why can't we both be  parents when they screw up? It's a shared responsibility. We're in this  together. After all, isn't sacrifice what being a parent is all about?"  </P> <P> The phone rang. Our son wanted to be picked up at the airport. He had been  skiing and had a few hours before he took off at midnight and thought he'd kill  them in the bosom of his family.  </P> <P> My husband and I looked at each other. Then we turned to our other son and  said, "He's YOUR brother!"  </P></p>

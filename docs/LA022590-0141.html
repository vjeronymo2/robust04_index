			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH GIRLS WIN 2ND CITY SOCCER TITLE  </P> <P> Sooner or later, someone might devise a way to stop the Chatsworth High girls'  soccer team.  </P> <P> For the second year in a row, the Chancellors plowed through Valley League and  playoff opponents and, with a 3-0 victory over Palisades at Birmingham High on  Saturday, placed another City Section championship trophy on their shelf.  </P> <P> Chatsworth first-year Coach Bob Horn has visions of a three-peat because all of  his players will return next year.  </P> <P> "We were stronger this year than last year, and we're going to be stronger next  year than this year," Horn said. "I don't want to sound cocky, but we have a  lot of weapons."  </P> <P> Forward Kris Bassler and defender Kim Constantino shared the tournament MVP  award. Horn suggested that midfielder Heather Gorman, who scored on a breakaway  at the 17-minute mark in the first half to give the Chancellors a 1-0 lead,  also should have shared in the award.  </P> <P> One minute after Gorman's goal, a Palisades defensive error helped Bassler  score a goal that pushed Chatsworth's lead to 2-0.  </P> <P> "We played a 4-4-2 defense trying to control the middle," Dolphin Coach Rick  Horner said. "Our sweeper tried to come up and let (Bassler) have a one-on-one  with our goalkeeper."  </P> <P> With three minutes remaining, Constantino scored into an open goal from 20  yards after a collision between Chatsworth's Sarah Murphy and Dolphin  goalkeeper Amber Wuchitech sent the ball bouncing into the right flank.  Wuchitech left the match sporting a black eye.  </P> <P> Chatsworth (15-1-1), the Valley League champion, thumped Belmont, 14-0, and  edged City League champion San Pedro, 4-2, in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I was thinking they might have underestimated us, but they didn't," Horner  said.  </P> <P> The Dolphins (11-3-1), who outscored their opponents, 57-11, this season, upset  El Camino Real, 2-1, and 1989 City runner-up Grant, 1-0, en route to the final.  </P> <P> Chatsworth crunched Palisades, 10-0, in a first-round playoff match a year ago.  </P></p>

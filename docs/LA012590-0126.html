			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOPE: STUDENT PEER COUNSELORS LEARN TO LISTEN  </P> <P> It is only a one-unit class that cannot be used for college credit, but  students in peer counseling at Paramount High School say the course is more  difficult than their academic subjects.  </P> <P> But students say they enjoy the class because they are helping other  teen-agers.  </P> <P> "It is emotionally challenging," said Jill Zuidervaart, 17, a senior peer  counselor.  </P> <P> Another counselor, 17-year-old junior Tracy Dawson said: "This is harder than  math."  </P> <P> Shelly Massicotte, 17, an advanced counselor added: "We are dealing with  real-life stuff."  </P> <P> After completing a 20-week semester of classroom training, students during the  second semester provide counseling to their peers. Of the 36 students now  attending peer counseling classes, eight have advanced to the point where they  can handle any type of problem.  </P> <P> Troubled teen-agers place their request slips for counseling in a locked wooden  box in the library. Peer counseling teacher Sandy Jacobs is the only one with a  key to the box.  </P> <P> Problems range from drugs to pregnancy, rape, suicidal thoughts and alcoholic  and abusive parents.  </P> <P> Other students who might be suspected of taking drugs or are having academic  problems and are unwilling to talk with adult counselors or teachers are  referred to the peer counselors.  </P> <P> The peer counselors "help break the ice. They move the student to seek  resources on campus," said Michael White, who heads the school student  counseling services.  </P> <P> The youths talk with the peer counselors in empty rooms, during lunch hours or  after school. Sometimes the youth counselors might be dismissed from one of  their regular classes to talk with a troubled classmate.  </P> <P> The peer counselors listen, but they do not try to tell troubled students what  to do. Everything they talk about is kept in strict confidence. However, they  are required by state law to report cases of abuse or possible suicide or  potential harm or threats to others.  </P> <P> In the case of a 17-year-old male student who was sleeping with a gun under his  pillow, peer counselor Olivier Contreras said she listened and was able to get  the young man to talk about his problems. He was considering killing himself  because of problems he was having with his girlfriend.  </P> <P> "He was nervous. I held his hand," Contreras said.  </P> <P> The young man's parents were told, school authorities were notified and  professional counseling was recommended for him, Jacobs said. The youth has  since dropped out of school.  </P> <P> Girls who think they are pregnant are informed about their options, which  include talking with their parents, seeking professional counseling and  discussing the situation with the baby's father. They are also encouraged to  seek a medical examination immediately.  </P> <P> The peer counseling program was started as an after-school pilot project three  years ago by Jacobs, who was a business teacher at the school. She is also the  substance abuse coordinator. Jacobs has a BA and MA in business. She also has  an MA in counseling psychology and is a licensed marriage, family and child  therapist.  </P> <P> Jacobs said she was hearing so many student problems that she thought it might  be a good idea to start a peer counseling group.  </P> <P> Many public schools have found peer counseling to be successful in dealing with  student problems, said Michael Donnelly, president of the California Peer  Counseling Assn. The association is a statewide volunteer organization composed  of adult professionals counselors and student peer counselors.  </P> <P> According to the most recent data based on a 1986 state Department of Education  survey, 25% of more than 800 high schools had some type of peer counseling  program, Donnelly said.  </P> <P> "Good counseling programs work when students (counselors) are properly  trained," said Donnelly, who runs a peer counseling program at San Gabriel High  School.  </P> <P> The Paramount Unified School District Board of Education approved the class for  the one-unit elective credit last year and Jacobs began teaching it full-time.  </P> <P> The students who sign up must have passing grades and be recommended by their  teachers. The peer counselors are taught basic skills on how to be good  listeners and how to communicate to troubled youths that they can seek  alternatives to their problems.  </P> <P> Jacobs said of the peer counselors: "While they may never use algebra in their  adult lives," they will always be able to use their counseling skills.  </P></p>

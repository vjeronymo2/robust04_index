			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trizec debt move may miss default deadline SENIOR debenture holders of Trizec, the troubled North American property group, will continue studying the company's financial restructuring plan for another two weeks, almost certainly delaying approval beyond October 20. Trizec, a publicly-held affiliate of the Hees-Edper group of Toronto, proposed a CDollars 1.86m (USDollars 1.39m)debt and preferred stock restructuring in August. It sought approval by October 20 to avoid default on a CDollars 84m Swiss-franc debenture issue due then. The trustee for the senior debenture holders owed CDollars 1.1bn said advisers are studying Trizec's legal and financial situation closely to determine whether the restructuring is acceptable. When they have all the information needed they will resume negotiations with Trizec. The company said it was willing to delay the approval meeting beyond October 20 and find means to avoid technical default on the Swiss debenture issue if necessary. Trizec's debt, some in bearer form, is held widely in North America and Europe, making the approval process for the restructuring complex. The company was caught by the 1991 slump in North American property markets. The senior debenture holders' steering committee is headed by a representative of the Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>

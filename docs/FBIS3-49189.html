			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "We Do Not Shoot at Clay Pigeons </F> -- Party Views on Viktor Orban's Coalition Model"]    [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young  Democrats [FIDESZ], considers a coalition of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF], the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ],  the FIDESZ, and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]  possible after the elections. In Kossuth Radio's Late Evening  Chronicle on 2 January, Orban added that, although this is only  an "experiment of thoughts" without knowing the number of  mandates, it is a politically feasible version. Especially  because many factors are pushing events in this direction.    According to Orban, his party would not take part in a  coalition that is organized on the basis of the Hungarian  Socialist Party's [MSZP] program, and would not happily  participate in one that is guided by the MDF's economic program.    Reacting to Orban's statement that a FIDESZ-MDF-SZDSZ-KDNP  big coalition could be established after the 1994 elections,  Attila Zsigmond, spokesman for the MDF's parliamentary group,  said that many more hypotheses and coalition versions will be  mentioned in the coming months. Therefore, until the first  round of the elections is over, we need not attribute much  significance to this suggestion, either, and he added that "we  do not wish to fire at clay pigeons."    As a matter of fact, six weeks ago, MDF Administrative  Chairman Sandor Lezsak said that the FIDESZ's anti-church  attitude makes it completely unsuitable for the MDF to consider  a coalition with it.    "The KDNP will not make any written or verbal agreements or  contracts, be it secret or open, with anyone before the  elections, and it is too early to talk about events that will  come after," Vaszlo Varga, deputy chairman of the KDNP said in  reply to our correspondent's question. "We pay special  attention to ensuring that the KDNP participates independently  in the elections. It is our firm view that we can only decide  with whom we enter a coalition after the election results and  the programs are known. Any other news to the contrary is a  figment of imagination," Varga said.    SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto is rather fed up with the coalition  speculations. In his view, some people are constantly opening  and closing doors in the rather drafty domestic political life  -- however, these approaches and alienations cannot really be  interpreted until the country is past at least the first round  of the elections.    As a matter of fact, the FIDESZ chairman has many times said  that, in his view, a liberal bloc would be the optimal solution,  which means that he would not be very happy to form a coalition  with the MDF. Then he said that they are also open toward the  KDNP and the MDF but did not completely rule out cooperation  with the MSZP, either -- although it is also true that, in the  meantime, he warned the SZDSZ that should it join ranks with the  possibly victorious socialists after the elections, it would  turn into a small MSZP. "When we -- or others -- would be  threatened by turning into a small or big Christian or  nationalist party, Orban could not exactly say but I hope that  we will be able to avert the lurking danger even without his  advice," Peto said.    According to MSZP member Laszlo Kovacs, it is difficult to  make out what the FIDESZ chairman is up to. "A few weeks ago  when, in an interview with a German newspaper, [then interior  minister] Peter Boross did not exclude the possibility of an  MDF-FIDESZ coalition, Orban was talking about provocation."    "I believe that a party first has to be successful at the  elections, has to win them, and only then is it worth deciding  about the coalition partners," Kovacs continued. "In my view,  the FIDESZ is doing exactly the opposite. It is probably trying  to compensate for its continuously decreasing popularity in  recent months by distancing itself from the MSZP."    Kovacs thought it possible that the MSZP might be forced  into  opposition even if it wins the elections. Should this happen,  in his view, it will mean that the parliamentary parties do not  accept the will of the electors, namely that the majority would  like to see the representatives of the winning party in  government.</p>

From Chinese Academy of Sciences, the scientists are trying  to preserve the rich plant varieties in this southwest China  tropical region.    Professor Xu Zaifu, director of the prefecture's botanical  garden, said that it is also a research conducted according to a  United Nation's convention issued in 1992 to preserve the  diversity of living beings and local culture and maintain the  harmony between them.    Funded by the U.S. Ford Foundation, they aim to cultivate  over 100 kinds of plants which are on the verge of extinction  caused by the population growth.    The 19,000-sq-km prefecture, bordering on Myanmar [Burma]  and  Laos, is a home to a dozen minority nationalities, including the  Hani, Lahu, Blang and Yi, with a combined population of over  800,000. The Dai nationality accounts for the largest  proportion.    Plants play an important role in local religion.    The Dai people believe in a kind of Buddhism, the sutras of  which are written on palm leaves.    According to ancient records, trees always appeared in  important events in the life of the father of Buddhism,  Sakyamuni. He was born, enlightened and entered a state of  nirvana under trees.    So trees have been honored as holy among local Buddhists. In  the past, anyone who cut down a tree would be sentenced to death  and their offspring made slaves.    In addition, temples and Buddha figures are made of valuable  timber. Lamp-oil, perfumes and dyes are refined from flowers  and leaves.    At present, there are more than 500 temples in the  prefecture, which are called "gardens for buddhist plants", with  at least over 50 varieties in each of them.    Xu and his colleagues hope to extend the research to other  temples.</p>

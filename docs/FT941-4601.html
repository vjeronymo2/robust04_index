			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: US vehicle side drives T&amp;N ahead to Pounds 70.3m A sharp rise in US vehicle output fuelled a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 70.3m at T&amp;N, the motor components manufacturer, for the year to end-December. Trading profits in North America jumped by 70 per cent to Pounds 35m (Pounds 20.6m), contributing to a group trading gain of 14 per cent to Pounds 122.8m (Pounds 107.3m). While welcoming the improvement Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said there were few recovery signs in continental Europe, one of T&amp;N's most important markets. 'Europe car production is down by 20 per cent and we've been hit by reduced demand, even in the UK. Exceptional cost cutting action is under way in Germany, France and Italy,' he said. Declining vehicle production, he added, had forced T&amp;N to increase rationalisation and redundancy charges last year by 96 per cent to Pounds 21.9m. The group has cut its workforce by more than 3,000 last year and Mr Hope warned that at least another 1,000 jobs would have to go over the year and next, reducing the group total to about 40,000. T&amp;N's Italian operations were worst affected by the downturn, with some subsidiaries forced to make 'significant' bad debt write-offs following a 50 per cent decline in sales volume. Mr Hope also predicted another 1,000 job cuts at Goetze, the German components subsidiary which T&amp;N purchased last year for DM250 (Pounds 97m). It has already cut more than 1,300, or 30 per cent, of the workforce. In the UK, meanwhile, trading profits slipped to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 43.9m) in spite of increased sales of Pounds 552m (Pounds 531m). The results were also hit by a provision of Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 16.6m) to settle asbestos disease claims, mainly in the US. The provision held overall operating profits at Pounds 101.7m, although this represented a 12 per cent increase on the Pounds 90.7m total in 1992. Group turnover advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.66bn (Pounds 1.39bn). Earnings per share came out at 8.8p (5.8p). The unchanged full-year dividend of 10.85p was paid at the interim stage, with an alternative scrip dividend of 16.275p per ordinary share. COMMENT T&amp;N has decided to swallow some bitter pills in a bid to increase future profitability. Heavy rationalisation costs and provisions against future asbestos claims have overshadowed an underlying performance that remains relatively healthy despite miserable trading conditions in Europe. Most analysts were expecting a pre-tax gain of about Pounds 70m without the provisions. That the company hit that target while enduring heavy charges pays testament to increased operating efficiency. Having cut costs, it is expected to report profits of Pounds 91m this year for a forward multiple of 21.1. This is expensive but the City likes T&amp;N's prospects and believes its asbestos liabilities are covered adequately. The latter proposition will be tested in coming months.</p>

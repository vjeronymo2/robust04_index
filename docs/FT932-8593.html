			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Xerox stock suffers after chairman's warning XEROX shares fell sharply yesterday after Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, warned that second-quarter earnings in the company's core document processing operations could drop below the Dollars 1.12-a-share level posted a year ago. However, he said he still expected full-year earnings for those operations to show an increase on 1992. Wall Street was surprised by the announcement and by the close Xerox shares were down Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 72 1/4 in active trading. The opening was delayed by a backlog of sell orders. Mr Allaire said the earnings fall reflected fundamental changes in the management of the company's document processing business, the realignment of the US salesforce and continued weak economic conditions. These factors had already affected first-quarter results, released last month, which showed overall net income of Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.77 a share, against a loss of Dollars 529m, or Dollars 5.68, in the same period last year when the company took accounting charges. Income from the document processing business was Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.12, against Dollars 103, or 91 cents. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 3.3bn. Mr Allaire said yesterday that, after the second quarter, 'we expect sales momentum to increase as we realise the benefits of the sales reorganisation'. His comments, in a conference with security analysts, were made in view of the planned offering of 6m shares, announced in March, which the company said would go ahead this summer. Mr Walter Fitzgerald, an equity analyst with RAS Securities, said the stock market was probably overreacting yesterday. The company's new products were going well and, although European markets remained flat, it was on target, he said.</p>

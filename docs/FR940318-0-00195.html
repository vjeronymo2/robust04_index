			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following scientific concerns raised in 1974 regarding possible ozone depletion from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFCs, EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acted on March 17, 1978 (43 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11301; 43 FR 11318) to ban the use of CFCs as aerosol propellants in all but essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. During the mid-1970s, use as aerosol propellants constituted over 50 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total CFC consumption in the United States. The 1978 ban reduced aerosol use of CFCs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this country by approximately 95 percent, eliminating nearly half of the then total U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of these chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some CFC aerosol products were specifically exempted from the ban based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of essentiality. (See reference Essential Use Determinations-Revised, 1978.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other uses of CFCs in aerosol and pressurized dispenser products (e.g., as an active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient, a solvent, or as the sole ingredient) were excluded from the ban because they did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not fit the narrow definition of ``aerosol propellant.'' Therefore, prior to the 1990 amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Clean Air Act, the only aerosol products that still contained CFCs were products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempted from the 1978 ban on CFC propellants or products excluded from the 1978 ban.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 includes statutory authorities relevant to use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone depleting chemicals used in aerosol applications in several sections of Title VI. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to mandating the phaseout of class I and class II substances (sections 604 and 605)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and mandating the review of substitutes (section 612), section 610 of title VI prohibits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sale of certain nonessential products made with class I and class II substances. Title VI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divides controlled ozone-depleting substances into two distinct classes. Class I is comprised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, MCF, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and methyl bromide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class II is comprised solely of HCFCs. The product bans for class I substances and class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances are distinct from one another and are addressed in subsections 610(b) and 610(d),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. In section 610(b), Congress directed EPA to promulgate regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibit the sale or distribution of certain ``nonessential'' products that release class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. Under this subsection, Congress specifies particular products as nonessential and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directs EPA to identify other nonessential products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final regulations implementing the Class I Nonessential Products ban (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4767; January 15, 1993), EPA issued regulations that implement the requirements of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 610(b) and ban certain nonessential products that release class I substances. Under this rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA banned, among other products, flexible and packaging foam, and aerosols and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized dispensers using CFCs. The use of methyl chloroform, while a class I substance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not restricted under this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As directed by Congress, EPA researched the purpose or intended use of products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing class I substances, the technological availability of substitutes, safety and health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations, and other relevant factors including the economic effect of banning selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. EPA then banned the use of CFCs as propellants and solvents in all aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products with the following specific exemptions (58 FR 4767; January 15, 1993):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Medical devices listed in 21 CFR 2.125(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Lubricants for pharmaceutical and tablet manufacture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Gauze bandage adhesives and adhesive removers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Topical anesthetic and vapocoolant products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Lubricants, coatings, or cleaning fluids for electrical and electronic equipment that contain CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12 or CFC&hyph;113 for solvent purposes, but which contain no other CFC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Lubricants, coatings, or cleaning fluids for aircraft maintenance that contain CFC&hyph;11 or CFC&hyph;113, but which contain no other CFC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Release agents for molds using CFC&hyph;11 or CFC&hyph;113 in the production of plastic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or elastomeric materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Spinnerette lubricant/cleaning sprays used in the production of synthetic fibers that contain CFC&hyph;114, but contain no other CFCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Containers of CFCs used as halogen ion sources in plasma etching. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Document preservation sprays that contain CFC&hyph;113, but which contain no other CFCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Red pepper bear repellant sprays that contain CFC&hyph;113, but which contain no other CFCs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exemption from the class I ban does not imply exemption from the phase-out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFCs also have current and potential applications as propellants and as solvents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosol products. Until recently, their use has been limited by the aerosol industry because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their high cost relative to traditional options such as CFCs and hydrocarbons. Increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation of CFCs, including taxation of these substances and an eventual phase-out, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meant that HCFCs are, for an interim period, economically viable in some applications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly where concern about flammability limits the use of cheaper alternatives, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, section 610(d) of the CAA prohibits as of January 1, 1994, the sale or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of aerosol or foam products that contain or are manufactured with class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. All HCFCs are currently listed as class II substances. EPA believes that the ban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on certain products containing class II substances is self-executing. Section 610(d)(1) bans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sale of the specified class II products on its own terms, without any reference to required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Thus, EPA is not required to determine which products will be banned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, section 610(d)(2) allows EPA to grant exceptions and exclusions from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ban on aerosol and pressurized dispenser products containing class II substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, EPA is authorized to grant exceptions from the prohibition where the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosol product or pressurized dispenser is determined by the Administrator to be essential as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of flammability or worker safety, and where the only available alternative to the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a class II substance is the use of a class I substance which legally could be substituted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such class II substance (i.e., use of a class I substance that is still allowed). In addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these two criteria for exceptions, aerosol products may be excluded from the ban as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a third consideration in section 610 (d)(2); namely, that the ban on products containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class II substances shall not apply to any medical device. Reflecting the self-executing nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the CAA ban, any aerosol product or pressurized dispenser containing a class II substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is banned as of January 1, 1994, unless EPA grants an exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published a final rule under 610(d)(2) December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69637). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following products were exempted:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

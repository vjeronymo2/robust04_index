			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Baker Act provoking controversy on national testing THE GREATEST power held by county councils has been eroded since their last elections in 1989 by Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act, John Authers writes. The Baker act, which became law in 1988, is provoking controversy on the issue of testing for the national curriculum, which it introduced. But it also introduced the right for schools to opt out of local education authority control and become 'grant maintained'. Opted-out schools are funded directly by the Department for Education, and so many of the powers previously held by local education authorities devolve to Mr John Patten, the education secretary. The 1988 act also introduced local management of schools. This aimed to devolve power away from county halls by creating delegated budgets which were paid to schools and then put under their control. Both moves indirectly attacked county councils, which are responsible for local education authorities outside the metropolitan areas. As the number of schools opting out has increased, the work remaining for county councils has decreased. This has led county councils to fear that there is a link between grant-maintained schools and the review of the structure of local government, which is considering replacing two-tier authorities - involving both counties and districts - with unitary authorities. Education is the counties' biggest responsibility, and widespread opting out would make it much easier to do away with county councils altogether. Not surprisingly, education is proving one of the most important issues in the campaign for the county council elections.</p>

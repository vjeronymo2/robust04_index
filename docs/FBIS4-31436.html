			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- President Berisha and  Speaker of the Macedonian Parliament Andov said yesterday that  important steps have been made in the relations between the two  countries and that the two parties are engaged in further  developing cooperation and understanding between them.    Berisha said that Albania is interested in Macedonia's [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] stability. "We  encourage the Albanians that they should be a factor of  stability for Macedonia, just as we insist that the recognition  of human and national rights of the Albanians residing there  serves the stability of the Macedonian state itself. In this  context, mutual respect between the Albanians and Macedonians is  of specific importance," President Berisha said.    Mr. Andov appreciated the Albanian policy in the Balkans as  well the facilities Albania has created to Macedonia to cope  with the Greek embargo. He demanded from President Berisha  Albania's support for Macedonia's membership of CSCE, the Black  Sea initiative as well as other institutions, whose member  Albania is. President Berisha assured the speaker of the  Macedonian Parliament that Albania will support Macedonia's  membership of CSCE as well as its membership in the Black Sea  initiative. "I consider the enlargement of the Black Sea  initiative with a new member as a very significant moment," he  said.</p>

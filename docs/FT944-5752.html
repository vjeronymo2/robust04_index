			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Vietnam boat people back under spotlight: Repatriation issue could raise tensions between UK and China Concern is growing in Hong Kong and London that time is running short for Britain to fulfil its commitment to repatriate Vietnamese boat people from the colony by the end of next year. The pace of voluntary repatriation has slowed to a trickle and the so-called 'orderly repatriation' (forced repatriation by another name) has only recently been restarted after suspension from March until September. This year the government will be lucky if 6,000 Vietnamese return to Vietnam, half as many as returned in each of 1993 and 1992. As the rate of repatriation is stepped up, the issue again risks becoming the focus of international controversy, possibly of fresh tensions between the UK and China. This week, Ta Kung Pao, a Beijing-controlled daily, warned Britain it should stand by its undertaking to see all Vietnamese in Hong Kong returned to Vietnam by the end of 1995. 'If not, the British government should be responsible for this,' the paper said. In a sentence few Vietnamese would recognise, Ta Kung Pao added: 'Hong Kong has become a paradise for the Vietnamese people.' The Vietnamese have few friends in Hong Kong, outside a band of civil rights activists. Caught between the apparent indifference of Britain and the hostility of China, they face an uncertain future. Yet they command the attention of both London and Beijing. Violence, or the threat of violent protest, is never far from the surface in the camps. A worry of the Hong Kong authorities is that a putative 'hard core' of Vietnamese may do something dramatic, such as group suicide, to protest against the hopelessness of their situation. In the spring of this year, the plight of the refugees grabbed international attention when 1,500 inmates at the Whitehead prison camp rioted in opposition to the government's policy of forced repatriation. The riot was put down with force, resulting in 270 casualties; one young mother of two may be crippled for life. More recently, Hong Kong's passions have been inflamed by the release of 125 Vietnamese after the government found they could no longer be lawfully detained. Hong Kong is unsympathetic to the plight of the Vietnamese, even though it has been a refugee colony for most of its 150-year history. In response to the release of the 125, the local press has been full of articles warning of potential law-and-order problems if Vietnamese are let into society; some civic leaders have pointed to the depressive effect on wage levels an influx of cheap labour might have. Since June 1988, the basis for detaining almost all Vietnamese in Hong Kong is that they are illegal immigrants awaiting return to Vietnam. In the case of 125 who volunteered to return, Hanoi rejected the Hong Kong government's contention that they were Vietnamese nationals. Unable to return them to Vietnam, the government had little option but to release them into an open camp. There are nearly 26,000 Vietnamese people housed in eight 'refugee' and 'detention' centres in Hong Kong. The government classifies only 1,699 of these as refugees: people with a well founded fear of persecution and therefore deserving of settlement in third countries. These lucky few are preparing for a life in the West. The rest, numbering some 23,700 and having endured a questionable screening process, are classified as illegal immigrants and detained in closed prison camps pending their return to Vietnam. The problem for Hong Kong, Britain and China is that there may not be enough time left for these people to be humanely persuaded that their future prospects are brighter in Vietnam than they are in post-1997 Hong Kong. Mr Brian Bresnihan, Hong Kong's refugee co-ordinator, says the outlook may not be as gloomy as it appears. The reintroduction of 'orderly' repatriation should have the effect of stimulating large numbers of other Vietnamese to return voluntarily, he adds. The scheme had a powerful effect on voluntary repatriation in the past; he sees no reason why it will not in the future. 'In 1991, orderly repatriation was introduced, not to effect the repatriation of migrants back to Vietnam but to show our intention to repatriate in a mandatory way those who did not return voluntarily,' he said. Fighting Mr Bresnihan is Ms Pam Baker, a former government solicitor who resigned in 1992 so she could spend time defending the Vietnamese. This week, Ms Baker, who also heads Refugee Concern, a pressure group, has called on the government to release up to 700 refugees whom she claims will be not allowed back to Vietnam and so are being detained illegally. She has threatened to issue writs of habeas corpus. The Hong Kong government will vigorously contest any action Ms Baker brings in the colony's courts. Mr Bresnihan denies the government will have to release any more Vietnamese: 'We firmly believe no one in our camps is illegally detained,' he says. Meanwhile, the inmates of the camps are restive and the clock is ticking.</p>

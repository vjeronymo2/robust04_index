			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Pain of going for broke - The soaring rate of business failures is forcing more and more people into personal bankruptcy. Charles Batchelor offers a guide for survival Paul Peccioli's fitted kitchen and bedroom business survived for two years before it succumbed to rising interest rates. For the final six months, Peccioli clung on hoping that things would improve, but with no prospects of an upturn he decided to declare himself bankrupt. On June 15 he paid his Pounds 150 fee - the authorities only accept cash - and was officially made bankrupt by Northamptonshire County Court with debts of more than Pounds 77,000. 'They ask you if you know what you are doing,' Peccioli recalls. 'Then there are lots of papers to fill in. They cut up my plastic, froze my building society account which had Pounds 41 in it, and notified all my creditors. I never even saw a judge. A young lady came out with the seal of approval on my petition.' The staff from the insolvency service (part of the Department of Trade and Industry) were helpful, Peccioli says. 'They don't treat you as the scum of the earth. But I felt unclean. There is a stigma to knowing you are bankrupt.' Peccioli is attempting to start again but the insolvency rules prevent him from obtaining more than Pounds 250 of credit without declaring that he is an undischarged bankrupt. In practice he has been unable to open a bank account so he has to ask customers to pay cash. He is also obliged to use the trading name - Options - which he used before he went bankrupt. Soaring business failure rates have meant that a growing number of people have found themselves forced into personal bankruptcy. Businessmen and women who operate as sole traders, or as partnerships, do not enjoy the protection of limited liability while many company directors give personal guarantees which override their limited liability status. The spectacular collapses of large businesses such as Polly Peck, Coloroll and Maxwell Communication have captured the headlines but business-related personal bankruptcies are far more common. No fewer than two-thirds of the 46,000 business failures in the first nine months of 1992 were bankruptcies of individuals acting as sole traders or in partnerships, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information group. Behind the statistics there are many personal tragedies. Ray Neale re-established himself in business despite the failure of his Portslade, Sussex-based steel fabrication company two years ago, but he knows of two other local businessmen who killed themselves after their businesses went bust. 'Matrimonial and financial collapse often go together,' notes Shirley Jackson, a partner in London-based insolvency specialists, Begbie Norton. 'The whole thing can lead to clinical depression.' 'It is absolutely appalling what is happening to people,' says John McQueen, founder of The Bankruptcy Association, which provides advice on how to cope with financial disaster. 'We are so angry about the state that people are reduced to. They are treated like dirt.' Not surprisingly, accountants who specialise in insolvency work take a more detached view. The Insolvency Act of 1986 introduced a far more sensitive and liberal treatment of bankrupts than the previous legislation which dated from 1914, says Jackson. 'Now you can keep people with a half-way decent standard of living,' she says. Previously bankrupts could only keep their bedding and the clothes they stood up in but they would now be allowed to run a small car, keep their computer if they needed it for their business and hang on to basic audio and video equipment. 'The present insolvency regime is about how you share the misery,' says Steve Hill, a partner at Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'It attempts to achieve a balance between the interests of the debtor and creditor.' Until 1976, Hill notes, bankruptcy was for life unless the bankrupt applied for a discharge and this was likely to be contested by the Official Receiver. The system was then changed to allow a review after five years, while in 1986 the Insolvency Act allowed an automatic discharge after three years for most bankrupts. If the bankrupt has declared himself bankrupt and owes less than Pounds 20,000, he is discharged after just two years. The 1986 Act also introduced the 'individual voluntary arrangement', under which the business owner in difficulties can come to an agreement with his creditors to pay them off over time. These arrangements avoid the stigma and the blot on the individual's credit rating which result from bankruptcy but they do involve a considerable commitment. Many people find bankruptcy less of a strain. Hill believes the British insolvency rules strike a fair balance and compares them with the US, where bankruptcy is common and has lost much of its stigma, and much of continental Europe where it lasts for life or until the bankrupt has paid off his debts. Some observers of the 'enterprise revolution' of the 1980s think that failure should be seen as a learning experience and not as a bar to starting up in business again. However, Hill and many other insolvency practitioners believe some stigma must remain to deter the unscrupulous. Clearly there are crooks who attempt to abuse the system but growing numbers of people are being made bankrupt for reasons beyond their own control. Many of the businesses which are now going under have not been managed recklessly, says David Swaden, a partner in insolvency specialists, Leonard Curtis. 'We are down to bedrock, family businesses which have used up their reserves and their energy fighting the recession.' Michael Long ran a village shop in Suffolk until the recession, high interest charges and the cost of business rates forced him to close. Long, who is now unemployed, opted for voluntary bankruptcy and moved away from the village to make a fresh start. Like many other small business owners facing bankruptcy, Long says he did not know where to turn for help. When Long's local paper carried a story about him, calls flooded in and he decided to set up a free advice service called the B-Line for those facing bankruptcy. Long says he has had enquiries from more than 2,000 people in the first year of operation. John McQueen, who set up The Bankruptcy Association in 1983 after seeing how his brother was affected by the failure of his building business, has more than 2,400 members and handles several hundred calls a month. Most people join for a short time while they sort out their problems but several hundred have remained members for many years, he says. With no sign of an end to the recession, the numbers of business-related bankruptcies are set to climb further. However accommodating the law sets out to be, the experience will remain a harrowing one for many people.

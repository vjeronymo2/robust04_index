			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY HOLDS 1ST FREE VOTE SINCE 1945  </P> <P> Incomplete results in the first free national vote here since 1945 narrowly  favored supporters of Communist Party reformer Imre Pozsgay, who hopes to be  elected Hungarian president in elections in January.  </P> <P> But freezing temperatures and snow delayed conclusive results in the  referendum, called by pro-Western political parties in an attempt to block  Pozsgay by delaying the January elections until multi-party parliamentary  elections are held next spring.  </P> <P> With only 23% of the vote counted by early this morning, government officials  said that 52% voted against delaying the election, compared to 48% in favor.  The officials said the vote results included Budapest, where support for the  referendum was felt to be strong.  </P> <P> However, referendum sponsors disputed the results, claiming that their count  showed an opposite trend. "Frankly, we are surprised," referendum campaign  director Tibor Vidos said. "The data we have is very different, going in the  opposite direction."  </P> <P> Official final results are not expected until Tuesday. But the early dispute  over the results will likely add to the controversy surrounding the vote, which  has turned into an electoral nightmare after originally being billed as the  first free national ballot in the Soviet Bloc since 1945.  </P> <P> Ironically, that 1945 vote also took place in Hungary, as one of the conditions  of the Yalta agreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. In that  vote, the Liberal-Democratic Small Holders Party won 57% of the vote, compared  to only 17% for the Communist Party. As a result of the lopsided return against  the Communist Party, no other free elections have been held in the Soviet Bloc  until this year.  </P> <P> Although incomplete, the count released by government election officials showed  that at least enough Hungarian voters went to the polls Sunday to make the  referendum binding. A major opposition party, the Democratic Forum, had asked  voters to boycott the referendum. And many here feared that widespread  confusion over the ballot issues would keep people away.  </P> <P> The National Referendum, sponsored by the pro-Western Alliance of Free  Democrats, asked voters to decide four issues, including the abolition of a  notorious voluntary police unit, the Workers' Militia; a proposal to require  the Communist Party, recently renamed the Hungarian Socialist Party, to reveal  its financial assets, and another proposal banning Communist organizers from  the workplace. According to the preliminary results, all of these issues were  approved handily.  </P> <P> However, vote tallies on the fourth and most controversial issue -- a proposal  to delay the presidential elections until next spring, after the country's  first multi-party parliamentary elections in four decades -- appeared much  closer.  </P> <P> Hungarian Socialist Party leaders opposed the measure. Instead, they want a  presidential election to take place as scheduled in January, in hopes that  longtime Communist Party member Pozsgay, leader of the party's reform wing,  would be elected before the parliamentary elections. To help their cause, they  managed to add a confusing "explanation" to the ballot -- opposed by the  referendum sponsors -- that claimed a "no" vote ensured the "direct" election  of the President.  </P> <P> Until the vote Sunday, organizers were not even sure that 50% of the 7.8  million registered voters, the minimum number required to make the election  valid, would go to the polls. But Hungarian voters overcame a reputation for  electoral apathy and flocked to the polling places.  </P> <P> "We had reports from the countryside that many people went to the polls  directly from church," said Vidos, leader of the alliance of four parties that  sponsored the referendum.  </P></p>

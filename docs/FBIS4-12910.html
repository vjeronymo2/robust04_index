			<p>BFN     [Text] At this morning's ceremony at the president's  residence, reporter Amy Rhodes asked Foreign Minister Peres how  he responded to 'Arafat's phone call to Prime Minister Rabin  last night.    [Begin recording] [Peres] Well, we appreciate the call. We  would like to see a more definite language, but this is a  decision for Mr. 'Arafat, not for us. We shall condemn any and  every act of terror whether it will be against innocent Arab  people or innocent Israeli people. Nobody has the right to take  away the life of anybody.    [Rhodes] Has the Israeli Government expressed to 'Arafat  that they would like him to use stronger language?    [Peres] We are not offering lessons to anybody. It is for  'Arafat to decide the language he wants to use.    [Rhodes] Is the Israeli Government satisfied with what he  said?    [Peres] Our job is to provide security and to continue with  peace. We are not in the business of reviews.    [Rhodes] The opposition is saying that if 'Arafat cannot  even come out and condemn the attack, what kind of peace are we  actually making? Can you comment on that?    [Peres] He is making peace with us. You know, the  opposition is measuring and judging everything by declarations.  Declarations are important. They are not the most important  thing, and I do see that the opposition is having a summer  collection of wintry declarations. It is of no importance.  Words are words and actions are actions, and changes are  changes, and we are not in the business of confusing it like the  right is doing. [end recording]    [In a similar report on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000  GMT on 14 April, referring to 'Arafat's response to the latest  terrorist attack, Peres says in a recorded passage: "I believe  that for his own sake and for the sake of his nation, he should  come out with the sharpest condemnation of terror."]</p>

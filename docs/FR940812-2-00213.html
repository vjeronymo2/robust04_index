FAF is a open-end management investment company organized as a Minnesota corporation and registered under the Act. FAF currently offers five series of shares: Money Fund, Institutional Money Fund, CT Government Fund, Institutional Government Fund, and CT Treasury Fund. Each series is a money market fund within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act. The Adviser acts as investment adviser to each series. The Adviser is a wholly owned subsidiary of First Bank System, Inc. (``FBS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. First Trust National Association (``First Trust'') also is a wholly owned subsidiary of FBS, and acts as custodian for FAF. First Trust and its affiliates hold of record in their own name and in the name of their nominee more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Institutional Money Fund, Institutional Government Fund, and CT Government Fund, and they hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. All such shares are held for the benefit of others in a trust, agency, custodial, or other fiduciary or representative capacity. First Trust and its affiliates do not have any economic interest in any such shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants propose that Money Fund and CT Government Fund (the ``Acquired Funds'') be combined with and into, respectively, Institutional Money Fund and Institutional Government Fund (the ``Acquiring Funds'') in tax free reorganizations (the ``Reorganizations''). In the Reorganizations each Acquiring Fund will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of its respective Acquired Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund, which then will be distributed to former shareholders of the Acquired Fund. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of each Acquired Fund are identical or substantially similar to those of its respective Acquiring Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The number of Acquiring Fund shares to be issued in exchange for each Acquired Fund share will be determined by dividing the net asset value of one Acquired Fund share as of the effective time of the Reorganization (before giving effect thereto) by the net asset value of one Acquiring Fund share at such time. Because each Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund computes its net asset value per share using the amortized cost method under rule 2a&hyph;7, these procedures will result in a share-for-share and dollar-for-dollar exchange of Acquiring Fund shares for Acquired Fund shares, without adjustment. It is a condition to closing of the Reorganizations that the net asset value per share of each of the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds immediately before the effective time, so computed, be $1.00 per share and that the net asset value per share of each Acquiring Fund immediately after the reorganizations, so computed, be $1.00 per share. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. At a meeting on June 8, 1994, the Board of Directors of FAF, including the disinterested directors, made the findings required under rule 17a&hyph;8 and unanimously approved the Reorganizations. In doing so, the Board considered: (a) The compatibility of the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the respective Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds; (b) the expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds of the Reorganizations; (c) the anticipated tax-free nature of the Reorganizations; (d) the terms and conditions of the Reorganization; (e) the costs associated with the Reorganizations, and the agreement of the Adviser to bear such costs; (f) the anticipated advisory fees before and after the Reorganization and the Adviser's agreement to waive a portion of such fees; and (g) the potential benefits to the Adviser of the Reorganizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

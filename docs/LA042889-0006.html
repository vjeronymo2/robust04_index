			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ABORTION REVIEW  </P> <P> At today's traditional Friday meeting, the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices  will take a preliminary vote on their newest abortion case. Whatever the  justices decide and whatever court opinion they fashion in the coming weeks  will not end the debate over abortion. The decision will, however, clarify what  legal battles, if any, remain to be fought, and where.  </P> <P> The justices' questions during oral argument Wednesday revealed the issues that  are likely to sway the swing votes. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.  Kennedy both probed the validity of state intervention in procreation. In  dialogue with Charles Fried, the former U.S. solicitor general who was arguing  the government's anti-abortion case, O'Connor asked pointedly, "Do you say  there is no fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not? Do you  deny the Constitution protects that right?"  </P> <P> In his turn, Kennedy referred to a 1965 Connecticut case that legalized the  sale of contraceptives. To him, the fundamental right of privacy enunciated in  that case appeared similar to that on which turns the 1973 ruling that  legalized abortion. Fried argued that the 1965 ruling was right and the 1973  application was wrong. Logic dictates against that view, and Kennedy's line of  questioning was a hopeful sign for those who favor keeping the law that now  allows a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy by abortion.  </P> <P> The state of Missouri was asking the court to reinstate its law that prohibits  public hospitals or public employees from performing abortions unless necessary  to save a woman's life, prevents use of tax money for programs that involve  abortion counseling and requires tests to ensure that a fetus older than 19  weeks would not be viable outside the womb. The law, held unconstitutional by a  federal appeals court, also declares that life begins at conception.  </P> <P> Any provision of that law, once upheld, would become a punitive weapon to be  used against women, not only in Missouri but wherever anti-abortion forces  could duplicate it in other state legislatures. The high court can thus stop  short of heeding the government's request to overturn completely Roe vs. Wade,  the 1973 case that legalized abortion, but still harm women.  </P> <P> By banning any public conduct or financing of abortions, the law especially  strikes at the poorest women. If existing law is substantially changed, the  more affluent would still be able to seek qualified private doctors or travel  to states whose laws were less hostile to abortion. The poor would either bear  unwanted children or take their chances with back-alley quacks.  </P> <P> Ours is a government of the people. A substantial number of those people do not  want legislators or judges in far-off cities dictating their most personal of  decisions, that is, whether to complete or end a pregnancy. They do not want to  decide what choices others make; they want simply for government to leave them  alone to make their own choices, choices that can never be lightly made.  </P></p>

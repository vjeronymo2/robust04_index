			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Gazumping complaints rise steeply Gazumping has risen sharply in the housing market, within a climate of increasing complaints made to the corporate estate agents' ombudsman, according to his report published yesterday. Mr David Quayle, ombudsman, said that the number of initial inquiries within the terms of reference of the voluntary scheme rose to 965 last year compared with 701 in his report for 1992. Cases completed rose to 198, an increase of 45 per cent over the previous 12 months. Mr Quayle used the publication of his report to call for urgent reform of the process of house buying. He said that it 'should be simpler and faster and give those involved a greater degree of certainty'. The ombudsman found for the first time in favour of more member agencies than complainants, a development which Mr Quayle attributed to stricter adherence by members to the code of practice. Complaints last year also reflected for the first time more initial enquiries from buyers than by sellers. Initial enquiries about gazumping rose to 100 last year from the 32 noted in the 1992 report. While this does not make it the largest area of complaint - that is still maladministration - it is the fastest growing, and Mr Quayle said it was the 'single issue causing most anger' among complainants. Mr Quayle renewed his criticism of the practice of lenders telling estate agents to obtain 'best and final offers', because of complaints from buyers who seemed to have provided the best only to be overtaken by a later one. The practice was particularly prevalent in the disposal of repossessed properties by organisations such as banks and building societies. Mr Quayle also expressed concern that 'over-computerisation' produced dangers that the nuances of conversations between agents and buyers and sellers were not properly recorded. The highest award made was for Pounds 5,500 and most of the 71 awards made were for less than Pounds 500. The voluntary scheme, which was set up in 1990, covers about 90 per cent of corporate estate agents, but does not include independent agents. The report covers 16 months, as it takes account of a change of year-end from end-August to end-December.</p>

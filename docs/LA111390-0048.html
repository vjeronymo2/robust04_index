			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALPHA BETA APPLAUDED  </P> <P> Our son's Army reserve unit has been activated due to the Desert Shield  operation. His employer, Alpha Beta, has informed him that while he is serving  on active duty, which should last six months, they will pay him the difference  between his military pay and what he would have received from the company for a  period of up to six months.  </P> <P> I have thanked them for him and wanted your readers to know how great Alpha  Beta is treating their employees who have been activated and their commitment  to our country.  </P> <P> JIM NICKERSON, Canoga Park  </P></p>

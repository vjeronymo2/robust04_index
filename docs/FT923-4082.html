			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Contest to host Apec INTENSE COMPETITION has developed this week between Thailand and Singapore over the proposed siting of a secretariat for the 15-nation Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group (Apec). The two countries hope the secretariat could mean international prestige and future material benefits if Apec, which includes the US, Japan, China and Australia, develops as planned. The organisation so far has amounted to little more than a loose series of meetings. Thailand is also seeking international endorsement that it has returned to normal politically after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Jakarta and Seoul are also candidates, but they are considered outsiders. Apec accounts for half the world's gross domestic product and 40 per cent of international trade. It includes some of thr world's fastest-growing economies. Its members are: the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Since its launch in Canberra in November 1989, the group has held regular consultations on trade and economic issues.</p>

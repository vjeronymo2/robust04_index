			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Retailers expect sales to fall this month RETAILERS had a disappoint-ing Christmas and expect sales to fall in January, reversing a six month rising trend, the Confederation of British Industry reports today. This gloomy picture of sluggish sales and orders among retailers and wholesalers, from the CBI's latest distributive trades survey, reinforces the view that the unwillingness of UK consumers to resume spending is delaying the upturn. It stands in sharp contrast to the prime minister's view, restated yesterday, that slow world economic growth is to blame for the imperceptibly slow pace of the recovery. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI survey panel, said heavy price discounting in December did not produce the boost in trade that retailers had hoped for. 'Retailers report that December's sales volumes remained moderately above the already very depressed levels of a year ago.' The CBI expects such consumer spending as there was in December - encouraged by unprecedented pre-Christmas discounting - to eat into sales in January. 'Retailers expect sales to slip back a little below last year's levels for the first time since June,' Mr Whittaker said. The government remains confident in its forecast of economic recovery. Speaking in his TV-am interview yesterday, Mr John Major claimed that the UK would be among the first countries to benefit from world economic recovery in 1992. 'We are at a different stage of the cycle from many of our competitor countries and I think we will come out of our difficulties earlier than them.' Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment spokesman, dismissed Mr Major's claims as 'utterly remote from reality'. The CBI survey suggests that the government faces more bad economic news today when the Central Statistical Office releases the provisional retail sales figures for December. Markets are expecting seasonally adjusted sales in December to be unchanged on the previous month. The final retail sales figures for November, released last week, showed that sales rose by 1.3 per cent on the previous month. But sales in the three months to November were down by 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter. This week also brings industrial production figures for November, expected to show production remaining flat compared with October, when it fell from the previous month.

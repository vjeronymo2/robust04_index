Provincial Party Secretary Li Changchun  made an important speech at the opening ceremony.    He stressed: We should take the decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guidance,  conscientiously implement central policies and measures on  strengthening agricultural and rural economic development,  persist in taking agriculture as the foundation in the course of  establishing the socialist market economic structure, actively  orient enteprises toward the market, and speed up the pace of  making the people prosperous.    The opening ceremony was presided over by Governor Ma  Zhongchen. [passage omitted]    In his speech, Li Changchun first analyzed the province's  current agricultural and rural situation. He said: Following  the deepening of reform in the 1990's, Henan's economy has  entered a new development period. Agriculture has started  transforming from a single type of cultivation structure into an  overall aspect embracing agriculture, forestry, animal  husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Industry,  commerce, construction, and transportation are are undergoing  comprehensive transformation. The rural economy is developing  from the small-peasant economy into an open socialist market  economy. Most peasants are beginning to move toward moderate  prosperity after resolving the problem of adequate food and  clothing. New vitality and vigor are emerging in the entire  agriculture and rural economy. In the last three years, grain  output has remained at more than 30 billion kg and stood at 35.3  billion kg last year, a record high in history. The output of  cotton, tobacco, and oil-bearing crops has remained stable.  Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries  have seen comparatively great development. After topping 100  billion yuan in 1992, the gross output value of township and  town enterprises throughout the province continued to grow in  1993 and was expected to reach 195 billion yuan, an increase of  62.5 percent over the previous year. In 1993 the peasant per  capita net income was estimated at 660 yuan, an increase of 133  yuan over 1990.    He pointed out: We must soberly understand that prominent  problems obstructing the province's agricultural and rural  economic development have not been fundamentally resolved. New  contradictions and problems have emerged in rural reform,  opening up, and economic development. Peasant income increases  slowly, the rural socialized service system is imperfect,  agricultural investment is inadequate, agriculture is not strong  at resisting natural disasters, there are many instable factors  in rural areas, peasant burdens have not been fundamentally  resolved, and the situation in the social order is grim.  [passage omitted]    In conclusion, Li Changchun pointed out: Henan is a big  agricultural province, in which agriculture and the rural  economy play a decisive role in entire national economic and  social development. There is a need to strengthen party  leadership over rural work to bring about faster and better  development in the rural economy. Leading cadres at all levels  should constantly improve their work style and work methods,  strengthen their study and investigation, and enhance their  leadership level. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: IT'S COMMERCIAL DEJA VU AS OLD AD SLOGANS BECOME  THE 'LATEST' THING  </P> <P> When Timex hired a new ad firm last year, officials at the agency told Timex  executives exactly what they didn't want to hear.  </P> <P> Why not bring back the slogan made famous by John Cameron Swayze: "It takes a  licking and keeps on ticking." For that matter, the agency suggested, why not  bring back Swayze himself to say it?  </P> <P> At first, Timex didn't like either idea. For one, Swayze, who is 83, was too  ill at the time to appear in the new ads. And besides, with hot competitors  such as Swatch, Timex desperately wanted to modernize its image -- not reach  back into the vault for a decades-old ad slogan.  </P> <P> But research convinced Timex otherwise. It revived the slogan and is just one  of many advertisers returning to their pasts. An epidemic of nostalgia for the  ads that baby boomers were brought up with seems to be sweeping Madison Avenue  these days. "Two mints in one" recently made a commercial return for Certs. The  "Nestea Plunge" is back again. The familiar "Sometimes you feel like a nut,  sometimes you don't" slogan for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars is back on TV.  And, yes, you are again hearing Campbell's soup's "Mmmmm, Good," and Maxwell  House Coffee's "Good to the last drop."  </P> <P> In the case of Timex, the company asked 2,000 consumers what they remembered  most about the watch maker. "Just about everyone said, 'It takes a licking and  keeps on ticking,' " said Ron Sok, manager of advertising at Timex. "Keep in  mind, we hadn't used that slogan in our ads for 10 years."  </P> <P> So, Timex went back to the future, dusted off its old slogan and added a few  funny modern twists. One ad, which has been running for months, features Timex  watches that are strapped to the bellies of two Sumo wrestlers. And a new  commercial scheduled to be broadcast next month shows a psychic with special  powers who is able to bend a key and a fork, but naturally can't get the Timex  to tick its last tock.  </P> <P> Another new Timex ad that will run next month features an opera singer whose  shrill voice breaks every object in the opera hall -- except the Timex. And for  nostalgia's sake, the new Timex ads even feature the old recordings of stalwart  spokesman Swayze verifying that the watch is, indeed, still ticking. "It's the  best way to leverage the fact that you've been in business for a while," said  Houman Pirdavari, art director at Timex's Minneapolis ad firm, Fallon  McElligott.  </P> <P> Advertisers who are reusing these slogans insist that the trend is not because  of some sort of creativity dearth. Instead, they say, the best slogans often  are the tried and true -- especially when people remember these old campaigns  as if they'd just heard them.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it doesn't matter what you say in ads, just as long as you have the  money to say it over and over again," said Michael Ray, professor of marketing  at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. "Even if you don't  remember an old ad slogan exactly," said Ray, "when you hear it again, it can  jog your mind in a very powerful way."  </P> <P> But some ad executives say the reason for this trend is all too clear. "There  are few really good ideas that people respond to," said Cliff Freeman,  president of the New York ad agency Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners. "For lack of  any new ideas, people fall back on the old ones."  </P> <P> He ought to know. Back in 1973, Freeman wrote the catchy ad slogan for the  Almond Joy and Mounds candy bar commercials. Now, after years of not using the  slogan, Hershey revived it this month in its TV commercials.  </P> <P> But the company says the return to its former slogan was mandated by research  -- not by a lack of new ideas. "We hadn't run that campaign since 1981," said  Bill Stamey, brand manager at Hershey Chocolate USA in Hershey, Pa. "But in our  research, people kept playing it back to us as if we'd never stopped using it."  </P> <P> That's precisely why the maker of Certs also this month began to broadcast the  familiar breath mints ad slogan.  </P> <P> "We were trying to develop new ads for the campaign," said Jo Ann Meyer, senior  vice president and creative director at the New York ad agency Young &amp;  Rubicam. "But every consumer we asked kept repeating that line that's been gone  for seven years."  </P> <P> Using another ad agency's slogan is not something many ad firms like to do. "We  were pretty skeptical," said Meyer. "It's always nice to come up with a  brand-new campaign. But the consumers kept telling us something else." So the  line, "Two mints in one," has returned, but this time it is set to music. The  agency also added the line, "Two is better than one."  </P> <P> And after several years of trying to convince American consumers that "Soup is  good food," Campbell's has dumped the slogan and once again returned to the old  faithful, "Mmmmm, Good."  </P> <P> The company denies that the change is in any way related to investigations by  the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general from nine states, who  have questioned the health claims made for some Campbell products. "The old  standby tested very well with consumers," said Pam Marcus, senior vice  president at Campbell's New York ad agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates. "Besides,  the time is right. Nostalgia is in."  </P> <P> Even the Nestea plunge -- where people take a swig of Nestea and suddenly get  drenched -- recently returned to TV after an eight-year absence.  </P> <P> "We didn't go back to it out of desperation or because we couldn't do something  better," said Richard Di Lallo, senior vice president and creative director at  the New York ad agency J. Walter Thompson. "The research was overwhelming. It  no longer makes sense not to use it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> L.A. Gear Looks at Best Way to Use Jackson  </P> <P> Is Michael Jackson worth $20 million to L.A. Gear?  </P> <P> Maybe. But only if Jackson sings in the commercials -- and only if the ads are  very narrowly targeted toward kids ages 6 to 11. At least, that is the opinion  of Steven Levitt, president of Marketing Evaluations, a Port Washington,  N.Y.-based research firm that is very highly regarded for its detailed research  on celebrities.  </P> <P> "If the ads contain his music and are directed at kids, he could be great for  them," said Levitt. "But if he tries to be a spokesperson or does anything  other than sing and dance, it could be a dismal failure."  </P> <P> Levitt said there are plenty of other celebrities who rate much higher with  kids than Jackson -- including Michael Jordan, who is a spokesman for rival  Nike. And he said Jackson is not particularly popular with teen-agers or  adults. Still, Jackson's popularity with children has remained "extremely high"  since the company began researching the pop star in 1985, he said.  </P> <P> L.A. Gear executives have stated that their new line of athletic shoes,  "Unstoppable," which Jackson will help design and market, will indeed be aimed  at kids. L.A. Gear Chairman Robert Y. Greenberg said Jackson is likely to star  in a L.A. Gear video promoting youth fitness. "He will talk to children of all  ages around the world," said Sandy Saemann, executive vice president at L.A.  Gear.  </P> <P> In the meantime, company executives say that despite the addition of Jackson,  former Los Angeles Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will continue to be a spokesman  for L.A. Gear. A new commercial that features Abdul-Jabbar was recently filmed  but probably will not be broadcast until spring.  </P> <P> Saemann said L.A. Gear plans to build an office for Jackson at its  headquarters. And as for Jackson's corporate title, jested Saemann: "It will be  Sir Michael."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Loic Bouvard, chairman of the  North Atlantic Assembly (NAA), said here Friday [6 May] that the  Republic of China has made exceptional achievements in economic  development ad political reform during the past years, paving  the way for Taiwan's re-entry into international organizations.    Bouvard, who led a five-member NAA delegation to visit  Taipei  recently, said at a news conference before his departure that  the NAA, an affiliated forum of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO), supports the Republic of China's [ROC] bid  to join the United Nations, the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) and other world organizations.    The NAA chairman, who is also vice president of the National  Assembly of France, singled out Taiwan's efforts in removing  trade barriers as "commendable," and its economic performance  "enviable."    Bouvard said he would be pleased to let Taiwan into the  Brussels- based forum as an observer. Japan and Australia are  also observers in the organization.    Jose Lello, a parliamentarian from Portugal, gave a positive  account of Taiwan's protection of human rights and speech  freedoms, saying that Mainland China lags far behind Taiwan in  these two areas.    Taiwan's achievement in upholding human rights and speech  freedoms will be salutary factors supporting the island's bid to  join the international community, including the UN, GATT, and  the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarian Forum, Lello maintained.    The NAA parliamentarians concluded their six-day visit in  Taiwan and left Saturday.    During their stay, the delegation met with ROC Government  officials, lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition  parties, civic leaders and scholars.    Other members of the delegation included Peter Corterier,  NAA  secretary-general and vice foreign minister of the former West  Germany; Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a polish parliamentarian; and  Anders Sjaastad, a Norwegian lawmaker.</p>

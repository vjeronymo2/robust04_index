			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuchin; from the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Sergey Turkov, VESTI's correspondent for the  Kamchatka Oblast, published an article which will surely  interest all fishermen and naval seamen in the Far East basin.  The seine fishing vessel Kamsuda III, belonging to a private  company of the same name, was fishing for cod in the area of  Asacha Bay, southeast of Kamchatka. About midday, the echo  sounder indicated a large school of cod on an isobath of two  hundred meters 10 miles from shore. It was decided to set the  pair of seine. When the sweep was completed and retrieval of  the half-kilometer seine lines began, something puzzling  happened. The vessel stopped, then slowly began to reverse  although the engines were on slow forward. At first it was  thought the bottom had been snagged. However, the cables became  taut, one of them snapping and the second beginning to feed out  from the hold. The ship began to list to starboard.    The seamen on deck realized that something was not right and  elected to seek shelter behind the deck structures out of harm's  way. The captain could in no way understand the reason for what  was going on, because in his many years of experience nothing  like this had ever happened. All this occurred in the space of  minutes. The conning tower of a nuclear-powered submarine  emerged from the water literally a few meters from the vessel  and just starboard of the seiner's stern, while the stern  rudders of the submarine were port of the seiner's bow. That  is, the submarine was directly beneath the vessel.    While the stunned crew was gathering its wits, the submarine  disappeared in a northerly direction, dragging off with it the  pair of seine and two and a half kilometers of cable, leaving  the trawler without fishing gear or cable. The damage caused by  the nuclear submarine was approximately 20 million rubles, not  taking into account lost profits and valuable fishing days. The  seiner was fishing in an authorized area, and there was no  advice on any closure of the area. The captain immediately  reported the incident to the expedition chief aboard the BMRT  [large refrigerated fishing trawler] Tselihar and headed for  port. Of course, there was nothing left to fish with.    On arriving in port, the sailor who was handling the cable  in  the hold and miraculously remained alive after the capture of  the submarine, immediately signed off the vessel. When the  VESTI correspondent arrived aboard the vessel he encountered  Captain Second Rank Gritsay, Kamchatka Naval Flotilla's  assistant flag navigation officer. Gritsay calmed the  correspondent by saying nothing happened, and that the vessel  simply snagged bottom; none of this was connected with any  submarines. However, the submarine--which had returned to  port--was supposedly merely carrying out its combat mission.  When the author of this report expressed his interest as to why  such a high-ranking military chief was aboard such a humble  seiner, the captain second class replied he was simply visiting  an old friend. Meanwhile, the seiner's captain involved in the  incident was intensely writing explanatory notes and making  extracts from the ship's logs.    I will add that this is the second occasion in which a  submarine was caught off Kamchatka. In 1976 the medium  refrigerated fishing trawler Som, belonging to the  Kamchatrybkolkhozobyedineniye fishing fleet  department--presently called the Akros Company-- caught a  submarine in an authorized fishing area.</p>

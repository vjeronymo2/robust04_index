			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Norske Skog at NKr92m pre-tax Norske Skog, the Norwegian pulp, paper and building materials producer, yesterday reported a sharp rise in pre-tax profit to NKr92m (Dollars 13.7m) in the first eight months, compared with NKr9m in the same period last year. The improvement was attributed to increased production and higher prices for pulp and building materials. Group sales advanced to NKr5.7bn from NKr4.9bn as operating profit increased more than four-fold to NKr387m from NKr93m. Norske Skog said demand for its products had made it possible to increase prices for pulp, building products and special grades of paper. However, prices for newsprint and magazine paper - normally sold under contracts of one year duration - could not be raised before next January. 'If they are increased, it will be the first rise since the price decline of about 30 per cent in 1991-92,' Norske Skog said. The group charged accounts with financial items of NKr216m against a NKr7m gain in the same period last year. Included in the figures is a loss of NKr123 on the bond portfolio, against a gain of NKr220m last year. For the individual business units, fibre lifted sales to NKr887m from NKr661 and returned an operating profit of NKr37m against a loss of NKr145m last year. Paper increased sales by NKr520m to NKr3.7bn as operating profit rose by NKr67m to NKr308m. Building materials saw sales rise by NKr89m to NKr1.25bn as operating profit more than doubled to NKr80m from NKr33m. Norske Skog expects a stable profit trend during this year's final period.</p>

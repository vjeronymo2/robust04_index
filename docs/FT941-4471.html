			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Ukraine gas supplies resume Russia's gas company, Gazprom, yesterday agreed to resume gas supplies to Ukraine until April 10, giving Kiev one month's grace in which to resolve its Dollars 900m (Pounds 616.4m) gas debt to Russia. During talks in Moscow, Ukraine agreed to pay half the debt in cash and the remainder in equipment, thus giving Russia part-ownership of Ukraine's gas industry. But Gazprom the chairman, Mr Rem Vyakhirev, kept the pressure on Ukraine to make good on this new deal, saying: 'If we do not restore order together by April 10, deliveries of gas to Ukraine will be cut off completely.' Last week, Russia reduced gas deliveries to Ukraine by 75 per cent.</p>

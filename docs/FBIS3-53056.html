			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordanian banks which used to have branches  in the occupied West Bank prior to 1967 will be allowed to  reopen one branch each in the next two months, Information  Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Sunday [9 January].    Dr. al-'Anani, a Jordanian strategist in Middle East peace  talks who played a key role in finalising an economic  cooperation agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation  on Friday, said opening of new banks would be considered after  giving priority to those which had branches in the occupied West  Bank on June 4, 1967--one day before the war started.    Eight Jordanian banks had 31 branches in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip when Israel occupied the territories. Those in the  West Bank followed Jordanian laws. All banks in the Gaza Strip,  including two branches of two Jordanian banks, were governed by  Egyptian regulations.    Cairo-Amman Bank reopened in 1986 under a special  arrangement, but it had to curtail its branches' activities  mainly to money changing because of Israeli regulations.    Palestinians could not get loans from the bank for two  reasons: first: the bank had to deposit 110 per cent of the  loan amount with the bank of Israel and second, the Palestinians  were reluctant to mortgage their land as collateral for fear of  seizures by the bank and the eventuality that an Israeli might  end up as the ultimate buyer of the land.    The accord finalised Friday after three days of talks sets  out a broad framework for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation.  Among other things, it clears the way for Jordan to implement a  memorandum of understanding it signed with Israel on Dec. 1 on  reopening the bank branches.    Dr. al-'Anani said priority would also be given to banks  applying to reopen branches in Jericho and the Gaza Strip in  view of a request made by the Palestinian negotiators.    The West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip are  expected  to be transferred to limited Palestinian self-rule authority in  line with the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement between Israel and the  PLO.    The main base of the self-rule authority is expected to be  located in Jericho.    Dr. al-'Anani said CBJ regulations would be applicable to  banks in the West Bank as well as the Gaza Strip. The memo  signed with Israel on Dec. 1 provides for reopening the branches  in the West Bank and, as officials said later, Jordan had to  work out a separate accord on the Gaza Strip.    Under the memo, the Bank of Israel will issue a token  approval for the banks already licensed by the Central Bank of  Jordan (CBJ). The obligations of the reopened branches to the  Bank of Israel will be limited to sending a periodic report on  their activities.    Dr. al-'Anani said the permission to reopen one branch each  will be followed by permissions for others. But in the  beginning, each of the banks will be allowed to open only one  branch.    A joint Jordanian-Palestinian technical committee will work  under the guidance of the CBJ in processing the reopening of the  branches.    The joint panel will also set monetary policies aimed at  protecting and maintaining the stability of the Jordanian dinar.    The seven branches that the Cairo-Amman Bank operates in the  occupied territories now would also be brought under total CBJ  control, after ending the 1986 arrangement, Dr. al-'Anani said.    Dr. al-'Anani noted that the economic agreement also  provides  for the use of other currencies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,  but that it excludes the Israeli shekel.    Israel said that the shekel would have to remain in  circulation in the autonomous territory; palestinian officials  say that it would be impossible to eliminate the shekel  altogether from the occupied lands during the interim period,  particularly that tens of thousands of Palestinians would  continue to be employed in Israel and be paid in the Israeli  currency.    Israeli officials have suggested that the Palestinians could  issue a currency similar to the Scotish pound. Although issued  by Scotland as a sign of Scotish identity, the currency remains  under the control of the bank of England.    The Egyptian pound, which was in force in the Gaza Strip  until Israel seized the costal strip from Egypt in the 1967 war,  will be among the currencies in circulation.    The pound is sparingly used in the Gaza Strip now. According  to reports, only Gazans wishing to travel to Egypt across the  Rafah border buys Egyptian pounds for use in Egyptian territory.    According to PLO sources, the use of Egyptian pounds in the  autonomous territories is part of commitments that PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat has made to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, with  whom he has stepped up coordination.    Mr. 'Arafat, who seems to have abandoned for the moment the  idea of issuing a Palestinian currency during the interim  period, also reportedly sees the use of more than one Arab  currency in the autonomous territory as a symbol of Palestinian  links with the Arabs while asserting Palestinian independence.</p>

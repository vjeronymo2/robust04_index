			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Approach to debts criticised BUILDING societies, utilities and local authorities are exacerbating consumer debt troubles by their heavy-handed and inflexible approach, according to the National Consumer Council. In its annual survey of advice centres, the government-funded council says that difficulties over paying for essential services such as water, housing and fuel form a high proportion of cases requiring help. The troubles brought to advice agencies are often linked in cycles that are difficult to break. For example, people who have difficulty in paying bills may be asked for a deposit in advance, which they cannot afford. The council points out that consumers on low incomes often have to pay more for essential services such as gas and electricity. Pre-payment meters, which are helpful to consumers on a limited income, are more expensive than quarterly billing. The National Consumer Council also blames suppliers and local authorities for delays and errors that posed further obstacles to consumers. The collection of the poll tax has been particularly difficult, with confusing billing methods and unclear instructions. The recession appears to be leading to a tightening-up on debt collection procedures, according to the survey. The council gives a warning that lack of understanding and inflexibility about renegotiating repayments often made debt delays worse. The council concludes that 'with a little patience, understanding and with sensible budgeting, most consumer debts can be repaid'. Advice Monitor.

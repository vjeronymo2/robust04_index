			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Boxed in at TSB TSB's new strategy might be more convincing if it did not read as though it had come straight out of a business school text book. It might also be more persuasive had it not come from the bank that clinched the Pounds 777m Hill Samuel acquisition and developed the disastrous Mortgage Express - a venture which is now selling repossessed houses at an average loss of Pounds 35,000 each. Total quality management is clearly arriving at the TSB none too soon. There are certainly worries. Focusing on personal business in the retail bank may be the only real option open to TSB, but it offers a far from certain future. Personal lending and other financial services are becoming increasingly competitive - as the establishment of NatWest Life demonstrates. With too many banks and building societies chasing too little business, returns are likely to fall. TSB risks being squeezed between the building societies' lower cost base and the big clearers' range of services. And, ironically, trussing up Hill Samuel to make it attractive to a buyer may deny TSB the painfully-earned rewards of any recovery in the commercial sector. In the shorter term there is at least a 25 per cent yield premium to the market for the shares to hang on to. If the bad loans have finally been cleaned out, then provisions may fall this year and investors may warm to the recovery story, but the bank has disappointed on bad loans before. Last year's revenues owe something to one-off factors such as gilt sales, while the scope for further cost reductions must be limited. Unless the banking sector can find new income streams, TSB looks like a bank with nowhere to go.</p>

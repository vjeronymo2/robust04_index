			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Suicide car bomb attack kills eight in Israel: Revenge attack by Islamic extremists fails to derail Cairo peace talks A suicide car bomber blew up a bus in Israel yesterday killing eight people and wounding at least 45. The extremist Islamic Hamas movement said it carried out the attack in revenge for the massacre of Palestinians in Hebron in February. Witnesses said children fled the explosion 'burning like torches' when the 385lb bomb exploded at midday at a central bus stop in the relatively peaceful northern town of Afula. The attack, one of the bloodiest yet seen inside Israel itself, prompted the government to seal off the occupied territories preventing Palestinian cars crossing into the Jewish state. The bomb blast coincided with talks in Cairo between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on implementing their peace deal. However, Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, said the peace talks would continue. Otherwise 'we are placing ourselves in the hands of these suicide bombers - and that is their wish'. The bombing by Hamas, which had vowed to avenge the lives of 29 Palestinians massacred by a Jewish settler in Hebron, will fuel growing Israeli right-wing opposition to the peace process. As promised, Hamas struck 40 days after the February 25 Hebron massacre  - the mourning period which, in Islam, must be observed before revenge can be taken. The Islamic movement warned Israel that suicide operations would increase. Shlomi Dahn, an 18-year-old schoolboy who ran to the scene after the blast, said screaming people whose clothes were on fire were trying to escape from the bus. 'It was like a battlefield,' he said. 'Bodies and parts of bodies were everywhere and there was blood, noise, smoke - everything like war.' Mr David Harbi, keeper of a music store who rushed to the scene, had burns on his hands where he had tried to douse flames on the victims' clothes. 'It was like the worst nightmare of the Jews,' he said - 'the feeling that if the Arabs have the chance they will drive us into the sea or kill us all'. In the aftermath Arabs in the town were randomly beaten. Israeli teenagers gathered at the charred bus stop to denounce the peace process and the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister. They chanted 'Kill the Arabs', and sang songs praising Dr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who was responsible for the massacre at Hebron. Mr Harbi said: 'The absurd thing was that in one of the school bags I saw Arabic language books. The child was trying to learn Arabic to prepare for the peace. Can you imagine that? If this is the price we have to pay for peace, we don't want it anymore.' Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: Mr Nabil Shaath, who has led the Palestinian delegation in talks with Israel on self-rule for Gaza-Jericho, said such incidents were 'one of the reasons we are pushing for the signing of this agreement - to stop the killing on both sides.' The attack showed the urgent need to complete as soon as possible the details of an Israeli withdrawal, he said. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

Cities will be selected next year by  soccer's world governing body, FIFA.  </P> <P> "At this point our intentions are to bid," Johnson said. He said the problem of  installing grass over the artificial turf could be overcome.  </P> <P> Twenty-seven cities, including Los Angeles and Pasadena, have indicated that  they will bid for games by the Dec. 14 deadline. Berlin said Denver's Mile High  Stadium probably will join the list.  </P></p>

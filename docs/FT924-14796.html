			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Smooth ride for the 'bus candidate' IT takes the chutzpah of Mr Kenneth Clarke to boast of making a flat speech to conference. But then it is the home secretary's easy confidence that is proving one of the more interesting sideshows of the week in Brighton. In a post-speech briefing yesterday he complimented the delegates for their 'more mature' attitude to the law and order debate - in the past a ritual demonstration of Tory bloodlust. 'It was a serious and perfectly sensible debate and I'm glad about that,' he said. 'It is the first time as far as I know that not a sole member of the audience mentioned hanging or flogging - the Birmingham Six case has had its effect.' That frank appraisal came with the observation that law and order probably was a more relevant issue to the public than all the Conservatives' public hand-wringing about the Maastricht treaty. Such calming sentiments are just one reason why Mr Clarke is increasingly seen as the 'bus candidate' for the leadership - the man most likely to succeed should Mr John Major disappear under a double-decker. All week, indeed, all last week as well, it has been the ever-relaxed, affably-voiced, suede-shoed home secretary who has appeared before the cameras to bat aside the increasingly vituperative rhetoric of the anti-Maastricht legions. He incurred their wrath on Tuesday by acknowledging that he had not read the treaty and opining that probably few of his cabinet colleagues had done so either. While provoking paroxysms from the rebels, this very human - not to say unpolitical - admission clearly appeals to the large element in the party for whom life-and-death issues are both wearying and slightly improbable. Yesterday, a similar, anti-hysterical tone pervaded Mr Clarke's law and order speech. Britain was not any more lawless a country than its neighbours, indeed, perhaps less so. But he had identified a specific group of juvenile delinquent offenders who were at the root of a huge quantity of crime. It was no good for them and no good for us, he pragmatically observed, so he would do something about it. Later, Mr Clarke was at it again, casually dismissing the imminent arrival of Lady Thatcher as an amusing but rather irrelevant sideshow. 'We always used to have our dust-ups in this great movement of ours,' he observed. 'It was only Margaret who shut them down. What is new now is that we also have the battle of the biographies.' Cornered for a few remarks on his former employer, Mr Clarke happily volunteered that he though it a bit rich that the woman who had brought Britain into the exchange rate mechanism was now attacking it. 'Margaret saying 'I didn't mean to do it, I was bullied'' amounted to 'denying the history of her premiership', he said, laughing at the image of Mr Major twisting the prime ministerial arm behind her back. On the treaty itself, he merely observed: 'We will get it through . . with difficulty.' To some, the Clarke style of infinite reasonableness is irritating. But to many others in what, after all, has often been called the non-political party, it makes a refreshing change from the destructive ideological warfare that the Thatcher epoch left in its wake.</p>

Ciskei Civil Servants Association (Cisa) Secretary General  Mthimkhulu Mashiya said on Friday [11 March] that although there  was dissatisfaction about pensions and related matters, civil  servants had hoped their fears would be addressed by military  ruler Brig Oupa Gqozo.    Mr Mashiya criticised Brig Gqozo, however, saying the Ciskei  leader had found time to address his soldiers, but not the civil  servants.</p>

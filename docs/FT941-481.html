			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Obituary: Sir Roy Griffiths - NHS reformer Sir Roy Griffiths, the government's adviser on National Health Service management reforms, and before that managing director of J. Sainsbury, the retailer, has died at the age of 67. The publication of the Griffiths report in 1983 heralded the most radical reform of the health service since it was established in 1948 by Aneurin Bevan, Labour minister of health. Without this report, the controversial recent introduction of the internal health market would have been impossible. Sir Roy proposed introducing hospitals to standard general management principles, with chief executives and directors of finance. Until then they had been run on a consensus and committee-led model. His proposal to create 1,000 general managers was accepted by the government, and introduced gradually over the period to 1988, with far less controversy than attended many other public-sector reforms of the time. His second significant contribution to the health service concerned the establishment of the 'care in the community' policy, which was started a year ago after his report on the subject in 1987. This included the recommendation that local authorities should be the lead bodies for providing community care. In spite of wide disagreements, the government accepted his view in the only significant extension of local authorities' power and responsibilities since the Conservatives came to office in 1979. He remained a defender of the managerial culture he had introduced as ministers attacked alleged NHS bureaucracy. He was already a successful businessman when he started his work on the health service, having been a director of Sainsbury's from 1968 to 1991. While he was managing director, from 1979 to 1988, the supermarket chain enjoyed strong growth and achieved its present position as the UK's largest retailer.</p>

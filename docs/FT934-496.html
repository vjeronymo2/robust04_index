			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Battle for Paramount not over yet The Dollars 10bn, three-month takeover battle for US entertainment group Paramount Communications entered its final leg yesterday with television shopping business QVC Network holding an edge over cable TV company Viacom. The advantage, however, could be temporary. In a significant psychological shift, the Paramount board recommended on Wednesday night that shareholders accept QVC's previously-hostile offer, rather than a lower, but friendly, bid from Viacom. Paramount's board, chaired by Mr Martin Davis, had previously shunned QVC's advances. This, however, does not clinch the battle. Under the rules drawn up for an auction of Paramount, both bidders are free to increase their offers for the company until January 7. Their tenders for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares will expire at midnight, New York time, on that day. Shareholders remain free to accept either offer. Paramount said Viacom was considering raising its offer. Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman, is believed to have been discussing additional financing with media and communications partners. These include Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain. The Paramount board voted unanimously on Wednesday morning to enter a merger agreement with QVC - a decision which must have been difficult for Mr Davis, who has a history of personal animosity with Mr Barry Diller, QVC head and a leading film industry figure. Under the merger agreement with Viacom, Mr Davis would remain chief executive of the combined group. If QVC wins, he will almost certainly be ousted by Mr Diller, who clashed repeatedly with Mr Davis when he headed the group's Paramount Pictures film business in the 1980s. However, the board had little choice but to recommend QVC's offer, made before a Monday night auction dealine, since it was significantly higher than Viacom's. Directors were under instruction from the Delaware supreme court to seek the highest value for shareholders. QVC is offering Dollars 92 in cash for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock, compared with Dollars 85 from Viacom. Both are offering bundles of securities for the remaining 49 per cent. QVC's offer for the entire group is worth around Dollars 10bn, while Viacom's is at some Dollars 9.5bn. However, since many on Wall Street believe both companies are paying a high price for Paramount, the perceived winner of the bid on any day is seen by the market as a loser. This is depressing its share price and the securities element of its bid. The ultimate winner is likely to be whichever company puts most cash on the table. Lex, Back Page</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Beginning of a difficult year for LVMH THE Guinness restructuring came as a blow to LVMH, the French luxury goods group chaired by Mr Bernard Arnault, which is one of Guinness' biggest shareholders with a 24 per cent stake. Its shares were suspended in Paris yesterday pending the Guinness announcement, as were other companies linked to Mr Bernard Arnault, LVMH 's chairman, including Christian Dior, the fashion house, and the Bon Marche retailing group. LVMH warned in October that both net profits and sales would be static in 1992 - at FFr3.7bn (Dollars 680m) and FFr22bn respectively - but yesterday cut its profit estimate to FFr3bn, mainly due to the shortfall in its contribution from Guinness. LVMH, which owns some of France's most famous brand names such as Moet et Chandon champagne and Louis Vuitton luggage as well as its stake in Guinness, is already struggling in the sluggish luxury goods market. A year ago it seemed poised for a robust recovery from 1991, when it was badly affected by the Gulf war. Analysts anticipated a sharp increase in net profits to as much as FFr4.4bn for 1992. Forecasts fell steadily throughout the year as the problems posed by the US recession were aggravated by the economic instability of Japan and the European slowdown. By the final quarter prospects were clouded by the relative strength of the French franc after the September currency crisis and by the threat of a Franco-US trade war. LVMH said yesterday that its own interests showed a slight decline in 1993, when the downturn in wine and spirits offset growth from perfume and luggage. However it is confident of an improvement in 1993 due to the US recovery and more favourable currencies. Mr Regis Aubert, analyst at Cholet Dupont in Paris, is waiting for more details on LVMH's fourth-quarter performance before reviewing his estimate of FFr3.9bn net profits for 1993. He said: 'It will still be a difficult year, but it's too soon to judge how difficult.'</p>

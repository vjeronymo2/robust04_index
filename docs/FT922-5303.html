			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (2): Breaking a high-energy diet is not easy - The Economy MANY Singaporeans, led by nervous stock market speculators, have become more gloomy this year about the country's economy than the economic fundamentals themselves appear to warrant. They justify their fears by recalling the recession of 1985 and 1986, by reminding themselves of Singapore's dependence on a slow-moving world economy, and by pointing to the government's latest (and reduced) forecast for growth of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent this year, compared with 6.7 per cent last year and 8.3 per cent in 1990. This sense of foreboding is shared neither by foreign businessmen nor by the government. And it is not reflected in the latest surveys of manufacturing and service companies on the island, which broadly predict stable business conditions for the next few months. The important disk drive industry, troubled last year by falling demand, expects business to improve. Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, regards the moderation of Singapore's growth rate as desirable and inevitable as the economy matures. 'There were clear signs that we had been growing too fast; quite clearly signs that we were overheating,' he told the Financial Times in an interview. 'We have been looking to get away from an 8-10 per cent growth diet to 5-6 per cent growth,' he said. 'But breaking a high-energy diet is not easy. Manufacturers and others get used to it.' Not everyone is going on a diet anyway. Motorola's plant, for example, has been working seven days a week making pagers and other data products to supply a rapidly-expanding Asian market and to meet North American demand which is still growing at 5-7 per cent a year. Singapore's strategy of marketing itself as a regional service hub focusing on advanced electronics, aerospace and other high-technology industries, and farming out labour-intensive work to neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, shows no sign of faltering. More than 3,000 multinational companies, attracted by the efficiency of the port, the airport, the telecommunications network and the rest of the island's infrastructure, have invested in Singapore, and the government hopes to attract more from Hong Kong with the approach of Chinese rule there. Motorola is considering making Singapore its regional headquarters - it would benefit from tax incentives under the Operational Headquarters programme - and already uses Singapore government subsidies to train its research and development engineers to masters degree level. Unit labour costs may be rising, but as a proportion of product content they are falling, says Mr Robert Becknell, Far East vice-president responsible for Motorola's paging and telepoint systems. 'We are evolving into a stage where labour is a very small part of our total cost,' he says. 'The designs are becoming more sophisticated. The manufacturing process is becoming highly automated. The people who need to work in the factory must be of higher and higher educational levels all the time. Technical support must be better.' With its well-planned infrastructure and increasing technological sophistication, Singapore is ahead of its partners in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. But the government is still concerned about Singapore's competitiveness relative to the other newly-industrialised economies (NIEs) - Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Unemployment remains minimal in Singapore, and real wage growth amounted to 7.6 per cent in 1991, while labour productivity grew by only 1.5 per cent. 'This marks the third year in a row where real wage growth has exceeded productivity gains,' Mr Hu said in his budget speech, noting with concern that the country's unit labour costs in manufacturing rose by 7.5 per cent compared to the other NIEs. 'This brings our relative competitiveness position to that in 1982 and 1983,' he said. Although the strength of the Singapore dollar is partly to blame, the government is anxious to ensure that its workforce remains competitive and has increased funding for education and training, and attempted to encourage foreign companies to set up research and development groups in Singapore. Singapore has made its name by planning economic development with ruthless efficiency from the centre and by encouraging foreign companies to invest in the island. But small companies complain that they have been ignored in favour of the big multinationals, and Singaporeans are afraid that over-regulation and prosperity have deprived them of the sort of entrepreneurs for which Hong Kong is famous. The cautionary characteristic of Singaporean business has blunted the government's attempts to persuade local businesses to invest surplus capital abroad, although Singaporean traders and investors have started to make inroads in Cambodia and Vietnam. For the energetic Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development Board, Singapore has simply become a victim of its own success. 'The more you educate a man the more risk-averse he is,' he says, suggesting that the best way to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit is to train too many people or to bring them into the country from outside. 'If PhDs have no job they start doing something. Entrepreneurship comes from adversity,' says Mr Yeo. 'So long as we have full employment in Singapore, there's no entrepreneurship. . . That's the disadvantage of Singapore. We've done too good a job.'</p>

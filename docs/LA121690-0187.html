			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> TYNER, BYRNE LEAD ROYAL TO TITLE, 77-65  </P> <P> David Tyner's 14 first-quarter points gave Royal High what figured to be an  insurmountable lead in Saturday night's championship game of the Beverly Hills  tournament.  </P> <P> But when Redondo mounted a fourth-quarter comeback, cutting the Highlanders'  16-point lead to two, Tyner again came to the rescue, scoring eight points in  the final 3 minutes 15 seconds as Royal won the championship, 77-65.  </P> <P> Royal (7-1) led, 26-14, after the first quarter, 35-26 at halftime and 50-39  after three quarters. A basket by Jared Byrne, named the tournament's most  outstanding player, and two free throws and a three-point basket by Tyner  boosted the lead to 57-41 early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> But the Sea Hawks (6-3) responded with a 16-2 run, cutting the lead to 59-57  with 4:37 left. Redondo's Ted Silva and Jason Correa both missed shots that  would have tied the score, and Silva missed the front end of a one and one.  </P> <P> Redondo again closed to within two when Silva's basket cut Royal's lead to  63-61 with three minutes left. Tyner, who finished with 31 points, then ignited  a game-closing 14-4 spurt.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Ventura 66, Saugus 55 -- The Cougars, who have won this tournament a record  eight times, came away with the consolation title, breaking open what had been  a close contest by scoring the game's final eight points, all from the  free-throw line.  </P> <P> Ventura (3-3) held Saugus (5-3) scoreless after Chris Hernandez's layup cut the  Cougar lead to 58-55 with 1:22 left.  </P> <P> Jon Seiler made four free throws and Larry Anter and Curtis Vaughn each hit two  to seal the victory.  </P> <P> "We played very well," said Ventura Coach Dan Larson, the tournament's most  valuable player when he led the Cougars to championships in 1976 and 1977. "We  overcame a stupid first half. We only turned the ball over twice in the second  half against a real tough defense."  </P> <P> Saugus shot 33.8% from the field, making 22 of 65 attempts.  </P> <P> "We had the wrong guys shooting the ball, which I guess is my fault," Saugus  Coach John Clark said. "I didn't think we were very tough down the stretch  inside."  </P> <P> Playing in a gym forever immortalized in the film "It's a Wonderful Life,"  Saugus led, 45-43, after three quarters. After Ventura's Chris Rockwell and  Hernandez exchanged baskets to open the quarter, the Cougars went on a 9-2 run,  taking a lead they would not relinquish.  </P> <P> Ventura held a 28-27 lead at intermission. But the advantage and the game  almost got away from the Cougars. Geoff Dains hit three three-point shots,  giving Saugus a 38-30 lead. Ventura regrouped with a 7-0 spurt later in the  quarter.  </P> <P> Seiler (17 points) led three Cougar players in double figures. Mike Ryken added  14 and Randy Martinez 12. Dains led Saugus with 17 points and foul-plagued  center Greg Yumbar had 11.  </P> <P> Buena 81, Rolling Hills 77 -- Lance Fay's three free throws in the final 42  seconds clinched the win for Buena (4-3) in the fifth-place game.  </P> <P> Fay, who was named to the all-tournament team, and Matt Burtolin each had 18  for Buena. Nick Houchin and Matt Egan contributed 16 and 13.  </P> <P> Notre Dame 54, Rio Mesa 51 -- Kirk Miller's two free throws with 31 seconds  left gave Notre Dame its final margin of victory in the seventh-place game.  </P> <P> G. C. Marcaccini had a game-high 21 points, plus 11 rebounds for Notre Dame  (7-3). Monte Marcaccini, G. C.'s sophomore brother, added 11 points and a  game-high 12 rebounds. Manuk Kayaoglu, a foreign exchange student from Turkey,  scored 16 points for Rio Mesa (1-5).  </P> <P> Glendale 56, Westlake 49 -- Jerry Armen had 19 points and six assists and Jason  Harper had 12 points and 12 rebounds for Glendale (3-4) in a consolation game.  </P></p>

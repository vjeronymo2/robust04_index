			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: MITIE moves ahead 30% to Pounds 943,000 MITIE Group, the Greenock-based building services company, made strong headway at the interim stage despite what Mr David Telling, chairman, described as 'even more difficult conditions than last year'. On turnover ahead 60 per cent to Pounds 35.6m, pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 943,000 - a rise of 30 per cent on the comparable Pounds 726,000. Earnings per share, however, expanded by a more modest 12 per cent to 5.7p (5.1p) reflecting a 36 per cent tax charge, up from 33.5 per cent, and increased minority interests. The interim dividend goes up from 1.25p to 1.5p.</p>

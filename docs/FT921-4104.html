			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Washington rejects EC report on air subsidies WASHINGTON yesterday rejected an EC report that indirect US subsidies to its aircraft industry should be considered in tandem with European government underwriting of the Airbus. The Commerce Department said an inter-agency review of the EC report had concluded: The US did not engage in 'massive, systematic support' of its commercial aircraft industry; this constituted 'old, discredited claims' first made by Airbus Industrie in 1988; US policies were not designed to provide 'direct or indirect' commercial advantages to specific companies or projects through defence and aerospace R&amp;D contracts; The EC report was described as a blatant attempt to deflect attention from current talks on Airbus subsidies; The report greatly exaggerated 'crossover' or spin-off benefits to the US industry, while ignoring similar benefits accruing in Europe for Europe. Last month, the US gave the EC until March 31 to agree a plan to cut subsidies to Airbus Industrie. The US considers its case has been strengthened by the Gatt ruling in January condemning German exchange-rate support for Deutsche Airbus, the German partner in the consortium. Yesterday, the Commerce Department restated its belief that the subsidies issue had to be resolved. 'US industry cannot continue to compete against European Treasuries,' an official said. Airbus Industrie has said it will retaliate if the US tries to step up pressure on the European aircraft consortium in the dispute over subsidies to aircraft builders, AP reports from Paris. Airbus's chief executive Jean Pierson told Le Monde that US negotiators had made 'outrageous' new demands for financial 'transparency' last month.</p>

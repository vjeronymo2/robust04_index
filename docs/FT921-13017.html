			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Observer: Fun of the chase The odd thing about Peter Greenall, 38-year-old new managing director of Warrington's Greenalls, is that he seems so keen to be seen as nothing more than a regular business man. He has plenty of perks not available to the ordinary executive. He lives in the family village of Daresbury, four miles south of Warrington, and will inherit the baronetcy when his father dies. Like his legendary grandfather, he is a great fox-hunter, chairs Aintree racecourse, and reputedly enjoys entertaining royals with his substantial fortune. So why put up with the humdrum world of business? The correlation between net worth and motivation is not very direct, he says, citing Edgar Bronfman of Seagram as an example of a much wealthier drinks merchant who works just as hard. Perhaps so, but it's rare indeed to find the seventh generation of a firm-owning family prepared to work as hard as the first.</p>

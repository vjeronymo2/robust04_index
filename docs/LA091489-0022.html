			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PERSONALITY  </P> <P> Sharon A. Bolton has been named partner and vice president of Dartmouth  Development Co., a newly formed real estate development firm in Del Mar. She  will be responsible for marketing and sales.  </P> <P> Before joining Dartmouth two months ago, Bolton was a vice president at Bedford  Properties, developer of the master-planned community of Rancho California. In  that position, she was responsible for managing the sales of more than 16,000  acres, including the Oakridge Ranches project in Rancho California.  </P> <P> Bolton, 45, also spent several years as an outside real estate saleswoman and  has owned her own Orange County advertising agency with clients including  Knott's Berry Farm and Lion Country Safari. Her marketing and sales career  began in the late 1960s.  </P> <P> "Basically, my background is more one of experience than of a fancy educational  dossier," she said. "Experience-wise, I started working in 1967, doing  marketing and planning for Mission Viejo Co., which was just a baby then."  </P> <P> Bolton then went to work at the Irvine Co. as assistant manager of the firm's  Fashion Island project in Newport Beach before starting her own ad agency.  </P> <P> Always an active community volunteer, Bolton founded PHASE in 1974. She  developed the nonprofit group, which grew to 2,200 members, to serve the needs  and utilize the skills of newly divorced and widowed women who had never worked  outside the home before.  </P> <P> "PHASE's primary purpose was to help women get employment," Bolton said. "I was  married 12 years before I got divorced, but there were women out there who had  been married 30 and 40 years who had never done anything besides take care of  the house and family."  </P> <P> Bolton said that what started as a way for women to market their organizational  skills rapidly became a major support network that drew national attention.  </P> <P> "We published a magazine and sold memberships to women, and advertised to  people who found these women were a very specialized market," she said. "It  took off like wildfire then. I went on television, was in front-page articles,  and all of a sudden I was a celebrity."  </P> <P> Bolton moved to Rancho California nine years ago with her second husband,  Robert, and their three children. They raise thoroughbred horses on their  50-acre ranch. CAROLINE LEMKE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Opinion" column by 'Izz al-Din Darwish: "New Crime by </F> Iraqi Regime"]    [Text] The murder of the Iraqi opposition figure, Shaykh  Talib al-Suhayl al-Tamimi, is still alive on the political and  judicial levels in Lebanon, especially after Iraqi diplomats  confessed to the murder.    Preliminary investigations prove the assassination was  carried out by direct orders from Baghdad and that a large  sabotage network, including diplomats, carried out the operation.    Perhaps it is not unusual for the Iraqi regime to carry out  such practices because it relies on methods of killing and  bodily liquidation as official policy, even inside Iraq. The  question is: What could the Iraqi regime reap from such murder?    The deceased shaykh had lived in Lebanon for a long time.  Lebanese circles say he respected the principles governing his  presence as a guest and was not a direct threat to the Iraqi  regime, although he devoted his life to serving his people's  causes.    It is indeed very sad for Iraqis to see their regime  implementing these murders. But the fact remains that the Iraqi  regime continues to live in isolation, outside the contemporary  world. It is futile even to imagine that there is any  possibility that this regime will behave differently and stop  its ugly methods, known to Iraqis, Arabs, and foreigners alike.    Iraqis are sad and indignant because of the crimes committed  by their regime. This is indisputable. They are not just  witnessing what is happening, but are confronting it with the  means at their disposal, waiting for the right opportunity.    It is unacceptable and unreasonable for conditions in Iraq  to  continue as they are now and for the regime to continue gambling  with the fate of the land and people, after all the disasters it  brought to them over the past years -- disasters whose  humiliating results are impossible to comprehend.    Nevertheless, the Iraqi regime continues to dispatch  sabotage, sedition, and killing missions without doing anything  positive about Iraq, which is now under trusteeship and whose  people are suffering pain and want.    Many strings connected with al-Suhayl's murder have been  unraveled. The Iraqi charge d'affaires in Beirut himself heard  what the detained diplomats said about the murder and the  instructions they had received directly from Baghdad.    Lebanon has regained its strength and unity. It has said it  will not allow sabotage gangs, whether they are Israeli or are  linked with the Saddam regime, to carry out acts of killing and  terrorism on its territory, that all the vicious acts will be  referred to the law so the killers will take the punishment they  deserve.</p>

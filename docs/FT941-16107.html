With the Association of British Orchestras, BT has commissioned the Scottish composer James MacMillan to write a work which will be played by all the orchestras in 1994-95. The first performance will be at the Barbican in London on September 21 and will feature the London Symphony Orchestra. In subsequent years the commission will go to another composer.</p>

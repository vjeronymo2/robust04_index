			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Budapest sell-off excites western Europe banks Three west European banks are considering bids for Hungary's Budapest Bank, one of the country's top four commercial banks, in a display of renewed enthusiasm for acquisitions in the former communist bloc. Credit Suisse and ING Bank are understood to have emerged in the past few weeks as potential contenders in what would be one of eastern Europe's biggest bank privatisations. They join Credit Agricole, the French co-operative bank, which has for several months shown interest in taking a stake. It is the only main contender to have conducted a 'due diligence' investigation of the Hungarian target. Some bankers in Budapest had singled out Credit Agricole as the strongest or even sole bidder until the emergence of the three possible rivals. A stake in Budapest Bank would provide Credit Suisse with a means of expansion to the east after the failure of its approach to Creditanstalt of Austria. Hungary expects to name a preferred bidder or bidders on November 17, which gives Credit Agricole time advantage. But to open up the race, the state bank and its advisers have given the last-minute bidders another fortnight to prepare proposals. The successful industry investor is expected to pair up with the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The most likely option is that together they would hold a majority and the EBRD would hold the swing vote. Creditanstalt, one of Austria's leading banks, explored an offer but management divisions are understood to have inhibited an approach. The sharpening rivalry for Budapest Bank marks a shift in western banks' strategies in eastern Europe. State banks in the region have shown a strong propensity to make bad loans and the preferred means of establishing a presence has been to set up stand-alone branches. But in two deals in the last 12 months ING Bank and Bayerische Landesbank took 25 per cent stakes in a Polish and a Hungarian bank respective-ly. Budapest Bank's privatisation could be the most significant transaction to date. Much depends on the terms and shareholding offered. But it has total assets of Ft156.6bn (Dollars 1.47bn), and a Hungarian official hoped for a purchase price of up to Dollars 100m.</p>

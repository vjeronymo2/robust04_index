			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Precedent for belt-tightening Sir, I was interested in Barry Riley's remarks (The Long View, October 24) where he says that '. . . devaluation only works if real incomes are cut'; and at the end of the same paragraph '. . . that British employees fiercely resist nominal pay cuts'. In the Netherlands, such cuts have been made in the past - for instance, in 1951, the early 1980s and possibly even now. The system of tripartite wage negotiations (government, employees' and employers' federations) seems to have helped. Should you wish to talk to the ministry of finance in the Hague about it, the key words to use would probably be 'bestedings-beperking' and 'inleveren', meaning roughly 'scaling down expenditure' and 'temporary belt-tightening by everyone'.

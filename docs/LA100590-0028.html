			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THE CRIMES OF SILBERMAN MAY YET RETURN TO HAUNT GOLDING'S  FUTURE  </P> <P> The common wisdom is that Supervisor Susan Golding survived her husband's  money-laundering trial without much damage to her chances of being elected  mayor in 1992.  </P> <P> Indeed, the trial produced no evidence that Golding knew that her husband,  Richard T. Silberman, was fiddling with what he thought was Colombian drug  money.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean the case won't return to harass Golding politically.  </P> <P> If it does become an issue, Exhibit A may be a sizzling document filed by  federal prosecutors in response to Silberman's recent plea of poverty.  </P> <P> Prosecutors argue that, after his arrest, Silberman began transferring his  property and other assets to Golding in an attempt to avoid a massive fine or  forfeiture of assets.  </P> <P> Silberman and Golding arranged to swap half-interests in adjoining houses on La  Jolla Scenic Drive, making Silberman full owner of one, Golding full owner of  the other.  </P> <P> Silberman's house was then sold for $920,000, which Silberman said netted only  $170,000.  </P> <P> Prosecutors suspect that the equity in the house retained by Golding is  "substantially higher" than $170,000.  </P> <P> In short: Golding gets lots of equity, Silberman gets the chance to plead  poverty. The Golding house is now for sale for $1.7 million.  </P> <P> Silberman also transferred his Jaguar to Golding. Later, his son, Jeff, bought  Silberman's Mercedes-Benz.  </P> <P> The prosecutors said: "The court should not countenance a procedure whereby a  defendant pleads 'poverty' after transferring away his assets to family  members."  </P> <P> As an added shot, prosecutors contend that Golding should be held liable for  Silberman's remaining $1.5-million legal bill. The bill was mailed to Golding's  County Administration Center office, addressed to both her and her husband.  </P> <P> Normally accessible to the press, Golding hasn't been available this week to  discuss her finances or her political future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buy/Rent/Lease . . . Please!  </P> <P> It says here.  </P> <P> * How cold is the real estate market?  </P> <P> The Jelley Co., one of San Diego's biggest firms, is reduced to handing out  flyers on downtown street corners to hawk its Mid-City bargains:  </P> <P> "Free phone qualification with no obligation!"  </P> <P> * Forget the package of goodies being arranged by the Convention &amp; Visitors  Bureau. If San Diego lands the Republican National Convention for 1992, it may  be the personal ties that count.  </P> <P> Like the fact that Sig Rogich, the Las Vegas advertising executive who is  President Bush's liaison with the site selection committee, keeps his boat at  Harbor Island.  </P> <P> And Ben Ginsberg, the Republicans' chief counsel, adores the Sunday brunch at  La Valencia in La Jolla and the south course of Torrey Pines Golf Course.  </P> <P> * A Carlsbad surfer faces a misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly "shooting"  his surfboard last weekend at a woman swimmer, badly cutting her leg with the  board's fin.  </P> <P> Police say it's part of an aquatic turf squabble between swimmers and surfers  off Carlsbad State Beach. The surfer spent four days in jail before making  bail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Cemetery Divided  </P> <P> Anyone whose interest in the Civil War was piqued by the recent PBS series  might want to visit Mount Hope Cemetery in Southeast San Diego.  </P> <P> Founded in 1869, Mount Hope has separate Union and Confederate sections for  soldiers who survived the war but died in San Diego. Each section has its own  monument.  </P> <P> The Union section has greater numbers and a superior position on the top of a  hill. There's probably battlefield symbolism there.  </P></p>

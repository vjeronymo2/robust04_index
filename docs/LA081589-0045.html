			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG-AWAITED OPENING IN SIGHT FOR VA SPINAL CORD INJURY CENTER  </P> <P> Two buildings at the Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center offer a study  in contrasts.  </P> <P> One of them, built in 1967, houses as many as 160 patients with spinal cord  injuries. Here, resting in drab wards of seven beds each, men and women in  wheelchairs struggle toward health in quarters that are noisy and crowded.  </P> <P> Less than 130 feet away at the end of a corridor, meanwhile, is the sleek new  140,000-square-foot Ernest Bors Spinal Cord Injury Center, which is twice the  size of the older ward.  </P> <P> There, the long shining halls are graced with large color photographs of  sailboats, seascapes and hot-air balloons. Electric doors swing open at the  touch of a button, while soft interior lights illuminate the decor. Spacious  day rooms filled with new furniture still covered in plastic complement large  four-bed patient suites, landscaped patios and a dining room with tables that  drop electronically from the ceiling.  </P> <P> Except for the security guards who patrol it and the gardeners who mow the  lawn, however, the place is as deserted as a ghost town.  </P> <P> It's been that way since last October when the $18-million two-story Bors  Center was dedicated with great hoopla.  </P> <P> Then the money ran out. After discovering a major deficit in their annual  health care budget, administrators at the Department of Veterans Affairs in  Washington decided to use the money that was earmarked to finish the Long Beach  building and others elsewhere to maintain basic medical services instead of  completing new building projects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patients Next Year  </P> <P> And although Congress recently approved emergency legislation to restore the  money, medical center officials say, the Ernest Bors building -- the largest  spinal cord injury center for veterans on the West Coast -- is likely to remain  vacant at least until early 1990 when hospital officials hope to move in the  first patients from the cramped ward next door.  </P> <P> "We're sitting over here with a horrendous white elephant on its back," said  Joe Fox, vice president of the 1,500-member California Paralyzed Veterans  Assn., which represents the state's estimated 9,000 veterans with spinal cord  injuries.  </P> <P> Many of those veterans are wheelchair-bound or bedridden and require special  ramps and modern medical equipment that the new building will provide. While  some of that equipment is available in the older facility, access to  state-of-the-art care in the Ernest Bors facility will make their difficult,  painful existences easier, veterans say.  </P> <P> "Everybody is complaining," said Ed Santillanes, the association's president.  "The only thing that's being used is the dining room for meetings and parties.  </P> <P> "It's a beautiful building, but it's just a showpiece. It's been a constant  (source of frustration)."  </P> <P> The 120-bed Ernest Bors Center -- named after a pioneer specialist who was once  the hospital's chief of spinal cord injury service -- features modern built-in  oxygen suction systems for those with respiratory difficulties, easily  accessible bathrooms with lights that go on automatically when someone enters  and special trapeze devices on each bed to enhance patient movement and  exercise.  </P> <P> In addition, the center is equipped with an extensive system of ramps for  wheelchair access, private and semiprivate areas for recreation and relaxation  and a one-bedroom apartment to help prepare paralyzed veterans and their  spouses for independent living.  </P> <P> A lot of things have changed in the last 20 years in how you treat spinal  injury patients," said Dean R. Stordahl, director of the medical center,  located on Long Beach's east side near the Orange County line. "Their life  expectancy has increased and we are more conscious of privacy now. There is  heightened awareness in society that these are not people to be pitied and  treated as patients, but as viable individuals."  </P> <P> The Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center was chosen as the site for the  Ernest Bors center because its spinal cord injury program is the largest on the  West Coast and one of the best known in the country, Stordahl said.  Construction started in 1986 and, for two years, went as planned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Year's Predictions  </P> <P> At last year's dedication ceremony, attended by various dignitaries including  Thomas K. Turnage, head of the Veterans Administration in the Reagan  Administration, hospital officials confidently predicted that the newly  completed building would be in use by early 1989.  </P> <P> But they needed about $2.4 million more to finish the job. And about the same  time that veterans officials in Long Beach were proudly conducting grand tours  of the massive new building, officials in Washington were discovering an  unexpected $635-million deficit in their national health care budget.  </P> <P> Simply put, said Donna St. John, a spokeswoman for the Veterans Administration,  congressional appropriations had not kept pace with rising costs, gradually  creating an unforeseen deficit. As a result, St. John said, 96 building  projects nationwide were put on hold. Besides the Ernest Bors Center, projects  delayed in California included a smaller spinal cord injury unit in San Diego  and a planned hospital dormitory in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Steps Delayed  </P> <P> In Long Beach, Stordahl said, the withholding of funds meant the delay of  several steps necessary to the center's completion. Among them were the  installation of the telephone system, nurse-call devices, patient monitoring  equipment and television sets, as well as the purchase of linens and supplies,  specialty beds and rehabilitation equipment.  </P> <P> Incensed by the delay, the national Paralyzed Veterans Assn. and other groups  launched an ambitious lobbying effort aimed at persuading Congress to enact an  emergency supplemental funding bill to save the stalled projects. Their efforts  were aided by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), among others, who as chairman of  the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, spearheaded a drive to see the bill  through.  </P> <P> On June 23, Congress approved $345 million in emergency supplemental funding  for Veterans Administration projects. According to a Cranston aide, the $2.4  million expected in Long Beach should arrive this week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Snags Seen  </P> <P> But even when the money comes, Stordahl said, it will take at least 120 days to  purchase and install the new equipment under rules that call for competitive  bidding. At best, he said, half the patients will be moved to the center early  next year and the second half two months later. About 40 spinal injury beds, he  said, will remain in the present ward, with the rest of the older building  planned for other uses.  </P> <P> Veterans charge that the delay constitutes a hardship for spinal injury  patients, especially those in need of the special respiratory and monitoring  equipment. Stordahl maintains that patient care has not been impaired. And the  cost of maintaining the empty building, he says, is minimal.  </P></p>

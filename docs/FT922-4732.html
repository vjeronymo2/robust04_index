			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: A Midsummer Night's Dream - Theatre There are some greater pleasures in an English summer than watching A Midsummer Night's Dream in the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park, but not many. Even in a summer that promises to be as good as this, it still takes a while to get used to. Strange things fall from the air, the aeroplanes can distract, but within minutes the spell begins to work and, as darkness falls, it is entrancing. This time last year, it was almost freezing. Blankets and gloves were the order of the day, but it was still worth it. Now the weather is kinder and Ian Talbot's production seems a little gentler than last year's as well. The main change is that Dinsdale Landen has taken over from Roy Hudd as Bottom. I will not say that he is better, but he is certainly different. Landen is physically a small figure, smaller than the other workmen who perform the play of Pyramus and Thisbe. He seems to get by more by charm than pushing. He is not really bully Bottom, just more enthusiastic than the rest and with relatively delicate manners. When he is given the ass's head, his voice changes and becomes distinctly nasal. He seems embarrassed when Titania falls for him, but gradually grows more pompous as in the line 'I have a reasonable good ear in music.' The head itself is a delight. The eyes, the eyebrows, the nostrils, the ears all move. And when it comes off, Landen is left to reflect poetically on Bottom's dream. Perhaps because the interpretation is so modest, this is one of the best Bottoms I have seen. And it is not all Bottom's play. All the workmen excel: see, in particular, George Pensotti as Robin Starveling, the tailor. When it comes to their performance in the Athenian court, some of the audience are laughing so much at the gestures that it is almost impossible to hear the lines. The lovers star, too. Sarah-Jane Holm was an excellent Hermia last year and repeats the performance. This time there is a wonderful Helena in Anna Patrick who uses her height to the full. When Helena and Hermia quarrel, it is almost a physical combat. The male lovers are not at all bad, but are quite outshone by the women. Hermia is booted off into the outlying bushes as Talbot's production makes use of the Regent's Park space: then she comes crawling back. If there is a reservation, it is the same as last year: the fairies are a trifle tatty. Gavin Muir's Puck is unnecessarily punk: neither Oberon nor Titania are especially attractive. The lesser fairies look almost too literally like mustardseed and cobweb. I cannot see why they should not be more conventionally pretty. Still, that is a small matter. The whole performance is a joy, even down to the normally almost unnoticeable part of Philostrate, the master of the revels, played here with great style by Paul Aves.

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTO DAYS DEVELOP AMATEUR SHOOTERS' SKILLS WHILE FATTENING  MODELS' PORTFOLIOS  </P> <P> The success of a magazine, as with almost all businesses, depends on getting  people to buy its product. But that isn't possible unless consumers see the  magazine. And therein lies the importance of the magazine cover.  </P> <P> A lot of magazines have gone to celebrity or cheesecake covers to draw in an  audience. These high-tech, state-of-the-art glamour images are made in the  studios of the best-known photographers or at exotic locations. It's a  specialized type of photography open to very few people.  </P> <P> And then there is Western Photographer, a magazine that bills itself as being  for the amateur photographer. It consists primarily of features, snapshots of  models in swimsuits and sportswear, calendar events of upcoming photo  opportunities, articles, columns and advertisements for glamour shoots at the  beach and local parks.  </P> <P> "Southern California is the mecca of photography," said Hank Koch, publisher of  Western Photographer. "There is no other place in the world that I know of  where there are so many model shoots -- especially with the quantity and  quality that we have here."  </P> <P> Photo days, which usually attract about 200 photographers and 50 to 100 models  at local parks, are designed to give amateur photographers an opportunity to  shoot models.  </P> <P> "It gives them (the photographers) a chance to shoot different girls without  paying a lot of money," said S.T. Bear, the magazine's editor. "It gives the  girls a chance to get modeling experience and photographs for their portfolios.  </P> <P> "The guys get out there and enjoy the company of the other photographers. It's  sort of a chance to meet the gang, instead of going to a bar.  </P> <P> "In a way it might be considered a girlie magazine. The pictures are used to  represent what happened at the photo shoots. We've had quite a few models who  have gone to photo days and become successful. Raquel Welch went to a few photo  days down here in San Diego."  </P> <P> Bear believes the photographs are useful because subscribers can learn from  them.  </P> <P> The magazine is published in San Diego and printed on newsprint. Columnists  include Rohn Engh, Lee R. Clark, Alice and Peter Gowland and Bear. Each issue  includes a calendar of upcoming photo events and shoots.  </P> <P> Koch started Western Photographer 30 years ago in San Diego with two friends  from the Navy. He was finishing his tour of duty and wanted to start a magazine  for servicemen who wanted to trade travel slides.  </P> <P> The magazine has appeared in many formats, starting as a pocket-size,  5-by-7-inch publication with just 25 pages, selling for 50 cents. Today it is  produced in an 8-by-11-inch format with a circulation of 10,000. Subscribers  now reach as far as England, New Zealand and Italy, with the majority in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Koch, 65, has seen a lot of changes in his years with the magazine -- and he'd  like to see more.  </P> <P> "There are a lot more subjects in the world than shooting girls," he said. "I'm  not against it, no way. But we intend to enlarge our magazine both in different  types of articles and approach. I'm not going to phase out photo days. My  growth is in the areas of nature, table-top shooting and all types of  photography. I want it to be more of a service to photographers."  </P></p>

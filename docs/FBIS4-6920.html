			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shunji Taoka: "What Would Happen to Japan if </F> War Were To Erupt on the Korean Peninsula?"]    [Text] Last February, when Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa returned to Japan after meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton in Washington, he immediately asked his cabinet to  consider possible measures which might be adopted by Japan  should the UN Security Council decide to impose economic  sanctions against North Korea.    Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense  Agency presume that "the odds are against the outbreak of a war  on the Korean peninsula," they have been conducting secret  discussions on possible actions that might be taken in case of  an emergency on the peninsula, as well as on legal issues  relevant to the subject. However, such a stance might provoke  North Korea or strike panic into the South Koreans.    Before undertaking any discussion, the Defense Agency is in  fact obliged to presuppose that it would be nearly impossible  for the Self-Defense Forces to go into action under the existing  laws and under the current political situation. This is why the  Defense Agency officially refuses to admit that such discussions  are under way. "No comment. Please understand why we cannot  make ourselves clear whether or not we are conducting such  discussions," the agency says.    A high-ranking official of the Defense Agency said  ironically: "Our action will depend on the government's  decision. For the moment, we are just told to pursue  discussions. However, as we did not receive any concrete  instructions--for instance we do not know what kind of situation  we have to presuppose--we are not making much progress in our  discussions. It is as if we have been told to design a house  without receiving such necessary information as the floor area  or construction cost."    If we put together the current objective circumstances  surrounding the Korean peninsula, and the different remarks made  by officials belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to  the Defense Agency, we can obtain a picture of what would happen  to Japan if war were to break out on the Korean peninsula.    First, the Japan-U.S. arrangement concerning prior  consultation would be called into question. This arrangement is  mentioned in the notes attached to the Treaty of Mutual  Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States.    Under this arrangement, the United States should hold prior  consultations with the Japanese Government if it wants to  undertake military operations directly from Japan, that is to  say, if it wants to use its Japan-based fighter and attack  aircraft to wage war on North Korean forces intruding into the  South.    The decision on whether Japan would give its assent to the  United States lies with the government. However, the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Agency already presume that  Japan would give a green light to the United States.    If a war broke out on the Korean peninsula, and if Japan  remained reluctant to provide active support, Koreans and  Americans with strong anti-Japanese sentiment might say: "The  war was protracted because of Japan, and it cost our countries a  greater sacrifice in human life." Many Japanese officials do  not want Japan to become the target of such criticism.    Some 160 U.S. fighter and attack aircraft are now stationed  in Japan. About 50 F-15 fighters attached to the 18th Air Wing  are based at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa Prefecture.    At Misawa Air Base in Aomori Prefecture, there are some 50  F-16 fighters attached to the 432th Air Wing. At Iwakuni Marine  Corps Air Station in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Marine Air Group 12  has some 40 F/A-18 fighter bombers and 20 AV-8B Harrier II's  (vertical takeoff and landing attack aircraft). If a war breaks  out on the Korean peninsula, these aircraft will sally forth  into the Korean skies, with the support of refueling and  electronic countermeasures aircraft based at Kadena Air Base or  at Futenma Marine Corps Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture.    Approximately three days after the sally, the Yokosuka-based  USS Independence (a 79,200-ton aircraft carrier with 84  carrier-based aircraft) will arrive in the Sea of Japan or in  the Yellow Sea with its escort, Destroyer Squadron 15  (comprising two cruisers, three destroyers, and four frigates).  The USS Independence will remain inside Japan's air defense  identification zone, for example near the Okinoshima Islands,  and its carrier-based aircraft will sortie from there under the  cover of E-2C airborne early warning aircraft and F-15J fighters  belonging to the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force. Some 200  Tomahawk cruise missiles may also be launched as well.    Four landing vessels, including the Sasebo-based 39,400-ton  amphibious assault ship "Belleau Wood," will head to Okinawa to  pick up some 2,500 U.S. Marines attached to the Third Marine  Division. The United States will try to inhibit the North Korean  forces from making their next move by showing that it is  preparing for an amphibious assault in cooperation with some  25,000 South Korean Marines. As reinforcements, other fighter  squadrons will immediately join the operations directly from the  United States, thanks to the support of air tankers.  <H5>  Will Itazuke Again Become a U.S. Air Base? </H5>   If we include the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard,  the United States now has a total of 46 air wings. The United  States Air Force is capable of immediately mobilizing eight air  wings, namely some 400 military aircraft, should an emergency  arise on the Korean peninsula. The only problem would be where  to deploy these aircraft. One air wing per base is the general  rule. If we follow the rule, only Kwangju Air Base would be  available in South Korea. Therefore, the United States might use  Pusan or Cheju Airports, or it might try to quickly restore  abandoned airfields in the south of the country.    Moreover, there is a great possibility that the United  States would ask Japan for permission to use several airfields  in northern Kyushu and in the Chugoku District.    In addition to Tsuiki Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture in  Kyushu), Ashiya Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture), and Miho Air Base  (Tottori Prefecture in the Chugoku District), the United States  might even ask for the use of the former Itazuke Air Base, which  has become the current Fukuoka Airport. During the Korean war,  Itazuke was the most important base for the United States Air  Force. Fukuoka Airport is currently under the jurisdiction of  the Ministry of Transport and the Self-Defense Forces. It would  be difficult for Japan to refuse the U.S. request because of the  Japan-U.S. agreement concerning the use of facilities and areas  in Japan by the U.S. Armed Forces. If the United States were  granted the use of Fukuoka Airport, it would become a major  problem since civil aircraft would no longer be able to use this  important airport located only a short distance from the heart  of Fukuoka. Moreover, Fukuoka residents would raise a hue and  cry if they saw bomb-laden fighters taking off one after  another, or if they saw damaged fighters flying low over the  city to make emergency landings.    According to the Defense Facilities Administration Agency,  under the current arrangements it would be necessary to obtain  concurrence from the concerned municipalities and landowners  should the U.S. Armed Forces want to use a Japanese air base for  military combat operations because it would correspond to a  major change in the use of the facilities. "The United States  might ask the Self-Defense Forces to take it upon themselves to  guard major bases against a surprise attack by North Korean  special forces. It might also ask us to cooperate in the  transport of fuel and ammunition," a general officer of the  Ground Self-Defense Force said.    If North Korean special forces attacked Japanese facilities,  the Self-Defense Forces would be called out for national  defense. In such a case, the Japanese Government would be able  to assign the Self-Defense Forces to guard facilities which  present major targets for the enemy--such as U.S. military  bases, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and nuclear  power plants--because Japan would be in a state of war.  However, the existing Self-Defense Forces Law does not allow  the Self-Defense Forces to take the field prior to the fact. In  time of peace, guard duties have to be fulfilled by the police.  Since special forces are professional killers and infiltrators,  it would be very difficult for the Japanese police to fight them  with nightsticks and guns.    North Korea has developed a ballistic missile called the  "Nodong I." With an estimated range of 1,000 km, the missile is  capable of hitting most parts of Japan. However, the missile is  not deployed yet since it is still in an experimental stage. At  the end of May 1993, North Korea test-fired the Nodong I at a  range of 500 km. So far, only one missile has been test-fired.    If North Korean nuclear reactors are working properly, there  is a possibility North Korea has already produced a certain  amount of high-grade plutonium from which several nuclear bombs  can be produced. However, whether North Korea's attempt to scale  down the size of nuclear weapons was successful is open to  doubt. Can North Korea really make a nuclear warhead or nuclear  bomb? In 1974, when India conducted its first nuclear test, it  was reported that its nuclear device was as large as a house.    Even if North Korea has successfully manufactured a nuclear  device, it has probably not yet developed a mobile nuclear  weapon. Such is the dominant view among U.S., Japanese, and  South Korean military experts.  <H5>  Chemical Weapons Are Much More Dreadful Than Nuclear Devices </H5>   When he appeared on NBC on 3 April, U.S. Secretary of  Defense  William Perry said: "North Korea might have manufactured one or  two nuclear weapons." This remark has attracted public  attention. Even if the North Korean nuclear device is large, it  might become a practical weapon if it could be carried by ship  or a plane. However, in order to make a warhead, it is necessary  to develop a nuclear device whose weight does not exceed one ton  and whose diameter does not exceed one meter.    Meanwhile, there is no reason to doubt information released  by the United States and South Korea that North Korea is  manufacturing several kinds of chemical weapons. The production  of chemical weapons requires simple technology which was  developed during World War I. Every country can easily produce  chemical weapons if it has a chemical industry. Such powerful  chemical weapons as yperite [mustard gas] have already been put  to practical use during World War I. There is a story which  illustrates the strength of the gas. An officer brought his  binoculars back to his room without knowing the strap was  stained with a few drops of mustard gas. During the night, the  negligible amount of mustard gas escaped as vapor, blinding the  officer.    Nerve gas, which was developed by the Germans before World  War II, is the same as agricultural chemicals and insecticides.  However, if the skin is touched by a fine grain of nerve gas  weighing no more than 0.002 grams, then breathing ceases as the  nervous system is immediately paralyzed. According to U.S.  estimates, 250 tons of chemical weapons are now stored in North  Korea. This amount corresponds to tens of thousands of shells.  Chemical weapons have little effect on soldiers wearing a  watertight chemical warfare combat suit and gas mask. However,  if chemical weapons are fired into cities in the form of rocket  bombs or missiles, people will panic as they will be at a loss  as to what to do. If 20 million people living in Seoul and its  environs tried to escape from the city, South Korea would  collapse into utter confusion, such that both the U.S. and South  Korean forces would be unable to launch an effective  counterattack.  <H5>  It Would Be Extremely Difficult To Rescue Japanese Residents </H5> in South Korea    Many representatives of Japanese firms reside in South Korea  with their families. Some 6,400 Japanese now live there.  Moreover, on average 4,500 Japanese go to South Korea every  day. If we assume these travelers spend four or five days in  South Korea on average, we should consider that there are an  extra 20,000 Japanese in South Korea.    Many examples show that a war often starts with a sudden  attack. In case of war, Kimpo International Airport in the  suburbs of Seoul as well as the port of Inchon would probably be  of no use since both facilities would come within range of North  Korean heavy artillery and antiship missiles. The Seoul-Pusan  superhighway would be used exclusively for military transport.  Moreover, this freeway is designated to become an emergency  runway. Meanwhile, traffic on public roads would be heavily  jammed. In the midst of great confusion, Japanese citizens  would probably have difficulty buying train tickets to Pusan if  they could not speak fluent Korean. Since the port city of  Pusan is about 450 km south of Seoul, there would be no  possibility of reaching there on foot.    Despite these dangers, there seems no promise that the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs would immediately urge Japanese to  restrain themselves from traveling to South Korea should the UN  Security Council decide to impose economic sanctions against  North Korea. This is because Japanese travelers spend 100-odd  billion yen a year in South Korea. Thus, if Japanese tourists  and businessmen stopped traveling to South Korea, it would be  similar to imposing severe economic sanctions on that country.    "If the Maritime Self-Defense Force is allowed to use its  vessels on rescue missions following amendment of the  Self-Defense Forces Law, it would send its ships to Pusan to  rescue those Japanese remaining in southern Korea," a flag  officer of the Maritime Self-Defense Force said.    Meanwhile, it will become a major problem if the United  States asks the Maritime Self-Defense Force to sweep mines  before the United States Marine Corps launches an amphibious  assault. Neither the United States nor the South Korean Navies  have enough minesweepers. Moreover, they are both less  experienced in this field than the Japanese Maritime  Self-Defense Force. However, the situation would not be the  same as when Japanese minesweepers cleared the Persian Gulf.  The area where mines are placed to defend against the enemy's  landing operations is generally covered by friendly artillery  deployed along the shoreline. If minesweepers enter the area,  artillery generally fires on them. Thereupon, escorting  destroyers usually fight back by bombarding the shoreline from  sea.    If Japan wanted to dispatch its minesweepers on such a  dangerous mission, it might have to use its own escort vessels  for cover since it would be too impudent to ask U.S. or South  Korean warships to escort Japanese minesweepers. This means  that if Japan accepts the U.S. request for minesweeping, it  might be drawn into direct involvement in a war outside its  territory. If that is the case, Japan would be forced to ignore  the Constitution and the Self-Defense Forces Law. The sea  battle would probably cost Japan a sacrifice in human life and  property.    Despite such dangers, it seems the Maritime Self-Defense  Force is somewhat eager to meet the U.S. request. According to  the Maritime Self-Defense Force: "The decision lies with the  government, but if the United States and South Korea complain  that their troops were unable to land on enemy shores because of  the nonparticipation of Japanese minesweepers, we would be  mortified. Japan-U.S. relations, based on mutual confidence,  would be affected."    The Maritime Self-Defense Force has always examined the  possibility of dispatching its ships to sweep mines along the  coast of South Korea in case of an emergency.    Meanwhile, Japanese minesweepers have had experience in  landing operations. When the Korean war broke out in 1950,  Japanese minesweepers belonging to the Maritime Safety Agency  were called out under the pretext they would be assigned to  clear the Straits of Tsushima, which is Japanese territory.  However, they were immediately ordered by the United States  Occupation Forces to head to East Korean Bay to support the U.S.  landing operation in Wonsan, North Korea. A minesweeper sank as  a result of an explosion in battle, killing one crew member.</p>

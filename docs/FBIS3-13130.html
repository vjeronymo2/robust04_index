The two leaders held a joint news conference  tonight following four hours of talks.    President Mubarak said that we are about to find a solution  to these problems. He added that the talks covered a number of  topics, including the situation in Yemen, bilateral relations,  and several Arab issues.    The Yemeni president voiced appreciation for Mubarak's  efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said that he and  President Mubarak reviewed longstanding bilateral ties,  inter-Arab relations, and the current crisis in Yemen.    President Salih said that he briefed President Mubarak on  the  Yemeni crisis and the Pledge and Accord Document signed recently  in Amman. The troubles should have ended with the signing of  the Amman document, but regrettably the crisis has dragged on  and has resulted in military clashes, which we do not want, the  Yemeni president stated.    President Mubarak opened the news conference by welcoming  the  Yemeni president. Mubarak said: We discussed a number of  topics during our meeting, including the problems in Yemen,  bilateral relations, and other Arab issues. I believe we are  about to resolve many problems.    The Yemeni president replied by thanking President Mubarak.  President Salih said: I am happy to be here in Egypt and to  hold talks with my brother President Mubarak. The Yemeni  president added that he and President Mubarak reviewed  longstanding Yemeni-Egyptian relations, inter-Arab relations,  and international issues.    President Salih pointed out that the Yemeni crisis began on  19 August when differences surfaced among the three coalition  parties: The General People's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist  Party, and the Yemeni Reform Group.    I briefed my brother President Mubarak on the details and  causes of this crisis. I also briefed him on the Pledge and  Accord Document that was concluded in Amman. The document was  supposed to bring the crisis to an immediate end so that the  leadership could resume its constitutional and executive tasks,  but unfortunately the crisis continued and had military  consequences, a development which we did not wish to see,  President Salih remarked.    The Yemeni president said: Inspired with a sense of national  responsibility, the three parties of the coalition agreed to  withdraw the units from their positions on the pre-May-1990  partition lines. Most were withdrawn, with the exception of a  few thousand troops in certain governorates, which will be  pulled out as well. But some provocations and media posturing  continues, President Salih added.    I have discussed this matter with my brother, President  Mubarak. The Egyptian president is holding consultations to  reconcile the two sides and to find a peaceful solution to the  current problem. I should recall here that Yemeni unity was  achieved through peaceful and democratic means, President Salih  stated.    The Yemeni President said: This problem should be resolved.  We are eager to settle all problems through peaceful and  fraternal means and find an understanding. We do not want the  troubles in Yemen to fester.    We highly appreciate the part played by the Egyptian  leadership, government, and people and the great concern your  country displays toward Yemeni unity. This is hardly  surprising. Egypt played a major role in inspiring the  revolutions of 26 September and 14 October and has sent us the  best of its sons to assist us, President Salih noted.    The two presidents then answered questions from reporters.    The Yemeni President was asked if the withdrawal of military  units is linked to bringing to trial those involved in recent  terrorist operations. He responded: The Pledge and Accord  Document calls for the withdrawal of all military units from  major towns. Other units will remain in their positions whenever  this is in the national interest of unified Yemen.    The document also calls for measures to achieve security and  stability. According to that document, those involved in acts  of sabotage and violence should be arrested in accordance with a  plan to be presented by the interior minister to the coalition  government led by Haydar al-'Attas. The government is  responsible for the implementation of the document, President  Salih stated.    The Yemeni president added: The leadership was supposed to  close its ranks so that the Presidential Council and the  coalition government could draw up plans or a detailed program  for the implementation of the Amman document. Unfortunately,  following the Amman meeting the brothers of the Yemeni Socialist  Party returned to the commercial and economic capital of Aden  and nothing was done.    President Salih said: We are ready to cooperate with other  Yemeni leaders in ensuring the arrest of all terrorist elements.  However, we have to point out that no party is in the employment  of another party. We cannot perform our tasks unless there is  harmony among the leaders. This is the responsibility of the  government, not the president.    The Yemeni president added: The Presidential Council and the  government were supposed to meet immediately to implement the  Amman agreement. Unfortunately, Socialist Party leaders  returned to Aden.    Concerning the call issued by President Mubarak for the  restoration of Arab solidarity, President Salih said: We fully  support this pan-Arab stance. There is a need to restore Arab  solidarity and clear the atmosphere following the rupture caused  by the Gulf war. We appreciate the call made by the Egyptian  president and people. Even without President Mubarak making  this call, we are aware of and appreciate the efforts he is  exerting with all brothers to restore Arab cooperation.    Asked about the task of achieving Arab solidarity and  unity, President Mubarak said: Egypt is, above all, an Arab and  Islamic country. We are advocates of Arab solidarity. We have  been long before I took office. The Gulf war left a trail of  scars and divisions in its wake. It took a long time for the  dust to settle and the healing process to begin. We have not  spared any effort in restoring Arab solidarity and cooperation  in various fields. I believe that today the situation is better  than at any time before. We are still making an effort.    We hope, God willing, that we may all come to believe in  Arab  solidarity and see the need to close Arab ranks. This, of  course, requires effort but we are working on it because we see  this as a primary commitment of the Arab Republic of Egypt,  Mubarak said.    President Salih was asked about his country's position on  terrorism and about a recent statement made by a Yemeni official  that some terrorist elements returning from Afghanistan are  living in Yemen. He responded: The Yemeni leadership,  government, and people are against terrorist elements, wherever  they may be. Egypt's security is a part of the security of the  Arab people. Yemen's security is a part of Egypt's security. No  Arab country should think that it is safe from terrorist  operations conducted under the slogans of Islamic or leftist  extremism. We are against terror in all its forms because it  yields nothing but havoc and destruction.    The Yemeni president added: It is true that there are  elements who came back to Yemen from Afghanistan. But most of  them are Yemenis who went to Afghanistan to engage in jihad and  were sponsored at the time by Western and some Arab countries.  These countries sponsored them in the effort to wage jihad  against the Russians in Afghanistan, and even against some Arab  regimes in the Arab world. Now we are reaping the harvest of  this intellectual and political terrorism.    President Salih said that Yemen is opposed to terror in all  its forms. He said: The elements that are in Yemen are  Yemenis. Some people claim that there are Egyptian terrorists  and some from other nationalities in Yemen. If these people  provide us with a list of names, we will be ready, in the  context of coordination and in accordance with agreements, to  take all necessary legal action against anyone engaged in acts  of terror in any Arab country.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 214.101(d) does not reverse long-standing policy or law, does not violate the RSIA or APA and, therefore, will not be withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the AAR's petition asserts that the exemption in section 214.103(b) for instances where the installation of fall protection poses a greater risk than working without protection should be expanded to include instances where the installation and use of fall protection poses a greater risk. FRA does not believe there are compelling reasons to enlarge this exception to the fall protection requirement with respect to all railroad bridge workers. The examples cited by the AAR in their petition (fire fighting, re-railing cars, working with moving equipment) as instances where the use of fall protection equipment may pose a greater risk than completing the work without fall protection are not persuasive. FRA believes that for each of these situations installation of fall protection equipment is the most difficult part of the process, and that once installed does not interfere in the work to be done. In other words, if installation can be accomplished, the duties to be performed once protection is in place can also be accomplished. The AAR states that workers need to be able to move away from these hazards quickly and easily. However, once installed, safety nets, walkways, and fall arrest systems provide ample freedom of movement. The only fall protection device that may present questions in this regard is the personal fall arrest system, and given new designs that encompass the peculiarities of railroad bridge structures and points of attachment, these devices can be installed to allow prompt and careful movement. Therefore, FRA is not willing to expand the fall protection exception set out in section 214.103(b) for all bridge workers. However, FRA does believe that this exception should be broadened to permit railroad bridge inspectors to work without installing or using fall protection systems, so long as certain criteria are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees performing inspections of railroad bridges must climb to all points above and below the bridge deck, as well as along the deck, and must be free to reach points on the structure that are accessed infrequently and with difficulty, and then only for inspection purposes. FRA believes that in some instances the use of fall protection could heighten the chance of injury for the inspector. Also, a blanket fall protection requirement could result in incomplete bridge inspections, a fact that raises additional safety concerns for fellow employees and the public. Therefore, persons who are capable of climbing on bridges, and who have been specifically qualified and designated by the railroad or railroad contractor, may perform bridge inspections without the installation and use of fall protection required under this regulation, provided the conditions set forth below are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to qualify for the installation and use exception now set forth in section 214.103(b)(2), the railroad or contractor using the exception must have a comprehensive written program in place that addresses pertinent climbing techniques and applicable safety equipment. The employee to whom the exception applies must be trained and qualified according to that program to conduct bridge inspections. Also, this employee must be formally designated by the railroad or contractor as one who will perform bridge inspections and voluntarily accepts the designation. The reason for this requirement is to prevent an employer from maintaining an informal bridge inspection program typified by on-the-spot designations of employees who lack training and who are uncomfortable working at heights without protection. Section 214.103(b)(2)(D) requires that the employee must actually be engaged in the inspection of the bridge or its components while the exception applies. Should this employee move to another duty on the bridge, fall protection would be required. Finally, the employee to whom the exception applies must be familiar with the appropriate climbing technique needed to scale safely the structure involved, and must be provided any generic, alternative or specialized equipment needed to complete the climb efficiently and safely. For instance, some railroads are training their bridge inspectors in rock climbing techniques and systems. If rock climbing techniques are used by a bridge inspector during the inspection, the appropriate equipment must also be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAR also requests that FRA eliminate the requirement of toeboards on bridge walkways found in section 214.103(c). In support of its request, the AAR states that toeboards are not normally found on railroad bridges, and because they would permit snow, ice, and debris to accumulate on walkways, will present tripping or falling hazards. FRA agrees, and is removing the toeboard requirement from section 214.103(c). Therefore, fall protection will no longer be required where a bridge is equipped with secure walkways and railings that meet the remaining criteria set forth in section 214.103(c). Toeboards are used traditionally as a method to prevent tools from falling rather than as a fall protection device. Recognizing that falling tools present hazards to those who work at levels below the walkway, FRA believes that the dangers created by the presence of toeboards exceed those associated with not requiring them. Also, nearly all railroad bridges equipped with secure walkways and railings do not also possess toeboards. Therefore, the substitution of walkways for personal fall arrest systems and safety nets permitted by section 214.103(c) as originally written is largely unusable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

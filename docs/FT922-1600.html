			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Mixed workload A batch of contracts has boosted the SHEPHARD HILL order book by nearly Pounds 10m. Almost half of this sum is a Pounds 4.5m contract by Severn Trent Water for the Strensham to Worcester main. Over the next 16 months the Cardiff office will be responsible for the installation of 19km of 600mm diameter water main through the Worcestershire countryside. Another award is the construction of the Pounds 3.6m Ash bypass for Kent County Council. Shephard Hill's southern region is handling the 5.5km of new single carriageway on the A257 that will provide a much needed improvement to the Canterbury to Sandwich link.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Canada becomes an Australian issue: Mulroney's tax policy makes its mark on the election campaign AUSTRALIA'S somewhat lacklustre federal election campaign came to life last week on the day that Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, promised that a re-elected Labor government would review the future of the monarchy. But it was not Mr Keating's tepid republicanism which caught the public imagination. Paradoxically, Australians were more interested in the resignation of Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's Conservative prime minister, whose profile was previously rather lower than that of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. Mr Mulroney was catapulted into the campaign because he is associated with the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST), the one issue which could prove capable of preventing the election of a conservative Liberal/National party government when Australians go to the polls on March 13. Opinion polls suggest that Australian voters do not believe Labor's claims that rapid economic growth will soon reduce unemployment, which peaked in November at 11.4 per cent. After a decade in power, Labor lacks credibility on economic issues, as illustrated by the cool response to Mr Keating's economic statement at the beginning of the campaign. But many voters are also fearful of the opposition's tax proposals, raising hopes among Labor advisers that a well-thought-out negative campaign may yet enable the government to stave off defeat. In line with this strategy, Mr Keating has dropped the statesmanlike style he adopted at the beginning of the campaign in favour a brawling onslaught on the proposed GST, which he describes as 'a monster'. 'This is not some small tax on the edge. The result will be that the Australian lifestyle as we know it will change forever,' he warned in a rowdy television debate with Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader. Against this background, the upheaval in Ottawa was a heaven-sent opportunity for Labor, which Mr Keating boldly exploited by asserting that Mr Mulroney had been forced to quit by public anger about Canada's GST. His explanation ignored the strains imposed on Canada by recession, high unemployment, the North American Free Trade Agreement and Mr Mulroney's failure to resolve Canada's constitutional problems. It was also challenged by commentators with knowledge of Canada, who pointed out that the conservative proposal forms part of a wide-ranging package of tax reforms which make comparisons difficult. Nevertheless, the anecdotal evidence of letters to newspapers and radio talkback programmes suggests that the Mulroney factor has contributed to a significant improvement in Labor support. The latest batch of opinion polls, published yesterday, put Labor only 1-7 percentage points behind the conservatives, compared with 6-12 points a week earlier. The apparent success of Labor's anti-GST campaign presents a dilemma for Mr Hewson, who has tried to make unemployment the main issue, but has been unable to persuade voters that Australia's economic problems can be solved by imposing a new tax. The coalition's fight-back policy platform claims that a 15 per cent GST would stimulate exports and help reduce Australia's long-term dependence on foreign capital by encouraging domestic saving. It also claims that most voters would be better off because the GST would be offset by personal tax cuts and the abolition of seven indirect taxes, including payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and petroleum excise tax. But Mr Hewson knows that while a few thousand voters will read the platform, many more may respond to Mr Keating's simpler warning that the GST will increase the price of everything except basic foods by 15 per cent. The result is likely to be a messy exchange of slogans in the last two weeks of the campaign as the government tries to exploit its advantage on the public relations battlefield where the election will be decided. Tough campaigning comes naturally to Mr Keating, a master of the pithy phrase, whose insulting labels for Mr Hewson include 'Dr Doom' and 'Gordon Gekko' the fictional Hollywood businessman whose creed was 'Greed is Good'. Mr Hewson attempted to win back the initiative yesterday with an attack on Labor's 'secret taxes', such as the variable rate sales tax which is added to the retail price of most consumer products. He also showed that he is prepared to step up his own rhetoric in an attempt to put the prime minister on the defensive in the last phase of the campaign. 'He has got no plan, he has got no answers, all he has got left is a negative scare campaign,' Mr Hewson told supporters in Sydney. Future for the banks, see International Company News</p>

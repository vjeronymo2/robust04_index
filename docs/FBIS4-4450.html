			<p>BFN     [Text] Thai Ambassador to Rangoon Mr Wirasak Futrakun said  its time to Salween River was turned from the river of conflict  into the river of cooperation which would provide both Thailand  and Burma with mutual benefits.    Mr Wirasak said Thailand and Burma have been haunted by the  "legacy of distrust" for a long time and that needed to be  changed.    At present, Thailand and Burma are in the process of  creating  mutual trust the ambassador said. "We are trying to help Burma  break political isolation by inviting them to be a guest country  at the ASEAN meeting in June. And at the same time we  facilitate the attempt of Burma to talk with the minority groups  and stop the fighting."    "Thailand maintains a non-intervention policy. However, we  hope that Burma and the minority groups will eventually reach a  peaceful settlement. The border between Thailand and Burma  should be the border of cooperation and not the border of  conflict. The fighting between Burma and the minority groups  along the border also adversely affects our country and our  people."    The envoy said only when Burma settles the problem with the  minority groups will that country will be able to start  focussing on development. "The situation has somewhat inched  towards peace as Burma has developed a more flexible stance when  dealing with the minorities," he added.    The diplomat said Burma has tried to improve its image and  that will take some time before it finds acceptance. "When I  first arrived in Burma, it was under martial law. Curfew was  imposed. Now there is more freedom. A number of political  prisoners were released and Burma has somewhat decentralised its  power."    "It has also drafted a new constitution which will have the  presidency system. However, the military will continue to play  an important role in that country. It's just like Indonesia.  If we can accept Indonesia, why don't we accept Burma?"    He said he has eyed Burma with an Asian point of view. "I  admit that I had in the past looked at Burma from the  westernised viewpoint and I had misunderstood that I know the  neighbouring country well. In fact, I came to realise that I  knew very little about Burma which has a different political  culture. Let's look at our neighbour from the Asian point of  view, like people in the same region should think of."    Burma should be allowed to find its own political solutions,  he said.    Thailand has initiated a number of projects to help Burma in  the areas of public health in the rural areas, he said.    Apart from Thailand, many countries have approached Burma  for  its rich natural resources.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, April 10 (AFP) -- Chief Moshood Abiola, the  self- proclaimed winner of presidential elections last June,  called Sunday [10 April] for an immediate return to democratic  rule in Nigeria.    In a statement published Sunday by his newspaper Concord,  Abiola said that the return should begin with the reinstatement  of all elected officials of all democratic structures disbanded  last November in the aftermath of General Sani Abacha's  take-over of government. The remaining results of the  presidential election held June 12 last year should also be  declared, he said in the statement.    The National Electoral Commission (NEC) had published only  results from 14 of the 30 states of the federation when the  exercise was stopped in compliance with a court order. Later,  on June 23, the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida annuled the  entire result for alleged irregularities.    "With democracy will come openness and transparency. All our  national problems can then be brought into the open and  solutions found with all participating", Abiola said in the text.    Since that election was cancelled, Abiola has campaigned for  upholding of the "sacred mandate" that he claimed was given to  him by the people in the election.    He said that the military, which has ruled for 34 years  since  the nation became independent from Britain in 1960, has been  unable to find solutions to the nation's problems.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> William M. Baker, a key aide to CIA Director William H. Webster, is taking the  rare step of returning to the FBI as assistant director in charge of the  criminal investigative division. The move by Baker, a 22-year FBI veteran, who  went from the bureau to the CIA with Webster in 1987, is designed to strengthen  the FBI's management team, which has been drawing criticism from some Justice  Department officials. Baker, who served as the FBI's No. 2 man in Los Angeles  and headed the bureau's Portland office before moving to Washington as  assistant FBI director for congressional and public affairs, will succeed Floyd  Clarke. Clarke has been elevated to executive assistant director. Intelligence  sources, saying that Baker's move does not indicate Webster plans to leave the  CIA, noted that the CIA director is looking for a replacement for Baker.  </P></p>

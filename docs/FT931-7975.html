			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Row over tendering rules spreads THE government yesterday faced conflicting demands to take action in the legal wrangle over whether public-sector workers' pay, conditions and pensions are protected by European law when their jobs are contracted out. The Public and Local Service Efficiency Campaign (Pulse), which is a supporter of compulsory competitive tendering of public services, insisted that the government should take action against councils that have suspended tendering because of the legal uncertainty. The government has said that the legislation protecting workers, known as the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment) or Tupe, would 'not normally' apply to contracting out. The Department of the Environment has also warned councils that framing contracts to include Tupe would be regarded as anti-competitive. Yet Pulse says Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is dragging his feet by not taking action against seven councils that have either suspended tendering or stated that Tupe must apply. They are Oxfordshire County Council, Gillingham Borough Council, Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council, Leeds City Council, Leicestershire County Council, Lancashire County Council and Beverley Borough Council. In a separate development the Prison Officers Association insisted that, contrary to the widely held view, occupational pensions were not excluded from the protection offered by Tupe. Two recent industrial tribunal cases - Warrener v Walden Engineering in Hull and Perry v Intec Colleges in Bristol - both found that pension rights were transferred when Tupe applied. Mr John McMullen, of solicitors Simpson Curtis, said the Warrener case might be overturned at the Employment Appeals Tribunal. But he pointed to further evidence of courts giving a much broader interpretation than the government of when Tupe applies to contracting-out. The High Court of Ireland, for example, recently ruled that the subcontracting of security services by a shopping centre amounted to a transfer of an undertaking. Mr McMullen also said that a possible 'acid test' for how generally Tupe applies will be provided in the spring by a European Court ruling on whether the regulations apply to the contracting out of a one-person cleaning service in Christel Schmidt v Spar und Leihkasse der Fruheren Amter Bordersholm.</p>

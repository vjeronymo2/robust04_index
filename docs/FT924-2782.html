			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (17): How to see through a dark glass lightly - Manufacturing user view / A new design makes a better impression in the right setting. CAD software has helped United Glass improve its presentation. A new design makes a better impression in the right setting. CAD software has helped United Glass improve its presentation. THE BOTTLES in which you buy gin, beer or babyfood are 'fashion items' to the people who make them. United Glass, a Pounds 177m company in St Albans, Hertfordshire, designs and manufactures bottles for Guinness' Kaliber, and Heinz babyfoods, among other customers. 'For 30 or 40 years, we've manufactured glass containers, but these days glass is basically a fashion medium,' explains Ian Peake, design service manager at United Glass. 'So much so that we couldn't go on selling using two-dimensional drawings: we had to do something about our presentation and visualisation to secure tomorrow's business.' United Glass wanted a CAD product that related directly to glass design, so it used a 'benchmark' project of a design to send to eight or so software suppliers, including Prime, McDonnell Douglas, Intergraph, and others - 'our priorities were presentation, accuracy, dedication, speed. It's important to represent and render the true geometry of the bottles so that we can't design something we can't make.' Mr Peake discovered that the IDEAS product from SDRC was able to drive the model using true dimensions, and also render the picture art speed. High-speed visualisation was a must when presenting to clients, and some of the other options lost out on their lack of speed, and the fact that they needed dedicated proprietary hardware. Communications Arts, a specialist in visualisation systems, won the Pounds 0.5m contract. It designed, installed and integrated the entire system, using 18 Silicon Graphics workstations, two personal Iris computers and 15 Iris Indigos, plus print and plotting hardware from HP, Tektronix and Iris. The main IDEAS software modules in use are the Wavefront Advanced Visualiser, for rendering, animation and presentation, and the Alias Full Color design and publishing system. The scope of the system reaches far beyond the moving of presentation models in real time. There are links to production systems to create moulds, and links to the sales and marketing systems which produce pictures ready-made for glossy brochures. As well as integrating all the CAD products so that they could exchange data and dimensions, Communications Arts produced a number of 'scenarios.' United Glass users can pick a number of scenes from a menu, and demonstrate the designs to clients 'in situ,' with the backdrop of a pub interior, supermarket or kitchen. These scenes can be 'edited' and adapted by users. They also have a menu from which they can pick from a range of glass colours and transparencies, with bottle contents ranging from ketchup to whisky in viscosity. SPEED is still an issue, given the complexity of the images produced by the system - 'basically we binned everything we had and started from scratch. It has taken a year, and we've spent Pounds 1m integrating with the mainframe,' explains Mr Peake. 'It's really only when you take something on board and use it that you discover such limitations as the size of files.' Nevertheless, he declares himself 80 per cent satisfied with the system. His words of warning to others researching CAD is to be wary of salespeople's claims, especially regarding performance. 'Expectations can be too high: we learned a a great deal in the process.' PRODUCT PROFILE Visualisation System Suppliers: Communication Arts, a computer graphics system integrator and and consultancy, was founded in the UK in 1989 by Pam Fisher, co-founder of IBM reseller, P&amp;P Micro. It supplies computer technology for the visualisation and origination of full colour material for print, animation and other visual material. Product: The high definition Visualisation System comprises equipment from a total of seven leading manufacturers, integrated to create design drawings, visualisation and output direct to film, print or VTR. Turnover: Pounds 3m. Price: Pounds 500,000 for typical installation hardware and operating systems: Silicon Graphics workstations under Unix. User views: 'Open systems platform has price advantages; integration service excellent, but complexity of image work may mean early upgrades to hardware.'</p>

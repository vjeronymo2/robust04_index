			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: Dreyfus: a grim centenary - Opera in Berlin The chorus of Berlin's Deutsche Oper screams 'Filthy Jew] Bastard] Yid] Pig] Death to the Traitor] Death to the Jew]'. A foyer exhibition of poster-portraits includes a caricature of a Jew's head, depicting him as greedy, dishonest and parasitical. In the city where the Nazis plotted the final solution, no-one raises an eyebrow. But this is not another example of German anti-Semitism. It is documentary evidence of the Dreyfus Affair, which divided French society 100 years ago and set the racist tone for 20th century Europe. To mark the Dreyfus centenary, the Deutsche Oper has staged the world premiere of Dreyfus - The Affair, with music by the Swiss composer Jost Meier and a libretto by George Whyte, a Hungarian-born Jew who has master-minded a series of centenary events. In addition to the opera and exhibition, there will be a Dreyfus ballet with a new score by Schnittke and a musical satire using anti-Semitic songs of the period, orchestrated by Berio and performed by Ute Lemper. All these will come together in Basle in October. Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a Jewish officer in the French army. In 1894 he was falsely accused of spying for Germany, court-martialled and exiled. Despite evidence proving his innocence, a retrial failed to clear his name. After a campaign by his wife and influential supporters, culminating in Emile Zola's celebrated pamphlet 'J'accuse', Dreyfus was released and eventually rehabilitated. The case uncovered a violent strain of anti-Semitism in France. Half a century later, Dreyfus's grand-daughter was among the French Jews sent to die at Auschwitz. In 1988, Dreyfus's grave in Montparnasse was desecrated. In a country renowned for its reluctance to delve into the more uncomfortable aspects of its past, the case still touches a raw nerve. It is to Germany's credit, and France's shame, that Berlin has kick-started the Dreyfus centenary. With racist attacks again making news across Europe, the Dreyfus Affair is both topical and salutary. The challenge facing the authors of the new opera was to turn a tale of political and moral significance into a successful work of art. The mere fact that an anti-racist opera was being premiered in Berlin was enough to guarantee the approval of the capacity first-night audience, which included local dignitaries, Jewish leaders and members of the Dreyfus family. By the second performance, the euphoria had subsided, and the work's flaws were all too clear. The libretto, based on contemporary sources and making use of nightmarish flashbacks, offers a resume of the Dreyfus case - public humiliation, torture and solitary confinement, an appeal to the Pope, the discovery of the real spy, establishment cover-up, re-trial and release. In an unbroken span of 90 minutes, such prejudice and personal suffering should hit the audience like a sledgehammer. But Dreyfus is never allowed to develop a personality: he remains typecast as a symbol of injustice, his wife Lucie a symbol of resistance. Zola's 'J'accuse' aria is frustratingly repetitive. Minor characters like the traitor Esterhazy are cardboard baddies. Far from seething with dramatic contrast, colour and tragedy, the opera fails to rise above the level of righteous polemic. For this, Whyte, Meier and the stage director, Torsten Fischer, bear equal responsibility. Whyte, most of whose family were gassed by the Nazis, appears to have been too close to his subject. The opera was his baby, the product of years of struggle. He has not taken the leap of imagination which transforms human experience into art: his material is more the stuff of musical documentary. Meier's pale Bergian modernism wears less well than his previous operas  - the best of which, Augustin (1988), deserves a wide hearing. The chansons and dances of the Moulin Rouge scene have the right sort of brash vulgarity, but the most telling moments are when Meier refines the music down to the barest thread. The overall impression is of competence rather than inspiration. Fischer's production, designed by Andreas Reinhardt, unfolded on a triangular platform and made theatrical use of paper walls. What it lacked was a sense of place, of genuine human feeling. Paul Frey's Dreyfus came across as a rather ordinary chap. Aimee Willis was the spirited Lucie, Artur Korn a shadowy Zola. A large supporting cast and chorus went through the motions of rage and outrage. The performance I heard was adequately conducted by the composer, stepping in for an indisposed Christopher Keene.</p>

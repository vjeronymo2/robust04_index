			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain First Rank Vladimir Chupakhin: "Society </F> Suffers From Lack of Spirituality--Best Remedy Is Patriotism:  Notes From Session of Russian Defense Ministry Collegium"]    [Text] What a complex, unusually sensitive and unique  organism the army is. Any sore point in our society or negative  phenomenon there immediately appears in the military, and with  double or even triple the intensity. The economic crisis is hard  for everyone, but for military personnel, who are maintained  exclusively at government expense, its consequences are  especially grave. Discipline has slackened in the country, crime  has become rampant, and these things cannot help but affect the  strength of our military ranks.    But perhaps the most important issue today is what is  happening in the spiritual or psychological area--the crisis of  the state and national ideal, the loss of moral reference points  in life, and much, much more. While for some people these things  are no tragedy, if they can find refuge in the world of  individualistic, consumer values, for military people, whose  very vocation is founded on the idea of serving the Fatherland  and on the idea of patriotism, to lose one's spiritual grounding  is like having no weapons or ammunition in battle.    In this connection it is hardly surprising that military  personnel are among the first who are sounding the alarm about  an aggression being waged by the lack of spirituality,  amorality, and all-permissiveness that we encounter left and  right. It is not surprising that the Armed Forces and Ministry  of Defense are increasingly often a source of impulses  encouraging a rebirth, on a new basis, of the patriotic and  unifying ideal and of effective and productive efforts to rear  true civilians and defenders of the Motherland.    This theme was the focus of a session of the Russian  Ministry  of Defense Collegium held several days ago, as KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  already reported. The agenda item was worded as follows: "On  measures to strengthen military-patriotic education for  servicemen and young people in support of the Russian Federation  Armed Forces." But in the hall, besides military officials and  chiefs of Main and Central Defense Ministry Directorates, one  could also see Russian Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov;  Colonel-General G. Yashkin, retired, chairman of the Russian  veterans organization; Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and  Kaliningrad; R. Bykov, the noted film-maker, and many other  state and public figures and representatives of concerned  organizations. This made it clear that the discussion would  inevitably transcend purely departmental bounds and by no means  touch on the "interests of the Armed Forces" alone.    And that is what happened. The introductory remarks by  Russian Defense Minister General of the Army P. Grachev,  followed by the report by Deputy Defense Minister  Colonel-General V. Mironov, bluntly declared: "This situation  cannot continue. Nihilism, lack of spirituality, and morale  degeneration have reached an extreme point that poses a danger  to both army and navy combat readiness and the security of  society and the state. The following facts disclosed at the  session caused a bitter sensation: In sociological surveys  conducted among conscripts in a number of oblasts on whose  territories the units of the Volga, Urals, and North Caucasus  Military Districts are stationed, as well as in Moscow and  Moscow Oblast, nearly 70 percent said military service was  unnecessary, and more than 35 percent spoke of a readiness to  emigrate from the Motherland. Every second conscript thinks that  such concepts as military duty, honor, and patriotism are things  of the past and no longer have any meaning.    The character of conscripts is extremely alarming.  Drunkenness, drug abuse, and crime are on the rise. Almost every  fifth young recruit has committed a legal offense or been taken  to the police station, and nearly 10 percent have been convicted  of crimes.    In view of all these things, the Army and Navy are  definitely  taking necessary measures. Everything possible is being done.  Col-Gen Mironov cited a number of facts relating to every  service arm and branch and showing how commanders and Army and  Navy educators aren't giving up but are instead trying to work  with the contingent now arriving in units and on ships and to  get positive results nonetheless. But the main attention of both  the keynote speaker and other colleagues who spoke was focused,  not surprisingly, on shortcomings and untapped potential.    The need to improve cooperation with state and public  organizations, patriotic associations, and the mass media was  posed with particular urgency. It was pointed out that much in  this regard has been lost, unfortunately. Ties with unit  veterans, associations of Afghan war veterans, and other  patriotic organizations are unraveling.    The educational role of the Russian Sports and Technical  Defense Association has declined markedly. Many of its primary  organizations are more involved in commerce than in the  education of future soldiers.    The Russian Armed Forces have at their disposal a rather  impressive array of assets for military-patriotic education.  They include more than 500 officer houses and clubs, 400  military museums, 35 singing and dancing ensembles, six drama  theaters, 800 orchestras, and library holdings of several  million volumes. But this things need serious support. Every  third officers house is in need of renovation. There is a  shortage of funds to make video films and movies about the  history of service branches and units. Book holdings must be  updated. There is almost no literature on the history of Russia  and the Russian Army.    A study of the state of affairs in military commissariats in  Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Tataria, Bashkiria, and a  number of other parts of the country show that existing  educational potential is being used poorly and that cooperation  with government bodies and public organizations is weak. For  example, of 246 military-patriotic clubs in Moscow only 14  remain, and of 1,400 museums and military valor rooms in  secondary general-education schools only 514 are left. The  situation is no better in other republics and oblasts.    Honor guards at memorable sites linked with the heroic  history of the Fatherland have been eliminated almost  everywhere. The Orlenok [Eaglet] and Zarnitsa [Summer Lightning]  Games have become a thing of the past. Military sports camps  have almost disappeared. Fitness programs for young people, like  the Ready for Labor and Defense program, many of whose methods  were adopted in other countries, including the United States,  France, and Germany, have ceased to function.    The report and a number of speeches suggested that it is a  serious mistake to abolish the system of elementary military  training, which was hardly intended to militarize pupils' way of  thinking and has greatly helped youths adjust to army life and  master basic army skills.    And it is inappropriate that military-patriotic themes have  largely disappeared from school textbooks, literature, movies,  theater, and art. Unfortunately, the vacuum is being filled by a  low-grade promotion of sex and violence. Age-old Russian values  are being destroyed.    Yes, there are many, many problems, and they are extremely  acute. But what can be done? How can the syndrome of destruction  be overcome? How can the situation be rectified?    "We can talk a lot about forms and methods of patriotic  education," said Colonel-General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the  General Staff, in his speech. "But nothing is going to change  unless we start with ourselves, with the patriotic education of  officials."    He was seconded by R. Bykov. Today our government itself,  the  national leadership itself is in need of patriotic education, if  you will. To be more precise, in need of a change of attitude  toward this matter." The film director cited an incident that  evoked a stir in the hall. He recounted how a request that an  appropriate government agency help finance a movie about the  50th anniversary of the Great Victory brought the following  answer: We can't help because "the military budget cannot be  increased." This is the level of understanding of the problem,  the level of thinking that, unfortunately, is very widespread  even among senior officials.    "We have reached a point where people have even begun to be  embarrassed by the term `military-patriotic' education," said  Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General B. Gromov bitterly in  his remarks. He called the attention of those present to the  need to seriously improve efforts to instill in young people  respect for national history and the achievements of Russian  culture.    "We must pool our efforts!" was the main point of the speech  by Russian Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov. He said that the  Ministry of Culture was prepared to cooperate closely with the  Ministry of Defense in all initiatives aimed at the spiritual  rebirth of society. In the minister's opinion, a good start  would be worthy preparations for the 50th anniversary of the  Great Victory and a fitting observance of that event.    Metropolitan Kirill also spoke about pooling efforts. In  this  connection, he characterized the cooperation agreement signed  recently by Defense Minister General of the Army P. Grachev and  Patriarch Aleksii II of Moscow and All Rus as extremely  promising. This "agreement of intentions" of sorts is already  operating and making headway in promoting the revival of Russian  military traditions. But it is important, the clergyman  stressed, to prevent the effort from becoming a short-lived  campaign and to avoid excesses, as in a reported incident in one  unit in which the following order was issued: "In honor of the  observance of the Annunciation, I hereby order..."    Real deeds, not fanfare and declarations, are what is needed  today. This was emphasized by many colleagues at the session.  Any real efforts, no matter how small, to promote the revival of  patriotic education must be supported. In particular, attention  was called to steps taken by the commanders of the North  Caucasus and Transbaykal Military Districts to support effective  cooperation with the Cossack movement. In this region, almost 80  Cossack organizations are serving as sponsors for various units  and taking part in educational work and efforts to solve social  and consumer-service problems.    Or consider this example: Despite all difficulties, young  sailors clubs in the Northern Fleet, young paratrooper clubs in  the Moscow Military District, and young artillery crewmen clubs  in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg have survived and are  popular among young people. The same is true of patriotic and  military-history associations attached to various units and  higher educational institutions. This form of work encompasses  more than 50,000 youths, and more than 3,000 servicemen have  been enlisted in it.    Every effort must be made to publicize such examples and  multiply them. Patriotic education enthusiasts must receive  comprehensive assistance and support.    At the same time, it is clearly impossible to rely solely on  someone's enthusiasm. The session leitmotif was the need for a  carefully formulated and substantiated state policy on patriotic  and military-patriotic education and on the development of  appropriate federal programs involving all branches of  government, as well as representatives of science, culture, and  public organizations.    This was also stressed by General of the Army P. Grachev in  his closing remarks. He announced that the Ministry of Defense  will propose an initiative to the government on launching a  federal program to enhance the prestige of military service and  to strengthen not only the prestige of the Armed Forces, but  also the Russian state and the country's security.    As was pointed out, the collegium discussion is only a  start,  a kind of prologue to a tremendous amount of painstaking work to  create in the new conditions a reliable and effective system to  rear citizens, patriots, and defenders of the Motherland--a  system that both society and the Armed Forces need very much.</p>

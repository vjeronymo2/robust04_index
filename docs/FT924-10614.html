			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew seeks progress on Ulster A 'HEADS of agreement' document acceptable to Northern Ireland's political parties, and the Irish and British governments, is becoming an increasingly likely outcome of talks taking place on the province's future, Ralph Atkins writes. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hinted to MPs yesterday that he believes agreement on such a report is feasible - and probably the best that can be expected in the week remaining before the talks end. Bilateral talks between the participants and Sir Ninian Stephen, the independent chairman, continued yesterday in Belfast. Further meetings are expected today, with increasing attention being paid to the possibility of reaching 'heads of agreement'. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, have indicated that they will pull out of the talks about a week before the November 16 meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, which marks the formal close of the talks. Sir Patrick said he hoped there would be only an 'intermission' before talks resumed. He told the Commons that he would make a statement when the talks closed and said that a 'heads of agreement' was 'a practical possibility'.</p>

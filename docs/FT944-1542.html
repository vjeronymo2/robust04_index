			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Collor's brother dies Mr Pedro Collor de Mello, whose revelations of top-level corruption in Brazil led to the toppling of his brother, former president Fernando Collor, in 1992, died yesterday in New York. Mr Pedro Collor, who was 42, was declared brain dead on Saturday after suffering from brain cancer and was being maintained on a life-support machine. In an interview in May 1992, Mr Pedro Collor said his younger brother had amassed a fortune through a multi-million-dollar influence peddling scheme and that he had used cocaine. Faced with an impeachment trial and huge street demonstrations across Brazil, Mr Fernando Collor resigned in December 1992 and was subsequently banned from politics for eight years. Last week a Brazilian court threw out criminal charges of bribe-taking against Mr Fernando Collor.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: Military efficiency Britain's cabinet office efficiency unit should soon be showing military precision in its attack on Whitehall's cobwebs. From March its new head is to be John Oughton, redeployed from the defence ministry to succeed Don Brereton, who's being posted back to the social security department. Even before the change the defence contingent was well entrenched in the cabinet office. Sir Peter Levene - the prime minister's efficiency adviser, no less - is a former chief of defence procurement. As Oughton was once his private secretary, he should have no trouble in keeping the new recruit in step. Moreover Oughton will be rejoining another of his former commandants in Richard Mottram, now top mandarin in the office of public service and science, who also served in the defence ministry. One of his jobs there was to head the 'options for change' exercise to reshape defence policy after the cold war, with Oughton under him in charge of naval aspects. Finally, there's Sir James Blyth, the businessman who chairs the cabinet office's Citizen's Charter advisory panel. He was once head of defence sales at a time when, oddly enough, a promising young civil servant called John Oughton conducted an efficiency scrutiny of the organisation. Besides making such good connections, Oughton has been responsible for the defence ministry's relations with its private-sector contractors. So he should be well armed to advance the market-testing programme in Whitehall, so dashingly launched by the departing Brereton.</p>

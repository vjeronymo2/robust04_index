			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC is experiencing serious financial problems  largely due to its extravagance. The property it is now  planning to sell will not be able to cover its total debt, which  means it is technically bankrupt. These developments naturally  place a serious question mark over the ANC's ability to control  the country's economy. According to sources within the ANC the  movement has a huge debt to settle. In selling its foreign  assets, the value of which is estimated at 20 million rands,  only part of that debt will be paid. In order to lighten that  debt burden even further the ANC will possibly have to lease  some of its office space at its headquarters, Shell House, in  Johannesburg. Some members even suggested putting the entire  building on the market and then leasing space in the building  for the organization.    One of the projects to which the ANC is paying attention is  the compulsory payment of levies by their officials. An  ordinary ANC MP will apparently have to pay 750 rands per month  to the ANC, while a minister will be asked to pay 2,000 rands.  This technical bankruptcy explains why it was decided to give  such high salaries to politicians. Before the election Mr.  Mandela said that the time for "fat pigs" [preceding two words  in English] was over, while it now appears that that time has  only just arrived. If the politicians do not receive those high  salaries then they will not be able to help the ANC out of its  misery.    These salaries are paid by the taxpayer, which means that  the  ANC is indirectly being lifted out of its bankruptcy by the  taxpayer. This is the first scandal to confront the Mandela  government. Meanwhile, a second scandal has also come to light.  Minister of Land Affairs Mr. Derek Hanekom initially indicated  that he was not interested in one of the expensive official cars  because his portfolio only requires a pickup truck for the dirt  roads of the rural areas. Now it appears that his truck is an  expensive imported model costing as much as the official cars,  if not more. With this sort of financial discipline (or rather  the lack of it) the fears of economists for the future of the  country are not unfounded.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Investments lift Citic Pacific 46% to HK1.2bn Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment company, Citic, yesterday topped market expectations when it announced a 46 per cent surge in net profits to HKDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 100m) for the first half of 1994. In April, the group issued HKDollars 3.82bn of shares, partly to finance tunnel and property acquisitions. As a result earnings per share rose by a more modest 30 per cent to 62.3 cents compared with 47.8 cents last year. Turnover crept up 5 per cent to HKDollars 6.5bn. Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 13 cents a share, up 3 cents. Profits were lifted by the group's long-term investments. Citic holds 12 per cent of Hongkong Telecom, the colony's monopoly supplier of fixed-line services, and 12.5 per cent of Cathay Pacific, the international airline which last week announced an 18 per cent rise in earnings. It is the first time a full six months' contribution has come in from Hongkong Telecom at the interim stage. Dragonair, the Asian airline in which Citic has a 46 per cent stake, made progress as additional flights were added to main destinations. Contrary to market expectations of a sluggish year for its motor trading business, Mr Larry Yung, chairman, said margins were maintained at last year's levels. Citic has recently acquired for HKDollars 3.4bn a 50 per cent stake in Discovery Bay, a self-contained community on one of Hong Kong's outlying islands. Mr Yung said an application had been made by co-owner Hong Kong Resort Company to build additional floor area, a new pier and a tunnel linking Discovery Bay to the airport road system. 'Directors of Citic Pacific will be actively involved in discussions with the government on this matter which is of considerable strategic importance,' he said. The first two 350MW generators of Citic's 56 per cent-owned Ligang Power Station are now fully operational. Installation of the next two generators is planned to start shortly, with completion of the first scheduled for late 1997. Citic has invested in a 25 per cent interest in Phase I of the Pudong Power Station with four 300MW generators, the first of which is expected to start commercial operation by the end of next year. Mr Yung forecast that full-year earnings would show a 'substantial increase' on 1993.</p>

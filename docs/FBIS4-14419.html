			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] Economic cooperation has dominated the talks between  Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy and Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. The meeting between the delegation of the Polish  parliament and the head of the Russian government was decided at  the last moment.    [Correspondent Wojciech Nomejko] The expected half-hour talk  was extended to over an hour. Both interlocuters considered  ways to increase Polish investment in the Russian market.    [Begin Oleksy recording] I am very satisfied with the  expressions of readiness that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin  declared regarding close contacts. We told each other: Poland  can, at the last resort, manage without Russia, Russia without  Poland on the whole certainly so, but why? [end recording]    [Nomejko] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin declared a readiness  for an economic rapprochement between Russia and Poland.  Speaker Jozef Oleksy expressed the hope that after the talk  today and after the visit of the Russian prime minister to  Poland, which will take place in May, decisions will be made to  stimulate the economy in Poland. There is a chance that the  Polish food processing and construction industries will regain  their former positions in the Russian market. They also  discussed issues of mutual indebtedness and of the conctruction  of gas pipelines.    To be sure, the visit of the Polish parliamentarians was to  have been solely an informational one, but the meetings with the  representatives of the highest authorities of the Russian  Federation, the prime minister, and probably the president, mark  out the political character of the visit.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (11): Banks chase new business - Syndicated loans, Tracy Corrigan sees signs of greater interest The rapid evolution of the international bond markets in recent years has encouraged more and more borrowers to tap the capital markets directly for their core financing, forsaking the syndicated loans market. However, after a decline in the volume of conventional syndicated credits over a period of years, there are signs this decline is being reversed. In 1993, international syndicated loans volume reached some Dollars 130bn, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Financial Market Trends, about Dollars 12bn higher than the previous year. However, more than Dollars 60bn of that total consisted of refinancing of existing debt, particularly by US companies, so the total volume of new loans was Dollars 70bn, the lowest since 1986. But the international bond markets place certain demands on borrowers: they must generally have a relatively high credit rating, they cannot repay the debt as and when they want to, and they must rely on the receptiveness of a given market at a given time. For these and other reasons, direct bank lending, syndicated or otherwise, still performs a number of vital functions. In addition, after suffering a squeeze on their capital, commercial banks have shored up their balance sheets in the last few years, and are again willing to commit capital to lending. Their capital/assets ratios have improved, as levels of bad debt has declined and as old debt has matured. Bond market weakness this year could help boost activity in the syndicated loans market. In a bull market, it tends to be easier for lower-rated borrowers to tap the market. In a bear market, they may be forced to return to their banks for funding. Other types of bank financing have been buoyant, in particular project financing, which is often for large and risky infrastructure projects. This allows companies, perhaps able to raise money in their own right, to isolate themselves from liability to the debt, by securing the financing on the cash flows created by the particular project. For example, in the case of the Rayong refinery in Thailand, the key sponsor was the Royal Dutch/Shell group with a 64 per cent stake, while the Petroleum Authority of Thailand had a 36 per cent stake. Shell could easily have tapped the international markets, but was able to obtain non-recourse financing so it would not have to risk its balance sheet. The debt financing of the Dollars 2.4bn project was made up of a Dollars 1.1bn facility. The structure allowed the joint venture to take advantage of export credit guarantees. The dividing line between bank credit and bonds, as between so many other markets, has become increasingly thin. For example, some bankers argue that since many floating-rate note issues launched in Asia are placed directly with banks, they are loans rather than bonds. The difference between a floating rate note issue bought and barely traded by a number of banks and a loan syndicated among the same banks, they say, is technical rather than material. Increasingly, a knowledge of the bond and loan markets is needed. 'You need to know at what level the companies' bonds can be asset-swapped, when you are pricing loans,' said Mr Alby Cator, head of syndicated loans at NatWest Markets. Although there is little sign of a net increase in volume, the greater enthusiasm of banks for lending is revealed by a tightening of the spreads over the London interbank offered rate at which loans are being agreed. Mr Cator says the spread for a top-rate corporate borrower has tightened from 3/8 point over Libor a year ago to  1/4 point over Libor. 'We haven't yet seen how low spread will go,' he warns. Eighteen months ago, companies were borrowing at 45-50 basis points over Libor. However, in April 1993, Reuters signed a Pounds 160m five-year revolving credit with a margin of  3/8 point over Libor. Despite the aggressive pricing, the deal was heavily oversubscribed, and increased from its original size of Pounds 100m. That deal was followed by a Pounds 150m revolving credit in May for Northern Foods, with the same margin, which also was increased. Last month, W H Smith raised Pounds 140m through a Pounds 140m revolving credit on the same terms  -again oversubscribed. Bankers say that bilateral loans have been agreed at tighter margins. In March, Allied-Lyons raised Dollars 250m over six years at a margin of 30 basis points - but that was for a guarantee facility rather than a revolving credit. In February, BTR Dunlop Finance agreed a three-year revolving credit facility with a margin of 25 basis points. There is anecdotal evidence a number of corporate treasurers are waiting to see if margins have further to fall before coming to the market. 'There have been fewer big corporate deals than we would have expected,' according to Mr Stan Hern, a director of Samuel Montagu. 'Some have held off, expecting pricing to go down.' Generally, companies appear to be borrowing less than in the last cycle, he added. Meanwhile, there has been a resurgence of sovereign business. Most notably, Spain signed a three-year revolving credit facility in September for Ecu5bn, at a margin of just 7.5 basis points. The facility, designed to replace lines from the central bank to the treasury, was heavily oversubscribed. Because of the zero risk weighting of sovereign credits, which means that whatever their credit rating banks do not have to put aside capital to meet guidelines, the banks can afford slimmer margins. While the syndicated loans market has yet to show a marked increase in volume, the good news for borrowers is that banks are chasing what business there is more aggressively. 'There are a lot of foreign banks with operations in London that have to be paid for,' said one banker. 'The maturity of asset portfolios means loss of income, so some banks are desperate for assets, and that is pushing down prices.'  ------------------------------------------------------ International syndicated loans volume (1993-94)  ------------------------------------------------------ Month              Amount        Issues                  (Dollars m)  ------------------------------------------------------ January          13,038.892        128 February         10,859.106        142 March            17,117.661        172 April            12,255.242        131 May              21,756.295        150 June             16,397.362        182 July             22,110.420        208 August           14,544.910        141 September        26,663.741        169 October          11,407.785        133 November         16,156.735        160 December         25,929.089        212 Month unknown     1,967.924         37  ------------------------------------------------------ 1993 total      210,205.162      1,965  ------------------------------------------------------ January          10,916.801        127 February          9,712.423        129 March            16,209.709        179 April            16,615.555         85 Month unknown        71.000          3  ------------------------------------------------------ 1994 total       53,525.488        523  ------------------------------------------------------ TOTAL           263,730.650      2,488  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Euromoney  ------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 10 arrangers of international syndicated loans in 1993*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank   Bank                    Amount (Dollars m)    No     % share  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1      National Westminster         15,631.370      124        7.6 2      Citicorp                     13,591.870      119        6.6 3      Barclays                     10,807.640      103        5.2 4      Deutsche Bank                 9,763.422       58        4.7 5      Hongkong/Midland Group        7,272.328       86        3.5 6      Chase Manhattan               6,796.101      100        3.3 7      Chemical                      6,761.850       96        3.3 8      ABN-AMRO                      6,527.161       83        3.2 9      Union Bank of Switzerland     5,540.704       67        2.7 10     J P Morgan                    5,503.339       40        2.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *USigned loans only, ranked by equal apportionment Source: Euromoney  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

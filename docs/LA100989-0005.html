			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLUTONIUM THREAT OF GALILEO PROBE  </P> <P> Planetary exploration at any risk?  </P> <P> NASA's scheduled shuttle launch on Oct. 12 will bring with it 48 pounds of  plutonium aboard Project Galileo. As the Challenger disaster tragically  illustrated in 1986, NASA's space program is not infallible. Furthermore, it is  believed by some scientists that the plutonium-fueled generator casings are not  capable of withstanding an accident like Challenger. An even distribution of  this plutonium is unlikely, but exposure to intense radioactivity now threatens  many Florida residents if an accident were to occur.  </P> <P> Therefore I ask, should life on Earth be jeopardized by this approach to the  exploration of Jupiter's atmosphere? Let us insist on the implementation of  technologies that protect (not threaten) the health of our own planet.  </P> <P> NANCY OWENS-RENNER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE, COUNTY OFFICIALS STEP UP INSPECTIONS FOR MEDFLIES  </P> <P> Examining the cola-colored liquid from the bottom of an insect trap, county  agricultural inspector Tony Do found nothing larger than a gnat Wednesday.  </P> <P> That made him happy. He had been looking for the dreaded Mediterranean fruit  fly, but he found nothing even resembling the insect's description -- a bug  slightly smaller than a housefly, with yellowish-brown wings.  </P> <P> During a routine inspection last Friday, another county expert had found a lone  pregnant Medfly in the same trap, which had been sitting in a guava tree at a  residence near the intersection of Puente Street and West Walling Avenue in  Brea since last summer. The discovery has prompted the state and county to  schedule an all-out attack on the fly that will include at least two aerial  sprayings of pesticide over a 10-square-mile area beginning next week. The area  to be sprayed includes portions of Fullerton, Brea and La Habra.  </P> <P> It was the first -- and so far only -- fertile Medfly found in Orange County.  </P> <P> However, in Los Angeles County this week, Medflies were found in five  additional neighborhoods, officials said Wednesday. The latest discoveries  prompted serious doubts there about the current eradication efforts and raised  the prospect of widespread aerial pesticide spraying.  </P> <P> The flies were found in South Gate, Monrovia, Eagle Rock, Pasadena and Elysian  Park.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Do is one of about 10 inspectors and technicians checking  about 350 traps daily to monitor the spread of the fly. In addition, several  teams of state officials have been out to sample fruit, looking for Medfly  larvae. One wormy piece of fruit was discovered Wednesday, but it has not yet  been determined if it contained Medfly larvae.  </P> <P> So far, their inspections have not turned up any new fertile Medflies. Nick  Nisson, an Orange County entomologist, said that all the Medflies collected  from traps on Tuesday were sterile. Officials said it takes about 24 hours for  scientists to determine the sterility, so test results on those flies taken  from traps Wednesday won't be known until today. About 25 sterile flies have  been found in Orange County since Friday, he said.  </P> <P> Officials said they have no way of knowing whether the fertile Medfly found in  Brea is a "loner" or part of a wider infestation. But Brian Taylor, a state  entomologist, said it is likely that the pregnant female had laid eggs,  elevating concerns that other fertile Medflies may exist.  </P> <P> "It is always a possibility that it was a loner," Taylor said. "But in this  case it was a mated female, which means she probably had the opportunity to lay  other eggs before being trapped."  </P> <P> When it was confirmed Saturday morning that the fly was fertile, dozens of  state and county workers helped place 1,000 traps within an 81-square-mile  area, including 789 in Orange County. The new traps were all set by Tuesday.  </P> <P> Before the fly was discovered in Brea, county agricultural officials had  checked a few hundred "routine" traps each week, said Steve Hill, the county's  deputy agricultural commissioner. But since the fly was found, they have  stepped up their inspections, checking traps daily within a one-square-mile  area. They also check traps every other day around an eight-mile buffer to the  area.  </P> <P> The county will follow this monitoring routine for one week. If no new flies  are found, the department will revert to its weekly schedule, Hill said.  </P> <P> The traps have been placed on many kinds of fruit trees, with the owners'  permission, Hill said. But the flies, who feed on ripe fruit, are more likely  to be found in traps on trees that are in season, which now include guava, fig  and apple trees.  </P> <P> "Guavas are just in season this time of the year so they are more commonly  found," Do said.  </P> <P> The pregnant fly was found in a McPhail trap, which resembles an upside-down,  round sink. The trap lures many types of insects with a liquid called Staley's  mixture, a sweet, brownish mixture of water, yeast and borax. The flies enter  the trap through the bottom and eventually drown in the lure.  </P> <P> Inspectors also have been hanging the Jackson trap, which is meant specifically  to lure male Medflies. The fly, which is sexually attracted to a special  mixture called Trimedlure inside the triangular trap, is captured when it is  caught on a piece of sticky cardboard.  </P> <P> Also out on Wednesday were several teams from the state Department of  Agriculture's fruit-cutting detail. The teams go from house to house and  carefully inspect garden fruit and vegetables for any sign of Medfly larvae.  They often keep their eyes open for near or fully ripened fruit.  </P> <P> "Just before human consumption, the flies like it," said Genaro Davila, a field  supervisor for the detail.  </P> <P> Among the team's finds on Wednesday was a wormy piece of guava fruit. The  fruit, which had fallen from a tree in a yard on Puente Street, contained about  a dozen small worms, which were put into an alcohol solution to be tested in a  lab. Davila was careful to get all the maggots, which may or may not be Medfly  larvae. There are several types of flies that lay eggs in fruit, he said.  </P> <P> Staff writers Steven R. Churm, Stephanie Chavez and Richard Simon contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

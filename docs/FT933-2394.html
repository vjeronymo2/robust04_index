			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Fishing: Okay, I'm hooked I SEE that British television coverage of the world chess championship is to extend to 75 hours, which is doubtless pleasing to the country's small band of chess enthusiasts. For the rest, I suspect that the spectacle of two immensely brainy men thinking, and assorted lesser brainboxes trying to divine what they are thinking about, may pall. It set me pondering on television's scurvy treatment of Britain's most popular participatory sport, fishing. I fear this reflects a general prejudice, an absurd picture of a man sitting under a green umbrella staring through the rain at a motionless float. In addition, I suspect that few anglers are to be found in the councils of the programme commissioners. But whatever the bias at work, I doubt if the total of hours given to the sport since television was invented would match the time devoted to Kasparov's heavy menace and Short's pink gums and pebbly spectacles. There are also obvious factors inhibiting fishing from taking the place of, say, darts. For long periods not much happens, and when it does, excitement lies more in the heart of the fisherman than in the event itself. The very presence of heavy-footed cameramen waving their lenses puts fish to flight. But there are honourable exceptions. Many years ago the BBC screened a first-rate series called An Angler's Corner, in which the incomparable Bernard Venables chewed his pipe and paraded his wisdom. Jack Hargreaves made many decent, unpretentious films for Southern TV. More recently, Jack Charlton and John Wilson have made series which - whatever one's reservations about the antics of the chief performers - have at least given an idea of what fishing is like. None of these, however, has remotely approached the series running on BBC 2 on Sunday evenings, A Passion For Angling. In terms of beauty, excitement, truth and eloquence, these programmes - I write after seeing the first two - stand alone. What Hugh Miles, the man who made them, has done is to recruit two of Britain's finest fishermen, Chris Yates and Bob James, and allow them to follow their noses - while he follows, camera in hand. Yates and James are not in the mould of the normal personality. Yates is the best writer on fishing in the land, and James is his chum. Together, they have evolved their own philosophy of fishing. Now, there are weaknesses in all this when shaped to television's demands. As you sit beside a reed-fringed lake watching the sun begin to suck away the dawn mist, your mind is liable to be suffused with sub-Wordsorthian images. Putting those reflections into words which are neither syrupy nor pretentious is tricky; and having them narrated by Bernard Cribbins is sometimes a risk too far. The music - all sighing strings and mellow woodwind - reinforces this slightly precious atmosphere of the waterside idyll, established in the first place by the glories of Hugh Miles' camerawork. Nor, in the first programme, was I enraptured by the starring role given to the lad, Pete, complete with his bamboo and string, and squashed tweed hat. But these are minor cavils, compared with the marvels. The second programme in particular - on carp-fishing at Redmire Pool, home of monster carp - was tremendous. Here, our heroes shed their self-consciousness as they contemplated the stately monsters of this fabled water. The moment at which Yates' second big fish opened his rubbery lips to engulf the floating dog biscuit was unbearably thrilling. And my children were transfixed by the climax, at which the intrepid duo leaped from the upper branches of a tree up to their waists in mud and water to do battle with another leviathan. Of course, these programmes do not tell anything like the whole truth. The boredom, the occasional wretchedness, the rages, the heartbreaks are either absent, or sentimentalised. But what television can do, at its best, is to give an authentic, intense taste of a reality, and that is what these programmes do. The best test is whether they make a fisherman want to fish. Within an hour of watching perfect Pete catch his 9lb barbel on the Hampshire Avon, I was seated beside my own favourite barbel swim on the Kennet. I was maddened by midges, missed a succession of good bites, and in the end caught - not a barbel - but a 4lb tench. That is real fishing.</p>

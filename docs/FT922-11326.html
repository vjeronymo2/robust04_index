			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: GM reshapes N American operations GENERAL MOTORS, the US automobile manufacturer which has been suffering heavy losses, yesterday announced plans for a major reorganisation of its troubled North American operations and the strengthening of its balance sheet through a share offering which could raise Dollars 2.3bn. The company is to reshape its North American operations into two divisions, one for trucks and one for cars, in place of the three-division structure introduced in 1984, with one for trucks, one for large cars and one for small cars. The moves are part of a shake-up initiated last December when the company said it would cut some 70,000 jobs over the next few years, close 21 plants and streamline its North American operations. Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, told staff that yesterday's shake-up was likely to lead to the loss of about 20,000 out of the 70,000 jobs which are on the line. Analysts said the moves were also likely to lead to the elimination of a significant part of GM's model range. The move came just weeks after GM's non-executive directors staged a boardroom coup which clipped Mr Stempel's wings, demoted two board members, and elevated Mr Jack Smith, head of international operations, to president and chief operating officer. The issue of common stock, also announced yesterday, will be an important test of investors' views of the company following the shake-up. The share issue will be GM's first issue of common stock since 1955 and the largest public stock offering in US history, excluding the Dollars 2.8bn rights offering to existing shareholders made by Time Warner last year. The current record for a straight common stock issue is held by Chemical Banking, which raised some Dollars 1.4bn earlier this year. Over the past six months corporate America in general has rushed to take advantage of a strong stock market to issue equity and reduce the heavy debt burden it took on during the 1980s. GM, which lost Dollars 4.5bn last year, has already raised Dollars 3.358bn through three tranches of preference stock since the middle of 1991. It had been widely expected to follow through with an issue of common stock, although the magnitude of yesterday's proposed offering took some traders by surprise. GM's shares closed Dollars 2 3/4 lower on Wall Street yesterday at Dollars 39 5/8 . The company plans to issue 50m shares in an offer led managed by Morgan Stanley. Some 35m of the shares are likely to be allocated to the US, with tranches of 6m in the UK, 4.5m in Asia/Pacific markets and 4.5m in other international markets. A further 7.5m shares might be sold in the US if there is sufficient demand. GM currently has some 630m shares outstanding. The group also plans to contribute 12m shares of common stock to its US pension plans this year, in additional to its required contributions, to reduce the schemes' Dollars 8.6bn underfunding.</p>

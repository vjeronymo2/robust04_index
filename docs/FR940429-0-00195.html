			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language for this provision is statutory and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be changed by the Secretary. In addition, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that any survey conducted as part of IPEDS is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will provide valuable information to the Department. Those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices that collect IPEDS information work diligently to create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent, easy-to-use forms and formats, not just because this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes data collection easier for the institutions, but also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it makes tabulating and sorting of the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easier. The Secretary does not believe this requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unduly burdensome to institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that by not allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to impose penalties on students unable to meet their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial obligations due to disbursement delays for loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeds, this provision would force institutions to ``carry''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpaid students indefinitely, creating a financial burden. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested it was not the intent of the statute for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to allow an unpaid student to remain enrolled if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay in disbursement of loan proceeds was caused by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's failure to comply with a program requirement. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter recommended that the regulations stipulate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions would not be prohibited from withholding academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transcripts and other graduate services from students as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of delayed disbursement of Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language of this requirement is for the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part statutory, and very clear in its intent. The Secretary does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe this requirement will cause a financial burden to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions as this situation should not frequently occur if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is complying with all applicable regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not probable that a student would deliberately cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delay of his or her loan disbursement by not complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instructions of the institution or lender; nevertheless, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a situation occurred, the institution would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited from imposing penalties on the student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The withholding of a student's academic transcript or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduate services is considered a penalty by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A very large number of commenters suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations went beyond the scope of the statute by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibiting any type of incentive payments, particularly those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on ``retention.'' Most of those same commenters, plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another large group, felt that token gifts to students and alumni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be excluded from this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that even in incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment structures based on retention there is room for abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, in fact, has seen evidence of such abuse. Since July of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 when the Amendments of 1992 were enacted, many institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have opted to change to retention-based pay for admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel. In that time, the Secretary has seen evidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowered satisfactory progress standards and in extreme cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falsified attendance and leave of absence requests, all in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to keep students enrolled. In many cases, these practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were designed by admissions personnel who were duly paid after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student passed a retention mark. After that mark, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students were dropped. Furthermore, the Secretary has evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that some of these students were admitted using falsified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability-to-benefit tests, which further ties the issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retention to enrollment. The Secretary believes that reputable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conscientious institutions can develop other creative ways to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reward their employees that will have no direct or indirect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship to success in securing enrollments. Regarding token  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gifts for students and alumni who refer other students, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, after reviewing the comments, has decided that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices are widespread and will cause no harm if the tokens are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not monetary, and limits are placed both on their value and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency of distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has amended &sect;668.14(b)(22) to allow that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> token gifts may be given to students or alumni for referring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other students for admission to the institution, as long as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the gift is not money, check or money order;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) no more than one such gift is given to any student or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alumnus; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) the value of the gift is no more than twenty-five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven commenters asserted that most institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer athletically related student aid are currently audited by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and that the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be amended to state that compilations and audits which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together satisfy NCAA and OMB also satisfy the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (d) and (e) of the regulation. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that the proposed regulations paralleled NCAA audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and compliance should not pose a problem for member  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. One commenter pointed out that a ``compilation'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a term defined under Statements on Standards for Accounting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review Services No.1 and only provides a representation without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any assurances on the statements. The commenter suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary require preparation of a schedule, and have that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule audited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute and regulations stand on their own. It is up to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to determine if a particular audit or compilation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for a different organization satisfies the conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of the regulation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes it is unwise to give blanket approval to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits and compilations which, although at present may satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation, may not at a later date. Furthermore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language of this provision, as written, covers all institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even those which are not NCAA members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven commenters indicated that by making the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date that the Secretary signs an institution's program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement, there may well be a lapse of time from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expiration of the prior program participation agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during which the institution may be ineligible. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> felt this may create financial problems for both institutions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, and some recommended that program participation be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive to the date of application. Some other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> felt program participation should be made retroactive to the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the certification review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language for this provision is statutory. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has no reason to believe that Congress had any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent when the law was drafted. However, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understands the concern of commenters that an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreement might expire after an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has submitted a renewal application but before the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signs a new program participation agreement. The Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified &sect;668.13 to address that concern. See the section of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that addresses certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures (&sect;668.13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.15&blank;Factors of Financial Responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : A few commenters supported all of the Secretary's proposed regulations in &sect;668.15. One of the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended the inclusion of a debt to net worth ratio in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering an institution's financial responsibility. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter, who disagreed with the Secretary's rationale for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the current ratio requirement from 1:1 to 1.25:1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the Secretary consider other types of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis such as a ``Z Score'' in evaluating an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial resources. Another commenter, who also disagreed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary, believed that tangible net worth was not an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate indicator of financial responsibility and recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Secretary consider cash flow statements in his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary considered a number of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio tests that could be used to evaluate an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial condition. While the Secretary does consider minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitalization an important factor in determining an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial responsibility, he has elected not to put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a standard into regulation at this time. Based upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited information presented by in the commenters, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not convinced that a ``Z Score'' would be an appropriate measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of financial responsibility for an institution. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary will monitor the financial information gathered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with these regulations to determine whether it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate to require either additional, or alternative cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow statement criteria as a factor in determining financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

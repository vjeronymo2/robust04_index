			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk under the rubric "Duties": </F> "Some Win, Some Lose"]    [Text] It appears that the heated debate that has  recently begun on account of the government's adoption of  increased customs duties on imported goods, primarily  foodstuffs, has entered its final stage. In the opinion of the  critics of the decree, only the president can bring this bitter  controversy to an end.    What has the discussion shown? Perhaps it merely confirmed  the truth that, as is often the case, there are two sides to  every problem. Judge for yourselves.    An appeal to the president by trading enterprises, such as  the Menatep Trading House, Eksportkhleb, Medeya, Eksimer, and  others, says reasonably that the adoption of the decree imperils  the very opportunity to fulfill already signed contracts to  import foodstuffs. The contracts have already been paid for;  they were signed on the basis of the price situation that  existed prior to adoption of the decree. Payment of new customs  duties may now result in bankruptcy for most of these  structures. After all, tens of thousands of tonnes of foodstuffs  are at issue. For example, the Menatep Trading House alone has  imported foodstuffs worth 80 billion rubles [R] to Moscow.    Moscow, just like St. Petersburg, is a special case. This  has  to do with the fact that, as the leaders of the capital city  testify, imported foodstuffs take up 52 percent of the  foodstuffs market in the city. Minister of Agriculture Viktor  Khlystun gives even more impressive numbers: He maintains that  the proportion of foodstuffs from abroad in these cities comes  to 70 percent. This makes understandable the concern of the  mayors of these cities and Yekaterinburg, where the situation is  by all signs similar. Prospects of a reduced selection and  rapidly soaring prices of foodstuffs alarm the leaders.    After all, this is not about exotic fruits and gourmet fare  but, for example, powdered milk for dairy plants, meat products,  and granulated sugar for the confectionery industry. Last year  70,000 tonnes of dry milk alone were purchased for the capital  city through imports. Yuriy Luzhkov's anxiety is not without  reason, that is the truth. Let us say that the quantity of milk  and dairy products may diminish and, therefore, products made of  milk will become more expensive.    However, it is also true that, in the words of Anatoliy  Petukhov, chairman of the Mozhayskiy joint-stock company in the  vicinity of Moscow, the herd of cows on this former sovkhoz has  been reduced by 200 head. What is the reason? They do not know  what to do with natural milk; yet the procurement price per  liter of milk in Moscow was R158 in February, while the retail  price was R450-470. The picture in St. Petersburg was  approximately the same. Therefore, the following observation by  Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha can be considered  quite reasonable: Since the mayors are concerned about the  possible growth of prices, they may very well apply themselves  by reducing various intermediate services.    For now, the selection in many shops of Moscow, for example,  such as the Tverskoy delicatessen, consists of imported goods.  Aleksey Filippov, commercial director of the store, thinks:  "Eighty percent of our foodstuffs are foreign. Naturally, once  the batches imported before 15 March run out, foodstuffs will  become more expensive, and fewer of them will be purchased."    Nonetheless, it is easy to notice that the new customs  duties  will entail superprotectionism for the domestic producer, will  rule out imports as an "instructor" in the better quality of  goods, and will eliminate the incentive to reduce costs. A  situation whereby unprofitable farms will remain such under the  new tariffs is quite possible: Structural changes in agriculture  are proceeding too languidly; somehow we still cannot get down  to reducing the producer cost of agricultural products. To be  sure, for the sake of fairness we must note that, as our  agrarians maintain, the uncompetitiveness of the Russian  producer is also entailed by the fact that agricultural  production is more than 50 percent subsidized in Western  countries.    What else is behind the increase in customs duties, apart  from the proclaimed defense of the economic interests of Russian  agricultural producers? I believe that it is, first, an attempt  at more powerful state regulation of foreign economic activities  and, second, the calculation that this action will yield almost  $4 million [as published] for the state budget. It is hard to  say what this calculation is based on: In the opinion of some  experts, the traders already know how to bypass customs in the  process of importing goods and how to understate their cost if  they have to legally transport foodstuffs across the border.    Nonetheless, for now the main question still remains--will  foodstuffs become more expensive and by how much? Some believe  that a 15-20 percent raise in customs duties will result in a  twofold growth of retail prices due to credit costs.    Others, including Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr  Zaveryukha,  have stated that the new duties will have virtually no influence  on the growth of prices because substantial reserves of food  staples have now been accumulated in Russia, which the peasants  do not know what to do with. In particular, reserves of meat  products in Russia as of 1 March came to 226,000 tonnes, which  would suffice to supply the country for one month; reserves of  milk come to 1.222 million tonnes, butter--45,500 tonnes, and  sugar--594,000 tonnes, that is, there is 3.5 times more of it  than there was last year.    Nonetheless, the fight over the government decree on import  duties goes on. Hence the terms in the vocabulary of the  agricultural minister which are more fitting for a military  commander. Viktor Khlystun is convinced that "massive  agricultural intervention from abroad, especially in 1993, is  one of the reasons for the current crisis in the Russian  agrarian sector." The "heavy artillery" has also thundered. In a  telegram to the president and the prime minister, the chairmen  of the agrarian committees of the Council of the Federation and  the State Duma, Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy and Aleksandr Nazarchuk,  called for "preventing cancellation of the decree on confirming  rates of customs duties on imports."    What are we, the civilian population, dejectedly looking at  the price tags in the stores every day, to do? Wait and, like in  any war, pray and hope for mercy from the victor, all the more  so because Minister of Agriculture Viktor Khlystun has promised:  "In 1994 the Russian peasants are capable of meeting the  country's needs for foodstuffs, and lacking food items can be  delivered from CIS countries for which duty-free trading  procedures remain in effect."    This might be so. However, reports are already coming in:  Having assessed the situation, domestic producers in some  locations have raised prices for butter and poultry, chicken in  particular. Ultimately, one thing is clear: The duties that have  been introduced are a temporary measure. The main decisions lie  ahead.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Sevastopol under the </F> "Conflict" rubric: "Black Sea Fleet Ships Denied Access to  Ukrainian Ports. Admiral Baltin Does Not Want To Take Any Risky  Steps"]    [Text] It has transpired from sources close to the Black  Sea Fleet staff that a telegram from Ukrainian Defense Minister  General Vitaliy Radetskyy to Admiral Eduard Baltin, Black Sea  Fleet commander, was received on 15 April, in which the former  categorically objects to the entry of Black Sea Fleet ships and  vessels to the Ukrainian ports of Odessa, Izmail, Kherson, and  Nikolayev. Meanwhile, the Black Sea Fleet command has been  preparing ships for evacuating eight families of the 318th  Division's servicemen who refused to take the oath of loyalty to  Ukraine. When meeting with them, Vice Admiral Vladimir  Beskaravaynyy, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Navy, who  heads the naval field staff at the "Slavutich" cruiser in  Odessa, proposed that the officers take an oath of allegiance to  Ukraine and follow him on board "Slavutich." The commander of  "Ilya Azarov," a ship blocked in the Odessa port, responded:  "We will not go to an enemy ship; these people have robbed us.  They will finish robbing us there."    In Odessa, the Black Sea Fleet's surveillance post has also  been blocked. Black Sea Fleet staff officers point out that the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry has made it clear by its actions that  it is carrying out the functions of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet  and its Foreign Ministry.    Currently, the 318th Division of mothballed ships includes  three Black Sea Fleet ships, on which Ukrainian flags have  already been hoisted. Black Sea Fleet Commander Adm. Baltin has  decided not to take any steps to evacuate servicemen, because  this may be interpreted by the Ukrainian side as a provocation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP] demanded Monday that the government clarify  its position on the North Korean nuclear row as the national  policy on that issue is being clouded by remarks made by former  opposition leader Kim Tae-chung in the United States.    At a meeting of senior party postholders, presided over by  Chairman Kim Chong-pil, the ruling party decided to urge the  National Unification Board (NUB) to issue a clarifying statement  on Kim Tae-chung's remarks, DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin said.    Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, told the  meeting he could not understand Kim Tae-chung's reasons for  making remarks that create uneasiness at a time when the entire  nation is striving to resolve the nuclear dispute.    Kim Chong-pil added that Kim Tae-chung's comments cannot be  understood by the people, Pak said.    THE WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Kim Tae-chung as saying Saturday  that even if North Korea possessed two or three atomic bombs, it  wouldn't be much of a problem compared with the United States'  20,000 nuclear warheads.    The DLP is expected to make a formal request that the  government clarify its North Korea policy when the National  Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee  meets in plenary session on Thursday.    Pak said Kim Tae-chung's remarks, which "sounded like"  support for North Korea's possession of nuclear bombs, were akin  to pouring cold water on international efforts to stop Pyongyang  from developing atomic weapons.    More than a few people have doubts about Kim Tae-chung's  reasons for making comments that are irresponsible and  unthinkable to South Koreans, Pak said.    Meanwhile, the main opposition Democratic Party accused the  ruling party of taking Kim Tae-chung's remarks out of context  and distorting them.    Deputy spokesman Sol Hun recalled that Kim Tae-chung, the  Democratic Party's former chairman, has in the past said many  times that North Korea should not have nuclear weapons under any  circumstances.    Kim Tae-chung's latest comments mean that even if North  Korea  possessed two or three nuclear bombs, it could not use them  against the Western world, which has numerous nuclear arms. Kim  only wanted to stress that it is foolish for North Korea to  possess such weapons, he added.    Despite that fact, "part of the press has picked up on the  erroneous report (by the U.S. newspaper) and carried it as  though it were true," he said. "Then the DLP spokesman turned it  around and distorted it, saying it was something a South Korean  couldn't even think of saying, etc."    The Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation stated that Kim Tae-chung  made the remarks in order to stress the foolishness of North  Korea's developing nuclear arms, as possession of such weapons  would only bring about self-destruction.</p>

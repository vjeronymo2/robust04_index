			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Banks report mortgage surge Mortgage lending undertaken by leading British banks in March was more than 40 per cent higher than the equivalent figure in February, the British Bankers' Association said yesterday. Figures published by the association show gross lending at Pounds 1.55bn in March, compared with Pounds 1.06bn in February, in a figure revised upwards slightly from the originally published statistics. There was also an increase in the number of new mortgages approved, which reached 31,518, with a total value of Pounds 1.58bn. New mortgage approvals are seen as an important indicator of prospects for the housing market, and the total number for March is the highest since August last year. Lord Inchyra, association director-general, said the figures for mortgage approvals suggested that April's tax increases had had little immediate impact on buyers' confidence. While much of the increase in lending was attributed to seasonal factors, he said that lending statistics provided 'welcome evidence of a recovery from the normal seasonal weakness around the turn of the year'. But the proportion of new mortgage approvals granted to first-time buyers fell back to 46 per cent in March, from 50 per cent the month before. The past year or so has seen intensifying competition for mortgage lending between banks and building societies. In terms of market share, the association said the increase in the value of new mortgages approved by banks, at 38 per cent, was notably higher than the equivalent indicator for building societies, where the rise in March amounted to 28 per cent. House prices rose slightly in April, according to the Nationwide building society index. This showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared with March, continuing a recent gently rising trend which takes the annual rate of increase to 2.9 per cent.</p>

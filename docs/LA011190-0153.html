			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SCREWBALL' FILMS FROM PAST GET A SERIOUS LOOK  </P> <P> Some of the funniest movies ever made are about to be screened at the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Starting Friday and continuing through March 3, the museum will present  "Screwball," a program of comedies from the 1930s and '40s, including "You  Can't Take It With You" and other classics as well as such rarities as Alfred  Hitchcock's sole screwball effort, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith."  </P> <P> Ronald Haver, director of the museum's film department, said his inspiration  for the program was friend Ed Sikov's recent publication of "Screwball," the  first book-length study of vintage madcap.  </P> <P> Haver said he first became enamored of them as a film-smitten adolescent in the  1950s. He would sit up half the night to catch a butchered-for-TV version of  "His Girl Friday" or some other classic, then desperately try not to wake up  the whole house with his guffaws. At the museum, he noted, people will be able  to see first-rate prints of the films as they were meant to be seen -- larger  than life, in an auditorium of people roaring with laughter.  </P> <P> According to Haver, the form was born in 1934 with either Frank Capra's "It  Happened One Night" or Howard Hawks' "Twentieth Century." He would give honors  to the latter because its humor was so pioneeringly off the wall. Hawks' 1952  "Monkey Business," in which Marilyn Monroe plays a secretary whose walk is more  memorable than her typing, is the last of the screwball classics, Haver said.  More recent comedies, such as Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up, Doc?" are too  derivative to include.  </P> <P> "Wacky" is one of the terms inevitably used to describe the screwball comedies.  It is hard to think of a better word for a movie like "Bringing Up Baby" in  which Cary Grant croons a love song to a leopard and wears a feather-trimmed  negligee.  </P> <P> The term screwball, film historian Sikov reports, was coined around 1930 by  Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants to describe his most famous pitch. It moved  in the opposite direction from a curve ball, leaving the batter wondering what  had happened. The convoluted plots and breakneck speed of the screwball  comedies sometimes leave audiences slightly dazed as well. "They are really  pinwheels," Haver said.  </P> <P> "Nothing Sacred" -- the title of one of the two films that opens the series  Friday -- could serve as a two-word summary of the form.  </P> <P> "The thing that makes these things still so wonderful," Haver said, "is their  irreverence -- toward pomposity, institutions, money, fame." Among the favorite  targets: big business, rural America, tabloid journalism, the pretensions of  the rich and especially marriage.  </P> <P> While the surface of screwball is inevitably comic, the view of the world  reflected in the films is often cynical, even jaundiced, Haver said, which  makes many of them more palatable to contemporary audiences than sentimental  movies of the time.  </P> <P> The tart quality of screwball extends even to romance. However much in love  they declare themselves to be at the fade-out, screwball couples are invariably  making war, not love. As Haver explained, screwball was born the same year as  the establishment of the Production Code, which filled the bedrooms of the  movies with unrumpled twin beds. "Overt sex was banned," he said. "What  replaced it was the battle of the sexes." ("In the world of screwball comedy,"  Sikov writes, "there is one primary axiom: Hatred is no reason to give up on a  relationship. Just because two people seem to despise each other doesn't mean  they're not in love.")  </P> <P> The code led to movies in which Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn bicker and  banter and skewer and squawk with the kind of intensity that is associated in  the real world with more conventional coupling. As Haver put it: "They flirt  with it, they talk about it, but they never actually do it."  </P> <P> A perfect example of the form's preoccupation with, but oblique approach to  sex, is Preston Sturges' "The Palm Beach Story," where the forbidden activity  is termed "topic A." Not surprisingly, infidelity, especially infidelity that  never actually occurred, is a favorite theme. In spite of the fact that the  couples must keep both feet on the floor at all times, or perhaps because of  it, films such as "The Lady Eve" are considered among Hollywood's most erotic.  </P> <P> According to Haver, one of the reasons the movies hold up so well is their  liberated attitude toward women. As played by Ginger Rogers, Carole Lombard,  Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne and other "stalwarts of screwball" as Haver  calls them, the women in these movies "were always equals, if not at the  beginning by the end."  </P> <P> Although the form is full of madcap heiresses, it also features boss ladies and  other independent women. Among the most notable examples is "His Girl Friday,"  the rewrite of "The Front Page" in which star reporter Hildy Johnson, played by  Rosalind Russell, is every bit as smart and cynical as the male reporter of the  same name in the original. Professional women often fared better in such films,  Haver said, than they do in contemporary movies such as 1988's "Working Girl."  </P> <P> Although many notable directors, including Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, Ernst  Lubitsch and Preston Sturges, are associated with screwball, Haver sees these  films as far more than expressions of a director's vision. "The director is one  element in the success of these films," he said, "and it's arguable whether he  is the most important element." Haver pointed out that one of the best films,  "Theodora Goes Wild," was directed by Richard Boleslawski, still a virtual  unknown.  </P> <P> Screwball also owes much to writers such as Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and  to actors who could do silly things with dignity and deftness. Even the Art  Deco sets and swanky costumes contribute to the success of screwball.  </P> <P> Besides "My Man Godfrey," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and other well-known  examples, the program will include such rarely screened films as the original  "Front Page," "Nothing Sacred" -- one of the first Technicolor movies -- and  "It's Love I'm After" with Bette Davis. "You never associate Bette Davis with  screwball comedy," Haver noted. "They manage to loosen her up a little, but she  never loses her stridency."  </P> <P>  The program starts Friday with screenings of "The Awful Truth" and "Nothing  Sacred" at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. "It Happened One Night" and "Twentieth  Century" will be shown Saturday, beginning at 8 p.m.  </P> <P>  Subsequent films will be screened on Wednesdays, Fridays or Saturdays (see  Sunday Calendar for upcoming films). The program will close Saturday, March 3,  with a seven-movie screwball marathon.  </P> <P>  All screenings will be held in the museum's Leo S. Bing Theater. Most weekend  screenings are $6 general admission, $3.50 for seniors. Wednesday matinees are  $1 for the general public, 50 cents for seniors. Tickets for the screwball  marathon are $12, $7 for seniors.  </P> <P>  For more information, call the box office at (213) 857-6010.  </P> <P> </P></p>

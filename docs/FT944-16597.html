			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures powered ahead with premiums to the cash market widening at times to more than 30 points, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract closed 45 points higher at 3,102, moving above 3,100 for the first time since mid September and extending its rally to 128 points in four days. At this level, the premium to the cash market was 29 points against a fair value premium of around 16 points. Virtually all the day's gains were made from lunchtime onwards, moving ahead very fast once Wall Street came into the picture showing a strong advance. Volume, which was a dreary 10,657 on Monday, jumped to 14,793 contracts at the official 4:10pm close, but traders said there was a marked absence of genuine business. The speed and acceleration of the afternoon upswing caught some traders on the hop and there was talk in the market that a number of short positions taken in the morning session had been severely squeezed. Volume in traded options rose strongly, jumping to 43,931 lots from 24,420 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 27,600 lots. Guinness was the day's most actively traded individual stock option with 2,000 lots dealt followed by British Airways with 1,792 lots.</p>

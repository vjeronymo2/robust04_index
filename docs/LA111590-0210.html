			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOG A HANG-UP FOR AIRPORT TRAVELERS;  </P> <P> WEATHER: A GRAY BLANKET KEEPS JOHN WAYNE RUNWAYS EMPTY AND PHONE BANKS FULL OF  BUSINESS FLIERS TRYING TO RESCHEDULE CANCELED FLIGHTS.  </P> <P> Some sprinted through the cavernous airport terminal to the nearest telephone  booth to reschedule appointments. Others took a more relaxed approach and  perched themselves in the Orange Grill bar to wait for the fog to lift at John  Wayne Airport on Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> Whatever the pastime, nearly all early morning travelers to John Wayne had time  to kill. A heavy blanket of fog reduced visibility to zero and forced the  cancellation or delay of all commercial flights until 9:15 a.m.  </P> <P> "We sat in the plane for about an hour, then were told to wait," said Greg  Paydock, one of dozens of businessmen and women to scramble to the banks of  phone booths. "That was frustrating."  </P> <P> Air travelers shouldn't suffer the same headaches today, according to weather  forecasters. While some patches of fog were expected, visibility should not be  affected, said Marty McKewon, a meteorologist for Kansas-based WeatherData,  which does forecasting for The Times.  </P> <P> The fog disrupted airport operations for two hours, but that translated into  longer delays for many travelers who missed connecting flights, like John  McGovern.  </P> <P> McGovern and his wife stared at the flight information screen and wondered what  to make of the flashing CANCELED next to their flight to Phoenix. They knew  they were not going to make a connection to New York.  </P> <P> "I know it's an inconvenience, but what can you do?" said McGovern, who has  been vacationing in Southern California for nine days. "I haven't seen fog all  week, now this happens. It's Murphy at work."  </P> <P> Phil McCarty passed the time slouched in a chair snoring peacefully among a  pile of suit bags and briefcases strewn on the chairs. He and partner Pat  Diamond were on their way to San Jose.  </P> <P> "You can hang him from a meat hook and he'll fall asleep," Diamond said  jokingly as he looked at the American Airlines check-in desk, watching for news  of when the flight would take off.  </P> <P> Meteorologist McKewon said the fog was caused by a storm front that swept from  the Gulf of Alaska into Central California. The system created wet weather in  the Pacific Northwest, but only caused a reversal of the wind pattern in  Southern California.  </P> <P> That reversal, coupled with clear skies and low temperatures overnight, created  the foggy condition along the coast, McKewon said.  </P> <P> The Southern California area should have scattered high clouds for the rest of  the week, McKewon said, with a slight chance of rain over the weekend.  </P> <P> Law enforcement authorities said the fog also caused problems for rush-hour  motorists on the San Diego Freeway, slowing traffic and causing numerous  collisions as drivers tried to get to work in visibility as low as 25 feet.  </P> <P> "I had to drive with my head out the window," Orange County Sheriff's  Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Angel Johnson said that most of the  traffic accidents were fender-benders. "There wasn't anything really tragic out  there," she said.  </P> <P> CHP spokesman Officer Lyle Whitten said the accidents caused no injuries,  although the fog was particularly dangerous because it covered parts of the  freeway in large patches.  </P> <P> "Drivers go into a pocket of fog at freeway speed, then they suddenly slow  down," Whitten said. "That's when we have multiple rear-end collisions."  </P></p>

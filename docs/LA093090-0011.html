			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: STRAVINSKY'S 'PULCINELLA' AND MORE  </P> <P> "Pulcinella' was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole  of my late work became possible," Stravinsky wrote in 1962.  </P> <P> "It was a backward look, of course -- the first of many love affairs in that  direction -- but it was a look in the mirror, too."  </P> <P> Stravinsky was talking about his 1920 commedia dell'arte ballet score for  Diaghilev, based on music ascribed to Giambattista Pergolesi, the short-lived  Neapolitan (1710-36) whose posthumous reputation was such that he was credited  with 330 compositions, of which some 300 have since been proven spurious. But  "Pulcinella" preceded the start of the debunking process by three decades.  </P> <P> The source material is, as it turns out, the work of half a dozen composers,  including Pergolesi, whose portion is seven of the ballet's 19 numbers, and an  obscure contemporary of his named Domenico Gallo who provided five, including  the obsessively catchy tune with which the score opens.  </P> <P> While Stravinsky left the inherited melodies very nearly intact, he infused  them with the rhythmic dynamism that is uniquely his, while providing the  delectably dry orchestration for an ensemble of 30-odd players.  </P> <P> The Stravinsky method of working with borrowed materials is set forth in a  helpful new recording (London 425 614) in which his complete score is followed  by some engaging source material: trio sonata movements by Gallo (including the  opening theme) and a cello piece by Pergolesi (London 425 614).  </P> <P> "Pulcinella" is performed by the excellent St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, whose  efforts, alas, are overshadowed by Christopher Hogwood's humorless, unincisive  direction. The trio of vocal soloists ranges from smoothly proficient (mezzo  Bernadette Manca di Nissa) to adequate if hard-pressed (bass John Ostendorf) to  crude (tenor David Gordon).  </P> <P> The program takes wing, however, with the Baroque sources, snappily projected  by a small contingent of orchestra principals, led by Hogwood in his element:  directing 18th-Century repertory from the harpsichord.  </P> <P> A wholly original example of Stravinsky-looking-back -- disdaining, that is,  the episodic structure, grandioseness and rhythmic fury of "Le Sacre du  Printemps," with which he had set the world on its ear in 1913 in favor of  formal order and textural clarity -- rounds out what should have been a  dynamite program: a punchless reading by Hogwood and his Minnesotans of the  1938 "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto, a dry-point evocation of the Baroque concerto  grosso.  </P> <P> There is no source material as a bonus, but conductor Richard Hickox, his  responsive City of London Sinfonia and a stylish vocal trio -- mezzo Ann  Murray, tenor Martyn Hill and bass David Thomas -- do present "Pulcinella" with  all its gleaming wit, charm and rowdiness intact (Virgin Classics 90767).  </P> <P> The added work here, superlatively done by Hickox and his instrumentalists, is  backward-looking and unmistakably of its time (1942), the tough, acerbic,  all-Stravinsky "Danses Concertantes."  </P> <P> Note: Virgin's annotator, unaware of half a century's worth of Baroque  scholarship (and a good deal of Stravinsky scholarship as well) ascribes all of  the "Pulcinella" sources to Pergolesi. In addition, Virgin supplies neither  texts nor translations of the vocal segments.  </P> <P> The most rigorously backward-looking -- formally, texturally and rhythmically  clear -- of the immediate post-"Pulcinella" pieces of the 1920s are the  not-too-often encountered Concerto for Piano and Winds, the "Capriccio" for the  same combination and the Symphonies of Wind Instruments.  </P> <P> All three are presented, along with the desert-dry "Movements" (1959) for piano  and a more usual orchestra of winds and strings, in dynamic, superbly detailed  readings by pianist Paul Crossley and the London Sinfonietta under Esa-Pekka  Salonen (Sony Classics 45797).  </P> <P> Stravinsky's 1946 Concerto in D for string orchestra is a far more menacing  work than one might guess from listening to the slick, sweet-toned performance  by the Moscow Virtuosi under Vladimir Spivakov (RCA 60370).  </P> <P> The program is, nonetheless, intriguingly unhackneyed, offering in addition to  the Stravinsky, Prokofiev's delightful "Overture on Hebrew Themes"; the flashy  "Capriccio" for oboe and strings of Penderecki; Karl Amadeus Hartmann's  touching 1939 "Concerto funebre," with Spivakov himself as the silky violin  soloist.  </P> <P> And, finally, the funny-weird "Suite in Old Style" by the Soviet Union's  current musical bad-boy in residence, Alfred Schnittke, which starts off as  fake (mock?) Handel with "wrong" notes in the bass and leads us into  alternating sprightly and pensive tunes that have a way either of not finishing  or taking us down false paths, in the spirit of Mozart's "Musical Joke."  </P></p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taking advice to the bank  -In a nutshell A new support organisation for both business and personal customers of the banks has been established. The Independent Banking Advisory Service (IBAS) will provide members with free advice on simple problems and a referral service on to professional advisers, who will charge their normal fees, on more complicated issues. IBAS is a breakaway organisation from the Bank Action Group (BAG) but plans to concentrate on providing advice rather than lobbying. Founder and chief executive of IBAS is Eddy Weatherill, co-founder of BAG. Membership of IBAS costs Pounds 45 plus VAT for businesses and Pounds 25 including VAT for individuals. IBAS says its strength is that it will be able to concentrate on banking issues. At present though IBAS is still building up a network of professional advisers and prospective members should compare the range and cost of its services with those provided by existing small business organisations.

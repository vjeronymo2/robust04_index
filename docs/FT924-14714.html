			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Spie expects to reduce losses SPIE-BATIGNOLLES, one of France's largest construction companies which fell into the red last year, expects to reduce its losses significantly this year after making a lower than expected deficit in the first half. The company, a subsidiary of the Schneider electrical engineering group, managed to contain its interim loss to FFr91.2m, (Dollars 18.8m) against FFr150.5m in the first six months of last year. Spie attributed the improvement to a reduction in costs following the restructuring of its French construction interests. The company said yesterday that it expected its loss in the second half to be roughly in line with that of the first. It also forecast a slight fall in turnover for the full year from FFr22.5bn in 1991 to around FF21bn in 1992, reflecting its withdrawal from unprofitable areas of activity. Last year, Spie crashed from profits of FFr251m in 1991 into a loss of FFr950m. This was attributed to the general slowdown in France's construction industry and losses on the company's work on the Channel Tunnel project.</p>

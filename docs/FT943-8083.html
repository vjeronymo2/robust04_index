			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Getty stands by his Pounds 1m offer Mr John Paul Getty, the US billionaire, yesterday confirmed his donation of Pounds 1m towards the fund to keep 'The Three Graces' sculpture in Britain, the Victoria and Albert Museum said yesterday. The announcement ends fears that Mr Getty will withdraw his offer. He had been upset at remarks by Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, implying that the offer was made because of a grudge towards his father. Mr Clifford retracted his remarks and apologised unreservedly to Mr Getty. The museum said it had Pounds 6.8m towards the required total of Pounds 7.6m. The remaining Pounds 800,000 has to be raised by November 5. Observer, Page 13</p>

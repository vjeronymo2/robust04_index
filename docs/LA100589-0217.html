			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARMED YOUTH HOLDS SCHOOL CLASS HOSTAGE, WOUNDS 1;  </P> <P> SURRENDERS TO POLICE IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> A 14-year-old student armed with a shotgun and handgun walked into a drama  class at Loara High School in Anaheim today, held 36 students hostage for  nearly 40 minutes and shot one pupil in the face before surrendering,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Witnesses at the scene identified the suspect as Cory Robb, who is a freshman  at the high school but was not enrolled in the drama class.  </P> <P> Anthony Lopez, 15, was in satisfactory condition at UCI Medical Center in  Orange after he was shot on the left side of his face.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reportedly Taunting Suspect  </P> <P> Lopez, a student in the drama class, was one of several in the class reportedly  taunting the suspect, believing his threats were a practical joke. Season  Rodriguez, another member of the class, said Lopez mocked the suspect, saying,  " 'Oh, we've got a suicidal killer on our hands.' "  </P> <P> Rodriguez said, "Everybody thought it was a joke. . . . I don't think Cory  meant to go in there and shoot anyone."  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said the armed youth entered the campus choir  room in an auditorium where the drama students were gathered about 9:30 a.m.  Rodriguez said the youth appeared calm and said he did not intend to harm  anyone.  </P> <P> "He said he just wanted to get even with his (step)father," said Rodriguez,  adding that suspect said he planned to keep the students "several hours."  </P> <P> After the taunting, the suspect then fired one shot, Rodriguez said. Soon  after, he released Lopez, who was bleeding but was able to walk out. The  suspect also released several girls from the classroom and allowed Rodriguez to  use a telephone in the room to call her father.  </P> <P> After the shooting, Rodriguez said the girls in the class "were crying and  screaming, and half the boys were getting sick."  </P> <P> Hedgpeth said officers were en route to the campus when they learned one  student had been wounded. The ordeal began during first period, and school  officials, using the campus public address system, advised teachers to ignore  the school bells and keep students in their classrooms and lock the doors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Persuaded to Surrender  </P> <P> Hedgpeth said police negotiators, using the telephone into the room, were able  to persuade the suspect to surrender, and about 10:10 a.m. he walked out of the  classroom. He was taken into custody for questioning.  </P> <P> Police said the youth was armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and a semiautomatic  handgun.  </P> <P> Students and parents who gathered in front of the campus in the 1700 block of  W. Cerritos Avenue said the youth has had problems at home, particularly with  his stepfather. It was unclear why he went to the classroom.  </P> <P> Robb attended Ball Junior High School last year. Friends said he was quiet and  somewhat of a loner, though he was considered friendly. He also had a  "fascination for guns," said a woman who knows the youth and his family.  </P> <P> Psychologists were being sent to the scene to talk to some students, who were  then expected to be released to their parents.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this story were Times staff writers Lily Eng, Maria Newman  and Bob Schwartz.  </P></p>

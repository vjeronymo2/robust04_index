			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories try to calm nerves over election - Public Opinion GOVERNMENT managers tried to steady party nerves yesterday as senior ministers damped rumours sweeping Westminster that Mr John Major could announce the election as early as today. Senior party figures commented disparagingly on an NOP poll which is said to show a 5 point Labour lead in about 50 marginal seats. The survey is said to show Labour on 43 per cent with the Conservatives on 38 per cent, and the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent. Calming speculation about an election announcement today, ministers said a statement on next week's parliamentary business, dominated by Budget arrangements, would go ahead as planned. One reason for the rumours could have been Mr Major's visit to Buckingham Palace last night to attend the presentation of the Queen's Awards for Industry, on top of his customary audience with the Queen on Tuesday. Tory managers put the best face they could on the NOP poll, emphasising the difference between a poll based on small samples in 50 seats and one involving larger numbers across more sampling points. They insisted that the Tories had better party organisation in the marginals, and that the 'incumbency' factor would favour sitting Tory MPs. NOP would not comment on the findings, but said that the interviews, with 20 people in each seat, were carried out last Wednesday. The survey was commissioned by the Local Government Chronicle and the television programme Public Eye. At Westminster, the Tories turned the campaign back to Labour's effect on the economy, as Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, presented City forecasts predicting higher public sector borrowing and inflation and lower growth under Labour. The message will be driven home in a party political broadcast tonight using the slogan that Labour would mean the double blow of 'more taxes and higher prices'. Labour responded that the Tories had not included the most recent estimates indicating better employment and growth and lower inflation at the end of a first-term Labour government compared with a further Conservative term. The Local Government Bill, which introduces the new council tax, cleared its final Commons stage last night and is due to receive Royal Assent tomorrow. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, told the House that regulations closing the legal loophole preventing computer evidence being used to establish non-payment of poll would be introduced as soon as the bill became law.</p>

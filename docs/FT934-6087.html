			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Anthony Burgess - Obituary If ever a writer stayed in harness until the end it was Anthony Burgess whose death from cancer at the age of 76 was announced yesterday. His erudite reviews were appearing right up to his demise. In April His most recent novel, A Dead Man in Deptford, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the death of Christopher Marlowe. It was one of half-a-dozen or so novels resurrecting a historical figure - Keats, Shakespeare, Mozart, Joyce, Moses - that formed but a part of Burgess's vast output. He had the knack of identifying completely with a creative genius of another age, bringing the individual convincingly back to life. The climax was invariably a scene of horrendous violence. The spectacle of Kit Marlowe, a homosexual, a spy and a poet, stabbed to death in a tavern brawl, simply played into Burgess's hands. It was not only the past that inspired Burgess to depict violent outcomes but also the present and the future. In his most famous work A Clockwork Orange (1962) he showed how the new youth culture could throw up a juvenile monster of such gratuitous cruelty as to make Graham Greene's Pinky seem like a benign cherub. The subsequent film of 1971 offered a role-model of glamour and winsome charm for would-be thugs; it has been banned for public performance in many countries. Twenty years on from the Orange Burgess gave us a novel Earthly Powers, colossal in conception, embracing in its literary framework the supreme moments of mass barbarism and bloodletting of 20th century history, from Hitler's holocaust to the Reverend Jones's Guyana. The central figure encountering all this was an 80-year-old popular novelist, a lapsed Catholic, who had a tireless facility, a gift for parody and word-play, and a well-tuned musical sense - all of which he shared with his creator. Music was Burgess's great love and first ambition when he graduated from Manchester University, after a working-class Catholic up-bringing. It was his ability to strum away on the piano in the mess that ensured his popularity when he joined the army during the second world war. He had operas performed and other compositions to his credit. The relationship between music and literature was the theme of his TS Eliot lectures delivered at the University of Kent. James Joyce, another musician novelist and lapsed Catholic was his particular hero. Burgess often told the story of how he became a writer by accident. He was recovering from what he was told was a mortal illness while working in Malaya as part of an educational unit of the British army. He started writing a novel as a therapy, found it terribly easy to do after composing and from then on he never stopped producing fiction. Some critics regard his early and more light-hearted novels, his Malayan trilogy and his Enderby novels as among his finest, most accessible work.</p>

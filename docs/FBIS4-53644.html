			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "Improper Behavior Against </F> Reason"]    [Text] The president of South Korean Red Cross talks like  a thief shouting "stop thief" by picking a quarrel with us. In  a commemorative speech delivered on the occasion of World Red  Cross Day, he said that the North's call for the repatriation of  old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan -- unconverted long-term  prisoners -- as well as the seriously ill Kim Chi-hyon to the  northern half of the Republic is foolish, and that the North is  responsible for preventing the exchange of visits by old parents  between the North and South from being held, and for the lack of  progress in the settlement of the issue of separated families.  He also maintained that talks between the North and South Red  Coss Societies should be resumed, insisting that the North send  the so-called detainees, including crews of Tongjin No. 27, to  the South.    Such remarks by the South Korean Red Cross president are  inappropriate for a man of the Red Cross who should regard  humanity as sacred and saving mankind from misfortune, as a  basic mission. Therefore, we cannot but regard his remarks as  unreasonable and preposterous. He even opened himself up to  criticism with public opinion at home and abroad by making  absurd remarks in his 22 April telephone message sent to our  side.    Nevertheless, he made such remarks this time again.  Regarding the exchange of visits by old parents and the issue  of settling separated families, he talked as though we had  broken a North-South agreement. This is not true. His remarks  distorting the truth can never be understood in today's bright  world.    Since an agreement was reached between the North and South  Red Cross Societies regarding the establishment of a Panmunjom  meeting place for separated family members and the exchange of  visits by old parents between the North and South, the South  Korean authorities have early on forged cunning strategies with  the backing of gangsters of the Agency for the National Security  Planning and have aggravated tension extremely [kuktoro] on the  Korean peninsula by conducting powder-reeking, [hwayangnae  nanun] large-scale war exercises against us. It is already  well-known that they are responsible for preventing the  above-mentioned works from being carried out. We, therefore,  are not responsible for its failure, but instead South Korea is  totally responsible for it.    Regarding our proposal for the repatriation of old men Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who refused to convert from communism,  and the seriously ill Kim Chi-hyon to the northern half of the  Republic, he said that the North interprets the humanity of the  Red Cross Society and international humanitarian law in its own  way. However, it is the South Korean authorities who interpret  it in their own way, running counter to the regulation on war  and international law.    Article 118 of the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949  regarding the treatment for the prisoners of war defines that  the prisoners of war should be released and repatriated  immediately after a hostile action ends. Therefore, old men Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan should have been repatriated to the  northern half of the Republic after the conclusion of an  Armistice Agreement. This is an obligation of international  law, as well as moral responsibility which South Korea should  assume responsibility for.    That the South is stubbornly insisting that they are not  prisoners is merely an unreasonable obstinacy aimed to avoid the  criminal responsibility of unfairly detaining and suppressing  them and to keep them in South Korea to the last.    So is the issue of nationality obtained by old men Kim In-so  and Ham Se-hwan. Under the condition that South Korean  authorities did not return them but kept them under detention,  they had to do so to live on. If they had wished to live in  South Korea, why would they ask the International Committee of  the Red Cross to help them be repatriated to the North?    The South Korean Red Cross is charging old men Kim In-so and  Ham Se-hwan with violating the National Security Law, which is  being strongly denounced and refuted by the international  community, and pin unreasonable crimes on them by labeling them  with so-called activities and operations to trample the  government. This is indeed an unfair treatment ignoring the  international law on war and postwar measures and interpreting  it at its convenience.    The demand regarding the crew of the Tongjin No. 27 is also  unreasonable babblings. The Tongjin No. 27, which had  infiltrated deep into our side's territorial water in the West  Sea, was thoroughly a spy boat. The head fisherman and captain  on board confessed that it was a spy boat. The crew on board  cursed the South Korean authorities who used them for espionage  and said they would never return to South Korea.    We never promised anyone that we would return the boat and  that could never have happened. The president of the South  Korean Red Cross said the detainees should be returned but there  are none in our Republic. What we have are defectors who chose  our social system according to their own faith and who came with  their longing for the northern half of the Republic.    It is the meanest act without any human moral or conscience  to keep finding fault with us reversing black and white despite  the facts.    Today, the acting chairman of the Central Committee of the  DPRK Red Cross Society, in a telephone message sent to the South  Korean Red Cross, once again strongly urged the South side's Red  Cross to immediately return old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  and Kim Chi-yon in conformity with international law.    The South Korean Red Cross should stop trying to keep old  men  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, and Kim Chi-yon, daughter of  unconverted prisoner Kim Pyong-chu, under detention while  playing servant to the South Korean authorities, but take steps  to immediately return them to the northern half of the Republic  according to their own demand and fair public opinion. This is  the duty of the Red Cross.    If the South Korean Red Cross continues to refuse to return  them and use them for insidious political purposes, it will be  more condemned by the international community.</p>

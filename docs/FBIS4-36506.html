			<p>BFN     [Text] Asked by the Jordanian News Agency about statements  attributed to him regarding the occupied Syrian Golan, published  by the London-based newspaper AL-HAYAH yesterday, Prime Minister  Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has asserted that the statement  attributed to him was untrue and distorted.    Dr. al-Majali added: We reject any attempts to distort our  strategic relations with sisterly Syria. We deal with Syria  with full confidence in the unity of both our objective and  fate, and also out of the desire to reach a comprehensive peace  that will safeguard the rights of all of us and secure the  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, on  which the peace process is based.    Dr. al-Majali said: We look forward to discussing all issues  of mutual interest during the meetings of the Joint  Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee, which will be held in Amman  at the beginning of next week in order to achieve the policies  of the two leaders; namely, His Majesty King Husayn and his  brother His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad, in a way that  will achieve the utmost degree of cooperation and coordination  between the two fraternal countries.</p>

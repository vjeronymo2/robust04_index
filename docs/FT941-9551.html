			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets FRANKFURT The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but UBS says the D-Mark's recent under-performance suggests the markets may have to wait until March for the next rate cut. Schering, the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, holds its annual press conference today. PARIS The results of the public offer for Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, will be announced after the bourse closes today, along with the offer price for institutions, which the economics minister has suggested could exceed FFr405 a share. Estimates suggest the public offer was at least 2.5 times subscribed. A raft of corporate results are due during the week. Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, which was privatised at the end of last year, reports on Wednesday, Cie Bancaire on Thursday and Primagaz, the bottled gas distributor, on Friday. MILAN Italy's privatisation extravaganza continues this week with a series of roadshows to drum up interest in the sale of 57 per cent of Banca Commerciale Italiana. A total of 260m shares will be offered to Italian retail buyers and 240m to institutional investors when the privatisation begins on February 28. Of those on offer to institutions, 60m will be targeted at Italy, 50m at the US and 130m at the rest of the world. BCI will be officially priced on February 26. ZURICH Pharma Vision, the investment company specialising in pharmaceutical share holdings, unveils 1993 results at a press conference tomorrow. Saurer, the textile machinery and technology group, is expected to report sharply higher full-year net profits on Wednesday. TOKYO The listing of the Nikkei 300 futures on the Osaka Stock Exchange may prompt active index-linked trading. Buying by overseas investors, which has supported prices during the past few weeks, may ease some of the volatility created by futures linked trading, but in the absence of such purchases, profit-taking ahead of the March year-end book closing by corporate investors could depress share prices.</p>

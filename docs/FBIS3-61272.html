			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ilya Fonyakov: "Anatoliy Sobchak, </F> Mayor of St. Petersburg, Declared at the Presentation of His New  Book: The LDPR Is the Creation of the CPSU and the KGB"]    [Text] St. Petersburg--"I am in possession of  reliable facts known at this time only to a small group of  people on how Zhirinovskiy's party was formed," he said. "This  happened immediately after the abolition of Article 6 of the  constitution at that time--the one that affirmed the CPSU's  monopoly of power."    "A multiparty system is coming, and we must anticipate  events," was what, in effect, M. Gorbachev said at a meeting of  the Politburo. "We ourselves must create the first alternative  party, but one that is manageable." The choice of candidates for  the role of leader was entrusted to the KGB at that time. And  it, as always, was up to the job--it found within its active  reserve (there is such a concept!) a person with the rank of  captain and a name that is now widely known. It was at that time  that the name of the party was thought up also: Liberal  Democratic. This appeared to be a real find: After all, the  world "liberal" had long been compromised with us. Two weeks  later the new party was officially registered. It was the first  registered political party in the country--the CPSU, as we all  know, had never undergone this procedure, and the party of  Russian Communists was registered much later under a somewhat  different name.... I shall describe this in my next book, which  will be called "There Once Was a Communist Party."    The book that has just been published, "The Tbilisi  Fracture,  or Bloody Sunday 1989," carries numerous photographs and  documents of those now quite far-off days. Is it not belated?  After all, so many events have rolled by since then, one after  the other. Since Tbilisi there have been other "fractures"  also--the Dniester fracture, for example. And the development of  the situation in Georgia itself, the calamitous situation into  which it (and not just it) was plunged with the discovery of  independence--does not all this influence the evaluation of the  events of 1989? Questions of roughly this nature were put to the  author.    And the answer was given: It is precisely the fact that much  is catastrophically being rapidly "forgotten" and that archives  are disappearing before our eyes (the archives of the Georgian  KGB disappeared this way under Gamsakhurdia) that compels the  obligatory recording of what happened. The book's main job is  not to judge but to bear witness as objectively as possible. The  well-known General Rodionov, for example, appears in the book as  a far from unambivalent personality: The author does not forget  to mention that at the time of the Afghan war he "fell into  disfavor with his superiors because of his refusal to shoot  peaceful inhabitants" and that, upon acquaintance, "he makes a  strong impression with his education, breeding, and intellect."  And alongside this--"a striking commitment to orthodox communist  views and an incomprehension and rejection of change".... And is  there not a most important and most topical historical lesson in  the fate of Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the very mechanism of the  conversion of a man of letters, intellectual, and civil rights  advocate into a dictator and autocrat? Or the fate of his  antipode, Eduard Shevardnadze, who has heaped on himself at the  most difficult moment responsibility for the fate of Georgia and  its people and who has found himself hostage to the current  situation to a large extent?    "My abiding aspiration is to maintain professionalism and  preserve myself as a scholar," Anatoliy Sobchak said.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Surviving the gloomy prognostications - Problems at the very British Union Discount LIKE THE House of Lords, the City of London's discount houses have, with monotonous regularity over the past decade, been decried as archaic institutions, doomed to extinction. Yet these peculiarly British securities houses, which act as intermediaries between banks and the Bank of England, have survived all the gloomy prognostications. Participants in the discount market were therefore cautioning yesterday that the losses made by Union Discount in 1991 should not be seen as symptomatic of a widespread malaise. Though Union is one of the three biggest houses - together with Gerrard &amp; National and Cater Allen - its problems are not typical of the industry, because the bulk of its losses were made by a leasing subsidiary, Sabre Leasing, which is quite distinct from its money market operations. However, Union's discount house subsidiary - one of the oldest and biggest of the houses - also made a loss, of Pounds 2.91m. It blamed 'unusual trading conditions in the discount market'. Discount houses traditionally make profits when interest rates are falling, as they have been in the past year. 'If we cannot make profits in those conditions, then our days may be numbered,' says a director of one of Union's rivals. A simplified example of how discount houses operate should help to explain his concern. The British banks place a certain amount of their surplus cash on deposit with the discount houses. The discount houses will typically pay about  1/2 per cent more than the bank base rate for this money, which is repayable on demand. They then invest this 'call' money in bills - securities maturing in one month or three months - which are likely to yield less than the base rate. On the face of it, therefore, the discount houses lose money on these transactions. However, if the base rate falls, then the discount houses will pay less for the money on call from the banks, but will earn an unchanged rate on the bills until they mature. 'We are creaming it for 90 days,' says a discount house director. That has been the theory. The recent practice has been different however. 'Interest rates have often not fallen as quickly as we expected,' says the discount house director. 'So we have had to continue to pay an expensive rate for money for rather longer.' However, Union's discount house losses appear to be the exception, not the rule. Other discount houses said yesterday that they had been profitable in the past year, if not as profitable as they might have been in previous periods of declining rates. They added that in the past few months it has become easier once again to make profits. But most have reduced their exposure to swings in interest rates in either direction by using the futures and forward markets. Nonetheless the prospect of economic and monetary union may pose a longer-term threat to the seven pure discount houses and two 'hybrids', or discount houses which have been merged into gilt-edged market-makers, the dealers in government bonds. Discount houses are part of a system for controlling interest rates which is unique in Europe. Central banks on the continent tend to deal directly with banks. But the Bank of England does not. It has an exclusive relationship with the discount houses, which it uses as intermediaries when influencing the level of the base lending rate and when lending to the money market to prevent liquidity shortages and extreme volatility in interest rates. This system has been in existence in roughly its current form since before the Second World War, though the houses date from the 19th century. The Bank of England believes it is an efficient system, which it is keen to preserve. If any individual house ran into serious difficulties - and there was no suggestion yesterday that Union's plight is parlous - the Bank might allow the house to disappear. But it would make sure that any winding-up did not damage lenders to that discount house or the financial system. Discount houses accept that European monetary union may lead to the end of their privileges. The continental system of dealing direct with banks might be employed by a new pan-European central bank. But though that would involve the extinction of discount houses - as defined by their relationship with the Bank - the firms themselves could in theory continue to thrive. This is not the contradiction which it appears. Discount houses have evolved into specialist market-makers in a range of short-term securities. They insist that their special relationship with the Bank of England contributes nothing to profits. The corollary is that Union's losses should be seen as no more significant than the losses of any other market-maker in any other market. Its market judgment erred and it paid the price.

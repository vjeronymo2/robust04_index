			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine cannot afford nuclear weapons, Aleksandr  [Oleksandr] Moroz, the country's parliament chairman said in  Kiev Monday. He added, however, that Ukraine was the sole  country in the world that was gradually becoming nuclear-free.    Moroz said that Ukraine could not make this step all at  once,  no matter what kind of pressure was brought to bear on it. In  his view, the West had to meet Ukraine half-way. The Western  countries had to understand that investing in Ukrainian  disarmament was not charity but payment for the security they  enjoy as a result of Ukraine's moves.    Moroz admitted that he had once regarded the Black Sea Fleet  as an element of collective defense forces. But now it was time  to become aware of the fact that Ukraine and Russia had  different interests in the Black Sea, meaning two friendly  navies had to be set up.    He said that he would work for closer relations with Russia  but thought that Ukraine's rejoining the ruble zone would do no  good either to Ukraine or Russia.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Costs of Berlin move approved The German government yesterday approved sharply scaled-down plans for moving to the capital, Berlin, cutting back on housing ministries in new buildings. In an effort to trim the costs, many ministries will be put into old buildings which housed the former imperial, Nazi and communist administrations. However, the chancellory will be one of the few institutions to be given a new site, close to the former Reichstag parliament building. The foreign ministry, which had lobbied hard to have a new headquarters, will be given only a new extension in the Mitte, the heart of old Berlin before the second world war. The finance and economics ministers will move to the building which now houses the Treuhand privatisation agency, but which was the headquarters of the Luftwaffe. The construction minister, Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, said the new plan will save the government around DM1bn, reducing the total costs to around DM20bn.</p>

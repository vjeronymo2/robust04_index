			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christo Retief] </F>   [Excerpts] The controversy over the land issue affecting  the government of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is likely  to be repeated in Namibia after government plans were revealed  yesterday on the proposed awarding of farms to former PLAN  [People's Liberation Army of Namibia] fighters as a means of  compensating them for their "services during the freedom  struggle."    Several senior government officials, and especially serving  officers of the Namibian Defense Force, are also named as  beneficiaries of the plan in which, among other things,  provision is made for the "expropriation" of farms being used by  the National Development Corporation (NDC) in Kavango for beef  production. The project includes the handing over of altogether  five NDC farms, comprising more than 24,000 hectares in the  Kavango Mangetti region, to the Namibian Defense Force to begin  a farming project.    The reason for the army taking over farming activities is  apparently to make the Ministry of Defense less dependent on the  private sector for the provision of meat and vegetables to  military units in the north. Confidential sources in the  defense force say that the once the development of this gigantic  farm is completed at state cost it will be handed over to the  former fighters.    According to documents in the possession of DIE REPUBLIKEIN,  the awarding of farms to former members of SWAPO's [South-West  African People's Organization] armed wing, PLAN, is taking place  under the guise of a resettlement project. An inter-ministerial  pilot committee comprising the Ministry of Land Affairs,  Resettlement and Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Agriculture,  Water and Rural Development, the Ministry of Information and  Broadcasting, and the NDC has already been established to  finalize the project. The former fighters are represented by  the "SWAPO Veteran's Trust," who liaises directly with the new  committee through a representative, Mr. Mzee Kaukungwa, also a  prominent SWAPO leader and member of the party's Central  Committee. The SWAPO organization for war veterans, in  collaboration with the pilot committee, is also responsible for  the appointment and approval of PLAN members who will qualify  for farms.    An initial list of approximately 200 former PLAN members was  rejected by the technical committee under the chairmanship of  the permanent secretary of Land affairs, Resettlement and  Rehabilitation, Mrs. Ulitala Hiveluah, after members of the  committee found that names of people on the list included those  of people who had died under unknown circumstances in the bush  war. A second list with approximately 100 names is being  studied by the committee.    Several of the former fighters are hailed as "war heroes of  SWAPO" and are also the relatives or recipients of the so-called  Ongulumbashe medals. The secret project was approved by the  cabinet on 18 January this year after which an order, not a  request, was issued to begin with the identification and  demarcation of suitable farming land in the Okavango Mangetti  region.    The setting up of infrastructure such as bore holes and  fences on the farms, the upgrading of roads, the provision of  accommodation and telephone links, a clinic and even a school,  will be carried out at an initial cost of approximately 12  million Namibian dollars before the farms are handed over to the  beneficiaries. An amount of 1 million dollars has already been  made available from state funds for the purchasing of livestock  for the former PLAN members, while an unknown amount from the  budget of the Ministry of Land Affairs will be contributed  towards the resettlement fund for the new community. [passage  omitted]    Yesterday the government denied any knowledge of the two  projects -- which has to be started before the forthcoming  presidential general and presidential elections (that is the  former PLAN farms and the army farms) -- at the highest level.  [passage omitted]    The official spokesman for the NDC, Mr. Mathew Gowaseb,  confirmed the existence of the two projects but referred all  enquiries to the head of the agricultural department, Mrs. Anna  Shiwedha. She was not available for comment, however. [passage  omitted]</p>

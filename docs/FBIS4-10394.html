			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] One of the two antagonistic blocs in the Senate  of the Republic, presided over by Senator Bernard Sansaricq,  voted on 10 April to implement Article 149, which provides for  the nomination of a provisional president and the holding of new  elections within 90 days. Rothschild Francois filed a report:    [Begin Francois recording] By deciding on 10 April to vote  for implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, the  branch of the Senate led by Sen. Sansaricq intends to implement  the closing of the Aristide file and a new beginning; endowing  the country with a provisional president chosen from the Court  of Cassation; the ratification of a new government; the holding  of elections; and the assumption of office by an elected  president on 7 February 1995.    Long before he became involved in voting for this resolution  during the session attended by some political leaders, the  president of this Senate office, which is not recognized by the  lower chamber, pointed out that he did not expect the sanctions  to be lifted this way. Sen. Sansaricq asserts, however, that it  is necessary for the country to be led by a conscious,  responsible team that could manage the embargo. His colleagues  also recommended a serious government capable of assuring the  management of the heavy burden of Haiti's economic sanctions.    This session on 10 April in the Senate brought together  eight  senators elected on 18 January and five from the normal office.  Four hours of discussion were necessary for the legislators to  reach a vote on this resolution leading to Article 149 of the  Haitian Constitution. Osny Eugene, elected on 18 January, is the  author of this document. In the 10 April resolution, senators  from the Alliance and from 18 January equate the refusal of  President Aristide to choose a prime minister with his  resignation.    These senators also decided to revoke the June 1993 decree  that restored President Aristide to his functions and to declare  and acknowledge the presidential vacuum. For them, Article 149  was unavoidable. [passage omitted] It should be recalled that  the Chamber of Deputies does not recognize this office of the  Senate of the Republic. [end recording]</p>

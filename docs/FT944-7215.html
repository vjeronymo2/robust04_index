			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Strength in Netherlands helps IWP to IPounds 7.6m IWP International, the Irish household and personal care products and packaging group, reported a 69 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 4.52m to IPounds 7.64m (Pounds 7.54m) for the half year to September 30. Levendaal, the Netherlands-based toiletries group, acquired in October 1993, made a significant contribution. Mr Joe Moran, chief executive, said: 'The performance was better than we expected.' He pointed to the 20 per cent rise in earnings per share to 14.53p (12.11p). Turnover grew 49 per cent to IPounds 72m (IPounds 48.3m), with the Netherlands accounting for 43 per cent. UK sales fell in the period, while Irish turnover rose slightly. The group, which is listed in Dublin and London, has about 20 diversified subsidiaries in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. Levendaal's performance more than made up for a static UK market. IWP paid IPounds 51m for Levendaal. As a result gearing had risen to 76 per cent at the end of the period. IWP also announced that it was 'within two weeks' of finalising a management buy-out of Questel, its UK-based lossmaking television company. IWP is reviewing marketing strategy to target European countries, particularly Germany and Scandinavia. It is appointing Mr Neil Popham, formerly with BP's nutrition subsidiary, as director in charge of household products and personal care. The interim dividend is raised to 3.6p (3.25p).</p>

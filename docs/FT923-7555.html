			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Treasury takes stock of its share portfolio: There should be little difficulty in meeting the Pounds 19bn target for privatisation proceeds THERE IS not much family silver left in the government's cupboard. Excluding British Coal and British Rail, which are on the block, and the Post Office, which is under review, the Treasury's list of nationalised industries comprises just six names. These range from the probably unsellable Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear to Caledonian MacBrayne which provides 'cost-effective lifeline services to remote island communities'. The others are: the Civil Aviation Authority, London Transport and the British Waterways Board. The era of privatisation is drawing to a close. But it is surprising how much the government still has locked away for a rainy day. An analysis of its remaining debt and equity holdings suggests it should have little difficulty raising the Pounds 19bn in privatisation proceeds it has budgeted for the three years commencing 1992-93. This would bring to more than Pounds 60bn the sum raised since the sell-offs started with Pounds 377m of disposals in 1979-80, the first year of the Thatcher administration. The conclusion that Pounds 19bn is within easy grasp assumes the government would be prepared to sell its remaining stakes in British Telecommunications and the two electricity generating companies by April 1995. It does not take into account proceeds from the latest batch of proposed privatisations, which are not expected to be among the biggest money-spinners of the past 13 years. How then might the figure be raised? As much as Pounds 3.6bn is already in the kitty. This has been raised by Pounds 835m from the second instalment payment of the Scottish electricity companies sale, Pounds 1.915bn from the second BT instalment, Pounds 350m from the disposal of Northern Ireland Electricity and Pounds 350m from the repayment of the last tranche of British Gas debt - the balance is derived from other odds and ends. A further Pounds 3.975bn will accrue by 1993-94 from more scheduled instalment payments on share sales which were completed some time ago. The payments consist of Pounds 1.465bn due in September from the sale of the regional electricity companies, Pounds 1.675bn due next March from BT and Pounds 835m due a month later from the disposal of the Scottish electricity companies. Another Pounds 650m relating to the repayment of debt owed to the government by the electricity industry will be credited to its account by 1993-94. The government also owns a Pounds 4bn-plus portfolio of marketable debt that is owed by the privatised utility companies. The loans range from Pounds 350m to less than Pounds 50m and maturities stretch until the year 2008. About half of the debt is in BT loan stock, which yielded about Pounds 450m of income over the seven years to 1990-91. Last month Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, was appointed to advise the Treasury on how to sell its loans, with the aim of raising about Pounds 1bn in this financial year. The government still owns more than Pounds 7bn in ordinary shareholdings in private-sector companies. The most valuable stake is the residual 22 per cent holding in BT, which alone would raise well over Pounds 4bn if put on the block. The roughly 40 per cent interests in National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generating companies, are together worth just under Pounds 2bn. All of this is not to suggest that meeting the Pounds 19bn target - equivalent to the projected budget of the Home Office over the three years - will be plain sailing. The recent stock market slide has wiped more than Pounds 500m off the value of the government's ordinary share holdings in 11 weeks - its 1.9 per cent stake in British Petroleum is now worth about 30 per cent less than in late May. But convincing evidence that the end of the recession is in sight could prompt share prices to rebound equally rapidly. Meanwhile, the attempted sale of the marketable debt portfolio has been described as one of the most teasing corporate financial puzzles since the privatisation programme began, partly because of the varied form of the loans and the high interest payments that many of them carry. If sold direct to investors, the high-yielding paper would need to be priced well above face value - a fact calculated to put off many UK buyers because of the tax implications of buying bonds above par. THE GOVERNMENT is considering co-ordinating aspects of the sale of the two parcels businesses that it is to privatise. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, are to discuss the timing of the disposals, which will transfer both Parcelforce, the Post Office's delivery service, and British Rail's parcels division to the private sector. The level of co-ordination is thought unlikely to extend to appointing the same teams of advisers for the sales. It is expected that traditional inter-departmental rivalries may limit the extent of co-operation. British Rail is primarily Mr MacGregor's responsibility, while the Post Office is Mr Heseltine's. Parcelforce, which lost Pounds 24m on turnover of Pounds 508m in the year to April, delivers about 750,000 parcels a day. BR's parcels arm, which lost Pounds 34.7m last year, consists of Red Star, the express parcels service, and Rail Express Systems, which mainly carries letters for Royal Mail, Parcelforce's sister organisation.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GOVERNMENT ORDINARY SHAREHOLDINGS IN PRIVATE-SECTOR COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Market         % of issued                              value Pounds m*      capital  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BT                               4,504.5           22.0 National Power                   1,111.3           39.3 PowerGen                           775.7           40.7 British Petroleum                  191.8            1.9 Water companies                    138.4          0.6-2 BAA                                 93.1            3.0 Regional electricity                88.5        1.1-1.9 Scottish Power                      53.4            3.6 Scottish Hydro-Electric             26.3            3.5 Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour              24.7           20.7 British Airways                      8.1            0.4 British Gas                          0.2             -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                            7,016.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * 11/8/92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Commons written answer June 5 1992 - market value updated  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The GPU Companies now propose to extend the term of the Credit Agreement and to provide for an increase in the amount of borrowings that the GPU Companies may make thereunder. They also propose to extend and increase their other short-term borrowing capability. Accordingly, the GPU Companies now request authority from the effective date of the authorization herein sought through December 31, 1997 from time to time (1) To issue, sell and renew their unsecured promissory notes (``New Notes'') to certain banks (``Banks'') under the terms of a new revolving credit agreement or an amendment to the existing agreement (``New Credit Agreement'') in amounts up to $250 million outstanding at any one time, (2) to issue, sell and renew their unsecured promissory notes pursuant to loan participation arrangements and lines of credit (``New Lines of Credit'') in amounts up to the limitations on short-term indebtedness contained in their respective charters and, in the case of GPU, $200 million, (3) in the cases of JCP&amp;L, Met-Ed and Penelec to issue and sell their respective unsecured promissory notes as commercial paper (``New Commercial Paper'') in amounts up to their respective charter limits, and (4) to incur other short-term unsecured debt from time to time in amounts up to the limits permitted by their respective charters and, in the case of GPU, $200 million. In no event, however, would the total amount of such unsecured debt of any GPU Company outstanding at any one time exceed the limitation on such indebtedness imposed by such Company's charter and, in the case of GPU, $200 million. Citibank, N.A. and Chemical Bank would serve as co-agents under the New Credit Agreement and Chemical Bank would also serve as administrative agent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Notes issued under the New Credit Agreement would mature not more than six months from their date of issue. The annual interest rate on each borrowing would be either (a) The Alternate Base Rate, as in effect from time to time, (b) the CD Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus an amount ranging from .375% to .625% depending upon the Debt Rating of the borrower and, in the case of GPU, the Debt Rating of JCP&amp;L, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus an amount ranging from .25% to .50% depending upon the Debt Rating of the borrower and, in the case of GPU, the Debt Rating of JCP&amp;L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The New Credit Agreement will afford the GPU Companies the option of inviting competitive bids from the Banks for requested maturities of up to six months in such principal amounts as a GPU Company may request, subject to the $250 million limit of the New Credit Agreement ($200 million in the case of GPU). No Bank would be required to bid for any such loan and the GPU Companies would not be obligated to accept any bids received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GPU Companies propose to pay the Banks a facility fee ranging from .125% to .375% per annum, depending on the Debt Ratings of Met-Ed, JCP&amp;L and Penelec, of the total amount of the commitment, and a competitive bid fee of $2,500 for each request for a competitive bid. In addition, an agency fee of $25,000 would be payable to each of the Co-Agents upon signing of the New Credit Agreement, and an annual administrative agent fee of $15,000 would be payable to Chemical Bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issuance of the New Notes would be subject to certain conditions, and the New Notes would be subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. Borrowings bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate would be prepayable at any time, without penalty; borrowings at the CD Rate or the Eurodollar Rate would also be prepayable, subject to payment of certain costs incurred by the Banks in connection with the prepayment; borrowings at a competitive bid rate would not be prepayable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each borrowing pursuant to an unsecured promissory note issued under New Lines of Credit will bear interest at a rate (after giving effect to any fees or compensating balance requirements) not exceeding 125% of the greater of (A) The lending bank's prime rate for commercial borrowing in effect from time to time, and (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, will mature not more than nine months from the date of issuance, will be prepayable only to the extent provided therein and will not be issued as part of a public offering. New Lines of Credit borrowings may include borrowings under which a GPU Company would execute a master unsecured promissory note. The principal amount outstanding under each such master note would increase or decrease depending upon the amount of borrowings. Such arrangements are often employed to facilitate the sale of loan participations by the lending bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unsecured promissory notes sold as New Commercial Paper would be issued in denominations of $100,000 or multiples thereof with maturities of up to 270 days and would not be prepayable prior to maturity. New Commercial Paper would be sold directly to one or more commercial paper dealers at a discount rate prevailing at the date of issuance for commercial paper of comparable quality and of the particular maturity sold by other issuers of commercial paper. No fee or commission would be payable by JCP&amp;L, Met-Ed or Penelec in connection with their issuances and sales of New Commercial Paper. The New Commercial Paper will be reoffered by the purchasing dealer or dealers to institutional investors at a discount of not more than 1/8 of 1% per annum less than the prevailing discount rate to JCP&amp;L, Met-Ed or Penelec. The commercial paper dealers will offer and resell the New Commercial Paper to not more than a total of 200 of their respective customers, identified and designated in a non-public list (``Closed List'') prepared by each such dealer in advance for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JCP&amp;L, Met-Ed and Penelec may also utilize the services of one or more commercial paper placement agents (``Placement Agent'') through whom they would sell their New Commercial Paper directly to one or more institutional investors included on the Placement Agent's Closed List (as it may be amended) which would not exceed 200 such investors. The Placement Agent would arrange for the sale of New Commercial Paper and would be compensated for its services out of the discount on the sale. No fee or other commission would be otherwise payable by JCP&amp;L, Met-Ed or Penelec in connection with the placement of their New Commercial Paper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GPU Companies further propose to issue, sell and renew from time to time their unsecured promissory notes evidencing short-term borrowings from lenders such as commercial banks, insurance companies or other institutions. Such notes would mature not later than nine months after the date of issue, bear interest at a rate (after giving effect to any fees and compensating balance requirements) not in excess of the greater of 125% of (A) Such lender's or other recognized prime rate and (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, would be prepayable only to the extent therein provided and would not be issued as part of any public offering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

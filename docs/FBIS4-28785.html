			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The 14 June issues of four Thai dailies  -- SIAM RAT, THAI RAT, MATICHON and NAEO NA -- carry editorials  on the current political situation, which has arisen from the  demand for constitutional reform by hunger striker Chalat  Worachat and his supporters and detractors both in and outside  parliament.    Bangkok SIAM RAT in Thai on page 3 carries a 600-word  editorial, entitled: "Tackle the Political Crisis." It says:  "The call for constitutional reform initiated by Chalat  Worachat by staging a hunger strike has evolved into a call for  political reform. Chalat himself is probably surprised by the  way things have developed, which are different from his four  original demands. However, it appears that Chalat has no  objection to the new development."    The editorial concludes: "The current political crisis  should develop in a direction that benefits society and the  country as a whole, not any particular group or political party."    Bangkok NAEO NA in Thai on page 3 carries a 600-word  editorial, entitled: "Dissolve the Parliament." The editorial  says: "The current political situation has gone beyond Chalat's  hunger strike since organizations for democracy and academics  have joined the campaign for political reform." The dispute  within the Phalang Tham Party over whether to support the  campaign "could result in the party withdrawing itself from the  coalition government. The resulting political crisis could lead  to a clash between mobs of the opposite sides and a blood bath  as Dr. Prawet Wasi warned earlier. This situation could be  exploited by certain groups to seize power. Therefore, the best  solution is to forget pride and dissolve the parliament in order  to return power to the people to avoid such a seizure of power."    Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on page 2 carries a 700-word  editorial, which is entitled: "Open and Sincere." It says:  "The differences of ideas triggered by Chalat Worachat's hunger  strike have increasingly widened. A cause for this development  is the inflexible position of the government leader and his  political party. Another cause is probably the confusion over  the numerous proposals by various sides on how to solve the  issue. The unclear positions of the various coalition parties,  which try to conceal their stands to gain political advantage,  are also to blame."    The editorial concludes: "In this situation, we appeal to  all sides which are carrying on political activities to do so  openly and appropriately inform the public. Do not conceal  these activities to gain political advantage. Only sincerity  and determination will help relieve the current situation. In  particular, the government leader, who is responsible for what  happens in the country, promptly must play his role. He cannot  just cling firmly to his stand regardless of how the situation  may develop. The question, which the government must answer,  is: What must be done to solve the situation peacefully? The  question is no longer about who is right and who is wrong."    Bangkok THAI RAT in Thai carries a 700-word editorial on  page  3 entitled: "To The Democrat Party." The editorial says: "The  political situation has reached the point that a decision has to  be made. Chalat's demands have received considerable support by  democracy-loving groups, although some of them disagreed with  the protest method. It is possible to have the House of  Representatives form a commission to study or redraft the  constitution. Whether or not its recommendations can be put  into use is another matter.    "To relieve political tension and prevent divisiveness among  the government political parties and the situation from  worsening any further, we appeal to the prime minister and the  Democrat Party to listen to the views of other parties in the  coalition government and democracy-loving people. The  constitution amendment may not be achieved today, but it is time  to start now."</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (23): Focus on weight reduction  -It is almost certain that carmakers will employ both materials much more extensively in future, particularly in the US / Magnesium vs Aluminium GETTING your retaliation in first is a well-tried battle tactic. Mercedes-Benz is aware how effective this can be - and therefore its latest shots in the increasingly hostile European car wars involved a paean to magnesium metal. Mercedes suggested that magnesium had big advantages over steel, aluminium and plastics for car producers needing to reduce the weight of vehicles. And certainly that is what producers are concentrating on today because weight reduction is the single most effective way to cut fuel consumption. The German company's statement was obviously designed as a 'spoiling' exercise ahead of an October Press briefing by its rival Audi, the up-market part of the Volkswagen group, extolling the virtues of aluminium in cars. Audi is soon to launch an 'aluminium-intensive', top-of-the-range V8 saloon which it developed along with the Aluminium Company of America. 'This is our most important project,' says Mr Franz-Joseph Kortum, Audi's chairman, of the DM1bn venture. 'We are trying for a second time for success in this segment of the car market and this is a great challenge for the company. But we will set new standards in this segment. We have changed the rule that says the bigger and better the car, the heavier it must be. 'It is true that cars generally have improved enormously, but the weight has increased enormously, too.' He says the new Audi will offer drivers 'a new experience because of its light weight, stiffness and rigidity and safety.' Many will find its performance and low fuel consumption astonishing, he predicts. 'And this is because it is build of aluminium.' BMW also chipped in with the news that it has signed a co-operative agreement with Hydro Aluminium of Norway for the development of aluminium components - possibly even the production of complete 'space frames,' skeleton-like frames to which body panels can be fixed. But BMW said it had no plans for volume production of an entire aluminium-intensive car such as Audi's. Nevertheless, BMW's M-Technik offshoot is using an aluminium space frame in its prototype E1 electric vehicle for California. At the Geneva Motor Show this year, the group presented the Z13 concept 'city car', which has an aluminium frame, recycled plastic panels, and a motor-cycle engine. Hydro, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group, this year started supplying aluminium space frames from a Michigan factory for General Motors' new Corvette sports. It has also been co-operating on car space-frame concepts since the mid-1980s with various groups, including Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy. Yet Mercedes intervention is a timely reminder that the automotive industry is interested in metals other than aluminium. And the automotive sector is expected to play a big role in magnesium's future. According to Mining Journal's annual review, in 1991 there were nearly 40 magnesium components already in production for US and Canadian cars, compared with only one 10 years previously. At the Institute de la Technologie du Magnesium, in Santa-Foy, Quebec, which specialises in contract research and development work, half the members are Japanese while the US automotive industry is represented by General Motors. An average of 4.5lb of magnesium per car was used in North America in 1990 and the Cadillac North Star engine, launched last year, uses 15lb of the metal. While this trend is particularly important for the use of magnesium in die-casting, extrusions are also set to become competitive and magnesium is already the choice for a growing number of structural automotive uses such as road wheels, seat frames, housings and valve covers. Although it is one of the lightest metals available for automotive design engineering, magnesium displays outstanding strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. Its proponents also say the metal has superior damping qualities to absorb noise and vibration and it is the easiest of all structural metals to machine. Mercedes commented on this aspect: 'Magnesium has the advantage compared with aluminium in that it can be better processed in many ways and consequently can be cheaper in the end.' Mercedes pointed out that new high-purity alloying processes can offset magnesium's traditional disadvantages to a carmaker - its relatively high price, poor corrosion resistance, low strength and inability to keep its shape in warm conditions. Magnesium alloys reach the required elasticity levels of up to 10 per cent without costly heat treatment, it added. The group has been working with a foundry specialist on a new thin-wall pressure casting technique which allows a 40 per cent reduction in material thickness. This 'opens up a new spectrum of possibilities for the use of magnesium.' Mercedes has been using magnesium seat frames for its SL Roadster since 1989 and said it had 'favourable experience' in using it in bodywork, too. But Mr Werner Heiss, of Mercedes' pre-development trials division, said it was unlikely the metal would be used for engine blocks in water-cooled engines. 'Consistent use' of magnesium could reduce a car's weight by 10 per cent, he said. Mercedes pointed out that it would not be difficult for the world to produce enough magnesium, no matter how much the carmakers eventually required, and that the metal could easily be recycled. Mercedes' attempt to place magnesium in competition with aluminium is a little puzzling given that its small concept car at the Frankfurst Show will be the Vision A93 which has a body, fuel tank and seat frames made of aluminium. And in many ways the metals complement one another - a great deal of magnesium is already used in aluminium alloys. It is almost certain that carmakers will employ both materials much more extensively in future, particularly in the US where they have to meet government-imposed fuel economy targets but the market shows customers do not want very small cars. For example, Ford not so long ago announced plans to install North America's first-ever car seat stanchions made of magnesium. Yet the US's second-largest vehicles group is also using more aluminium than the rest of the American motor industry combined - about 16m tonnes a year. Mr Kenneth Kohrs, Ford's vice-president of car product development, has been standing up for the aluminium-intensive car. He revealed that Ford was testing a fleet of 20 Mercury Sable cars made mostly of aluminium as part of a Dollars 25m effort to see whether volume production of an aluminium-intensive car was feasible. He said the experimental Sables each weighed 400lb less than an identical version made of steel. Ford has also developed the Synthesis 2010, about the same size as the Sable but which achieves weight savings of about 1,000lb. The Synthesis, 'a rolling test bed for new technologies,' is powered by an aluminium, three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium producer, and Alacan of Canada, the western world's second-largest aluminium producer, have both been working with Ford on its aluminium projects.</p>

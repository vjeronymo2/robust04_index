			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS IN 'STREETCAR'  </P> <P> I'm fit to be tied over Ray Loynd's Sept. 17 review of the LAAT's "almost  flawless" production of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire." The  flaw as Loynd squints to see it is the "beautifully played" performances by  Neva Ruschell and Lance Nichols as the upstairs neighbors, which (to him)  represent "tinkering" with the untinkerable author because "blacks wouldn't be  running in and out of the Kowalskis' flat in 1947 New Orleans."  </P> <P> This is outright racist hogwash. Williams says nothing about the racial  composition of Stanley's friends and neighbors who live "at the end of the  trolley line." It is poor, noisy and rough and, more than likely, especially in  New Orleans -- famous for its interracial mix of blacks, Creoles, Cajuns and  whites -- the Kowalski digs would reflect that diversity. I've personally seen  a number of productions, including the original on Broadway, in which the  street mise-en-scene was interracially cast.  </P> <P> FRED E. BAKER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / MPs sceptical about work pledges for Rosyth: Devonport success welcomed by west country Tories - Scots likely to view decision as a further slight ACCUSATIONS of bad faith on the part of the government and some scepticism about the future of Rosyth dominated reaction at Westminster yesterday. Yet the scale of the commitment made to the Scottish yard enabled some Scottish Conservatives to find a silver lining. The yard was guaranteed the refit of half the surface fleet including aircraft carriers. Opposition MPs questioned whether the undertakings about work to be allocated to the yard should be believed. Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman and MP for north-east Fife, was among those who quoted the promise given by Mr George (now Lord) Younger in 1984, that the Trident refit work would go to Rosyth. Mr George Foulkes, a Labour defence spokesman, also pressed for assurances about how binding the new contractual obligations would be on the government and whether Mr Rifkind's assessment that only 450 jobs would be lost at Rosyth was shared by Babcock Thorn, the company that manages the yard. Concern about the future work was not confined to the opposition. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, was unable to give an immediate answer to Mr George Kynoch, Tory MP for Kincardine and Deeside, who asked whether the allocated programme of work would be enough in itself to keep Rosyth profitable. While his statement enabled Mr Rifkind to refer to 'scaremongering' during the long negotiations for the contract, he was unable to be as categoric as some MPs would have liked about the impact of the decision on Rosyth. He made clear that the government's assessment of job losses related to Ministry of Defence work and did not take account of any other possible redundancies, which would be a matter for Babcock Thorn. Any improvements in productivity would also affect the figures. The Westminster exchanges were peppered with opposition calls for the resignation of Mr Rifkind and of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, who was in the Commons to hear the statement. Awarding the Trident work to Devonport - a decision warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs in the south-west of England - will have shored up the Tories' position in the west country, but the decision could still cause serious long-term damage to the Conservative party in Scotland. Most Scots will see the decision as a betrayal of past undertakings, and will feel that it panders to English demands. They will recall the government pledge that the Trident refitting work would go to Rosyth - a promise given partly to help sell the decision to base the submarines on the Clyde at Faslane, at a time when the nuclear disarmament movement was strong. Had Rosyth won the Trident contract it would have guaranteed the future of the yard well into the 21st century. As matters now stand, the yard will definitely survive for only 12 years. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, pointed out that the government in 1987 gave a conditional seven-year guarantee on British Steel's Ravenscraig complex near Glasgow. In the event it closed, already severely run down, after five years, and was a running sore to the Conservative party for much of that time. Yet the scale of the work guaranteed as a consolation prize to Rosyth is bigger than most people had expected. The claims of Tory MPs, such as Sir Nicholas Fairbairn and Mr Bill Walker, that a decision against Rosyth would lead to the defeat of all 11 Scottish Tory MPs at the next general election now look to be exaggerated. The Scottish Conservatives have been trying to consolidate the revival which began at last year's general election when against all expectations they won two seats and increased their share of the vote. With Mr Lang a skilful and soothing Scottish secretary, and Labour and the Scottish National parties in disarray, Scotland has recently been one of the government's few trouble-free zones. The claim that the government broke its word over Rosyth will hamper that recovery. It will not help erode the perception among many Scots that at heart the Scottish Tories are the English Tory party.</p>

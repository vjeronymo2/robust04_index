			<p>BFN     [Text] Police Colonel Thatnarong Winyanrat, commander of  the Border Patrol Police Unit No. 34 in Tak Province, said  during an interview that he agreed with the Office of Narcotics  Control Board's [NCB] report labelling Tak, Phitsanulok, and  Chiang Mai Provinces as the major marijuana-producing areas in  northern Thailand. He pointed out that over 75 percent of the  area in Tak is mountains and dense jungles suitable for  marijuana cultivation by hill tribes such as at Pang Sangkasi,  Vang Tamlung, and Phaphun villages in Na Bot District and Na  Khiri village in Muang Tak District.    Police Colonel Thatnarong added that capitalists from the  northeastern region and upper part of the northern region will  normally give marijuana seeds to tribesmen to begin cultivation  at the beginning of the rainy season and provide the necessary  instructions to ensure a bumper harvest. Marijuana is  compressed into bars and sent by trucks to Chiang Rai Province  from where the drug will be shipped down the Mekong River to the  Gulf of Thailand for export to foreign countries and sale in  domestic markets.    The officer said: "Our unit has been coordinating with the  northern branch of the Office of Narcotics Control Board in  search of marijuana plantations in the northern provinces. We  destroyed not less than 15 tons of the grass worth millions of  baht during each crackdown operation. However, the authorities  also faced numerous difficulties because all the plantations are  located in remote and mountainous areas which enables the  culprits to flee before their arrival."    Meanwhile, Suphong Manatphaibun, deputy governor of Nakhon  Phanom Province, disclosed that the provincial administration  does not have sufficient information to confirm the NCB office's  claim that Nakhon Phanom is the largest marijuana-producing area  in the country. However, he admitted that there are some  marijuana plantations in the province. Several portions of the  drug found in the province were smuggled into the country and  authorities have been instructed to launch regular search and  suppression operations.    Sub-lieutenant Prawat Athipanya, deputy governor of Sakon  Nakhon Province, expressed his disagreement with the report by  the NCB Office saying Sakon Nakhon is one of the three largest  marijuana- producing provinces in Thailand, noting that small  plantations are scattered in the mountainous areas of Kut Bak  District and Phuphan reserve forest. Unlike other provinces,  Sakon Nakhon does not have any big investors engaging in  marijuana cultivation. The provincial administration has  ordered that continuous suppression operations be carried out  throughout the province.    Sub-lieutenant Praswant said: "Most of the grass is grown in  Tha Uthen District of Nakhon Phanom Province and in Laos, where  Lao farmers plant marijuana along the bank of the Mekong River.  We can clearly see the plants from the Thai side." He  disclosed that Sakon Nakhon is no longer a marijuana transit  point due to intensified suppression operations by provincial  officials.    Banphot Piamdi, director of the Narcotics Control Center in  the northern region, revealed that opium cultivation remains the  big problem in the 17 northern provinces. The total acreage  used for opium cultivation in 1993 was as high as 16,000 rai  [2.5 rai is equivalent to one 1 acre]. Marijuana cultivation  was first introduced to Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Mae Hong Son,  Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai Provinces in 1987 and later spread to  other nearby provinces. Tribesmen have found it easier and less  complicated to grow marijuana than opium. Moreover, they can  earn more from planting marijuana. More tribes people have now  shifted to planting marijuana, but most of them plant the crop  for their own consumption and sale in small quantities.  Marijuana is not as big a business here as it is in the  northeast.    Witthaya Kaeopharadai, Phalang Tham MP from Nakhon Si  Thammarat Province, said people should not think that the U.S.  drug charge against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is politically  motivated, adding that Thanong has acted correctly in appointing  lawyers to deal with and clear himself from the U.S. accusation.    Asked about the thesis by an NCB official on police  involvement in drug trafficking connections, Police General  Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department,  replied that the topic is not unusual. In the past, several  police officers and officials of other government agencies have  been arrested on drug charges.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Pensions code sought by funds The government should consider implementing regulatory reform of pension schemes through codes of practice rather than legislation, the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, said yesterday. The Department of Social Security has invited comment on proposals to reform the regulatory regime for occupational pensions prepared by its Pensions Law Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode. The association said legislation could be years away, while many elements of the proposals could be in place by the autumn if there were a code of conduct. Mr David Morgan, chairman of the association's parliamentary committee, said: 'In endorsing this robust new system and supporting most of the Goode recommendations, we are concerned that uncertainty over the two years until any new legislation could come into effect would make it difficult to plan with confidence.' The association conceded that codes of conduct were not legally enforceable, but 'the Inland Revenue has worked with codes of conduct for years and try breaking one of those'. It said that failure to comply with voluntary codes of conduct should cost schemes their tax-exemption rights. The association recognises that at least some of the elements of the Goode Committee recommendations, such as the creation of a new pensions regulator, will require primary legislation. In its response to the report, the association urged changes in the most crucial element of proposals for pension fund reform - the requirement that all schemes meet a so-called minimum solvency requirement ensuring that they could meet 90 per cent of all liabilities if they were suddenly wound up.</p>

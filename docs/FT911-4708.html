			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman plans significant US expansion JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, the Leicester-based machine tool manufacturer, plans a significant expansion of its US activities through the acquisition of Rhode Island-based Brown &amp; Sharpe Grinding Machines (BSGM), a joint venture between J&amp;S and Brown &amp; Sharpe of the US. J&amp;S has reached agreement in principle to acquire Brown &amp; Sharpe's share of BSGM, which was set up in 1989 to provide a marketing and servicing facility for the two companies in North America. No terms for the deal were disclosed, but the sum is unlikely to be large. At the end of last month Brown &amp; Sharpe, once the largest US machine tool maker, announced it was pulling out of the industry to concentrate on its metrology products. Mr John Wareing, J&amp;S managing director, said the acquisition would make the Leicester company solely responsible for sales and service of its machines in North America. Additionally, J&amp;S will acquire the rights to Brown &amp; Sharpe's Hi-Tech creep-feed grinders and Techmaster surface grinders. Production will be moved from Rhode Island to Leicester. Creep-feed machines grind the workpiece at a slow pace but with deep cuts, and are ideal for composite materials and ceramics which would crack under normal grinding. J&amp;S will now be able to compete with three European manufacturers of creep-feed grinders, which are heavily used by the aerospace industry. Mr Wareing said the deal would add at least Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m to annual sales. In the 15 months to end-March 1990, the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m on sales of Pounds 30.9m.</p>

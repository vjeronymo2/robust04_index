			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Observer: Big Blue puts on speed There was a time when it seemed that IBM could do anything. But can it persuade the stuffy old codgers of the All England Tennis Club to install one of its new-fangled IBM 'speedometers' on Wimbledon's centre court in time for this year's tournament? Its latest invention, which comes complete with IBM logo, is designed to record the speed of a player's serve. Its introduction at the current Australian Open in Melbourne is proving popular with the public and controversial with the players. World number one Jim Courier, who fought its introduction at last year's US Open, thinks it's a stupid idea. 'It creates a situation where you say 'Gee] I hit that one 200kph. Let's see if I can hit this one 202?' 'What's the point? If I hit a 140kph slice serve into the corner, that's just as effective.' Crass or not, the media and public have been lapping up the new statistics, noting avidly that the fastest gun in Melbourne's Flinders Park centre has been German ace, Michael Stich, with 203kph. Monica Seles leads the women with 167kph. Wimbledon guards its on-court signage jealously, unlike most international sports events. Rolex for timekeeping, Slazenger for equipment and Robinsons for drinks have for many years been the only three branded products seen on court. Maybe something will go right for IBM this year and it will become the fourth.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> CAN'T FIND THE CAN? . . . IT'S EASY AS DUCK SOUP  </P> <P> Tired of hunting in the cupboard for that can of soup you want but can't find?  With Canup, a Californian's invention, consumers can double their kitchen  cupboard space by hanging cans in holders that fasten to the underside of  shelves.  </P> <P> Canup, designed by James Cosgrove of Baldwin Industries Inc. in South Gate, is  made of sturdy plastic and can be attached with pressure-sensitive tape or  three wood screws. Its plastic panel grips cans' metal edges to hold them  securely. It holds four, 10 3/4- or 12-ounce cans that can be slipped in from  the end or snapped in and out.  </P> <P> RV owners and boaters also may want to consider the holder "for space reasons  and load stabilizing capabilities," Cosgrove says, adding he plans to market  other Canups to hold larger cans.  </P> <P> Suggested retail price for a three-pack of holders, which come in white, red or  black, is $6.95. They're available through three catalogues: Colonial Garden  Kitchens ((800) 752-5552), Ambassador's Easy Living ((602) 747-5000) and Taylor  Gifts ((215) 789-7007). Or you can order them directly from Baldwin Industries  Inc., 5211 Chakemco St., South Gate, Calif. 90280; phone, (213) 569-3266. Cost  is $6.95 for a three-pack, plus $2 shipping and handling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mini-Water Bed Can Be Used Hot or Cold  </P> <P> Suffering from muscle tension in your neck, shoulders or back? Consider  Aqua-Cel, a portable water pad that can be microwaved.  </P> <P> The 12- by 11 1/2-inch plastic cushion can be filled with hot tap water or  placed in a microwave for use in heat therapy; for cold, use cold tap water or  refrigerate before applying. When filled, its manufacturers say, water is  channeled through the Aqua-Cel "creating a mini water bed."  </P> <P> It's portable -- about an inch thick when not filled -- fitting easily into a  briefcase.  </P> <P> Aqua-Cel contains no chemicals, gels or electric components and stays hot or  cold for about an hour. It's available at Dana Boutique and Drug Store in  Burbank, Northridge Pharmacy in Northridge, Friedman's Microwave Store in Long  Beach and Orange and Moulton Plaza Pharmacy in Laguna Hills. If you can't find  it, you can order it, for $29.95 plus $3.50 shipping and handling (Californians  add 6.25% tax), from International Diversified Technologies, 2211 E. Winston  Road, Suite G, Anaheim, Calif. 92806; phone, (714) 635-1815.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Handy Hook for Heavyweight Hanging  </P> <P> The PowerHook lets you hang a heavy mirror, clock or painting on dry wall  without searching all day for that wall stud.  </P> <P> Made of steel and plated in yellow zinc, the PowerHook's design lets you punch  a small hole in dry wall and insert a hook where you want it. It holds an  object weighing up to 110 pounds in 1/2-inch dry wall; 150 pounds in 5/8-inch,  says inventor George Mullen of Dallas.  </P> <P> PowerHooks sell in quantities of 12 per bag for $7.50, plus $1 postage and  handling (California residents add 6 1/2% sales tax). To order, contact  PowerHook Co., P.O. Box 5261, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150; phone (805)  969-7051.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / ANC struggles to control its radicals: Leadership's problems are legion WHEN AN obscure leader of the black supremacist Pan-Africanist Congress in South Africa gets more applause at a rally than Mr Nelson Mandela himself - as happened last week in Soweto - the African National Congress knows it has something to worry about. The murder of Mr Chris Hani, whose funeral yesterday ranked as one of the most important political events in South African history, has seriously threatened the always fragile unity of the ANC. It has jeopardised the ascendency of moderate ANC leaders who have brought South Africa to the brink of agreement with the government on a post-apartheid constitution and forced them to adopt militant rhetoric and tactics to please angry supporters. It has also jeopardised relations with the ruling National party, destined to be the ANC's coalition partner in any multi-party interim government. Inevitably, moderate leaders such as Mr Mandela, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general, and much of the top ANC leadership, have grown away from their mass base as they have moved towards power-sharing with whites. (The maverick Mrs Winnie Mandela says they show indecent haste to sleep between 'the silken sheets of power.' She has been encouraging ANC crowds to 'kill the Boers, kill the farmers.') Links between the moderate leaders and the radical youth, the unemployed, with the huge underclass, are tenuous at best. Mr Hani's death raises the risk that the ANC leadership will lose control of that radical constituency, either to the black power-inspired PAC, or to chaos itself. The PAC so far has negligible support, despite the symbolic applause at the Soweto rally; but chaos decidedly beckons. 'Chris Hani was the umbilical cord between the African National Congress and the masses,' says Mr Peter Mokaba, leader of the ANC youth league. As general secretary of the South African Communist Party, which operates as a sort of 'Militant Tendency' within the ANC, Mr Hani provided a radical home for the 'young lions' of the townships while ensuring their electoral support for the ANC. His death has thrown up two potential successors, men with the radical credentials - and some of the charm and intelligence - to recreate that vital link. They are Mr Sam Shilowa, deputy general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the over one-million-strong ANC-allied union federation, and Mr Tokyo Sexwale, another former guerrilla commander who is leader of the ANC in the crucial industrial heartland around Johannesburg and Pretoria. Neither yet has the stature of Mr Hani, though both have skilfully handled the huge crowds which have turned out to mourn the slain leader. So the main task of defusing the radical threat has inevitably fallen to the ANC leadership - at a time when, after three years of superficially fruitless negotiations with the government, their street credibility is at an all-time low. 'Mandela released three years ago; South Africa still not free.' This complaint, from a placard carried by demonstrators at Saturday's 30,000- strong march through Johannesburg, has become increasingly common as negotiations seem to bog down in ever greater detail. 'The people think that all negotiations have achieved so far is to get Chris Hani killed,' says one moderate ANC leader, stressing that the ANC can no longer afford to ignore popular discontent. 'We want the people to be angry. If they were not, we would know they had given us up,' says Mr Sexwale. 'Now we have to see how we are going to channel this anger properly.' That seems to be the strategy behind the ANC's call for a six-week programme of mass protest action to follow yesterday's funeral. Mass action is meant to defuse that anger - damming it up, says Mr Joe Slovo, leading ANC negotiator, would be 'the shortest route to an explosion' - while applying pressure to speed negotiations. The risk is that a sustained campaign of mass action would tip the delicate balance within the ANC away from 'realists' such as Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Slovo towards the romantic revolutionaries, ideological purists and firebrand socialists who make up the radical camp. This would reverse the balance of power which has prevailed for the past seven months, since the radical-inspired ANC march on the Ciskei capital Bisho, in which more than two dozen died. Moderate ANC leaders, led by Mr Ramaphosa, took control after the blood-letting at Bisho, and were not seriously challenged until Mr Hani's death. In those seven months, they managed to force through the most momentous policy shift in ANC history when they endorsed multi-racial power-sharing until the end of the century, a decision which broke the logjam in constitutional talks with the ruling National party and will form the basis of an eventual deal. Mr Mandela cleverly put down a revolt over this issue, allowing the radicals to hang themselves with their own rope after they were unable to propose any pragmatic alternative to power-sharing. The test he now faces is far greater: to lead his angry people to a level-headed constitutional deal, rather than letting their rage tip South Africa into chaos and race war.</p>

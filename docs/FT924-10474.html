			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Observer: Tyson packs a punch If Bill Clinton does indeed win the US election, who will be the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers? Will it be an FOB - 'Friend of Bill' - or an academic high-flyer? During the campaign, Clinton has relied heavily on the ideas of Robert Reich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government and old friend from his Oxford days, and Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington think-tank. Though both would play important roles in a Clinton presidency, neither seems right for the CEA. Reich - a guru in the Jacques Attali mould - seems more likely to serve as a top policy adviser in the White House, while Shapiro may get a senior post at the Office of Management and Budget. Among the academics, two of the most obvious choices for the post are Larry Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, and Alan Blinder, a Princeton professor and columnist for Business Week. Paul Krugman of MIT is also a strong contender. Summers has a combative personality and can offer first-hand experience of policy-making in a large bureaucracy, although his role as a senior adviser in the ill-fated Dukakis campaign might count against him. Maybe the dark horse is Laura D'Andrea Tyson. As Arkansas governor, Clinton had a female chief of staff for many years and gained a reputation for promoting women. Tyson, a professor at the University of California's Berkeley campus, made a strong impression at economic briefings in Little Rock and shares some of Clinton's economic prejudices. She believes the US should play hardball on trade, and should seek reciprocal concessions before opening its markets. She also advocates a national strategy to promote high-tech industries. That should go down well in Silicon Valley.</p>

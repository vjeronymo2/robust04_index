			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Abolition of pay bodies urged PAY REVIEW bodies and Whitley Councils, which cover workers including nurses and teachers, should be abolished so that a truly social market can operate, says a pamphlet published today by the Social Market Foundation, an independent think-tank. Despite a decade of liberalisation in the private sector the pay of 90 per cent of public employees is still determined centrally, it says. Mr Ron Beadle, the author, said this had prevented rewards being linked to performance in a way that would improve public services and increase employment.</p>

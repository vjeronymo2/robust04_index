			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide survey on 18  and 19 December regarding the government's decision to partially  open Japan's rice market. In the survey, 8 percent of those  questioned termed the decision "reasonable" and 69 percent  called it "unavoidable," making a total of 77 percent who found  the decision acceptable. The results clarify that more than  three-fourths of the people accept the government's decision.  However, 19.4 percent "opposed" it. Asked if Japan should  accept rice tariffication after a six-year grace period, during  which time the market will be partially open, 43 percent of the  respondents said "tariffication should not be accepted," while  as many as 35 percent said "it should be accepted." The results  show that public acceptance of liberalizing Japan's rice market  is on the rise.    In a similar poll in October, 62 percent supported opening  the rice market and 30 percent opposed. The results cannot be  compared directly with those of this month's survey because the  December survey asked specifically about the partial opening of  the market. Nonetheless, in this month's survey 22 percent of  those who "opposed" the partial opening said "rice tariffication  should be accepted" after the six-year grace period. This may  mean those who oppose the partial opening do so because they  want the market to be fully opened. Also, as many as 50 percent  of those who are in the agricultural, forestry, and fisheries  industries called the partial opening "unavoidable."    When asked about how they think the partial opening will  affect Japanese rice farming, the majority said "the structure  of rice farming will be improved," while 44 percent said "rice  farming will be on the decline."    In response to other questions, more than 70 percent said  "ensuring the safety of imported rice will be a major problem;"  62 percent said rice, the staple food in Japan, "will steadily  be supplied;" and 70 percent said "there will be little change"  in rice prices.</p>

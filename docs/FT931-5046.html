			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Jobs data provide bonds with a dose of cold reality IS A 6.5 per cent yield on the 30-year Treasury bond a real possibility? For most of last week, the mood of US bond dealers seemed to suggest that it might be. It took the February employment data, which on Friday disclosed a surprisingly large increase in jobs last month, to inject a dose of cold reality into the market. The persistent 'upbeat' mood - which, in the previous week, had sent the long bond yield to its lowest level since 30-year bonds began to be issued regularly in the 1970s - became plain when trading began on Monday. In spite of disruption stemming from the World Trade Center blast and some cautious comments on short-term government borrowing plans from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US treasury secretary, the long bond yield had fallen to 6.84 per cent by Monday evening from 6.9 per cent at the end of the previous week. Admittedly, there was nothing particularly alarmist in Mr Bentsen's remarks; he simply indicated that there would be no 'dramatic, radical shift' in the authorities' short-term borrowing plans. Nevertheless, traders had attributed part of the long bond's price rise to expectations that the quarterly 30-year auctions would diminish significantly in scale, and this might have depressed sentiment. So, too, might the temporary absence from the market of Cantor Fitzgerald, an important brokerage firm in the bond market and one of the casualties of the WTC explosion. But, having overcome these obstacles, the bond price rally duly continued for another three days. By Thursday evening, the long bond yield had dropped to 6.78 per cent, and yields on other Treasury issues had also declined. At this stage, there were few specific economic numbers to account for the rise - although weaker-than-expected data on 10-day car sales may have helped. In general, the rally appeared to result from growing confidence in the non-inflationary implications of the Clinton economic plan, and even some speculation about a further easing of interest rates by the authorities. Nevertheless, uneasiness about the speed and extent of the rally was beginning to spread among analysts - and Friday's release of the jobs numbers brought a perfect opportunity for the market to consolidate. The numbers themselves were certainly unexpected: there was an increase of 365,000 workers on non-farm payrolls in February, about three times the figure which pundits had been predicting, while the national unemployment rate edged down by a tenth of 1 per cent, to 7 per cent. With the weekend to reflect, analysts appeared to be striking a cautious note. Some pundits observed that manufacturing sector employment remains fairly weak, although it does appear that the recent pick-up in economic activity is finally translating into jobs. Although demand and supply considerations may underpin recent bond yields, many suspect that the steam will go out of the rally. The coming week, meanwhile, will be fairly light on new economic data. The February producer price index is due to be released on Friday, and expectations centre on a small increase - perhaps 0.3 per cent, after 0.2 per cent in January - due to higher food and energy prices. Predictions for February retail sales figures, out on Thursday, focus on a modest 0.1 per cent increase. Individual store sales results for the month have already displayed lacklustre trading, although retailers have blamed severe winter weather in many parts of the country.</p>

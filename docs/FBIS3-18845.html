			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marco Panara: "Spaventa: Let Me Explain Why This </F> Recipe Will Not Work"]    [Text] Rome -- [Budget Minister] Luigi Spaventa does not  appear on television. He does not like to reduce ideas to a  single sentence, to express himself in slogans, or to trim his  assessments back with a hatchet. He prefers situations in which  he can develop his arguments and explain his thinking clearly.  This, partly because economics, and especially tax matters, do  not lend themselves well to slogans or, rather, the slogans that  raise people's feelings in these fields conflict with the  figures. So Spaventa tries to avoid them, even during an  election campaign and even on television.    What he does like, however, is debate -- so much so that he  decided to stand for election in Rome's constituency number one,  precisely in order to challenge [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi's claim to a seat in the lower house. And the first  thing that Spaventa did on "Milano, Italia" yesterday was to set  his own position on taxation against that of Forza Italia or,  rather, to demonstrate the impracticability of the "Martino  theory" -- a reference to the person behind Berlusconi's  economic program -- which aims to introduce a single 30 percent  income tax rate.    "At present tax rates of up to 30 percent of taxable income  apply to 95 percent of taxpayers," Spaventa said, "while higher  rates apply to only the remaining 5 percent. If the aim were,  by means of a number of allowances, to maintain the present tax  burden on those paying less than 30 percent, while at the same  time reducing the higher rates, there would be an immediate loss  of revenue of 3.5-4 trillion lire. This presents two  alternatives: Either we forego this large slice of revenue,  which the state coffers cannot allow, or this burden is placed  on the medium taxpayers, those declaring incomes of 40-80  million lire, penalizing them still further."    Having finished with figures, Spaventa went on to tackle the  issue of fair taxation: "Ronald Reagan included in his program  the introduction of a single rate of income tax, but then the  problem of ensuring neutrality for federal funds and for  taxpayers by means of allowances in such a reform became a  nightmare for him. He never found the solution, and indeed a  single tax rate was never introduced in the United States."    "The problem," Spaventa added, "is that in order to avert  enormous waste, the system of allowances must be extremely  detailed, in which case the regulations would fill a whole book."    Having dismantled his adversary's proposals, Berlusconi's  progressive rival went on to present his own proposal, which has  three points: "What can be done is to reduce the number of tax  rates, to lower the higher ones and to raise the lower ones, and  to operate a simple system of deductions for personal income  tax. In the case of legal entities, my proposal is to reduce  the tax rate, which is officially very high, and to revise the  entire taxation system, which at present favors indebtedness  rather than the increase of risk capital. Last, there is  investment income, and in this regard I very much like the  proposal made by Finance Minister Gallo." Franco Gallo's  proposal which was not pursued because of the early election,  envisages the incorporation of taxation on all financial income  (interest received, yield from bonds and government stock,  dividends, and so forth) so as to make the tax aspect neutral in  the choice of how savings will be employed. Tax would in any  case be deducted by intermediaries at source.</p>

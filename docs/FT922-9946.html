			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Sweden and Finland turn in declines OUTSIDE the EC, the government bond markets in Sweden and Finland have suffered from political uncertainty and economic upheaval, writes Sara Webb in Stockholm. The Finnish government market fell 1.7 per cent in April, following the resignation of the Central Bank governor and an ensuing outflow of capital. The financial crisis in Finland pushed Sweden's bond market down 0.1 per cent in April. In addition, political worries last week upset the Swedish market and pushed up bond yields. Sweden's New Democracy Party made a name for itself campaigning for cheaper alcohol, abolition of traffic wardens, and lower taxes in the 1991 general election. Last week, it joined forces with the socialist bloc in Parliament and stopped the Centre-Right government from pushing through the abolition of part-time pensions. The news that the government had failed to win a majority sparked a minor sell-off in Swedish government bonds on Wednesday. Five-year bond yields rose from 10.04 per cent to 10.12 per cent on the day. But while Swedish investors reacted badly to the news, international investors appear less concerned. They hope to benefit from a closer association between the Swedish krona and EMS currencies.</p>

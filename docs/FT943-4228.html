			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Investors oust five directors at Cadillac Fairview A group of institutional investors who recently emerged as the biggest shareholders and creditors of Cadillac Fairview have ousted more than half the directors of the financially stretched North American property developer. Cadillac yesterday named Mr Charles Masson, former head of financial restructurings at Salomon Brothers, the New York based investment bank, as chairman. Five of the previous nine-member board have been replaced by seven new directors. Cadillac, whose 70 properties include several of Canada's biggest downtown office buildings and shopping malls, has been hit by the long downturn in North American real estate markets. The Toronto-based company is in the throes of restructuring CDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) of debt on its properties as well as CDollars 1bn of syndicated bank debt. It is negotiating a capital infusion from one or more outside investors. Cadillac, a private company, said about 75 per cent of its common shares and 90 per cent of its senior debt had recently changed hands. The biggest single shareholder is Calpers, the California public sector pension fund, with a 15 per cent stake. The new owners and creditors are an assortment of institutions, including pension funds and so-called vulture funds. Mr Masson said the new owners 'were of the view that it would be in their best interests to place people on the board who were known to them'. Mr Graham Eadie, Cadillac's chief executive, said the new owners 'recognise there's good value and good upside here'. Mr Masson said he hoped the board changes would not slow the restructuring process. He indicated that he hoped to complete the restructuring in about nine months, although he said such negotiations usually took longer than expected.</p>

Acknowledges that the House was promised a debate prior to the committee stage. Notes that the Danish Government's intentions have now been clarified. Recalls the Lisbon Council's commitment to subsidiarity, the Birmingham Council's agreement on a framework for decisions to implement that principle and the practical steps already taken to achieve it. Recognises that the UK should play a leading role in the development of the European Community to achieve a free market Europe open to accession by other European democracies, thereby promoting employment, prosperity and investment into the UK And invites Her Majesty's Government to proceed with the bill in order that the House should consider its provisions in further detail.'</p>

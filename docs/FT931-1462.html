			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Johnston Press hits Pounds 9.76m JOHNSTON PRESS, the Edinburgh-based newspaper publishing group, increased 1992 pre-tax profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 9.76m, with just over half the increase coming from acquisitions. The company, in which the Johnston family has a 45 per cent stake, has doubled its turnover since 1988 - partly because of a series of acquisitions of newspaper and publishing groups as it has expanded out of Scotland and the north of England. Mr Fred Johnston, executive chairman, said that for the third year running there was no evidence of any improvement in the market place. The company's improved performance was due to its own efforts in containing costs and in finding business opportunities 'in often bleak economic conditions.' The company benefited from 'the strong and well-established' position of its free and paid-for newspapers, which operate between Falkirk and Sussex. The bookbinding and library bookselling businesses performed well. Turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 71.7m, of which all but 1.6 per cent was due to acquisitions. The figure benefited from one year's revenue of Greenhead Books of Ipswich, one quarter from TR Beckett, the Sussex-based newspaper group, and from Shoesmith and Etheridge, a stationery wholesaler in Uckfield, Sussex. Mr Iain Bell, managing director, said: 'Our strict cost controls and good housekeeping stand us in good stead.' Mr Johnston hinted at possible further acquisitions, stating 'as companies scarred by the recession begin to review their portfolios, there are going to be further business opportunities for undertakings which have survived the last three years in good order.' He added: 'Despite the utterances of the politicians, evidence in the everyday world has yet to provide any significant signs that the recession is coming to an end.' A final dividend of 4p makes a 6.25p (5.5p) total.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Small business in favour of leasing changes Sir, Tony Mallin of the Finance and Leasing Association is quite wrong to claim that changes by the Office of Fair Trading to current leasing regulations are not favoured by small businesses (Survey of leasing and asset finance, November 19). This chamber has presented evidence personally and in writing to Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, urging that protection afforded to individuals and unincorporated businesses be extended to private companies. Leasing deals can be a minefield for smaller businesses. Both the FLA and government should remember that small businesses and the jobs that depend on them can be at the mercy of the unscrupulous and some regulation is in the interests of business. Daphne Green, chairman, Leeds &amp; Bradford Chamber of Commerce and Small Business Committee, Mill House, Troy Road, Horsforth, Leeds LS18 5NQ</p>

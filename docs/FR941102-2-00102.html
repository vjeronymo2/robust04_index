			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(iii) assume the existence of a pass-through voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. Applicants state that pass-through privileges will be provided with respect to all variable contract owners so long as the Commission interprets the Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners. However, Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority. Voting instructions may also be disregarded by the insurance company if the contract owners initiate any change in the investment company's investment policies, principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and based on a specific good faith determination as required under the Rules. Applicants assert that the rights of an insurance company or of a state insurance regulator to disregard contract owners' voting instructions are not inconsistent with mixed or shared funding. According to the Applicants, there is no reason why the investment policies of any portfolio of the Fund would or should be materially different from what it would or should be if it funded only annuity contracts or only scheduled or flexible premium life contracts and that there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of contracts will lead to different investment policies for different types of variable contracts. Applicants represent that the Fund will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of insurance product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Application states that mixed and shared funding should provide several benefits to variable contract holders. It would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment, thereby promoting economies of scale, permitting a greater diversification, and making the addition of new portfolios more feasible. The Applicants believe that making the Fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts, and this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing, which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts have historically been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. The Fund does not believe that mixed and shared funding will have any adverse federal income tax consequences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A majority of the board of trustees of the Fund (the ``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund, as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona-fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) for a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill a vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon Application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Board will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the life owners and annuity owners and any future owners in the Fund. An irreconcilable material conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (1) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (2) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (3) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (4) the manner in which the investments of any portfolio are being managed; (5) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Participating insurance companies and InterCapital will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board. Participating insurance companies and InterCapital will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised. This includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the Board whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of all insurers investing in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with the view only to interests of the contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

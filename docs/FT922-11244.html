			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / US Money and Credit: Yields have only one way to go ONCE again long-term bond yields have risen above 8 per cent, but unlike six weeks ago, it is likely that this time they will will stay there. Historically, bond yields bottom out when a recession ends, and ascend alongside the economic recovery. Given that even the most bearish of commentators now admits that the US economy has slipped the shackles of recession, that domestic interest rates and inflation have probably reached their lows, and that supply pressures linked to the Budget deficit will continue to weigh on Treasury prices, bond yields have only one way to go from here, and that is up. The economists at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street broking house, succinctly sum up the outlook for the Treasury markets in their latest circular, which targets 6 per cent on the two-year note and 8.5 per cent on the 30-year bond by the year end. Say the folk at DLJ: 'Our forecast continues to be based upon the perception of economic activity accelerating to 3 per cent, inflation not receding below 4 per cent, Treasury financing needs continuing to exert pressure on the market, likely increases in long bond offering sizes, and moderate policy firmings by the Fed during the second half of the year. We currently see little opportunity for even a short-run significant rally in bond prices.' The most recent economic statistics - for March durable goods orders and unemployment insurance claims - leave little doubt that the recovery is well under way, although how fast that recovery will progress remains in doubt. The clearest evidence yet of recovery will be available tomorrow, when first quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures are released. Forecasters are expecting GDP to have risen somewhere between 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent in the opening three months of the year, with consumer spending shown to have risen at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent over the period. Also expected out in a busy week for figures are April consumer confidence (forecast to increase to 57 per cent), March new and existing home sales (both projected to fall slightly), March personal income and spending (up about 0.3 per cent), March factory orders (up 1.2 per cent) and April's purchasing managers' report (which is expected to rise to 55 per cent). If the economic numbers fail to push yields any higher, the quarterly refunding announcement could do the job just as well. Much of last week's decline in prices, and the rise in yields above 8 per cent, was due to concern among dealers already loaded with inventory about the approaching refunding round. Estimates of the size of the May refunding operation centre around Dollars 37bn or Dollars 38bn, slightly higher than the previous quarter's Dollars 36bn, with the extra supply spread evenly among three-year and 10-year notes, and 30-year bonds.</p>

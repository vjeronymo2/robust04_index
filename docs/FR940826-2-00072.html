			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Providing for each of its existing customers to designate the Interexchange Carrier of the customer's choice within 60 days after the System's conversion to equal access, and thereafter requiring each new customer to designate the Interexchange Carrier of the customer's choice. After such date, the McCaw Cellular Systems shall block Interexchange Services to customers who both fail to designate an Interexchange Carrier and place calls without using access codes, except that they may allocate existing customers who fail to make such a designation among Interexchange Carriers in proportion to the number of customers subscribing to each of these Interexchange Carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Each McCaw Cellular System shall provide complete lists of its Cellular Service customers' names and addresses to Interexchange Carriers unaffiliated with McCaw or AT&amp;T for use solely in connection with marketing their Interexchange Services to customers of that McCaw Cellular System at least sixty days prior to the system's conversion to equal access and at quarterly intervals thereafter. If customers' names, addresses, telephone number or other information are provided to or used by AT&amp;T for the purpose of marketing Interexchange Services, the lists shall be provided to other Interexchange Carriers at the same time and under the same terms. A McCaw Cellular System shall not provide AT&amp;T with information about a cellular customer's Interexchange Carrier or the customer's Cellular or Interexchange Service usage unless (a) the customer is already a customer of AT&amp;T's Interexchange Services, and (b) the McCaw Cellular System provides other Interexchange Carriers with the same information concerning their customers at the same time and under the same terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. After its conversion to equal access, each McCaw Cellular System shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Provide to all Interexchange Carriers Exchange Access on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality, and price to that provided to AT&amp;T. Each McCaw Cellular System shall allow access to MTSOs through switched connections by way of local exchange carrier access tandems, and shall provide to the Interexchange Carrier dialed digits, automatic calling number identification and other information necessary to bill calls, answer supervision, carrier access codes, and testing and maintenance of whatever facilities of the cellular system are used by Interexchange Carriers, regardless of whether any of these services are provided to AT&amp;T. A McCaw Cellular System shall be required to offer to each unaffiliated Interexchange Carrier to establish dedicated access connections to MTSOs, to perform billing services on reasonable terms, to provide interexchange traffic routing services, provide customer location information for use in routing calls, and to perform other activities or functions for Interexchange Carriers in connection with the origination, routing, or termination interexchange calls in the same manner as and on the same terms and conditions, including price, that those services, activities, or functions are provided to AT&amp;T. If a McCaw Cellular System provides information to AT&amp;T to allow it to bill its Interexchange Service customers for Cellular Service, it shall at each unaffiliated Interchange Carrier's option provide sufficient information about the usage and charges for Cellular Service to other Interexchange Carriers to allow them to make commercially reasonable arrangements to bill their customers for Cellular Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Be prohibited from discriminating in favor of AT&amp;T (a) in providing in a timely manner technical or other information about the Cellular System or its customers, (b) in the interconnection or use of the McCaw Cellular System's service and facilities or in the charges for each element of service, or (c) in the provision of new Exchange Access services and the planning for and construction or modification of facilities used to provide Exchange Access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Be prohibited from implementing any new Exchange Access service, or imposing any charge on Interexchange Carriers for Exchange Access, unless the service is available and the charge is applicable to all Interexchange Carriers and has been announced a minimum of 60 days before the service is provided or the charge imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. A Cellular System that becomes a McCaw Cellular System following the entry of this Final Judgment shall comply with the provisions of this Section IV within one year of the date on which it becomes a McCaw Cellular System, or within 21 months of the commencement of this action, whichever is later. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section IV, and following the dates upon which AT&amp;T, McCaw and McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems may use the name ``AT&amp;T,'' its trademarks and trade names pursuant to Section III of this Final Judgment, AT&amp;T may act as McCaw's agent in marketing Local Cellular Services and may jointly market Local Cellular Services, Interexchange Services and other services, provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. AT&amp;T must advise actual or prospective subscribers that they have a right to presubscribe to competing Interexchange Carriers following each McCaw Cellular System's conversion to equal access; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. AT&amp;T shall be required to state separately the prices, terms, and rate plans for Local Cellular Services and Interexchange Services; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULE INTERPRETATION FUMBLED BY WIRE STORY  </P> <P> The Associated Press story on the 49ers-Saints game (Oct. 9) described Jerry  Rice's apparent fumble before reaching the goal line, and the fact that the  ball rolled through and out of the end zone.  </P> <P> The article says that "if that had been the ruling, the 49ers would have had  the ball where Rice fumbled."  </P> <P> While that statement might mollify a reader who felt that the outcome was  determined by a bad call, the statement is incorrect. Under those  circumstances, the ball would have been turned over to the Saints at the point  of the fumble (the prior rule would have given the ball to the Saints at the 20  as a touchback), but in any case, it is turnover. The game's outcome was  determined by a bad call.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the officials declared that the next play (the extra point) was  run before there was a chance to call for an instant replay review, precluding  such a review. But football rules designate that the extra point is part of the  touchdown play (not an additional play). So the officials blew it twice and  cost the Saints a game.  </P> <P> STEPHEN D. MOSES, Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Editor's note: According to NFL rules, "A fumble that goes forward and out of  bounds will return to the fumbling team at the spot of the fumble unless the  ball goes out of bounds in the opponent's end zone. In this case, the defensive  team is to take possession at the spot of the fumble." By the way, the NFL has  suspended, at least through this weekend, that instant-replay official.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS;  </P> <P> MAJOR LEAGUES BALK AT BALK RULE  </P> <P> Baseball's controversial balk rule, which created havoc for pitchers during the  1988 season and led to a 160% increase in balks, is being scrapped for the 1989  season.  </P> <P> The Major League Baseball Players Assn., which accepted the rule last spring on  a one-year trial basis, has decided to block it for this season. The Official  Playing Rules Committee decided to go back to the old rule, which said pitchers  must come to a "complete stop" instead of a "complete and discernible stop." A  record 924 balks were called in 1988. The previous record was 356 in 1987.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Official sources  confirmed today that a group of unidentified people dynamited an  electricity pylon in the municipality of Concepcion in the  southern department of Escuintla. As a result, several  communities have no electricity.    The National Police indicated that early this morning  several  men planted dynamite cartridges on two of the four sides of the  pylon, which was partly destroyed while the homes of some  100,000 people were left without electric power.    According to the Police, the Army arrived in the area and  began to comb the mountains for those responsible for the attack.    The Police said that last Saturday another two electricity  pylons were dynamited in the country's interior, and no victims  have been reported yet.    The attacks took place within the framework of the meeting  between the government and the Guatemalan guerrillas in Oslo,  Norway, where the parties are considering the creation of a  Verification Commission of the Historic Past. Guatemala has  endured a 34-year armed conflict, which has resulted in some  175,000 victims.</p>

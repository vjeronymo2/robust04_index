			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Technology: New directions for research resources - Why European companies must look to the future Europe's industrial base is in danger of being eroded because of wrong use of its research resources, according to Hartmut Weule, head of research and technology at Daimler-Benz, the German motor, electronics and aerospace group. Too much effort has gone into preserving the old and not enough into creating the new. Research funds have too often been allocated by the public sector, and this has tended to inhibit innovation. Weule, addressing the European Union's industrial research and development advisory committee in Brussels, said Europeans were not tight-fisted nationally when it came to spending money on research. Germany spent 2.7 per cent of its gross national product on R&amp;D compared with 2.8 per cent in the US and 3.05 per cent in Japan. But in 1991, only 16 per cent of Germany's exports were of research-intensive, high technology products - in which R&amp;D funding accounted for more than 8.5 per cent of turnover. In Japan, the figure was 27 per cent and in the US, 43 per cent. The reason was that German exports had a high concentration of products from traditional sectors such as the mechanical engineering, electrical, chemical and motor industries. Weule's comments are in line with the findings of Ifo, the German economic research institute, which said recently that the country's research efforts were too heavily weighted towards low-growth sectors. 'However,' Weule said, 'it's not just the Germans who are stuck in their ways. It's a European problem.' Many companies did not make proper use of resources for research into future products. Nor did they put enough effort into evaluating the success of research. None of this was easy, Weule said, citing the extensive changes that Daimler had been forced to make in targeting its research after its 1980s expansion through acquisitions. Daimler now compares its R&amp;D efforts with those of other companies in different fields. Its spending is also focused. Some 70 per cent of its annual long-term research budget of DM500m (Pounds 200m) - part of the total R&amp;D budget of DM9.3bn, 10 per cent of turnover - is concentrated on five future-oriented areas: transport drive systems, materials, energy technology, microelectronics, and technology and society. Daimler was also increasing the efficiency of its use of resources by co-operating with other companies and institutes. 'Anyone trying to 'go it alone' dissipates his energies,' he said. Also, group research spending was organised strictly on a project basis, with clear time and cost frameworks. Two years ago, Daimler was the first European company to introduce a special research audit for its main research fields, involving group managers and outside scientists who also assess how well research is translated into products. Weule said state funds should be redirected in the same way and not simply go into broad research areas of national economic interest. 'We must concentrate on just a few future-oriented key fields.' These would include: advanced production systems, information and communications technologies, power engineering, environmental technology, and vehicle and traffic engineering. The allocation of funds would have to be planned by industry, science and the state. 'To be successful in these fields, we Europeans must be ready to co-operate more closely - despite our tendencies to individualism.' Daimler, for example, was co-operating with France's Aerospatiale on various projects, within the framework of Airbus Industries and of the Eurocolumbus space and Eurocopter helicopter programmes. Individualism, Weule said, was a European strength where it led to creativity and a weakness where it led to egoism. 'The complex high technologies we need to produce competitive products, processes and services for tomorrow's markets can only be realised in partnership.'</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Pupils' leaving rates show regional divide An educational 'north-south divide' is revealed by regional statistics published yesterday for school staying-on rates and academic qualifications. However, the figures, provided separately by the Department for Education and the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys, showed that all regions of Britain have registered improvements. National participation in full-time education in the academic year 1992-93 ran at 70 per cent for 16-year-olds - up 3 percentage points on the previous year - and 53 per cent for 17-year-olds, up 5 percentage points. Staying-on rates have improved by 18 percentage points for both age groups since 1988-89. However, while some local education authorities, mostly in the south, have registered improvements in staying on of more than 25 percentage points - the greatest increases coming from Barking, Hounslow and Avon  - other predominantly northern authorities have managed an increase of less than 10 percentage points. Knowsley in Merseyside is the only English authority where less than half of 16-year-olds are in full-time education, while Salford, Rochdale, Sandwell, South Tyneside, Tameside and Barnsley all have participation rates of 54 per cent or less. All the 10 authorities with staying-on rates of 80 per cent or better are in outer London or the Home Counties - Kingston, Berkshire, Surrey, Hounslow, Redbridge, Sutton, Croydon, Harrow, Hertfordshire and Barnet. Data from the 1991 census shows that there has been an improvement in the proportion of the British workforce which has 'higher' qualifications - equivalent to an A-level or better - but there are again broad regional variations. The census showed that 17 per cent of men between the ages of 18 and 64 in Britain had such qualifications - up from 13 per cent 10 years earlier, and 9 per cent in 1991. Meanwhile, 14 per cent of women had similar qualifications, up from 9.5 per cent in 1981, and 6.7 per cent in 1971. The south-east had the highest proportion of qualified men (19.1 per cent), while the north of England had the lowest (12.2 per cent).</p>

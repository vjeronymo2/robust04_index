			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOME VICTORY!  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles Getz, who argued the state's case in the El Cajon  malathion spraying trial, is reported to have said the court's decision was "a  victory for the environment, period." ("El Cajon Gets Its Second Dose of  Malathion," June 5.)  </P> <P> Orwellian Doublespeak of the first order!  </P> <P> I was struck by the similarity of his attitude to that of an American officer  present at Ben Tre, Vietnam, in February, 1968, who is reported to have said,  "It became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it."  </P> <P> If the governor and his minions continue their chosen course, they will not  only degrade our shared environment in known and unforeseen ways, they will  also erode the public trust in our government, demonstrate the arrogance of  unaccountable bureaucrats and seriously impact the public health. For what? The  shelf life of an avocado in an export market?  </P> <P> DANIEL TARR  </P> <P> Co-chairman, Green Party  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

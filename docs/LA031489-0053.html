			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: VOTE SET ON ACQUISITION OF ENCINO INSURANCE FIRM  </P> <P> Shareholders are scheduled to vote March 31 on whether to approve the  acquisition of Republic American Corp., an Encino workers' compensation  insurance company, by Penn Central Corp.  </P> <P> The merger, which needs the blessing of those owning two-thirds of Republic  American's shares, is expected to be approved. Both companies are controlled by  Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner.  </P> <P> About 53% of Republic American's stock is already owned either by Penn Central,  a telecommunications and defense company in Greenwich, Conn., or another  Lindner-controlled company, American Financial Corp. Penn Central is offering  $153 million, or $15.75 a share, for the 47% stake that Lindner-controlled  companies do not already own.  </P></p>

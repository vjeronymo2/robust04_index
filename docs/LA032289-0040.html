			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNARDI SAYS HE WILL TAKE PART IN FORUM WITH FOES  </P> <P> In a sign that he is facing his toughest race, Los Angeles City Councilman  Ernani Bernardi took the unusual step Tuesday of agreeing to face his  challengers in a public forum.  </P> <P> Council members traditionally have ducked candidate forums because such events  tend to give challengers an opportunity to gang up on the incumbent.  </P> <P> But Bernardi, 77, is in a largely new northeast San Fernando Valley district  because of the 1986 council redistricting. He is opposed by seven challengers,  the most in his 28-year council career, in the April 11 election.  </P> <P> "I think he is in a tough race," said Steve Afriat, a veteran City Hall  political consultant. "There is a large number of constituents who are  unfamiliar with him because of reapportionment."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerned About Attacks  </P> <P> Bernardi said he was concerned about opponents attacking him for refusing to  appear with them.  </P> <P> Opponents have charged that Bernardi is afraid to meet them. The councilman  denied that, saying he has avoided forums so far because they have been  sponsored by his foes.  </P> <P> Bernardi laid down some stiff terms, including refusing to answer questions  from the audience and insisting that he be permitted to speak last. He said he  would meet his challengers only once and would not participate in a debate  format, but would answer questions asked by a panel that he felt was impartial.  He also said the forum must be sponsored by what he considers an impartial  group, such as the League of Women Voters.  </P> <P> "There's no way you can debate with seven people," he said at a news conference  in his City Hall office. "How can you debate when I'm the target?"  </P> <P> "I'm only interested in discussing the issues," he said. "All they're doing is  criticizing me without saying what they would do different."  </P> <P> Some of Bernardi's opponents said they welcomed a chance to confront him before  an audience.  </P> <P> "I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the issues with him," said Lyle  Hall, a labor-backed city firefighter and potentially Bernardi's toughest  challenger.  </P> <P> Hall, former president of the Los Angeles firefighters' union, said he did not  care what conditions Bernardi put on the meetings.  </P> <P> "I have not put any conditions on any of the appearances that I have made," he  said. "I walked into what was viewed as potentially unfriendly territory, but I  felt that's the system. . . . The purpose of having a candidates forum is so  the public can ask questions and talk about items of concern to them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'That's No Surprise'  </P> <P> Challenger Jules Bagneris III, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners  Assn., said Bernardi "has been last on showing leadership on a number of  issues, so if he wants to be last at a debate, that's no surprise. I don't care  if he goes first, if he goes in the middle or if he goes last. I will be  there."  </P> <P> But challenger Irene Tovar said: "I think it is an insult for me to participate  in something that doesn't allow the public to ask questions."  </P> <P> "We are asking for their votes," Tovar said. "How dare we tell them they have  no right to ask questions."  </P></p>

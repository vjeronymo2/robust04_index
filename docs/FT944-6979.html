			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Ivory and Sime plans to reorganise trust: High dividends cut British Assets' reserves Ivory and Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund manager, yesterday proposed a reorganisation of its flagship investment trust, British Assets Trust, whose income has been insufficient to pay the high dividends promised to investors. Under the plan some shareholders will forgo dividends for seven years in return for the right to buy more shares at a special price. Ivory and Sime will also reorganise the assets of another investment trust it manages, Investors Capital Trust. British Assets, which owns 36 per cent of ICT, will sell its stake. Together the two trusts have nearly Pounds 1bn in assets, about a quarter of all Ivory and Sime's investment trust assets under management. 'Ivory and Sime has been the investment manager over the past 10 years and is not entirely free of blame. Performance has not been up to par,' said Mr Colin Hook, managing director designate at Ivory and Sime. Earlier this month, British Assets, which has about 60,000 shareholders, said its net asset value had fallen 7.6 per cent to 102p per share for the year to end September. In that time, the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index rose 0.3 per cent. Mr Hook said the directors of both trusts had considered sacking Ivory and Sime, but had reconsidered after management changes. It is expected that the chairman of British Assets, Mr Roger Inglis, will step down. British Assets's charter promises investors it will pay dividends each year which outstrip above the rate of inflation. In the event, British Assets has only been able to keep its dividend promise to shareholders by eating into reserves. 'We are now down to about 47 per cent cover (reserves over dividend expense) and it would only be a matter of time before our reserves are depleted,' said Mr Richard Muckert, newly appointed fund manager. Under the proposals, 16 per cent of shareholders must agree to receive no dividends for seven years by converting some of their ordinary shares to a new class of 'growth share'. Each growth share will come with five warrants, entitling the investor to buy new ordinary shares in seven years at a price equal to British Assets' net asset value at the reorganisation date. Those who retain ordinary shares can expect dividend growth to continue as promised. Institutional shareholders have already indicated their intention to take up at least 16 per cent of the new shares. However, the proposals cannot be adopted unless 75 per cent of shareholders attending an extraordinary general meeting next month vote in favour. British Assets shares closed yesterday at 94p, up 1.5p on the day, after 22m shares changed hands in heavy trading. The shares are trading at a discount of 7 per cent to net asset value.

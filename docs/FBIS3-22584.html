			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Fletcher: "Fifty percent of All Hospitals </F> `Run Short of Money'"]    [Text] More than half of all hospitals have experienced  such severe financial problems in the past year that they have  been forced to close wards or exceed their budget, the  Association of Community Health Councils says today.    In a report assessing the impact of the health reforms, it  says they have brought both benefits and disadvantages for  patients.    On the negative side:    -- One in three hospitals has had to slow down the number of  patients being admitted because of cash problems.    -- Patients of non-fundholding GP's have found they cannot  get into hospital as quickly as fundholders' patients.    On the positive side:    -- Waiting times to get into hospital have shortened.    -- Fears that patients would have to travel further as the  internal market developed have proved unfounded.    The report is unable to reach clear-cut conclusions about  the  overall benefit of the reforms.    It says: "Opinion is divided among community health councils  about the impact of the reforms on the quality of care  delivered. Some feel purchasers and GP's are more able to insist  on higher standards. Others feel patient care is being  compromised by cost-cutting and staff demoralisation."    The report adds that there is little evidence of  non-fundholding GP's having to change referral patterns to fit  the contracts made by their health authorities.    In contrast, "fundholding GP's are revealed as the most  dynamic and disruptive sector of the NHS internal market.  Thirty-eight percent of CHC's say local hospitals have lost  patients because of fundholders. They have sent their patients  to private hospitals or to other NHS hospitals.    "Fundholders' patients can get better treatment, sometimes  at  the expense of other NHS patients. One in five CHC's report that  fundholders' patients get priority access to local hospitals."    Great difficulties have resulted from hospitals facing too  much demand without purchasers having funds to match, says the  report.</p>

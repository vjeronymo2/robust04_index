			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GLITCH TIES HUGE AT&amp;T NETWORK IN KNOTS;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS: ABOUT HALF OF ALL LONG-DISTANCE CALLS THAT CUSTOMERS TRIED TO  PLACE WERE BLOCKED. THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM TOOK HOURS TO CORRECT.  </P> <P> If you tried to reach out on Monday, chances were about even that you did not  touch anyone.  </P> <P> A mysterious problem gripped AT&amp;T's giant long-distance network, making it  impossible for many calls to get through. Instead, for hours on end, unlucky  callers heard only a series of musical tones and the following tape recording:  "All circuits are busy now. Please try your call later."  </P> <P> The company said the problem was fixed by 8:30 p.m. PST, but spokeswoman Sally  Sherwood said she could not provide any more details immediately on how the  network was returned to normal.  </P> <P> "Obviously through a very long, laborious process they were able to detect the  problem and fix it," she said.  </P> <P> The difficulties were traced to software that runs computerized call-switching  gear that AT&amp;T began installing in 1987, Sherwood said.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T's diagnostic testing system first alerted the company to the problem  around 11:30 a.m. PST.  </P> <P> Several hours later, engineers at the firm's Network Operations Center in  Bedminster, N.J., figured they had isolated the problem in the utility's  Signaling System Seven, a data network overlaying the talking path of telephone  conversations. But it took several more hours to fix the system.  </P> <P> Linda McDougall, a spokeswoman in AT&amp;T's Los Angeles office, explained that  the SS7 network carries the calling number, the number called and the route of  the call, but not the conversation.  </P> <P> She estimated that the problem affected about half the calls that AT&amp;T  customers were trying to make on public lines.  </P> <P> Particularly hard-hit were companies that rely on 800 numbers to generate much  of their business. At Avis car rental, for example, operators accustomed to  juggling several calls per minute were staring at silent phones for as long as  five minutes at a time. "We're not getting any calls," said one, who identified  herself as Candy.  </P> <P> Increasing computerization has given the phone system far more versatility,  enabling it to handle a growing load of calls, faxes and computer hookups. Call  forwarding, call waiting and other custom services are all products of this  computerization.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T and the regional operating companies insist that these additional  services have not come at the cost of less reliability, but some experts have  warned that the more complex the software systems, the more likely they are to  have bugs that may pop up without warning.  </P> <P> On a normal business day, AT&amp;T's long-distance network, the nation's  largest, handles between 80 million and 90 million calls. However, company  officials said they believed the volume was significantly lower on Monday  because of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. birthday holiday.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Hyundai Motor America was among those bedeviled by the  AT&amp;T glitch.  </P> <P> "We've had major problems; we can't call out," said telecommunication manager  Susie Nakao earlier in the day. "We just get all circuits busy."  </P> <P> The company's high-speed data lines were still transmitting despite the  failure, however, so employees increased use of an electronic messaging system  to reach out from the Fountain Valley national headquarters to other Hyundai  offices across the United States, Nakao said.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell also suffered from the AT&amp;T failure because Pacific Bell's  local operators were "bombarded" with phone calls from puzzled customers,  according to Linda Bonniksen, a company spokeswoman in Orange County.  </P> <P> "Old habits die hard," Bonniksen said. The flood of calls came from AT&amp;T  customers who punched zero once and connected with a local Pacific Bell  operator instead of punching zero twice to reach an AT&amp;T operator.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Southern California, Al Harmon, owner of Aljo Fabric Protection  Inc. of Van Nuys, said he was frustrated in a daylong effort to reach his  distributor in Vacaville to tell him about an emergency that threatens a  $16,000 to $18,000 fabric-protection contract with a Sacramento hotel.  </P> <P> "My manufacturer has shorted me on some product, and I'm afraid we're going to  lose the job, unless my distributor tells the customer that we're going to be a  week or 10 days going in," Harmon said.  </P> <P> He started telephoning his Vacaville distributor at 6:30 a.m. Monday and  continued throughout the day without success, Harmon said.  </P> <P> "I'm not outraged, but, Lord, this is my business. All of it is done on the  telephone . . . I'm going to stay on it until I'm beat or I succeed."  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported that a number of heavy users of toll-free lines  experienced problems.  </P> <P> Cindy Sheffield, phone systems manager for the Marriott hotels reservation  office in Omaha, said the problem was "devastating" for her office because it  wasn't receiving calls from prospective customers.  </P> <P> The office received only 10% of its normal call volume after the problem began,  she said.  </P> <P> Fidelity Investments said callers had trouble getting through to the  Boston-based mutual fund operator. "It did have quite extensive impact," said  spokeswoman Tracy Gordon.  </P> <P> American Airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill in Ft. Worth said that after 11:30  a.m. PST, the carrier experienced about two-thirds fewer calls than normal on  its reservation lines.  </P> <P> Trans Mid-America, a marketing company in Omaha, specializing in temporary  motor vehicle license sales, could not make any long distance or 800-number  calls, said Florence Waymire, a vice president of the company.  </P> <P> "We're dead in the water here today," she said. The company has inbound and  outbound telemarketing services, which "totally shuts us down."  </P> <P> The problem did not affect the nation's other major long distance carriers, MCI  Communications Corp. and US Sprint.  </P> <P> Staff writer John Kendall contributed to this story from Los Angeles and Danny  Sullivan contributed from Orange County.  </P></p>

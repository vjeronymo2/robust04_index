			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium chief sees bridge to prosperity More than 200,000 bridges in the US are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. If aluminium was specified in only one-third of all bridge repair or replacement projects, at least an extra 400m lb a year of the metal would be required. Mr Richard Holder, chairman of Reynolds Metals, the world's third largest aluminium company, gave these statistics yesterday in an upbeat presentation about potential future demand for the material. He suggested that the infrastructure market offered the industry tremendous potential because many countries were faced with crumbling bridges and highways, leaking water and sewer lines and ageing mass transit facilities. Meanwhile, many developing countries were now creating infrastructure systems. Speaking at Alumitech 94 in Atlanta, the biggest exhibition and conference about aluminium ever organised by the industry, Mr Holder also predicted that the use of aluminium in North American cars would grow by another two-thirds by the year 2000. Having risen by 23 per cent last year to 210lb on average per car, it was expected to rise to 350lb by the end of the decade. 'That projection may even be conservative because it does not count on a lot of body sheet applications which are looking more abundant by the day,' he added. Mr Holder said there were tremendous prospects for aluminium beverage cans outside the US, a country where the metal now had 98 per cent of the market and where shipments this year would total more than 100bn cans for the first time. 'Within the next 25 years, the aluminium beverage can will have as great a presence within Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe as it has today in the US,' he said. Reynolds predicted a 65 per cent growth in the global aluminium beverage can market by the year 2000. Alumitech, sponsored by the US Aluminium Association, is designed to provide a forum for exchanges of information on the most important technical, environmental and market place issues facing the industry and has attracted visitors from 30 countries to hear 120 speakers at 50 discussion sessions. It takes place, as Mr Holder pointed out, when the aluminium industry is turning a corner from the most difficult four years in its history.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There are efforts to arrange a meeting between  President 'Ezer Weizman and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar', both of whom are due to arrive in South Africa today  to attend Nelson Mandela's inauguration ceremony as president.    The Syrians have shown interest in a meeting, but have not  made any commitment. President Weizman, who leaves for  Johannesburg this morning by Air Force plane, will meet with a  number of political figures, including PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat,  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, U.S. Vice President Al  Gore, and perhaps Jordan's King Husayn, during his visit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Feb (PL) -- Today's editorial of the  weekly TRABAJADORES stressed Cuban workers have to accomplish  efficiency, economy, and effectiveness to be able to improve the  country's economic situation,    The publication of the Cuban Workers Federation writes the  country's main economic problem can be resolved with more  production but that, contrary to previous years, it now has to  be accomplished with low costs, meaning less spending.    As the new Workers Parliament Assemblies (approximately  80,000 meetings in which workers study ways to reduce expenses,  increase income, achieve profitability, and mend finances) are  being held, the editorial writes, the workers who attend them  learn about terms such as efficiency, economy, and effectiveness.    The editorial encourages workers not to look for  macroeconomic solutions to national problems at those meetings,  rather, to concentrate on the internal problems of each center,  because this will allow for the reinstatement of the centers'  productive capabilities and the achievement of optimal  development.    "We need to produce more of everything with current  resources  to be able to produce the many products we lack," the article  writes, adding it is vital for workers to concentrate on how to  reduce costs, to take advantage of production potentials, to  make the best use of raw materials, and to obtain quality  products and services."    It is a matter of achieving economy, efficiency, and  effectiveness in all business and budgeted activities, be it in  the production of products or in services, it adds.    The Workers Parliament Assemblies are enhancing the  country's  true potential to overcome the severe economic crisis that  developed after the downfall of the socialist bloc and the  intensification of the U.S. blockade, the editorial stresses.    After attending those assemblies, Cubans know the  significance of budgets, costs, subsidies, profitability,  excessive circulation, income, expenses, prices, taxes, losses,  and profits to the island's future. Thus, the assemblies are an  excellent education mechanism for the union movement, it  comments.    The Cuban economy is showing a growing gap between the  monetary liquidity in the hands of the population and the offer  of goods and services, and that is why we need to decrease  substantially the budget deficit, the editorial emphasizes.</p>

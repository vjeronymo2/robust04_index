			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.959&blank;Unusable Fuel Supply <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.959 requires that the unusable fuel supply for each tank be established and states certain parameters for establishing the unusable supply. The current text of &sect;23.959 would be redesignated as paragraph (a); a proposed new paragraph (b) would require that the effect of any fuel pump failure on the unusable fuel supply also be established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been industry practice to include in the Airplane Flight Manual an entry describing any additional unusable fuel quantity that results from a fuel pump failure. This proposal would not require any change in the fuel quantity indicator marking required by &sect;23.1553. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.963&blank;Fuel Tanks: General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.963(b), which requires that each flexible fuel tank liner must be of an acceptable kind, would be revised by replacing the phrase ``must be of an acceptable kind'' with the phrase ``must be shown to be suitable for the particular application.'' The word ``acceptable'' is inexact since all components of a type certificated airplane must be acceptable. This is a clarifying, nonsubstantive change. Also the reference to &sect;23.959 would be revised by changing it to &sect;23.959(a) to coincide with the proposed revision of &sect;23.959 discussed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.965&blank;Fuel Tank Tests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section &sect;23.965(b)(3)(i) would be revised by changing the phrase ``the test frequency of vibration cycles per minute is obtained by&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' to ``the test frequency of vibration is the number of cycles per minute obtained by&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''. This would clarify that it is the number of cycles per minute that is to be used during testing of a fuel tank. The frequency of vibration to be used during testing of a fuel tank on a non-propeller driven airplane has received differing interpretations during certification procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.973&blank;Fuel Tank Filler Connection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.973(f) specifies a minimum diameter of the fuel filler opening for airplanes with turbine engines that are not equipped with pressure fueling systems. The proposed paragraph (f) would remove the provision related to pressure fueling systems to make the regulation apply to all airplanes with turbine engines, including turbine engines that are equipped with pressure fueling systems. The need to restrict the fuel opening diameter on the top side of the fuel tank is not related to a function of whether or not the airplane is equipped with pressure refueling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.975&blank;Fuel Tank Vents and Carburetor Vents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current 23.975(a)(5), as amended in Amendment 23&hyph;43, requires that there be no undrainable points in any vent lines where moisture can accumulate and that any drain lines installed in the vent lines must discharge clear of that airplane and be accessible for drainage. This paragraph would be revised to clarify that there may be no points in any vent line where moisture can accumulate unless drainage is provided. The intent is to allow low spots in the fuel tank vent system if a drain is provided for each low spot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.979&blank;Pressure Fueling System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.979(b) would be revised to add a requirement for commuter category airplanes that an automatic shutoff means must provide indication at each fueling station of failure of the shutoff means to stop fuel flow at the maximum level. This revision makes the commuter category automatic shutoff means requirements similar to the requirements for transport category airplanes in &sect;25.979. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1001&blank;Fuel Jettisoning System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise &sect;23.1001(b)(2) to redefine the speed at which the fuel jettisoning system tests should be conducted. In a separate notice, as identified in the background section of this document, the FAA determined that the best rate-of-climb speed no longer need be determined under part 23, and has proposed that it be eliminated from &sect;23.69(b). Accordingly, this proposal would redefine the climb speed as stated in &sect;23.1001(b)(2) to reference &sect;23.69(b) as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1013&blank;Oil Tanks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would delete the word ``crankcase'' in &sect;23.1013(d)(1), making this paragraph applicable to all engine installations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1041&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1041 under the cooling heading requires that powerplant and auxiliary power unit cooling provisions must maintain the temperature of powerplant components and engine fluids within the limits established for those components and fluids to the maximum altitude for which approval is requested. This section would be revised to state ``to the maximum altitude and maximum ambient atmospheric temperature conditions for which approval is requested.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it has been the practice to correct the cooling temperatures to 100  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F ambient temperature. In practice, turbine engine powered airplanes have been corrected to the maximum temperature for which approval is requested. The standard would be revised to require all airplanes, regardless of engine type, to demonstrate adequate cooling at one maximum ambient atmosphere temperature for which approval is requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1043&blank;Cooling Tests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1043(a)(3) would be revised to shown that the minimum grade fuel requirement applies to both turbine and reciprocating engines and that the lean mixture requirement applies to reciprocating engines only. The introductory text of paragraph (a) would be simplified by deleting the requirement that compliance must be shown ``under critical ground, water, and flight operating conditions to the maximum altitude for which approval is requested.'' This requirement is already contained in &sect;23.1041. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

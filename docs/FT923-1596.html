			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather hits Canadian harvest UNUSUALLY wet and cool weather has seriously delayed Canada's prairie grain harvest and is expected to affect both the volume and quality of this year's crop. Farmers in Alberta suffered a summer snowfall last month, and frost has already hit most other parts of the prairies. Scientists blame the freak weather, which has given many parts of Canada east of the Rockies their wettest and coolest summer in a century, on dust spewed into the atmosphere by last year's eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines. Mr Ken Budzak, crop analyst at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, said the province's farmers had harvested only 8 per cent of their crop by the end of last week. In a normal season, close to 80 per cent would be in the bins by mid-September. Mr Budzak estimated that harvesting would take another month or so. An official at Manitoba Pool Elevators said the wheat harvest in that province had ranged between zero and 45 per cent so far. He added that 'very little' oilseed, rape and flax had been taken in. Analysts stress that it is still too early to assess fully the weather's impact on yields and quality. While some damage has undoubtedly been done, it appears that fears of a disaster after the late-August snowfall were exaggerated. 'We're not in a position where we have to panic yet,' Mr Budzak said. But he added that estimates of the size of the crop 'keep dropping every day'. Mr Budzak expects Saskatchewan's crop of six main grains and oilseeds to be somewhere below 20m tonnes, down from earlier estimates of 20.9m tonnes. The Alberta Wheat Pool's most recent estimate of the total harvest in that province is 14.7m tonnes, compared with a 10-year average of 15.4m. But the final figure is expected to be somewhat lower. The late harvest will not necessarily do further damage, provided that rain does not germinate crops.</p>

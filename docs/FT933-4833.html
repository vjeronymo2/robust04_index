			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer: Southern suitor Competition between five US southern states to get a new Mercedes-Benz plant with a price tag of some Dollars 300m is warming up, but Governor Zell Miller of Georgia may have stolen a march on his rivals by going to Stuttgart today. Miller would naturally love to have both the plant and the 1,500 jobs that are likely to come with it. But his devotion to the cause has an extra dimension; he has just announced his intention to run for re-election next year. What better way of starting his campaign than by winning a foreign investment plum like Mercedes? In the past Miller has opposed offering financial incentives to investors in Georgia, unlike the other suitors for Mercedes' hand - North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama. In 1992 South Carolina persuaded BMW to site a new factory there; incentives such as land, tax-breaks and worker training, worth some Dollars 100m, are thought to have considerably helped its cause. But Miller may be able to call upon powers other than the purely financial. He is after all very close to President Bill Clinton, and he made a key speech to the Democratic convention which nominated Clinton. Moreover, Mercedes-Benz may never know when it needs a friend in the White House, particularly in these troubled times for the world's automobile business. Miller should learn later this month whether his powers of persuasion have been successful.</p>

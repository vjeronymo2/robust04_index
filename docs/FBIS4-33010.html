			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- At a luncheon with  entrepreneurs from Brasilia and its satellite towns, Workers  Party [PT] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said  that some people should fear his electoral victory. These  people are tax evaders, speculators, corrupt people, and large  estate owners who have unproductive land.    He sent a message to speculators, warning them to be  careful.  He promised: "Speculators will have to invest their money in  productive areas of the economy." Lula said that the current  problem is that the government pretends to have a fiscal policy,  and people pretend to pay taxes. "These people cheat everybody,  and no one thinks about Brazil."    The PT candidate said that the country does not need big  laws, but big accords. "If we have clear rules, agreed upon by  the parties involved, we will be able to establish rules that  will allow Brazil to grow." Lula remembers that one can only  govern by ensuring credibility among social protagonists,  workers, entrepreneurs, and government officials. Lula promised  to implement the country's first agrarian reform and to end  corruption.</p>

			<p>Inspections   <F P=102>   SK2004051494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0436 GMT 20 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> SK2004051494 </F> <F P=104>  Pyongyang KCNA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [``DPRK Foreign Ministry Warns the U.S. and IAEA Not To </F> Resort To Pressure''--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in  a memorandum today warns that if the United States and the  secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency continue  to resort to the unreasonable pressure campaign, the nuclear  issue will remain unresolved indefinitely and it will only  entail irretrievable consequences jeopardizing peace and  security in Asia and the rest of the world.    The memorandum was published in connection with the fact  that  the United States and its satellite forces have resorted to the  one-track course of pressure by enjoining fullscope inspections  on the DPRK with disregard to the unique status of the DPRK  which has temporarily suspended the effectuation of its declared  withdrawal from the treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons (NPT). It throws a revealing light on the major  obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue and the truth  behind them.    It says that although the United States and the secretariat  of the IAEA recognized the DPRK's unique status following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced  withdrawal from the NPT, they are still talking about the  ``noncompliance with the safeguards agreement'' and ``full  inspection.'' ``Such action clearly shows that they are using  the safeguards agreement as a leverage for attaining their  dishonest political objectives of strangling the DPRK's  system,'' it notes.    Pointing out that the inspection activities that befit the  DPRK's current unique status are only the inspection activities  necessary for maintaining the continuity of safeguards, it  declares: ``How long the DPRK's unique status will last depends  entirely on when the United States renounces its nuclear threat  against the DPRK and its policy of antagonizing and strangling  it and, at the same time, when the agency redresses its  partiality and injustice to the DPRK.''    The memorandum further says:    ``The DPRK's unique status would naturally terminate if  further round of DPRK-USA talks take place and the simultaneous  action steps are carried into practice with a view to resolving  the nuclear issue once and for all on the principle of the  proposed package solution.''    It notes that the IAEA secretariat and the United Nations  Security Council, both in support of the U.S. policy of  antagonising and strangling the DPRK, are openly applying their  extremely discriminatory and prejudiced double standards to the  DPRK's ``nuclear issue.''    ``Unless the United States renounces its policy of hostility  and nuclear threat campaign against the DPRK and unless the IAEA  secretariat redresses its partiality and injustice to the DPRK,  the DPRK's reinstatement in the treaty will remain absolutely  inconceivable and, therefore, full implementation of the  safeguards agreement will have no sense of word at the present  stage,'' states the memorandum, and continues:    ``The DPRK sincerely wants the nuclear issue to be resolved  impartially. To this end, the United States and the IAEA  secretariat must clearly realise their responsibility for the  origination of the nuclear issue and for its current complexity,  stop resorting to the unreasonable and contradictory method of  double standards and pressure, and must seek unprejudiced and  substantial ways to resolve the nuclear issue once and for all.''</p>

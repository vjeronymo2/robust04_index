			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Norweb leads recs with move to listing in US Norweb today becomes the first UK regional electricity company to have its shares listed in the US. The Manchester-based utility has obtained a listing for American Depositary Receipts on Nasdaq, the over-the-counter market. The company said it had the largest proportion of shares in US hands of any rec - about 5 per cent - and the move would provide greater liquidity for American shareholders. The initial marketmakers will be Smith New Court and Lehman Brothers. The listing also reflects Norweb's strategy of raising its profile in the US, where earlier this year it took a 50 per cent stake in a gas-fired power project in Virginia. The company has an active policy of overseas expansion, particularly in countries with a well developed regulatory framework and a stable and mature political, economic and legal environment. Norweb is also among those recs which have defined a specific dividend policy. It aims to deliver annual real increases of 6 to 8 per cent up to 2000. Analysts thought it unlikely that there would be a rush of other recs seeking a US listing. The cash-rich electricity distributors have no need to tap foreign capital mar-kets. Indeed, many of them - including Norweb - are in the process of buying back up to 10 per cent of their shares. Few have business interests or large numbers of shareholders in the US market. However, Norweb's move could pave the way for a listing by the National Grid company, which is owned by the recs and likely to be sold off next year.</p>

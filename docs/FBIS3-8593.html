The RILINDJA commentary says that this action is indicative  of the FYROM decision to eliminate the Albanian language from  the mass media.    In keeping with this policy, the Macedonian police recently  confiscated 200 copies of SHKENDIA magazine published in Kosova  at the border point between Kosova and the FYROM, in the  vicinity of Jazhice. The confiscation was explained by saying  that the educational nature of the magazine made it subject to  censorship. According to the chief of the customs house, this  magazine "must be read" before its sale can be permitted.</p>

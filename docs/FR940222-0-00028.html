The final rule also removes the requirement for physician supervision and referral for certified marriage and family therapists; requires all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment in full; ensures that the relationship of certified marriage and family therapists is consistent with other mental health practitioners with comparable education and training; protects the CHAMPUS beneficiary from incurring added out-of-pocket costs for care rendered that is not part of the current CHAMPUS mental health benefits package; and better defines the specific requirements of existing CHAMPUS policies for coverage and reimbursement of services of teaching physicians and physicians in training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This part is effective February 22, 1994.

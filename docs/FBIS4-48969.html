			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by unidentified XINHUA reporter] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- After the major case  involving robbery, arson, and murder on Qiandao Lake was  cracked, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  [ARATS] sent letters to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation  [SEF] twice, on 20 and 23 April, inviting the latter to send  personnel to Hangzhou. These personnel will be accompanied by  relevant experts who will give briefings on specific situations  pertaining to the case and answer questions. We have now found  out from Taiwan media reports that relevant Taiwan authorities  have been adopting an attitude of procrastination regarding the  ARATS invitation. People hold that the Taiwan side has been  urging the Zhejiang side to make public the truth about the case  after it occurred. Now that the case has been solved, we are  willing to give a face-to-face briefing on details of the case  and answer questions -- in addition to having the ARATS provide  the details -- but the Taiwan side has intentionally been  procrastinating by not coming, and that is definitely not a wise  move.    According to the ARATS, replies sent to it by the SEF on 21  and 24 April noted that the SEF is willing to "positively  consider" the ARATS invitation, but they also said that before  the SEF decides on the time of arrival in Hangzhou and the list  of experts who will accompany the trip, the mainland side will  have to first provide information on how the crime occurred, an  autopsy report, a report on the crime site, relevant exhibits,  and answers to questions raised by the Taiwan side about  doubtful points on the case.    People have observed that a large number of items mentioned  in the SEF replies appear to be preconditions for the SEF's  coming to Hangzhou. Despite having paid close attention to  details concerning the case and having indicated that it will  show understanding toward feelings of the victims' families, the  Taiwan side has set up preconditions on its coming to Hangzhou  to directly understand the case and hear answers from relevant  experts. What is particularly noteworthy is that the SEF has  repeatedly asked for "relevant exhibits" and other such  materials used in handling the case. Exhibits of a crime are  used by public security departments and judicial organs when  handling cases and passing sentences. It is hard to understand  why the Taiwan side is requesting such exhibits. Actually, ever  since the incident occurred, the ARATS has continually informed  the SEF about progress made in solving the case. Mainland media  have also made numerous reports on the incident. Most of the  materials requested by the SEF in its replies have already been  given to the Taiwan side, and some information can be obtained  directly by coming to the mainland. Why does the SEF hesitate  to move forward?    People around here believe that the Qiandao Lake case has  invoked grave concern from compatriots on both sides of the  Taiwan Strait. The death of 32 compatriots has caused deep pain  among the people. We have finally solved the case now, and the  murderers will not escape the net of justice. To show its  sincerity and dispel misunderstanding, the mainland side has  repeatedly invited the Taiwan side to send people over to hear  briefings on the case. Its attitude is open and aboveboard, and  shows that it is seeking truth from facts. However, what merits  our attention is that a small number of Taiwan people who harbor  ulterior motives have politicized the criminal case. These  people, who lack interest in information about the case, which  is followed closely by Taiwan compatriots and media circles on  the island, are only fond of spreading continuously the  so-called "questionable points" and attacking the mainland for  "concealing" the truth. They are actually trying to continue  fanning hostility and poison the cross-straits atmosphere in an  attempt to pull back relations across the Taiwan Strait. This  matter gives much food for thought for compatriots across the  strait, the large number of overseas Chinese, and countrymen  residing abroad, who are all concerned about the development of  cross-straits relations.</p>

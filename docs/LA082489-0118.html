			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANCE WALKING TIGHTROPE BETWEEN LEBANON FACTIONS  </P> <P> The French government is walking a political tightrope between Lebanese  Christians who think a French naval force off Lebanon is their military  salvation and pro-Syrian Lebanese militias who see it as an invasion fleet.  </P> <P> For the second time in three days, French President Francois Mitterrand  insisted Wednesday that the eight warships, including the aircraft carrier  Foch, are being sent into Lebanese waters as part of a "rescue mission,"  concerned primarily with 7,000 French citizens living in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "Some pretend to confuse the rescue mission with a military action," Mitterrand  told members of the Cabinet. "Others wrongly think the French navy is at their  disposal. No country or group has the right to dictate what France should do as  far as Lebanon is concerned."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cartoonists' Field Day  </P> <P> Political analysts and cartoonists have been having a field day with the  government's ambiguous intentions. A cartoon in the newspaper Le Monde shows  Mitterrand talking to a pilot in a French warplane heavily armed with missiles  and bombs. "Try not to look too mean," he tells the pilot.  </P> <P> The main purpose of Mitterrand's statements, made Wednesday in Paris and  earlier in Spain, apparently is to project a position of neutrality between the  Christian and pro-Syrian Muslim forces.  </P> <P> When Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who is on an extended trip to the South  Pacific, suggested that the French ships might be used to take military action  if necessary, Mitterrand, in Madrid, quickly shot back:  </P> <P> "I reject the idea that we can act militarily with ships fulfilling a  humanitarian mission."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ordered to Lebanon  </P> <P> The French naval operation began Aug. 15 when the frigate Duquesne, armed with  missiles, was ordered to the Lebanese coast. The Duquesne and two other ships  are said to have arrived and were expected to be joined soon by the carrier  Foch, which is capable of carrying 40 aircraft, and four other ships.  </P> <P> The differing views of what France expects to achieve has put Rocard's  Socialist government in a delicate position. But Mitterrand so far has heard  little serious criticism.  </P> <P> France has a long history of intervention in Lebanon, which it ruled as a  League of Nations protectorate until 1943. Lebanese political interests,  particularly on the French-speaking Christian side, run deep in France;  Lebanese businessmen are active and generous contributors to political parties.  </P> <P> "The naval mission is justified and appropriate," said center-right opposition  leader Didier Bariani, who is the mayor of one of the districts of Paris.  "Effective help is the most effective method in a place where some want to  commit genocide."  </P> <P> In their background briefings, French officials contend that their main purpose  in mounting the mission to Lebanon is to "wake up" the rest of the world,  including the United States, to the problems in Lebanon.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 18 January carries the program  "Approaching Elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The  program features platforms presented by the Democratic Party of  Ukraine [Demokratychna Partiya Ukrayiny] and the People's  Movement of Ukraine [Narodnyy Rukh Ukrayiny], also known as  Rukh. The announcer says each party has been given a 10-minute  slot on this evening's program during which each party can  presents its views.    The Democratic Party of Ukraine begins its slot with a brief  video recording. Party chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy then  takes the floor in the TV studio, naming some party members, and  saying that the Democratic Party was born not out of its  leaders' ambitions but out of a reality of building a Ukrainian  state. According to sociological polls, Yavorivskyy says, the  party occupies first place in Ukraine. He says his party is not  looking for enemies, preferring to use the word "opponents."    Yavorivskyy says people are fed up with the statutes and  programs of different parties. The Democratic Party is not  looking for someone to blame, he says, but for a way out of the  complex situation that has arisen. He says the main cause of  the current difficulties was that nothing was done with reforms  after independence. A reform of the authorities, he says,  should have been the first step after independence. But the  same weak and irresolute authorities remain, he says.    Yavorivsky favors the law proposed at today's conference of  local representatives. In accordance with the law, elections  would be held for local leaders who would then bear  responsibility for their actions. He goes on to say that the  issue of reducing the army should be resolved wisely, adding  that servicemen cannot just be thrown onto the street. He  proposes that those leaving the army voluntarily could be given  a double privatization package and that construction detachments  be formed to speedily build accommodation for them.    But the main thing is economic reforms, Yavorivskyy says. He  and his party are against shock therapy, because people are  already exhausted. It is necessary, however, to advance toward  reform. He adds he is convinced people are ready for economic  reforms. He says society has been polarized into rich and poor,  and that a middle class should be created.    The Democratic Party's slot finishes with another brief  video  recording.    The entire Rukh slot is taken up by a video recording  featuring Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil. Chornovil starts by  saying he believes viewers are fed up with traditional election  broadcasts from the studio, finding it hard to tell the  difference between the programs of various parties and having  little faith in them either. He believes the reason for it all  is to show that Ukraine has a multi-party system. But this is  not so, he says, because of the anti-party nature of the law.  If there were a proportional or mixed electoral system, he  says, it would be different -- fewer parties and one clear  winner, which would assume full responsibility for what occurs  in Ukraine.    He goes on to say Rukh stands for fundamental political  reforms. He mentions today's conference of local  representatives, adding that the main elements of the draft law  discussed at the conference have been taken from Rukh's program:  elections of leaders at all levels, eliminating the post of  presidential representative, the president being head of state  and not head of the government, with all branches of power being  clearly delimited. He goes on to say that the judicial system  needs to be reformed because it is deeply corrupt, turning a  blind eye to the deeds of the Communist nomenclature. It is  necessary, he says, to bring order to the country's finances and  put an end to the bedlam. If this were done, pensioners,  disabled people, and mothers with many children could be paid  twice as much, he says. Reforms should begin immediately.    Chornovil refutes the accusation that democrats conducting  reforms have put the country in the situation it is in now,  saying democrats have not been in power to do so. Ukraine is  traditionally an agricultural state, he says, and therefore it  is necessary to start with agrarian reforms. But as the  nomenclature has acquired land illegally, it is necessary to  return what has been acquired illegally so that conditions are  equal before beginning extensive privatization. Rukh pays  special attention in its program to social protection. He says  the Communists pose as the greatest protectors of the people,  but it is they who brought about the situation in the first  place.    Rukh is for assistance directed to where it is most needed,  Chornovil says, but it's not for everyone. If privatization and  land reform are conducted, Rukh proposes to carry out monetary  reform with the introduction of the hryvna. But if the hryvna  were to be introduced now, it would share the same fate as the  coupon and be dead within a few months. It is necessary to  demonopolize extensively, he says. Then there will be true  market prices, considerably lower ones than now.    Chornovil concludes by saying Rukh is the greatest political  force in Ukraine today. If the viewers support it and it gets  at least 25 percent of the seats in parliament, then other  reformist forces there could unite around the basis of this  foundation and a government of national confidence could be  formed. He asks viewers to vote for Rukh candidates, adding "we  won't let you down."</p>

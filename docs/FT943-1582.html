			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Model for international total quality award Sir, The message in Alan Mitchell's article (Management: The Growing Business, September 20) is absolutely right - the quality assurance system BS EN ISO 9000 is a small component of total quality and not the whole answer. He reports on various ways of trying to add total quality to quality assurance . . . but how cumbersome and confusing these ways sound] What is needed is an internationally endorsed, systematic approach to total quality, and this now exists. It is the model used in the new UK Quality Award. Strongly supported by the British Quality Foundation and the European Quality Foundation, the model is endorsed by the Department of Trade and Industry and government generally. The prime minister, John Major, will be presenting the first awards to UK companies using the model in November. What is more, the model is designed to be used by organisations of all types, sectors and sizes, and can be adopted on a self-help basis, without the need for expensive advice. We work with voluntary sector organisations and often recommend that they use this model. Interestingly, some large private sector organisations are now wondering how they can offer help to voluntary organisations working on quality. The principles can be the same regardless of sector and size, and such help can show the private sector organisation's commitment and expertise to good advantage.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India today denounced Pakistan for its reported  rejection of New Delhi's six proposals on resolving bilateral  issues. In response to a query, the External Affairs Ministry  spokesman said in New Delhi today that though India has not yet  received any formal response, it has the Pakistan Foreign  secretary's statement in the press rejecting the proposals. He  said if it is true, it is the final proof that there is no truth  in Pakistan's claim that it only provides moral, diplomatic and  political support to separatists and terrorists in Kashmir. He  said Islamabad's refusal to discuss the proposals and the  confidence-building measures gives a lie to their claim that  they are not supporting terrorists on Indian soil. On the other  hand, it has acknowledged that it will continue to send  infiltrators and mercenaries in Kashmir to support terrorist  activities.    The spokesman said if Pakistan genuinely wanted peace and  dialogue, then there should be no objection to the proposals  which also included a draft agreement on maintaining peace and  tranquility on the Line of Control.</p>

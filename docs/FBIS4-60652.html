			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister,  affirmed that his current tour of several Arab countries aims at  stopping the war. He pointed out that this war brings losses  not only to Yemen but to all Arab countries.    In a press statement in Cairo today, Mr. al-'Attas said that  consultations and deliberations are taking place on the issue of  recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. This step  has been imposed by the war which was launched on the south by  the Sanaa rulers. Al-'Attas added that we demand a halt to this  war and withdrawal of the forces to their positions before 22  May 1990. Then dialogue could begin on all matters which concern  Yemen and how to tackle various issues, either the traces of the  war or the future of Yemen.    Mr. al-'Attas refuted that elements in the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] had carried out mediation independently from the YSP  leadership. He pointed out that there were national elements,  with Mujahid Abu-Shawarib [deputy prime minister for internal  affairs] among them, who earlier conducted consultations with  several personalities outside the homeland. When some ideas  began to evolve, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih dissuaded these  personalities from continuing their efforts.    Mr. al-'Attas welcomed any Yemeni or Arab efforts. He added  that he preferred to submit the Yemeni cause to the UN Security  Council and he affirmed that the Security Council can assist in  stopping the war.</p>

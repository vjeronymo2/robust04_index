			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Two officers of Saddam's intelligence service  have been killed in central Baghdad. Sources opposed to the  Ba'thist regime said unknown persons assassinated the two  officers late last week and that security forces rushed to the  scene, cut off all roads leading to it, and launched a search of  the public in shops and other places nearby.    The sources added that Saddam's security agencies arrested  several citizens and took them to unknown locations. [passage  omitted]</p>

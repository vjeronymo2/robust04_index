			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Brussels talks on aid for N-safety OFFICIALS from 24 western industrialised nations are meeting in Brussels today and tomorrow to work out a co-ordinated system of nuclear safety assistance to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Senior officials and nuclear experts from OECD countries aim to co-ordinate their bilateral aid programmes, following the failure of the G7 summit in Munich last July to agree a Dollars 800m (Pounds 406m) multilateral programme to pay for short-term safety work on the region's 25 most dangerous reactors. These are in Russia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The bilateral assistance announced so far amounts to about Dollars 300m  - with about 90 per cent of that coming from the EC. Most of the EC aid so far has been paid for work in Bulgaria. The meeting is not expected to provide much more money but is intended to ensure that existing funds are spent more effectively.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further fall as base rate hopes recede INTEREST rate optimism was firmly discouraged yesterday both by the Bundesbank and by the UK chancellor of the exchequer. The setback in the UK stock market deepened in the face of a fresh sell-off in stock index futures. A fall of 24.2 points took the FT-SE Index down to 2,726.5, virtually the day's low and around 2.3 per cent below the peak achieved only ten days ago. Yesterday's setback ranged across the full range of the market, bringing a fall of 6.9 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. Share prices tried to rally from a dull start but soon turned back again as first reports reached London from the Bundesbank's press conference; unchanged German rates, plus a warning from the Bundesbank president that there was no room for a rate cut at present, undermined lingering hopes for a reduction in UK base rates before the year-end. Worse was to come, however, when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, ruled out any early cut in base rates, although, reviewing the first of the Treasury's monthly monetary reports, he saw encouraging signs for the domestic economy. The premium on the December contract on the Footsie melted away, leaving the contract in line with the cash market at the official close. With the two-week equity trading account due to close tonight, professional traders were looking for ways to take their profits. In addition, there were many large 'bed and breakfast' tax-related deals. Seaq-reported trading volume, swollen by the tax-related business and by a trading programme towards the close, totalled 711.7m shares compared with 660.5m on Wednesday. Retail, or customer business in equities, was worth Pounds 1.28bn on Wednesday but traders believe that equity volume is being swollen significantly at present by the year-end tax-related deals. While few strategists had remained convinced that a further base rate cut would come this year, yesterday's discouraging news from Germany and the UK took some of the speculative steam out of the equity market. The stock market has risen by around 16 per cent on the Footsie scale since Britain quit the ERM in mid-September and a pause for consolidation has been expected. Corporate developments also remained bleak yesterday, with Guinness, the international drinks group, again hit as City analysts digested the outcome of the meetings with the board arranged this week. The renewed weakness in sterling, mirrored yesterday by half point losses in UK government bonds, prompted some strategists to take a more cautious line. Mr Peter Lyon at Smith New Court, the London securities trading house, commented that, while the market's underlying uptrend is still in place, the risks of a correction have strengthened. At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Mr Mark Brown repeated the widespread concern that UK institutions will be obliged to commit more cash flow to government bonds next year and could therefore be net sellers of equities. However, selling pressure in equities was not heavy enough to cause concern. After allowing for the end-year technical activity, traders believe that the institutions are still positive towards the UK stock market and are doing little more than make minor adjustments to portfolios ahead of 1992.</p>

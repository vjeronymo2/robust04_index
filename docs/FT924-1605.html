			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Santa rises in the east - The commercial exploitation of Christmas has arrived in the former communist countries of Europe, much to the delight of entrepreneurs and consumers alike There may be little economic cause for seasonal cheer in much of central Europe this year. That, however, has not deterred the new entrepreneurs in the region from embracing the commercial possibilities of Christmas. The appearance of oranges, bananas and the occasional forbidden fruit from the western consumer culture symbolised Christmas under communist rule. But with much of the central European retail sector having been privatised in the past few years, this season's festive symbols come straight out of western marketing textbooks. Santa Claus, that most potent western symbol for gift-giving, is finding the region fertile ground. Polish Santa Clauses pose for pictures on Warsaw streets where Solidarity demonstrators used to confront the communist government while their Hungarian counterparts peddle Sony televisions and videos in TV advertisements. The density of store and public decorations confirms the spread of Christmas consciousness among retailers and consumers alike, although the motive for their use is not entirely commercial. In Romania's bleak capital, Bucharest, about 60 per cent of the stores in the city's two main shopping streets boast some decoration. But many are old and have been brought from home by employees, partly out of tradition but mostly to relieve the gloom. That contrasts sharply with shops in Budapest, which are using fewer but higher quality decorations than last year, according to Dekorgraf, a company which designs and installs seasonal bunting in shops. In Poland, marketing companies such as Multi-Investment, set up in 1989 by American Jacques Tourel, have used decorations as a way of stretching the holiday buying period. The company donated a 22-metre high Christmas tree that stands in the middle of Warsaw's Old Town square outside the Royal Castle. The tree went up on November 22 as a signal that the shopping season had begun, a tactic that appears to have been successful as many shops quickly followed with their own decorations. 'We want shopping to be a pleasure and not a last-minute duty, all done in a rush,' explained Ivona Kochanska from Multi-Investment. The Christmas decorations in Wenceslas Square in Prague are dwarfed by advertisements for big western brand names, a development of which many residents approve. 'It shows Prague as a world city. It is like Piccadilly Circus in London,' said a 26-year-old bank official without a hint of overstatement. 'It is much more colourful than it was before, and now it is possible to buy all the goods.' An informal survey by FT correspondents suggests that the novelty of western goods has yet to wear off, even if they remain beyond the reach of many consumers. Petr Trybil of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce says: 'People seem to be buying more western goods, especially electronics which are expensive but not excessively so. I believe the reason is quality and, of course, the fact that they were not available until recently. But quality is becoming more important and there is a lesson there for us.' Eva Ruzekova, who runs a small, specialised Prague gift store, believes the high prices of western goods are mistakenly seen as a mark of quality. But she concedes that 'they are practical and attractive and everybody would like one for Christmas.' An advertising executive said: 'Western companies and Czechoslovak entrepreneurs are tapping into the perception of the country as a relatively wealthy place with a history of a market economy behind it.' 'It is not too difficult to sell a product here.' Western goods also remain popular in Hungary where Philips, for example, has launched a Christmas competition with its electrical products as prizes. But some of the big retailers have adopted western marketing methods to sell local products. Centrum Department Stores, the Hungarian state-owned general retailer, has given prominence to the products being promoted and has brought out its first glossy Christmas brochure. Skala, Centrum's main rival, hired the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency which created a cartoon character, the 'Skala angel', for the chain's Christmas television spots. Its efforts seem to have paid off: the chain's customers are spending 10 per cent more in real terms than last year, reversing a long decline. Both retailers benefit from the Hungarian tradition of buying a television set, video recorder, washing machine or other expensive consumer durable to coincide with Christmas and provide a gift to be shared by all the family. At Warsaw's Kidi Land, a small-scale version of Hamley's toy shop in London, sales are up 50 per cent this year over 1991. Its windows feature two displays of hand painted dolls from B. Altman's in Manhattan while, inside, the staff sport Father Christmas garb. Polish television ads promote gifts for both children and adults, with Lego  -a runaway success in Poland - and the Swiss Swatch watches featured prominently. In Czechoslovakia, workers received their Christmas pay packets at the end of last week and sales in December are running 25 per cent ahead of previous months, according to Lubomir Staffen, commercial director of Kotva, a large Prague department store. This year for the first time, Kotva has devoted a separate section within the store to Christmas gift ideas, including magnificent glass and giftware. 'We have special departments offering western haute couture and luxury goods,' Staffen says. 'The market is there, and we want to tap it. But we must remember that most of our customers are ordinary people whose spending power has not increased at all in the last five years.' The biggest sellers throughout central Europe this year have been small consumer goods, such as do-it-yourself equipment and electronics, products that are also perennial favourites in the west. But the choice of some Christmas gifts might surprise western retailers. In Hungary, gifts of deodorant - among other cosmetics - are persistently popular. It is no reflection on Hungarian hygiene, rather a hangover from communist times when vanity products were in short supply. And what of central Europe's Santa Clauses? Do they think there is a future in western-style commercialism? One somewhat cold Santa who stands by the Multi-Investment tree in Warsaw and who lets parties of school children have their picture taken with him for 15,000 zloty a time, thinks he has found a niche. 'I'm a poser. That's what I do - I pose for pictures,' he said. When the Christmas season ends he simply plans to don other costumes.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Leading Article: The Bank looks up The Bank of England's Quarterly Inflation Report was introduced to give British monetary policy greater 'openness and accountability'. Judging by the City's recent confusions, many are still trying to work out what that entails. But as far as the Bank is concerned, the latest answer is that interest rates will have to rise in the months ahead if the government's inflation target is to be met. Bank-watchers should not be surprised that it declines to say when. Once again, the Bank has been caught out by the slow pace of price increases since its last report was published three months ago. Instead of rising slightly in the second quarter of 1994, as predicted, the government's target measure of inflation remained broadly stable. However, as the Bank never tires of pointing out, the more relevant prediction is that for two years hence, since that is roughly how long it takes for interest rate changes to take effect. As in May, the report predicts that if interest rates remain unchanged, inflation will then be 3 - 3 1/2 per cent, above the government's 1 - 2 1/2 per cent target range for the end of the current parliament. Before long, therefore, interest rates will have to rise. As the Bank observes, inflationary pressures could be well developed even while the actual inflation rate continued to fall. 'It is possible', it somewhat coyly remarks, 'though not yet certain, that the UK is entering this phase.' Such turning points are notoriously hard to judge, but the Bank yesterday doubled the number of inflation 'risks' which it thinks worth worrying about. Output growth In addition to the three dangers identified in May - excessive money growth, inflation expectations, and labour cost increases - movements in commodity prices and company profit margins may also feed into the inflation rate in the coming months. Finally, there is a chance that the current growth rate of output is taking the British economy closer to its current potential level than was previously estimated. Cynics might suggest that the unexpectedly good behaviour of the variables highlighted in May has left the Bank searching for other reasons to recommend a rate increase before the end of the year. Indeed, only one, the growth of narrow money, is currently a cause for concern. This grew at an annual rate of 6.5 per cent in July. Although the rate of increase has subsided somewhat in recent months, it still lies well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring range. Cash balances may still be adjusting to lower interest rates, though the Bank may not find this explanation convincing for very much longer. Still, growth of the broader measure of the money supply, M4, was a subdued 5.2 per cent for the six months to June, well within its 3-9 per cent monitoring range. And, as the report admits, neither expectations of inflation nor the underlying growth of average earnings have deteriorated since May. Interest rates Underlying growth in average earnings has stabilised in recent months at 3 3/4 per cent. Expectations of inflation, as measured by survey data and bond market expectations, are much the same as they were three months ago, albeit higher than the government would like. Is the speculation that interest rates will rise overdone? In order to make the alternative judgment - that interest rates should not be raised over the next few months - one has to believe one of two things. Either price pressures entering the fifth year of a recovery will be lower than currently predicted, or the government should not act to deliver on its target. Clearly, neither is a judgment the Bank is prepared to make. Thanks to innovations such as the Quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank's reputation and influence has grown during this recovery, almost as steadily as the economy itself. But with monetary policy still ultimately determined by the chancellor, it will take more than two years of non-inflationary growth for the new regime to establish its credibility. A pre-emptive rate rise in the coming months, before higher inflation has had a chance to get established, offers the best strategy for sustaining both.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POWER GLITCH HALTS TRADING ON NYSE  </P> <P> The New York Stock Exchange halted trading for more than 90 minutes this  morning because of a power disruption that knocked out the computer system at  the nation's largest stock market.  </P> <P> The disruption shut down the exchange at 9:41 a.m., 11 minutes into the start  of its session.  </P> <P> NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said the problem was identified and corrected  before 10:30 a.m., but trading didn't resume until 11:15 a.m.  </P> <P> "As a rule I don't see any real damage (to the market)," said Richard Meyer,  managing director of institutional trading at Ladenburg Thalmann. "It was not  that big of a deal. It was a quiet day and this just made it a forced  quietness."  </P> <P> Traders said the problem was with the exchange's "Dot" computer, which executes  small orders. "They have a backup system that evidently is not working," one  trader said.  </P></p>

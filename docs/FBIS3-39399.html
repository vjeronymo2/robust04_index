			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said the National  Council unanimously suggested that the Greek Cypriot side should  attend the proximity talks beginning on 17 February. Kliridhis  was speaking after a lengthy National Council meeting today to  discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue and the  confidence-building measures [CBM's].    The president said there were some differences in views and  that some people suggested disengagement from the CBM's while  others said we should discuss them but on the basis of some  principles. Answering questions, Kliridhis said that when he  attends the talks, his goal will be to discuss those points that  the UN secretary general refers to as the basic points in his  set of ideas. He said he expects Butrus-Ghali to announce these  points tonight.    DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said we are  now facing decisive developments for the future of the country,  so our side must move carefully. On the handling of the  discussion of the Cyprus issue, Matsis said there has been a  noteworthy change with the European Union observer's  intervention and presence at the talks. He continued: We  believe that the observer's reports, as his orders say, should  be in line with European law. Matsis added that DISI is  determined to support the president during this decisive course  for the Cyprus issue so as to hold talks in the most effective  manner.    AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary  General Dhimitrios Khristofias said that when the president  decided to participate in the proximity talks he should have  manipulated the discussion to include the substance of the  Cyprus issue. Khristofias said that AKEL has no intention of  covering up the faits accomplis created by the president, adding  that AKEL interprets any reference to the substance of the  Cyprus issue as a return to discussing Butrus-Ghali's ideas.    DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou reiterated  that he considers the CBM's as unacceptable and very dangerous.  He said: We are afraid that if the CBM's are implemented they  will form the basis of an overall Cyprus solution. He added  that the measures solve the illegal regime's problems and  therefore Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side have no reason to  pursue a reasonable Cyprus solution. The DIKO chairman said  disengagement from the measures is necessary, adding that his  party made suggestions on how the president should handle the  issue.    Socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus]  Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said he pointed out ways to disengage  from the measures, adding that all the prerequisites exist for a  return to discussing the substance of the Cyprus issue. He said  he believes the contrasting views expressed in the National  Council strengthen the president's negotiating position.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk changes strategy Novo Nordisk, the Danish healthcare products and industrial enzymes producer, yesterday announced changes in its business strategy, saying that it would focus its efforts on fewer business areas and seek partnerships to develop business areas which are not its core businesses. 'We must position ourselves in a few selected areas where we know we can stay ahead,' said Mr Mads Ovlisen, the group's chief executive. He said the group faced large investments in plant over the next few years and was seeking to build capacity as efficiently as possible. The changes were announced after a disappointing year for Novo Nordisk, which reported a fall in profits after nine months to DKr934m (Dollars 151m) compared with DKr1bn in the same period in 1993. The group's main healthcare production is in insulin and other diabetic care products, of which it is one of the world's two leading suppliers together with Eli Lily of the US. Its other main division is industrial enzymes. Both these areas will remain core business areas. 'After months of analysis we have concluded that there will be continued growth in diabetics care and we want to remain strong in this area,' said Mr Ovlisen. Hormone replacement therapy (female health products) and human growth hormone will remain core business areas, but blood products and central nervous system therapy products will be downgraded. The groups said the health care division's research and development was being centralised as a separate division in order to improve utilisation of resources.</p>

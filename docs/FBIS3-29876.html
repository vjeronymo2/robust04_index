			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] South Korea authorized 622 contacts between its  people and North Koreans for business purposes over the past  four years, according to official figures. But only 168  contacts, or 27 percent of those approved, took place as the  others did not due to lack of their preparations or refusal by  North Koreans to meet.    One hundred and eleven contacts were made in China, mostly  in  Beijing and Shenyang, 33 in Hong Kong, 15 in Japan and nine in  other countries, the National Unification Board [NUB] said in  its "White Paper on Unification" released yesterday.    The ratio of actual contacts to total authorized  applications  declined from 39 percent in 1990 and 1991, 27 percent in 1992  and 21 percent last year, apparently in line with the growing  tensions between the two halves of the peninsula.    As far as the number of applications was concerned, small  and  medium industrialists were more inclined to inter-Korean  contacts. A total of 516 applications came from small and medium  companies and 137 from large ones.    Since the enactment of the Law on South-North Exchange and  Cooperation in 1990 through last year-end, the NUB said, 419  South Korean businessmen met with North Koreans in the 168 cases.    They were part of the 3,088 South Koreans who made contacts  with North Koreans in 838 cases on various occasions such as  academic forums, family reunions and business during the period.    Those who visited the other side of their fatherland  numbered  1,270 on 38 occasions, largely consisting of the several rounds  of prime ministers' talks, each attended by a total of 100  negotiators, support personnel and newsmen.    Economic cooperation, which started in October 1988 with the  capitalist South lifting its trade embargo in the wake of the  successful hosting of the Seoul Olympic Games, cooled later in  1992 when Seoul linked it with the nuclear issue.    Businessmen here expect that inter-Korean economic ties  would  resume soon after the one-year impasse over the North's nuclear  development plan is broken.    As Seoul is likely to give the green light to entrepreneurs  seeking to conduct trade with the North, the private sector is  vigorously moving to gear up for more business relations with  the communist state.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> LONGER NORTH JURY HOURS ORDERED  </P> <P> The judge in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial said today he ordered longer  working days and shorter lunches for the jury deciding the fired White House  aide's fate.  </P> <P> "I felt there was time being wasted in the sense that when they came in in the  morning they were not starting as early as they could have," Judge Gerhard A.  Gesell said at a hearing to answer attorneys' questions. "I simply told a  marshal to get them in here by 9 and not to take them home before 5."  </P> <P> Gesell refused a prosecution request to intervene to see what was taking jury  members so long to reach a decision. The panel deliberated for an 11th day  today.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: NBA BLEW CHANCE TO RAISE STANDARD  </P> <P> He died last week in Mozambique, Gabriel Estavo Mondjane did. He tripped and  fell in his back yard, hitting his head on a concrete patio.  </P> <P> During all the customary commotion of Super Bowl week, I did not get a day free  to comment on Mondjane's death, which was hardly a proper way to see off a  giant of our times. Now that football season is officially over and basketball  season is back on my mind, however, I have been giving a great deal of thought  to the big guy.  </P> <P> Gabriel was 8 feet 3/4 inches tall.  </P> <P> Talk about your power forwards. There isn't a lineup in the NBA that couldn't  have used Mondjane. He could have gone up to Manute Bol and called him  "Shorty." He would have had to duck to dunk.  </P> <P> This is one dude who wouldn't have needed a pump in his sneakers. Gabe could  have won the opening tipoff barefoot. Teammates could have run give-and-go  plays between his knees. He could have become the first player in history to  bump his head on the overhead scoreboard.  </P> <P> He was 45 years old when he went, younger than Wilt, who still believes he can  play, and not much older than Kareem, who was playing as recently as June.  </P> <P> Oh, if only Jerry West or some other sharp NBA general manager had taken the  time to go see the big fella in his hometown of Maputo. For the price of  round-trip air fare to Mozambique, some team could have had the center of its  dreams.  </P> <P> David Robinson? Hah! That little squirt? Big Gabe had more than 12 inches on  that puny San Antonio Spur.  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing? Small potatoes. Put him at point guard. If the Knicks had  bothered scouting Gabriel Mondjane, they could have been reading about him on  the back page of the New York Post by now. He'd be the second-biggest center in  town, after the World Trade.  </P> <P> Manute Bol? Everybody makes such a fuss over him, merely because he's 7-feet-6,  or 7-7, whatever. What's that compared to an authentic 8-footer? Mondjane could  have guarded Bol with one hand and adjusted the 24-second clock with the other.  </P> <P> Alas, I guess the big guy never did play basketball. According to his obituary,  he weighed 392 pounds and used to work in a Portuguese circus. He was billed as  "the Giant of Mondjacaze," after his birthplace in the province of Gaza. As  nicknames go, it wasn't exactly "the Human Highlight Film" or "the Round Mound  of Rebound," but pro basketball reporters would have come up with something  better eventually.  </P> <P> Upon his death, the Guinness Book of Records confirmed him as the world's  tallest man. The tallest man ever was one Robert Wadlow of Alton, Ill., who  died in 1940. He stood 8-11.  </P> <P> Recently, I have spoken to several NBA general managers, all of whom agreed  that, yes, they could probably use a good 8-11 man.  </P> <P> I have to believe that if Gabriel Estavo Mondjane had been approached by  somebody, he definitely could have been a lottery pick.  </P> <P> Steadily over the last couple of decades, we have seen the growth of  professional basketball, in more ways than one. When Chamberlain came along, he  was colossal. Then came Abdul-Jabbar, who was even more so.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar led to Tom Burleson, who stood 7-4. Next in line was our old  friend, Chuck Nevitt, who was 7-5. Then came Bol, tallest of them all. We  ushered in an era in which 6-9 Magic Johnson was a playmaking guard and 7-4  Ralph Sampson was somebody's forward. The word tall was redefined, right before  our eyes.  </P> <P> A census earlier this season revealed that the NBA had 40 players 7 feet or  taller. There was talk of raising the hoop, widening the floor, raising the  roof. Referees are getting bloody noses, merely trying to toss up the opening  jump ball. Centers are going onto the disabled list with vertigo.  </P> <P> Coaches, bawling out a player, start screaming: "Sit down while I talk to you!"  </P> <P> "I am sitting," the player says.  </P> <P> By the time he retires, an Abdul-Jabbar is a pipsqueak. At old arenas like  Boston Garden or Chicago Stadium, nozzles of the locker-room showers are aimed  at the players' kneecaps. Beds in hotels are so inadequate, players keep waking  up with their feet in the minibar.  </P> <P> By the turn of the century, who knows how big our basketball players will be?  There's a baseball pitcher now, Randy Johnson of Seattle, who stands 6-10.  Someday, he is going to go into his delivery and kick some batter in the chops.  </P> <P> Too bad about Gabe Mondjane, who would have been the biggest thing in sports.  </P> <P> People would have come for miles to see him dunk a free throw.  </P></p>

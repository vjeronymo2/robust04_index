			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Japanese motor output down 14%: February figures continue 17-month decline Japan's motor industry output fell 14.1 per cent in February against the same period last year, the 17th consecutive monthly fall. The industry's performance underlines the depth of Japan's recession. Production of cars, trucks and buses fell to 896,000 units, the sixth month the decline has been in double digits, and a post-war record. Japanese car manufacturers have been badly hit by the strength of the yen, which has contributed to a 24 per cent fall in exports. Domestic demand fell 6.2 per cent to 519,000 units. Passenger car production fell 14.5 per cent compared with the same month last year, the 11th month output has declined. Production of trucks fell 13 per cent to 214,000 units, the 31st month that output has decreased. Toyota's vehicle production fell 12.3 per cent during February to 279,500 units; Nissan's dropped 13.4 per cent to 143,000; Mitsubishi's 10.3 per cent to 111,700; Mazda's 16.8 per cent to 92,000 and Honda's was down 14.6 per cent at 92,800. Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday agreed to a parliamentary schedule that will allow bills for a large income tax cut to be enacted next week, Reuter adds. The tax bills must be passed by March 31, the last day of the current fiscal year, or they expire automatically. The Y6,000bn (Dollars 56.6bn) tax cut is one of the pillars in Mr Hosokawa's package of anti-recession measures which were announced last month.</p>

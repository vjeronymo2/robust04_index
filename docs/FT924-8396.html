			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: T&amp;N Marrying piston and piston ring manufacturers is clearly a growing business. Carmakers look increasingly to component suppliers to spread the load of development costs and the supply of whole assemblies certainly helps. From that point of view, putting T&amp;N's piston expertise together with Goetze's ring manufacturing makes sense. It should help get T&amp;N products specified for German manufacturers such as VW, where the company has had little luck in the past. However, the timing of the deal is more questionable. T&amp;N's management is buying into Germany at a time when the economy, and particularly the car market, is turning down. True, Goetze has plenty of business outside Germany, but the whole European car industry will remain weak throughout 1993. So it is not yet clear that T&amp;N is buying when German assets are at their cheapest. Even if that is the case, the deal means a further cash outflow. Granted, the staged nature of the payments lessens its impact, but the company has in recent years spent heavily on acquisitions, research and capital expenditure and is currently paying an uncovered dividend. Interestingly, that dividend is up for consideration in the spring at the same time as the first payment is due to be made. T&amp;N has left the door open for a placing to fund the first stage. If the dividend is maintained and prospects are good it could get the issue away easily. Yet if poor earnings force a cut, the company would find the placing difficult just when it most needed it.</p>

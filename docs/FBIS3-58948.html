			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eckart Spoo: "Kinkel Comes Out in Clear Support </F> of Europe"]    [Text] Hannover, 23 Jan -- At the Free Democratic Party  [FDP] meeting of federal representatives to prepare for the  European elections, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel discussed the  reservations against the process of European unification that  were voiced by Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber, of  the Christian Social Union [CSU], and of former FDP official  Manfred Brunner He warned against the assumption that "we  could be saved again by pursuing a special national course."  The federal foreign minister emphasized that there was "no  contradiction" between the national interests of German and  European integration. On the contrary, the unifying Europe was  "the right place to enforce vital German interests," Kinkel  said. In Europe and even beyond Europe Germany is dependent on  open competition. "Only that way can our economy fully use its  strength," Kinkel explained.    The foreign minister said that another reason why Germany  needs Europe was that "due to our past, the world is watching us  closely." He argued that without Europe reconstruction and  prosperity would not have been possible after 1945. Now Germany  must safeguard this prosperity together with Europe. Kinkel  emphasized: "The European Union accounts for 1.3 percent of the  surface of the earth, 6 percent of its population, but 22  percent of the international product. There is not much one  could add to that."    It is essential, therefore, to conclude the Economic and  Monetary Union. Kinkel stressed, however, that the joint  European currency must be as stable as the German mark -- "or we  will not have one."    At its meeting of representatives, the FDP agreed on the  principles of its European policy, calling for more  privatization, flexibility, and a fundamental reform of the  social and tax system to make Germany more attractive as a  European center for production and investment. To make sure  that the European Union is accepted by the people it is  inevitable that the community has a social dimension, though it  must be developed "carefully." The establishment of levels for  social benefits must not go beyond minimum standards. The less  developed member states must be "given a chance to develop their  social systems in accordance with their economic possibilities."  The FDP principles also plead for a "reduction of  over-regulation" in European environmental policy.    The FDP representatives nominated Bundestag deputy Uta  Wuerfel as their leading candidate for the European elections,  while Mechthild von Alemann came second.</p>

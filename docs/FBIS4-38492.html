			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Russian Pan-National Union, State  Duma deputy Sergey Baburin, has said that his movement has no  intention of supporting Russia's former vice-president,  Aleksandr Rutskoy, in the forthcoming presidential elections.    Addressing the residents of Novosibirsk on Tuesday, Baburin  said: "Rutskoy is the leader of Russia's nationalist movement  only in the pages of the press." According to him, in the wake  of last October's events Rutskoy displayed his unsuitability as  a political leader and strategist.    Baburin came to Novosibirsk to inaugurate a branch of his  movement on Monday. According to him, this is the 50th  affiliation to the Russian Pan-National Union. "The  establishment of a mass of regional branches across Russia is  linked first of all with our preparations for the upcoming  presidential elections," he stressed.    During the election campaign his movement, Baburin added,  will be ready to cooperate with all patriotic-minded  organizations, except the Liberal Democratic Party. With  reference to the possible candidacy to be backed by the Union  and by other nationalist organizations he said that it has not  yet been determined.    In comments on developments in and around the Crimea Baburin  told Interfax that Russia must give the Crimea military aid by  sending troops there. According to him, the deployment of  Russian troops alone will induce Ukraine to "lower its ambitions  toward the people of the Crimea and induce the Ukrainian  government to enter into negotiations on the situation on the  peninsula."</p>

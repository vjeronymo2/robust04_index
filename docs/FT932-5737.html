			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Excavator that ploughs a lonely furrow - JC Bamford maps out its strategy to improve profitability THERE WERE raised eyebrows at the Chelsea Flower Show last week when a hitherto unknown plant species, skidsteerloaderus britanicus, was found nestling coyly among the more conventional flora. The challenge to horticultural orthodoxy was mounted by JC Bamford Excavators, Britain's biggest construction equipment company and no shrinking violet when it comes to publicity. It was all because a new bright yellow rose, Mr JCB, was being named in honour of Mr Joe Bamford, the company's 76-year-old founder. However, Mr Bamford's son, Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of the Staffordshire-based group since 1975, is currently more concerned with growing profits than plants. In an interview with the Financial Times at the Samoter construction equipment show in Verona, the JCB chief mapped out the company's future strategy, revealed how he wanted to improve JCB's profitability, and let slip a few numbers from the privately-held company's accounts. The past three years have been tough for JCB, one of the UK's most widely admired engineering companies. Sir Anthony said the maker of backhoe loaders, telescopic handlers and other earthmoving and agricultural equipment had seen profits fall from a peak of nearly Pounds 50m in 1988 to a group net figure of Pounds 9m last year, on a decline in sales from Pounds 450m to Pounds 350m. However, unlike the majority of its larger and smaller rivals, debt-free JCB has stayed profitable - even while its sales volumes have dropped from a rate of 20,000 units a year in 1988 to 9,000 units last year. New products, a big programme to reduce break-even levels and strong sales in Europe - until recently - have offset a recession of unprecedented length and severity in the UK market. Sir Anthony says he is not happy with last year's profits. 'We should be making Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m, even at current levels of demand.' On a conservative forecast he believes JCB could double profits this year - due not only to new products and lower break-evens, but also to a recent reorganisation that has put the main equipment lines into three additional product-related profit centres. 'We needed it to make it much clearer throughout the company that it was necessary to make a profit,' says Sir Anthony. And that is despite the weakness in continental markets which is worrying the industry just as glimmers of hope are emerging in the UK. 'France is at a dead stop, Italy has just come to a halt too, and Spain is in a terribly bad way. The German market is about to fall off, but growth in eastern Germany is still continuing,' says Sir Anthony. The reorganisation should allow JCB to speed up further its product development programme. But Sir Anthony signalled that the company was entering a consolidation period, concentrating on developing its existing products after a spurt of new ones over the past two years. 'We've used the recession as a time to bring new products out,' he says. 'It shows you're not demoralised, and it's something new to go to customers with.' The new products include the Fastrac high-mobility vehicle - launched in 1991 and aimed at farmers - and JCB's crawler excavator range - produced at Uttoxeter by a joint venture with Japan's Sumitomo Construction Machinery. However, the star new product is looking like the JCB Robot skid-steer loader, launched this spring and designed with a single boom to allow the driver in and out through a side door. 'The acceptance has been fantastic, and we can't keep up with demand,' enthuses Sir Anthony. 'The safety features mean customers have to be interested.' Already, JCB is coming under pressure from its sales subsidiaries to step up production. Even in Italy, where sales of larger machines have come to a virtual standstill because of the corruption scandals and the curbs on public spending, JCB's sales subsidiary is planning to sell 180 this year. The Sumitomo joint venture was a way for JCB to replace its outdated range of crawler excavators, and the venture is now producing prototypes for a wheeled excavator due to be launched next year. However, Sir Anthony does not believe the UK company will need to make further such ventures - either because JCB's products are already competitive or because the UK company can fix them itself. The main priority is to broaden and improve JCB's wheeled loader range, seen both within and outside the company as a poor relation. 'We've got to become a European force in wheeled loaders,' says Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive, noting that Germany accounts for about half the market. Sir Anthony's target is to make JCB Europe's biggest construction equipment group - it already is in unit terms, but its European sales are a long way behind Brussels-based VME and Caterpillar of the US, which make a lot more larger machines. Whatever the chances of JCB ever achieving this, Sir Anthony makes two things clear. First, JCB has no intention of going public. 'Being private is very important,' he says. 'It has enabled us to plough our own furrow through the good and the bad times and not be swallowed up.' It's not just a question of the time saved in not having to talk to analysts, says Sir Anthony. 'All our capital investment would be looked at in a different light if we were a public company.' JCB would have to justify policies which the City would inevitably criticise. Against the trend in the industry, for example, JCB makes most of its own axles and gearboxes. This makes good commercial sense, says Mr Coyne. 'It gives us an extra area where we can have an edge over our rivals, and sales to outside customers are rising.' Secondly, Sir Anthony is sticking to a growth strategy that has achieved success without making acquisitions, apart from one in 1968. 'We're not speculative, it's going to be boring old organic growth,' he says.</p>

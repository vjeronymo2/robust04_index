			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of six UN/OAS civilian mission observers in  charge of monitoring respect of human rights had to turn around  and depart on 29 April following a hostile demonstration [words  indistinct] in the town of Le Borgne in the north of Haiti, UN  spokesman in Haiti Eric Falt told AFP on 1 May. The mission had  come to investigate the situation in this region, 50 km west of  Cap-Haitien and 260 km from the capital, where Army units led an  operation over the past weekend against (?a group of) presumed  armed partisans of President Aristide, according to Haitian  military officials.    Before their departure, the observers were able to converse  for 10 minutes with the local populace and had a very animated  but courteous 45-minute discussion with a special military  delegation from Port-au-Prince, headed by an unidentified  high-ranking officer. They were not allowed to enter the town,  however, and remained at the Le Bourgne military outpost, the  diplomat explained.    [Words indistinct] refused to make any assessment of the  situation in this area, pointing out that a communique will be  published by the civilian mission in the next few days. A group  of U.S. journalists was obliged to hurriedly leave the area,  before the observers did, in the face of a similar but much more  aggressive demonstration, Falt said.    On the other hand, other observers were able to go without  incident to Gonaives, 152 km northwest of Port-au-Prince, where  28 persons were allegedly killed on 22 April by soldiers in the  slum neighborhood of Raboteau. According to Eric Falt's  announcement on 1 May, a communique from the civilian mission  should be published in that regard on 2 May in Port-au-Prince.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> HARVESTING LIMITS ON CHEMICALS;  </P> <P> FARMERS ARE LIMITING THEIR USE OF PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS TO PROTECT THE  ENVIRONMENT -- AND THEIR HEALTH.  </P> <P> It's planting time again in the grain belt, but this season, many farmers like  Ron Salge are sowing a revolution of sorts into the soil along with the seed  corn and soybeans.  </P> <P> Salge has reduced his use of commercial fertilizer by about 25%. He's also  gotten stingy with weed-killers, laying them out in narrow strips rather than  in broad mists that often blew up his nose and made him nauseous with what  folks in Butler County sarcastically call "springtime flu."  </P> <P> Nearby in Shell Rock, Jeff Reints has decided not to pre-treat any of his corn  fields with man-made fertilizer this year. Up the road in Greene, Mike Ruby  plans to limit herbicide use to 20 of the 360 acres he's planting.  </P> <P> "I've been in this county 18 years and I'm amazed at how much more conservation  concerns there are today," said Dale Thoreson, the state's agricultural  extension agent for Butler County. "These people have to make a living off the  land and they have to drink the water that's under it. They don't want to screw  it up any more."  </P> <P> In growing numbers, farmers are struggling to wean themselves of a slavish  reliance on the very miracle chemicals and synthetic nutrients that made  post-war American agriculture the envy of the world.  </P> <P> "Farmers are increasingly aware of the health risk," said Marty Strange,  director of the Center for Rural Affairs, a Nebraska think tank. ". . . there  are a lot of farmers out there that know they're on the front line in terms of  exposure, and the more we learn about these things the less we like them."  </P> <P> Urged on by some of the same experts and officials who for decades championed  the use of chemicals as a panacea, many growers are rediscovering the promise  of largely abandoned practices, such as crop rotation and manure spreading,  that once were as basic to farm life as rain and sunlight. At the same time,  sophisticated new soil testing and pest control techniques have helped to  refine low-chemical farming.  </P> <P> It is a movement that should not be confused with organic farming, although  advocates of both practices share concerns. Few growers in these parts are  likely to go cold turkey, but many of them are beginning to tinker with ways of  reducing their heavy dependence on chemicals without seriously jeopardizing  yields.  </P> <P> An example: Laying a precautionary "plow-down" of nitrogen fertilizer before  planting has been a springtime ritual for Ruby and most other farmers. This  year, Ruby skipped the plow-down on all but a handful of acres. Instead, he  will periodically test his soil. When tests show that a particular field needs  a shot of nutrient, it will be fed on an "as-needed" basis. That should slice  about $2,500 off Ruby's usual fertilizer bill, he estimates.  </P> <P> To outsiders, such a notion might seem prudent and obvious, but for years it  has been a tough sell. "A lot of guys figured that if 100 pounds of fertilizer  was good, then 200 pounds was better," said Salge. "That's why we've got the  ground water problems we have."  </P> <P> Here in Iowa, the concept of "sustainable" or "low-input" agriculture is  strongly backed by both the state agriculture department and Iowa State  University, which has one of the nation's most respected agriculture schools.  Both have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into experiments and  demonstration projects. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also has a program.  </P> <P> "Agriculture has been sold a bill of goods by science and those who produce and  sell these products," state Agriculture Secretary Dale Cochran said. "You don't  see resistance to this any more. You don't see people saying you're crazy. Over  a period of four or five years, I think we're going to see most all Iowa  farmers practicing some form of sustainable agriculture."  </P> <P> Indeed, not too many years ago, the farm establishment by and large considered  followers of such unconventional practices to be kooks or radicals. No more.  </P> <P> At Iowa State, in Ames, a recent opinion survey found that 78% of Iowa farmers  questioned said they believed that modern agriculture was too dependent on  insecticides and herbicides; 60% of them said they had refrained from using a  farm chemical they believed was too dangerous, and nearly as many said they had  used chemicals that they thought had somehow affected their health.  </P> <P> The wariness has filtered into the political arena. One Democrat running for  governor of Iowa recently called for a special tax on farm chemicals to  discourage their use. And one of his opponents urged an outright ban. Not long  ago, voicing such ideas in a Midwestern farm state would have been political  suicide.  </P> <P> "Whether chemicals are safe or not may still be an open question," said Paul  Lasley, a rural sociologist at Iowa State University. "But a significant number  of producers perceive them to be dangerous, and they're acting on their  perception."  </P> <P> In the rural Midwest, where fads and social causes have always taken a back  seat to hard-nosed pragmatism, the movement seems to be accelerating for two  reasons:  </P> <P> Some producers have discovered that they can earn more money even with slightly  smaller crops if they spend less for pesticides and fertilizers. And there is a  gnawing fear among farmers that the products used to poison bugs and weeds may  inadvertently wind up poisoning their families as well.  </P> <P> "Down at the elevator in Allison the other day, a guy said he spilled just a  little insecticide on his skin and started getting the shakes," said Salge, who  raises hogs along with corn and soybeans on his 720-acre spread. "That's  scary."  </P> <P> Due to sudden demand, operators of that grain elevator in Allison, the Butler  County seat, have for the first time this year begun to stock protective  clothing, hats, goggles and gloves.  </P> <P> More worrisome than accidents, however, are the long-term dangers posed by such  products as they leach through the soil and into wells, creeks and streams that  are tapped both for farm use and city drinking water.  </P> <P> Recent studies have raised serious questions. Near Madison, Wis., half the  wells tested last year in rural Dane County contained low levels of atrazine,  the most widely used corn herbicide in the country. It is suspected of causing  cancer in sufficient concentrations.  </P> <P> Similarly, the Army Corps of Engineers found atrazine contamination approaching  the recommended maximum safe levels in three major reservoirs in Kansas that  supply drinking water to as many as 500,000 people. Iowa state tests have found  detectable, although not necessarily dangerous, levels of farm chemicals in  wells and streams that provide drinking water to perhaps 40% of the state's  population.  </P> <P> When it comes to surface water, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  regards agriculture as the most broad-based source of pollution. Tests  conducted last year by the U.S. Geological Survey served only to reinforce that  indictment. The agency sampled water from 150 rivers and streams in 10  Midwestern states over several months. Low, but detectable, levels of atrazine  were found in 90% of the samples taken in March and April, before planting  began. Other farm chemicals also were present in many samples.  </P> <P> By late spring, after most fields had been planted, treated with chemicals and  flushed by rains, the proportion of tainted samples had risen to 98%. Median  concentrations of atrazine were measured at three times the federally  recommended safe limit for drinking water. In the fall, about 76% of the water  samples contained atrazine, although in less threatening amounts.  </P> <P> "Until recently, people thought these compounds just degraded," said Dan  Goolsby, a USGS water quality specialist based in Denver. "We're finding some  of them don't degrade, or are degrading far slower than we thought."  </P> <P> Alarmed by such discoveries, both the state of Iowa and, later, the federal  government, clamped restrictions on the use of atrazine earlier this year.  </P> <P> Defenders of the farm chemical industry acknowledge that it has a growing image  problem. Still, they insist that many of the doubts about safety are overblown,  and they say that an anti-chemical fad could endanger the nation's food supply.  </P> <P> For one thing, said Ron Phillips of the Washington-based Fertilizer Institute,  chemicals have enabled agriculture to maintain high production levels even as  the number of farmers has dropped precipitously. Many of today's farmers  supplement their incomes by holding down jobs off the land. Since low-chemical  agriculture is more time-consuming, there simply may not be enough manpower in  rural areas to make it work on a large scale, Phillips said.  </P> <P> "This idea that farmers can reduce their use of commercial fertilizers and  still remain profitable and productive is ridiculous," he said.  </P> <P> Dick Fawcett, a private soil consultant in Iowa, said the methodology used for  testing the quality of well water in Iowa may have exaggerated the  contamination problem. Many wells appeared to be tainted by pesticides  primarily because they were adjacent to spots where farmers had mixed chemicals  or washed out spraying equipment, Fawcett said. Simply moving the sampling  sites would lower the readings, he insisted.  </P> <P> Switching from chemical fertilizers to manure and other so-called natural ones  also could have its drawbacks, Fawcett warned. If not properly managed, manure  can leave even higher levels of potentially carcinogenic nitrates in the soil  than artificial fertilizers do, he said.  </P> <P> "It's great that farmers are coming around to using the least (chemicals) that  they have to," Fawcett said. "The only concern I have is that we don't start  substituting other technologies that are worse than what we have."  </P> <P> With some reservations, leading farm chemical dealers in Iowa agreed that their  business is due for an upheaval, and they said they are preparing to adjust  rather than fight it. Dan Frieberg, executive vice president of the Iowa  Fertilizer and Chemical Assn., a retailer's group, said sales of nitrogen  fertilizer dropped 10% to 12% in Iowa last year, even while the acreage planted  in corn was increased 10%.  </P> <P> To compensate for a continuing decline in sales, many dealers said they will  begin marketing services, such as soil fertility testing and scouting for pest  infestations, Frieberg said. "If service is 15% of our business now, it'll be  possibly 40% by the turn of the century," he predicted.  </P> <P> If such trends continued they would mark a dramatic turnabout in the history of  American agriculture. In simpler times, the typical Midwestern farm may have  raised corn, oats, milo, soybeans, wheat and several other crops. Many farmers  also raised cows, pigs and chickens in the barnyard. Animal droppings were used  to fertilize the fields. Rotating crops and letting fields lie fallow every few  years were tried and true natural methods of recharging the soil and keeping  pests to a minimum.  </P> <P> Then, after World War II, came the "green revolution" that ushered in an era of  specialized farming. New, man-made fertilizers and pesticides, as well as  improved crop strains, made possible huge increases in yields. Pesticide use  soared 170% between 1964 and 1982, and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer spread  on fields quadrupled between 1960 and 1981, according to the USDA.  </P> <P> Thanks to chemicals, farmers no longer had to rotate crops or haul manure. Many  of them began to plant the same crops in the same fields year after year. Some  dropped out of livestock production altogether. Government policies encouraged  these developments.  </P> <P> According to a lengthy report released last year by the National Research  Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, federal policies actually  penalize farmers who adopt conservation methods or try to reduce pesticide  applications.  </P> <P> For example, the council explained, crop rotation is a good way to fix nitrogen  in the soil naturally, curb erosion and reduce the need for chemical  safeguards. Yet price support formulas are written so that farmers who do  rotate crops get smaller subsidies than those who don't, the council charged.  </P> <P> Several measures designed to correct this pro-chemical bias are being  considered in Congress as legislation that will dictate federal agriculture  policy through 1995 is debated. Under consideration are proposals to grant more  money for research into low-input agriculture as well as training in  chemical-free farming methods for all county extension agents in the nation.  </P> <P> While the move away from chemicals is only beginning to catch on in a big way,  it has long had a small corps of pioneers. Gary Young, president of the  Sustainable Agriculture Society of Nebraska, gave up on chemicals 20 years ago,  after he sprayed a corn field to kill cut worms and ended up in the hospital.  </P> <P> "I was planting one day and I started getting stomach cramps and felt dizzy and  I didn't know if I was going to make it back to the house," said Young, who  lives in McLean, Neb. "Since I quit, I've never gotten sick like that again. I  just walked away from using all chemicals. I just figured it was either that or  die." Young insists that his production and profits over the years have been as  good or better than his neighbors'.  </P> <P> Few farmers are willing to go as far as Young did, however, and there remains  considerable resistance to sweeping change. Tom Smidt, who coordinates a pilot  crop management program in Butler County, said that most of the farmers he sees  are merely experimenting with reducing their applications of fertilizers and  pesticides, trying to determine the most efficient levels.  </P> <P> "In a lot of cases you can have your cake and eat it too," Smidt said. "If you  can get the same yields with less fertilizer, you're making more profit and  there's less pressure on the environment."  </P> <P> Ruby, the Butler County farmer, agreed.  </P> <P> "We've all got to come to the realization that we couldn't work without  chemicals and fertilizers and still farm. . .but it's something we can't abuse  or overuse."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: WHOOPI GOLDBERG EYES 'LETTICE AND LOVAGE,' VICE VERSA  </P> <P> HOW ABOUT this for creative casting? Whoopi Goldberg is said to be meeting with  the distinguished British playwright Peter Shaffer (he wrote "Amadeus," for  instance). They will talk about Whoopi's playing what is called "the Margaret  Tysack role" in the movie version of the Shaffer comedy "Lettice and Lovage."  Whoopi, who was dead in the water for a minute there, is now speed-boating  along on the raging success of her psychic self in the hit film "Ghost." It has  already been noted here that an Academy Award nomination is in order for the  Whoop.  </P> <P> Of course, on Broadway -- just as on the London stage -- Margaret Tysack has  had a total personal triumph acting as the exacting bureaucrat who chastises  the eccentric and delightful fantasist Maggie Smith in this drama. But when it  comes to the movie of same -- someone like Whoopi may whoop up the box office.  </P> <P> ONE OF the nicest guys in show biz -- Barry Manilow -- has signed a long-term  publishing agreement with BMG Music, the worldwide company of the Bertlesmann  Music Group. Manilow produced and directed his own live stage production,  "Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana," which opened recently at Caesars Atlantic  City. His Christmas album, "Because It's Christmas," on Arista, will be  released this fall. The title track is said to be an "instant classic."  </P> <P> BMG also acquired Barry's catalogue of songs.  </P> <P> OH, HOW the naughty have fallen department. This month, you'll only find me  once in all of Spy magazine -- in one of their "Separated at Birth" bits where  Sam Kinison and Liz are twins. How flattering. I do love the way Sam does "our"  hair.  </P> <P> Anyway, as Spy observed only last month, this columnist has now "lost it," so I  guess this is why I am no longer featured on every sixth or seventh page in  those wonderful unflattering photos they love to buy from the paparazzi. I am  crushed.  </P></p>

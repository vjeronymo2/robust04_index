			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: Die Fledermaus - Opera An opera producer with a sense of humour is usually worth the price of a ticket. Among the new breed of British producers who came to the fore in the 1980s, Richard Jones is the one most likely to be found with a smile on his face. Even in heavyweight Wagnerian music dramas he cannot resist tickling the audience's ribs occasionally. Unfortunately, it was a loud raspberry from the press which greeted his production of Die Fledermaus two years ago. So often operettas in the care of English National Opera have succumbed to what one might call the London Coliseum treatment: play it big, play it brash, play it vulgar. By all accounts Jones did all three and threw in a bare bottom as the final insult. The reviews may have been awful, but at least the photos made page three. Now the opera is back and for this revival the company has taken the precaution of covering its posterior. As I did not see the show the first time round, I cannot say what else has changed, but clearly a re-think has managed to turn this Die Fledermaus into a more disciplined evening. Forget Vienna, 1874, whatever the calendar on Colonel Frank's prison wall might say. This production has never been nearer to Austria than the end of Brighton pier and is content if it can get a laugh by mentioning Sachertorte and having people say 'Auf wiedersehen'. Indeed, the first act works desperately hard to raise any laughter at all, but when the curtain goes up on the second, Jones's sense of the ridiculous starts to work. The crazy staircase, the sloping dining-tables from which the candelabra never slide off, the 25-foot chaise longue are all zany, off-centre fun. It is down that ludicrously extended sofa that Geoffrey Dolton's Eisenstein crawls, rolls and somersaults in a virtuoso performance, as he tries to seduce his own wife. The comic energy is unstinting and he really seems an 'all-round good egg', as somebody remarks. Vivian Tierney's Rosalinda is made up as a Jean Harlow lookalike and behaves about as much in period, but she sings well, the Czardas apart. As a spirited, red-haired Adele, Rosemary Joshua reveals some sparkling top notes, but keeps her bottom under wraps. Richard Suart is a less bumbling Colonel Frank than usual; Paul Napier-Burrows has enough voice, but possibly not enough personality for Dr Falke. Nobody enjoys himself more than Anthony Mee as Alfred the tenor, his accent now North-of-Watford, now Italian Riviera. Therese Feighan is the nicely pale new Orlofsky, Nigel Planer an alternative comic Frosch. There were moments in the overture when it seemed the music might grind to a halt - surely Straussian rubato is meant to be the musical equivalent of a comma, not a full stop? - but Jerzy Maksymiuk did eventually get the show on the road. It seemed shorter than Die Fledermaus often does. If the dialogue had been cut, that is no loss. The translation does not exactly sparkle with champagne wit. Performances continue until February 10.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears for farm budget if price ceiling ignored THE European Commission expects the EC farm budget to run out of money before the end of the year, if the community's agriculture ministers continue to fail to agree to stay within the mandatory ceiling, or 'guideline', on farm price support. Brussels is understood to have calculated that the first cash shortages in the Common Agricultural Policy will appear around October, if ministers push the tangled debate over this year's price package into June. Such a delay looked altogether likely last night, as the council of agriculture ministers began their third attempt since February to fix this year's prices - by agreeing that any accord would have to wait until next month at the earliest. Ten of the 12 farm ministers reiterated their demands that the ceiling be raised to take account of what they claim is the unforeseen cost of integrating east German farms into the CAP. Led by France and Ireland, they want to soften the cuts proposed by the commission on February 27. These cuts are intended to limit the rise in farm spending this year to Ecu7.4bn, a record 30 per cent leap from last year, touching the ceiling of Ecu32.5bn (Dollars 40bn). Only the UK, and, with some dithering, the Netherlands, are holding fast to the guideline, both in the council of farm ministers and finance ministers, whose unanimous agreement would be needed to breach it. The UK's fiscally rigid stance was one of three emerging from yesterday's farm council. In addition: Ireland was advocating the adoption of the guideline but creation of 'an ad hoc mechanism', a special reserve, in case it is broken. In common with France and others, the Irish believe the commission has overreacted to one-off effects on the beef market, such as the 'mad cow' scare and the Gulf crisis, has exaggerated overproduction trends, is overly pessimistic about world farm prices, and has misjudged how fast the dollar is strengthening so reducing the cost of export subsidies. France appears still to want to take the wrangle to the European summit due in June, in the hope of winning sanction for a higher guideline, having failed to get it on to the agenda of the special summit here on April 8, devoted almost entirely to the Kurdish emergency. The finance ministers meeting which took place alongside that summit replicated the 10-2 division among farm ministers over the guideline. However, it was a European summit, in Brussels in February 1988, which set the yearly ceilings. The Irish idea of a special reserve would, commission and UK officials say, require the unlikely unanimity of the finance ministers. However, one of its underlying premises - that Brussels has done its sums wrong - appears to be buttressed by figures from the commission's periodic 'early warning system' survey of expenditure. These show that price support to the end of this month has been underspent by Ecu1.1bn. France also pressed last night for an update. But commission officials maintain that the seeming underspend is because certain member states, Italy in particular, are behind in paying out subsidies to their farmers. They also dismiss the contention that the stronger dollar will save the guideline, since its effect will not feed through until next year. There is concern in the commission, however, that if a summit were to address farm spending, it might fix guidelines into the future, and queer the pitch for the radical reform of the CAP which Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, is due to present in detail by July. Its preferred alternative may in the end be simply to roll over last year's price package, keep formally within the 1991 guideline and pass on surplus spending to next year, when it hopes to start the reform.</p>

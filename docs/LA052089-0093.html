			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS REFUSE TO LEAVE TROOPS ENTER SHANGHAI TO QUELL DEMONSTRATORS  </P> <P> About 500 Chinese troops moved into the center of Shanghai early today to try  to remove students demonstrating for democracy outside city government offices  on the waterfront.  </P> <P> The troops, who were unarmed, tried to usher the students into buses and a few  were driven away. But most of the 6,000 students refused to go and thousands  more demonstrators poured into the center of the city, China's biggest, to show  their support.  </P> <P> The troops acted shortly after Chinese President Yang Shangkun announced the  army was being called in to end mass demonstrations in Beijing.  </P> <P> Student-led protests that erupted in Shanghai on Tuesday and Thursday forced  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to abandon plans to visit the center of the  historic city, a section largely built by European traders in the 19th Century.  </P> <P> The troops formed a thin line between the students outside the city government  offices and thousands of fresh demonstrators arriving in the center.  </P> <P> A public address system broadcast a statement by Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji  saying: "You should all leave in an orderly manner. We can still conduct  dialogue."  </P> <P> Defiant students yelled back at the loudspeakers: "Get out! Get out!"  </P> <P> The loudspeakers then played a recording of a meeting of party, government and  army representatives in Beijing at which President Yang announced that troops  would be used and Premier Li Peng attacked "a tiny minority of agitators" who  he said want to overthrow the government.  </P></p>

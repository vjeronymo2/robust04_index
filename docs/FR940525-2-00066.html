The proposed Consent Decree settles claims asserted by the United States at the request of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at the Wyckoff/Eagle Harbor Superfund Site and the proposed Pacific Sound Resources Superfund Site, both in Seattle, Washington. The Consent Decree also settles claims for natural resources damages at these two sites asserted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Suquamish Indian Tribe, and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe (the Natural Resource Trustees). The settling defendants include Pacific Sound Resources, Inc. (PSR), which owns the sites and operates or formerly operated a wood treating facility at each of them, a trust created to take ownership of the sites during cleanup, and officers and directors of PSR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint assets claims under Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607. The Complaint seeks an order that the defendants implement remedial actions selected by EPA at each site, that they reimburse all response and assessment costs incurred and to be incurred by the plaintiffs, and that they pay damages for the injury to, destruction, and/or loss of use of natural resources resulting from contamination at the sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Consent Decree, all assets of PSR will be transferred to a trust to ensure that they will be sold at an appropriate time and that all proceeds will be devoted to cleanup and restoration of the Sites. The assets of PSR include several parcels of potentially valuable real estate. The amount that will be obtained towards cleanup and restoration costs under this agreement will depend in part on market conditions as the properties are sold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice.

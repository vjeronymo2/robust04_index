			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples  Organisation [AZAPO] on Friday urged the North-West government  of Popo Molefe to grant immediate pay parity for civil servants  in that region. "AZAPO objects in the strongest possible terms  to the insinuation by the premier of the North-West region, Mr  Popo Molefe, that there are elements behind the public servants'  demands who seek to frustrate the work of the new government.    "AZAPO reminds Mr Molefe that the people of the North-West  region overthrew the homeland regime without needing to be  instigated by any 'elements'. They assumed their own power and  exercised their democratic rights," said AZAPO official Mr Nkosi  Molala.    "In the spirit of the discussions between the president of  AZAPO, Prof Itumeleng Mosala, and the new president, Mr Nelson  Rolihlahla Mandela, recently, that co-operation will be sought  in matters on national interests between our organisations, we  urge the premier of the North-West Region to refrain from  insinuating that people cannot make demands from the new  government unless they are instigated by someone else outside  themselves," he concluded.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Forecast '94: Locomotive out of puff - US economic growth will slow down US economic growth accelerated substantially in the second half of 1993. From less than a 1.5 percentage point annual pace in the first six months, real gross domestic product growth jumped to an estimated 3.5 per cent, and an even stronger rate in the fourth quarter. Hopes are high that the economy has finally moved on to a path of consistently higher growth and job creation. The reality in 1994, however, is more likely to be deja vu. As with earlier intermittent periods of accelerated expansion, such as the second half of 1992, this one should also prove transitory, despite the drop in long-term interest rates in the summer. Resurgent growth never lasted earlier in this upturn because its source was short-lived, and the factors restraining the economy never dissipated. Growth seems likely to slow again for the same reasons. The recent spurt is being driven by a once-onlyreturn of vehicle inventories to desired levels and an unrepeatable sharp drop in the household saving rate. At the same time, a poor trade balance is a drag on growth, structural factors are suppressing the economy's spirit, and policy is barely stimulative. The surge in vehicle output and its spillover will account for about half the growth in fourth-quarter GDP. But production glitches and excessive industry caution kept output below rising sales in the summer of 1993. Without these influences, the production surge would have been more evenly spaced. Households will be unable to sustain their consumption binge because it cannot be financed. Outlays have been rising at a 4 per cent annual clip since early 1993 while real disposable income growth averaged only 2.5 per cent. To keep up this spending spree, either employment gains must rise to 350,000 per month to generate income growth, or the household saving rate must fall by another 1 1/2 percentage points to about 2 per cent. Yet companies are keeping a firm rein on head count, and stock and bond prices would have to rise by another 15 to 20 per cent over the year to justify such a negligible savings rate. By late winter, vehicle assemblies will be synchronised with sales, and consumer expenditures should be more in line with income. Thus, by the second half of 1994, economic growth should return to the slower trend implied by three fundamentals. First, foreign trade prospects look bleak, despite completion of the Uruguay Round. A deteriorating trade balance has restrained growth and should do so in coming months. US exports are still cheap, but not as cheap as they have been over the past few years, because the dollar's effective exchange rate appreciated 3 per cent last year. Moreover, even if the price is right, demand in industrial countries is stagnant, with little chance of improvement before late 1994. Export expansion will thus be weaker than the 8 per cent rise over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, import penetration is rising as domestic demand leaks abroad. Since the US is the only economy expanding with gusto, foreign companies will push for US market share. Second, the economy is still adjusting to structural changes that have helped consign the US to a slow, bumpy growth course. Corporate restructuring is most commonly mentioned. It has short-circuited the interplay of employment and income so crucial for economic expansion. Moreover, the 30 per cent reduction in the rate of household formations since the early 1980s to about 1m annually, together with an excess of apartments, is dampening the response of housing construction to lower interest rates. Housing starts already exceed the rate that would be consistent with the underlying demand for living space, so the likelihood of much further expansion is low. Finally, the private sector's adjustment to defence cuts is incomplete, and future military retrenchment will be even deeper under the latest budget cuts. Third, monetary and fiscal policy are only marginally accommodating, and less so than required to elevate underlying growth to a sustainably higher plain. Tax rises and spending restraint in the next year are genuine. The structural deficit relative to GDP should fall by at least 0.5 per cent in fiscal 1994. In addition, the freeze on nominal discretionary spending will produce significant real reductions in these outlays over the next year at least. With fiscal tightening and structural adjustments, neither a zero real cost of short-term money nor double-digit growth in the monetary base should be seen as evidence of significant monetary policy stimulus. Real short-term interest rates are closer to their cyclical equilibrium than policymakers fear. Moreover, inflation-adjusted short-term rates understate the true level of real financing costs for households and businesses. They pay less than they did five years ago when the cost of all their forms of borrowing is considered, but two to three times more than in earlier expansions. Similarly, rapid growth in the monetary base is misleading. Its spurt in recent years has been due to changes in the private sector's portfolio preferences, not to the central bank's creation of excess liquidity. It also has not led to high growth in bank loan demand. Thus it would be surprising to see materially higher growth than the 2.5 per cent average so far in this recovery. There should be no economic need for the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates before autumn, and then, initially, by only 50 basis points or so. A pre-emptive anti-inflation tightening seems unwarranted and unlikely. Excess capacity should be sufficient to keep inflation low for another year. Even if growth averaged 4 per cent in 1994, it would probably take more than a year before actual GDP reached or exceeded its potential level. Barring shocks, inflation should stay in the 2.5 to 3 per cent range, if not lower. Hence, monetary policymakers will have time to react before the economy hits its inflation trip wire. If the Fed raises interest rates soon, the rise would have to be small to stick, and be followed by another extended period of stability. Economic officials in other industrial countries have been counting on the US to be the world's locomotive for growth. For nearly three years, however, they have waited in vain; in 1994, they are likely to be disappointed again. The author is director of economic research at Goldman Sachs, the US investment house</p>

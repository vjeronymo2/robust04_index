			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Interest costs hold back Severn Trent SEVERN TRENT, the Birmingham-based water and sewage company, yesterday reported a slight fall in profits due to rising interest costs and pre-tax losses at its waste management arm, Biffa. Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said Biffa had achieved some price rises, but operating profits fell Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 12m, leading to a Pounds 10m loss after interest costs. 'It's about market pressures. It's been a tough year,' he said. Severn Trent's results were poorly received by analysts, who also criticised a sudden switch of accounting policy on the company's underground assets. The change, which lifted pre-tax profits by Pounds 15.9m, conforms to accounting rules but was not announced in advance. The company's shares fell 13p to 486p. Group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 274m to Pounds 270m, although the prior year figure was restated under FRS 3 from Pounds 265m. At the interim stage, profits increased 3 per cent to Pounds 140.8m. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 904.6m, helped by price rises and acquisitions, while operating profits on continuing operations increased 11 per cent to Pounds 299.6m. Profits from water and sewerage businesses increased 15 per cent to Pounds 293m. Excluding Biffa, other non-regulated activities saw profits drop from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 1.4m. Mr Paul said the fall was due to restructuring costs and weak economic conditions in the UK and US. Interest costs increased sharply to Pounds 28.9m as net borrowings increased Pounds 252m to Pounds 422.4m, giving gearing of 21 per cent. Borrowings are expected to increase by a further Pounds 200m this year, the company said. The company disconnected 1,215 customers during the year, a slight fall from the previous period, although there was no change in disconnection policy. The bad debt provision fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds 8m. Earnings fell from a restated 70.6p to 69.9p. Excluding exceptional disposal profits of Pounds 8.6m in the prior year, earnings increased 2.5 per cent. A final dividend of 14.1p was recommended to make a total of 21.1p, an increase of 9.3 per cent. The company said it looked at offering an enhanced scrip alternative, but decided it was against shareholders' longer-term interests.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SISTER MARY' NO VIOLATION OF GRANT, CITY ATTORNEY SAYS  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse did not violate a new arts-grant restriction  barring city-funded groups from engaging in religious activity with its  production of "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," City Atty. Thomas  A. Kathe has determined.  </P> <P> Kathe, who sent the legal opinion in a report to City Council members early  this week, found that the city apparently has no grounds to demand repayment of  city money from the theater company. The playhouse has received $20,000 in arts  grants so far this year and has a $9,400 grant pending. The City Council is  expected to address the city attorney's report at its regular meeting on  Monday.  </P> <P> Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle said the council usually agrees with the city  attorney's opinion. "In my reading of the play and reading of the Constitution,  I think (Kathe) is probably right.  </P> <P> "I don't see us (overruling Kathe and) filing suit," Hornbuckle said. "That  would certainly not be a productive use of our funds."  </P> <P> The 1979 Christopher Durang play, a caustic satire about a nun who lectures  about Catholic dogma, was denounced as "anti-Christian bigotry" by some local  residents. Among them were John and Ernie Feeney, a couple who asked the city  to investigate whether the production violated its new restriction against  using city arts grants for "religious or political activity."  </P> <P> "Although the choice . . . by the Playhouse is of questionable taste," Kathe  wrote, "the use of public grant monies on a theatrical production which  questions the value of parochial school education does not violate the  restrictions on the use of public funds set forth in the California  Constitution."  </P> <P> Citing legal precedence, Kathe backed his opinion by concluding that the aim of  "Sister Mary Ignatius" is secular.  </P> <P> "The primary purpose of the production is to use satire to question the methods  of education used in the parochial school system," Kathe wrote. "Although the  play contains scenes that recite Catholic dogma, the theatrical purpose of  satire would appear to negate any message of endorsement of the religious  content by the dialogue in the play. Thus, the primary purpose of the play  appears to be secular and not sectarian."  </P> <P> Neither of the Feeneys nor the play's co-producer, Civic Playhouse board member  David Sharp, could be reached for comment. The play, slated to run through  Sunday, is sold out for all remaining performances, according to a box office  official.  </P></p>

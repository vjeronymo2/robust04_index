			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler rounds on Labour over Soley claims SIR NORMAN Fowler, Conservative party chairman, last night challenged Labour to disown the MP who named Mr Michael Heseltine as having met a Saudi prince before the general election to discuss aid to the Tories. Sir Norman said the comments by Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for Hammersmith, amounted to 'a baseless personal attack' on the trade and industry secretary. Mr Soley said yesterday that he had no details of when the alleged meeting, referred to in a letter he read out in parliament on Tuesday, was supposed to have occurred. He confirmed that some information in the letter had been passed to The Guardian before the newspaper published a report this week alleging a Saudi royal family member contributed several million pounds to the Tories before the last election. The Guardian alleged that a meeting took place in March 1992 between 'a cabinet minister' and Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, son of Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz, the Saudi defence minister. But in a statement issued on his behalf Prince Bandar has said no such meeting took place and that he was not in England during March. The Guardian story also has been angrily denied by Conservatives, with Mr John Major saying no donations were accepted from foreign governments or royal families. Mr Soley said he did not tell The Guardian who his contact was and yesterday said only that he was an Arab with good contacts in Saudi Arabia. The contact had approached him during the general election and had sent him the letter more recently. The extract from the letter Mr Soley read, under parliamentary privilege, to the Commons said: 'Prior to election time a meeting took place in the residence of Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz in the Boltons, SW10, between Prince Bandar, son of the aforementioned, and the ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the USA, with Michael Heseltine and two other people unknown to me. The subject of the meeting was to aid the Conservative party financially in their efforts against the Labour party. 'As far as I have been informed by members of the embassy, this task has been delegated to Mr Hattab Alonzi, press attache, via his supervisor, General Ali Al-Shaaier, minister of communications and media.' Separately, a former senior Tory fundraiser last night gave the first confirmation the party had received money from Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong businessman. Sir Bryan Wyldbore-Smith, who was director of the party's board of finance for 22 years leading up to the last general election, told Channel Four News Mr Li had 'certainly' given a donation. He said he was 'not going to talk sums.'</p>

			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Spices The pepper market is going through a period of very limited activity, reports Man Producton. In fact this situation has been lasting for several weeks already and is going to influence source markets. White pepper prices declined this week to a level of about USDollars 2950/mt cif. It looks like we are not far from the stabilization point. Black pepper was offered in larger quantities by India and Brazil. The material could not be absorbed failing industrial demand for nearby positions and prices consequently came under selling pressure. Mg1 black pepper is offered at USDollars 1525 cif and about the same price is valid for Brazil black grade 1.</p>

(Licensee), is the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License No. 29&hyph;19310&hyph;02 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30 on July 31, 1986. The License authorized the possession and use of nickel-63 in plated sources or foils, not to exceed 15 millicuries per foil, in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The License expired on August 31, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The byproduct material has been transferred from the licensed address of 412 Route 9, Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, 08834, to 512 Route 9, Forked River, New Jersey 08731, where it is currently stored. The Licensee did not submit an application for renewal of the License under 10 CFR 30.37 prior to its expiration, nor did the Licensee notify the Commission, in writing under 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the License. Although Mr. Walter Holm, Jr., the Radiation Safety Officer, stated ETL's intentions in a letter dated May 15, 1991, to terminate the license, as of this date, ETL has not transferred the licensed material to an authorized recipient, nor has ETL applied for an NRC license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 14, 1993, the NRC, Region I, issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to ETL, mailed to Mr. Walter Holm, for possession of material without a valid specific license. The letter forwarding the NOV directed the Licensee to place the licensed material in secure storage, not to use the material, and promptly transfer the licensed material to a lawful recipient. The Licensee has not responded to the Notice of Violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in a June 7, 1994 letter, the NRC again reminded ETL of the need to respond to the NRC Notice of Violation. ETL did not respond to a telephone message left on October 26, 1994. To date, ETL still possesses nickel-63 sealed sources without an NRC license and without applying for such a license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ETL remains in possession of NRC-licensed radioactive material without a license. This is prohibited by Section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Based on the above, ETL has violated 10 CFR 30.3, which states that, except for persons exempt as provided in 10 CFR Parts 30 and 150, no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, based on the above, notwithstanding the several notices concerning the above from the NRC and the corresponding opportunities to achieve compliance with applicable requirements, ETL has deliberately violated NRC requirements by possessing nickel-63 sealed sources without a license. This conclusion is based on the facts that ETL never filed a renewal application before the License issued to ETL expired on August 31, 1991, as required by 10 CFR 30.37; ETL has not responded to the NRC Notice of Violation issued on January 14, 1993; ETL has not responded to an NRC letter, dated June 7, 1994, addressing its previous failure to respond to the Notice of Violation; ETL has refused to dispose of the radioactive material; and ETL possesses the radioactive material contrary to 10 CFR 30.3; without a valid NRC specific license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improper handling of the nickel-63 sealed sources can result in an unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act and the Commission's regulations require that possession of licensed material be under a regulated system of licensing and inspection. ETL's possession of NRC-licensed material without a valid NRC license, as documented in the January 14, 1993, Notice of Violation, and its unwillingness to respond to numerous NRC written and verbal communications to apply for an NRC license, demonstrate that it is either unable or unwilling to comply with NRC requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the circumstances surrounding ETL's possession of the byproduct material and the failure to respond to communications with the NRC, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected while ETL remains in possession of the radioactive material without the required NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

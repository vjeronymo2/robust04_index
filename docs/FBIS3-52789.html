Addressing a news conference in New  Delhi today, the party president, Mr. L.K. Advani, took  exception to a letter reportedly written by President Clinton to  a Washington-based supporter of militancy in Kashmir. Replying  to questions, Mr. Advani said that Pakistan should be told that  any further talks on Kashmir will depend on Islamabad ending its  proxy war and the inclusion of the future of Pakistan-occupied  Kashmir in the agenda.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOB DUKIET FIRED AS MARQUETTE CAGE COACH AFTER 2 BAD SEASONS  </P> <P> Bob Dukiet was fired today as Marquette basketball coach after two consecutive  losing seasons and several conflicts with players.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Bill Cords said in a news release that Dukiet had been  offered the position of assistant to the athletic director for the remaining  three years of his contract.  </P> <P> "This change in position is not meant as a personal or individual criticism of  Bob Dukiet," Cords said. "We appreciate the energy and effort he has brought to  his duties."  </P> <P> Published reports named possible candidates for the coaching position as former  Indiana and NBA standout Quinn Buckner, Creighton coach Tony Barone,  Wisconsin-Milwaukee coach Steve Antrim, Syracuse assistant Bernie Fine, DePaul  assistant Jim Molinari and Texas-San Antonio coach Ken Burmeister.  </P> <P> Dukiet could not be reached for comment today, but he told a Milwaukee  television station Wednesday night that he would restrict comment until he had  conferred with his lawyer.  </P> <P> Dukiet, 41, was hired by Marquette in 1986. In three seasons, he compiled a  39-46 record, including 10-18 two years ago, the university's worst in 23  years.  </P> <P> The Warriors ended the season last week with a 13-15 record.  </P></p>

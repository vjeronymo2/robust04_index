			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Australia deal for UK group BRITISH Telecommunications Australasia (BTA), a wholly owned subsidiary of the UK telecoms group, was yesterday awarded a 10-year deal to run a communications network for New South Wales, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. BT said the contract, expected to be worth Pounds 350m, was the biggest overseas contract it had won. Mr John Fahey, NSW premier, said BTA would set up a phone and communications network linking all government departments and public sector agencies statewide, cutting the annual ADollars 120m (Pounds 54.7m) telecoms bill by 20 per cent. The project, to be completed in two years, would connect 5,000 sites, 120,000 telephones and 23,000 computer terminals.</p>

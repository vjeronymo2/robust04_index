			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: The Valkyries ride at La Scala - Richard Fairman reports from Milan on Riccardo Muti's opening production The management of La Scala, Milan, will no doubt have been relieved that the opening night of the season passed off so peacefully this year. The rumoured student demonstration failed to materialise and the audience responded with reasonable enthusiasm to the performance. Some reports suggest that Riccardo Muti, the musical director, would be happy to see the opening night ritual done away with altogether. While the riot police are outside guarding the glittering audience, many of the performers inside liken the atmosphere to being put on trial; the unfortunate ones who fall from grace (including Pavarotti recently) finding themselves on the receiving end of whistles and jeers. The worst incidents have occurred on opening nights devoted to Verdi, La Scala's presiding genius. Some resentment may have been caused by this season's choice of opera - why Wagner when there were so many Italian operas? - but in other respects Muti has found a good way of diffusing the tension. Italian temperament does not burn on such a short fuse when the opera is German. There is another reason, too. Ironically, it is easier to cast a Wagner opera well at the moment than it is one of the grand operas by Verdi. For this new production of Die Walkure La Scala has assembled not one, but two all-star casts, the first of which exhibited a high level of purely vocal accomplishment on Saturday (like most people interested in the opera rather than the occasion, I attended the second performance). As Siegmund and Sieglinde, Placido Domingo and Waltraud Meier poured out a stream of rich tone with no hint of strain or forcing. Domingo habitually swallows his German consonants and Meier's Sieglinde was less exciting than her famous Kundry, but at least they made a handsomely-sung couple. Matthias Holle's menacing Hunding completed a strong trio for the opening act. In the second cast Jane Eaglen will be making her La Scala debut as Brunnhilde, but the first cast offers the well-tried and powerful Gabriele Schnaut, wielding a laser-beam soprano which can jar on the nerves when it is not exactly in tune. Monte Pederson has stepped into Wotan's shoes early in his career and his youthful, carefully-contained baritone is still growing to the right stature; his vocal reserves were waning fast some way before the end. Marjana Lipovsek's Fricka was as sure as a rock (fortunate as she was placed on a precipitous crag) and there was a strong band of Valkyries, including Susan Anthony, Ruth Floeren and Penelope Walker. Muti himself received widespread public acclaim, although his sleek Wagner conducting might not go down well everywhere. The music sped through the fast passages as though flying weightlessly, only to become becalmed when the tempo had to slow; and it was strange that the excellent, apparently well-rehearsed La Scala orchestra should have a brass section that could get itself into such a pickle. It is not clear yet what definite plans the company has for the other Ring operas. If this Walkure is a one-off assignment, it will matter less that Andre Engel's production showed so little inclination to get a grip on the Ring's intellectual issues. The best course was to enjoy Nicky Rieti's strangely alluring stage pictures and not trouble oneself asking why Hunding's hut seemed to be an underground dwelling in the middle of a desert or what Siegmund was doing wandering among a consignment of white duvets (were they clouds?) before he died. There was, however, one stunning coup de theatre. For the Ride of the Valkyries four remarkably lifelike mechanical horses appeared at the back of the stage, rearing their heads and galloping towards the audience in awesome slow motion. Every staging of the Ring gets one of the special effects right. It is just a shame one cannot collect them over the years and put together a definitive production.</p>

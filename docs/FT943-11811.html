			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life shows 13% advance Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance group, yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 to Pounds 171.8m - 13 per cent higher than the same period last year - despite sharp falls in sales by its two core life insurance subsidiaries, writes Alison Smith. Sir Simon Hornby, group chairman, said that the life assurance companies were trading in a market where sales were unlikely to grow in the short-term, but that both were responding to market conditions by intensifying training and making substantial changes to the sales process. He highlighted the impact of recent unfavourable publicity about the life industry as a whole, which has focused on the possible mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes and on general levels of training and of compliance with regulators' requirements. The steepest fall in performance was in Black Horse Financial Services, a 'bancassurance' company selling products only to customers of Lloyds Bank. It recorded a drop in sales of 40 per cent. Abbey Life, the group's other UK life assurance division, suffered a drop in sales of 8 per cent. Mr Stephen Maran, group chief executive, said Abbey Life's performance was broadly in line with the market. He attributed about half the drop in BHFS's sales to the extensive amount of time devoted to training rather than selling during the six-month period. A further factor in the fall in business is that the group has not yet re-entered the pensions transfer market. Within the Pounds 171.8m total pre-tax profits, BHFS fell 27 per cent to Pounds 44.1m (Pounds 60m), while Abbey Life slipped back to Pounds 66.9m (Pounds 69m). The increase in group profits was largely due to the recovery in Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company, both in terms of income and a sharp fall in the charge for bad debts. Its pre-tax profits almost trebled, rising to Pounds 33.5m from Pounds 11.5m. Earnings per share for the group rose 14 per cent to 16.3p (14.3p), and the interim dividend is increased 8 per cent to 6.8p (6.3p). The impact of regulation on the life industry was also reflected in comments from Sun Life, despite its 13 per cent increase in new busi-ness for the first half of the year at Pounds 182.6m (Pounds 161.1m) reported yes-terday. Mr John Reeve, managing director, said although the group had improved on earlier results against the industry trend, he expected regulatory pressures, keener competition and a contracting market 'will make it unlikely that the current rate of year-on-year increase will be sustained for the full year'.</p>

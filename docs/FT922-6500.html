			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Short rates higher SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets ended marginally higher yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a large shortage that was not fully removed during the day. But the trade in sterling futures had a slightly more bullish tone, as dealers got more optimistic about a possible cut in base rates. Cash rates for one-week and one-month money ended slightly higher at the end of a day on which the Bank had forecast a larger-than-expected shortage of Pounds 2.1bn. The rate for one-week money ended at 10 1/8 per cent, up from 9 3/4 per cent the previous day. The rate for 1-month money ended at 10 per cent, up  1/16 per cent from the previous close. Further out, the rates for everything from 3-months to 1-year ended at the same level of 9 15/16 per cent offered. The rise in short-term rates was the result of a much stickier day in dealing with the Bank of England. On Thursday, a Pounds 1.3bn shortage was completely removed in the morning. But yesterday, there was a shortfall of almost Pounds 300m at the end of the day. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 7m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The shortage was later revised to around Pounds 2.05bn before taking account of the early operations. Later, the Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 30m for resale to the market in equal amounts on 9,10 and 11 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 121m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 728m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 95m of Band-2 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 78m also for resale to the market in equal amounts on 9,10, 11 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 505m. Trading in the sterling futures market was far more bullish, influenced perhaps by the Bundesbank's decision not to raise German interest rates on Thursday, as some people had feared. September short sterling ended two ticks up on the day at 90.36. This suggests that 3-month LIBOR four months from now will be at 9.64 per cent. December short sterling also closed higher, up five ticks to 90.64. This suggests that 3-month LIBOR at the end of the year will be at 9.36 per cent.</p>

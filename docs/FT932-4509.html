			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Merger talks for TGWU and GMB THE CREATION of a single general union, bringing together almost 2m unskilled and semi - skilled workers, moved a step closer yesterday with the announcement that formal talks will start for the first time on a merger between the TGWU and GMB unions. Delegates at the annual conference of the GMB, traditionally a centre-right union, agreed by 10 to 1 to a policy document which argued the case for merger. Talks will not start until after the annual conference next month of the TGWU, a union whose hard-left image has softened in recent years. No date has been fixed for a merger, but it is not expected before the end of the century. Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general secretary, said: 'This is a matter of enormous significance in the union movement. We have seen a decline in union membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s and we have to think of how to move out of that and transform the union movement.' An amalgamation between two unions with extensive resources could be a way of attracting more members. The relationship between the TGWU and the GMB has been marked by a blend of rivalry - mainly over recruitment - and co-operation in campaigns, such as better training rights. Although most GMB delegates at the conference in Portsmouth were in favour of a merger, a handful spoke against the move because they did not want to lose their regional identity. The merger plan is part of a trend towards fewer, larger unions. The most recent merger was the creation of the AEEU by the merger of the EETPU electricians' union and the AEU engineering union last year. Three key public-sector unions, Cohse, Nupe and Nalgo, will merge on July 1 to create Unison.</p>

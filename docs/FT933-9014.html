			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Personal View: How to halt Russia's rouble charade Contrary to the implication of a recent leader in the FT ('Sabotaging the rouble', July 21), the actions of the Central Bank of Russia to confiscate pre-1993 rouble notes should not be viewed as extraordinary. They exemplify long-established, mischievous tendencies of central banking in Russia. As the leader remarked, the present confiscation is like the one made under Gorbachev in January 1991. But the Gorbachev currency confiscation was nothing new to Russians. Older Russians had suffered a currency confiscation on December 14 1947. It cut in half the real value of savings exceeding 10,000 roubles (about three months' wages at the time). Further back, Russian monetary history contains other episodes of monetary mischief. Indeed, even before central banking began in Russia in 1860, the tsars, including Peter the Great, frequently debased the coinage. Yet westerners now advising the Russian government seem to have learnt nothing from the wretched historical record of political control of money in Russia. For example, as recently as July 21, the FT ('Climate of reform brings rouble back from the dead') reported that Jeffrey Sachs was urging the International Monetary Fund to negotiate an agreement by the end of the summer to make as much as Dollars 6bn available to stabilise the rouble. In the same article, Charles Blitzer, the World Bank's chief economist in Moscow, claimed: 'What we are seeing are the first effects of a step-by-step stabilisation programme.' The FT and other leading newspapers have rather uncritically used material supplied by Russia's western advisers to advocate foreign aid to stabilise the rouble and reform the Russian economy. That is curious, indeed, because neither the Central Bank of Russia nor the Yeltsin government has ever had a coherent programme to stabilise the rouble or reform the Russian economy. Their policies have been little more than hastily improvised charades to extract aid from the west. The charades have, alas, been successful; for example, last month's currency confiscation came on the heels of a Dollars 1.5bn loan to Russia from the IMF, which adopted an especially lax set of rules to enable Russia to borrow. Russia's western advisers speculate that things would be fine if Mr Yeltsin would just replace the former communists in the central bank and the government with 'reformers'. But they neglect two details: Mr Yeltsin is a former communist, and deep-rooted patterns of thinking cannot be radically changed overnight. We suspect that one reason Mr Yeltsin keeps former communists in power is that he has known them for years, trusts them to some extent, and agrees with much of what they do. Mr Yeltsin could have reacted to the currency confiscation by declaring the central bank's decree invalid. He could also have fired Viktor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the central bank, and Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who signed the decree. Alas, he did not take these actions, even though they would have been popular with the populace. Instead, he agreed to the main features of the currency confiscation. Russia's monetary problems go deeper than personalities. They are institutional: central banking has never provided a sound currency in Russia for an extended period. As long as Russia has a central bank it is likely to have an inconvertible currency highly prone to inflation. The only way to stabilise the rouble permanently is to change Russia's monetary institutions. That means, first and foremost, abolishing the central bank and replacing it with a currency board. Such boards have been tried successfully in more than 70 countries, including part of Russia from 1918-20. A Russian currency board would hold 100 per cent foreign reserves against rouble notes in circulation. It would maintain a fixed exchange rate between the rouble and a suitable foreign currency such as the dollar. The rouble would then be as stable and convertible as the dollar. The currency board would force financial rectitude on the Russian government and prevent it from picking the people's pockets. When the Group of Seven nations and international financial institutions confer with the Russian government after the summer holiday season, the west must start talking monetary sense. Anything less than a currency board will perpetuate Russia's traditional pattern of monetary mischief and jeopardise any attempts at real economic reform. The authors are, respectively, professor of applied economics and a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. They are the authors (with Lars Jonung) of 'Russian Currency and Finance: A Currency Board Approach to Reform', which will be published by Routledge in September</p>

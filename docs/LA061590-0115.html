			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF CANTOR'S FILMIC LOVE AFFAIR  </P> <P> Jazz grabbed film archivist Mark Cantor's ear at an early age, and the images  of jazz musicians on screen, which seemed to him a logical extension of his  love for the music, soon became his passion.  </P> <P> Cantor now owns approximately 2,000 jazz films and you'll be able to see a  dandy selection from his vaults in a free screening tonight at 10 at the Monica  4-Plex, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica. The program culminates a monthlong series  of free community events that have preceded the 11th annual Playboy Jazz  Festival, being held Saturday and Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> On tap tonight are several recent additions to the Cantor collection. "I've got  some new footage of Thelonious Monk doing 'Light Blue,' originally aired on  French TV in the early '70s, and a piece by Chet Baker from Danish TV from  sometime in the '60s," Cantor says. Other clips feature vibist Lionel Hampton,  who is on this year's Playboy lineup, appearing in the late '30s with the Benny  Goodman quartet, and sax legend Coleman Hawkins. Two 1958 shorts spotlight  trumpeter/composer Shorty Rogers, one with the Lighthouse All-Stars, another  with his big band.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old Cantor, who has been a kindergarten teacher for 18 years, began  his love affair with jazz films serendipitously. "About 20 years ago, I was in  a junk shop on Western Avenue and found something labeled 'jazz film,' " he  recalls. "I took it home and it sat on the shelf for two years. I finally saw  it and it was a film with (sax great) Lester Young and that whetted my  appetite."  </P> <P> NEW JAZZ CLUB: San Pedro, the hometown of the late alto saxophonist Art Pepper  and the current city of residence for flutist James Newton, hasn't exactly been  known as a haven for jazz lovers. But Ozzie Cadena, the former record producer  who is also in charge of entertainment at the Indigo Jazz Club in Compton,  would like to change that.  </P> <P> Cadena is doing the bookings for Stingaree Gulch, a new jazz room located in  the just-opened Sheraton San Pedro (601 Palos Verdes St., San Pedro, (213)  519-8200). The club debuted last week and, according to Cadena, people seem to  like what they're hearing.  </P> <P> "We started with (Latin bandleader) Poncho Sanchez and had a nice crowd,"  Cadena said as saxman David Newman could be heard playing "Stella by Starlight"  in the background. (Sanchez plays a free concert today at noon on the steps of  Los Angeles City Hall.)  </P> <P> Cadena admitted he's still feeling his audience out. "I'm trying to figure out  what they want," he said. "Since it's a new area, I may not be able to do a  hard-driving jazz thing every week. So I've tried having the featured vocalist  as the emcee. Last week, it was Julie Kelly, this week it's DeeDee McNeil. This  weekend she'll introduce the house trio, then after they play, she'll sing a  couple of songs, then introduce (violinist) Papa John Creach, the featured  artist."  </P> <P> Cover charges will average about $6, Cadena said. A liquor license is pending.  Music begins about 8:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Artists on tap include pianist Paul Smith, Tuesday; guitarist Laurindo Almeida  plus pianist Gildo Mahones' trio and McNeil, Wednesday, and Creach again on  Thursday. In July, New Yorkers Fred Hersch and Louis Hayes will arrive.  </P> <P> BREAKFAST JAM: Marla's Memory Lane in Los Angeles is hosting a breakfast jam  session Sunday from 1-4 a.m. Vibist Bobby Hutcherson, who is appearing at  Marla's tonight and Saturday, and pianist Horace Tapscott will perform and  numerous guest artists will be on tap. "We're hoping that some of the people  from Playboy will drop by," said trombonist George Bohanon, who handles  artists' bookings for the nightspot. Cover charge is $7. Information: (213)  294-8430.  </P> <P> SINGING THE BLUES?: If you've got the blues and feel like sharing that emotion,  why not enter KLON-FM's Blues Talent Search, held in conjunction with the  station's 11th annual Long Beach Blues Festival Sept. 15-16. For an entry  blank, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to KLON-FM, 1288 N. Bellflower  Blvd., Long Beach 90815-4198, attention Blues Talent Search. Deadline for  entries is June 30.  </P></p>

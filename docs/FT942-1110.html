			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family (Pensions): Better - but not ideal / A look at this week's White Paper on pensions For most consumers, the government's package is a good deal. From April 1997, when the laws come into effect, company pensions will be more secure and personal pensions will be more attractive. But the regulatory regime is not as rigorous as the system proposed by the Goode report. Here, we look at what the government has in mind. COMPANY SCHEMES Is my pension more secure? Yes. A series of checks and balances will ensure that employers, trustees and the professionals involved in the scheme do their legally defined job. Will the law be enforced properly? Not necessarily. Goode's proposals for a pro-active, independent super-regulator have been weakened seriously. Instead, the regulator will be a last resort. Moreover, instead of receiving independent funding from the government, he will be funded by the very schemes he is supposed to police. Will the value of my pension change? Yes. The good news is that pensions must increase each year in line with inflation (capped at 5 per cent). But this will apply only to benefits built up from the date the law comes into effect. The deferred pensions of early leavers - ie, the benefits left behind when an employee changes jobs - will be reduced in some cases because the new law will sever the link between occupational schemes and the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). Most company schemes that link pensions to salaries contract the entire scheme membership out of Serps and pay reduced National Insurance contributions. To qualify for this, they must provide a replacement pension at least as good as Serps. This 'guaranteed minimum pension' (GMP) normally must increase in line with earnings inflation or 7 per cent a year for early leavers who have deferred pensions. After April 1997, schemes contracted out of Serps will no longer have to provide that guarantee. Instead, they must increase all of the deferred pension by price inflation capped at 5 per cent. Where the GMP is a significant proportion of total pension, this will reduce the overall level of inflation proofing. How are transfer values affected? The law will allow schemes to calculate transfer values for younger members on a less favourable basis, so they could get less than at present. Will I get my pension if my employer goes bust? Yes, but it could be reduced. The government has adopted most of Goode's proposals for a minimum solvency standard to ensure that, if the scheme terminates, there will be sufficient assets to pay members a transfer value and to secure payment of existing pensions. Bear in mind, however, that the calculation of transfer values for younger members will result in lower payouts. Will I receive full compensation in the event of fraud or theft? Not necessarily. The compensation fund will bring the fund up to 90 per cent of the solvency level, but this may not equate to 90 per cent of your full benefits. Will I have a greater say in running my scheme? Yes, but not as much as Goode recommended. Members of all types of scheme will be able to elect at least one-third of the trustees. Goode wanted two-thirds for schemes where the investment risk falls on the individual. Will I get better information? Yes but it is up to you to complain if you do not understand. Will there be better ways to resolve disputes? Yes. You should take the initiative and complain to the regulator if your company's disputes system is ineffective. Caveat emptor: Alan Pickering, a consultant with actuary Watsons, says the regulatory regime will not be as rigorous as that proposed by Goode. 'Scheme members must take more trouble with their pension arrangements than they do now,' he stresses. 'A lot is at stake. It is in members' interests to understand their benefits and to watch out for any warning signs.' PERSONAL PENSIONS There are two major changes here: age-related rebates and flexibility on the timing of the annuity purchase. Who will benefit from age-related rebates? At the moment, the rebate of NI contributions for employees who opt out of Serps is a flat rate, apart from a small bonus for employees age-30 and over. The value of the Serps benefits increases with age, so at present, the rebate is good value for younger employees. For older employees, Serps is better. Age-related rebates will certainly improve the terms for older employees but may reduce the terms for younger employees. Why do we need flexibility in the timing of the annuity purchase? At present, you must buy your annuity immediately on retirement. Annuity rates, based on gilt yields, fluctuate dramatically. If you buy at the wrong time, your income could be reduced by as much as 30 per cent. After April 1997, you will be able to delay the purchase until up to age-75 and, in the meantime, draw down an appropriate annual income from your pension fund. The remainder of the fund will continue to benefit from investment returns. William Burrows, director of Annuity Direct, says: 'These proposals overcome the main disadvantage of the present rules which force people to buy annuities when they retire, even though annuity rates may be very low. 'Until 1997, there are existing opportunities for those who want to defer the annuity purchase, but you should seek expert advice.'</p>

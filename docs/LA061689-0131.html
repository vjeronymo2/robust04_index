			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME, WARNER BOARDS QUIET ON STRATEGY  </P> <P> Directors of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. apparently met separately  Thursday to thrash out plans to salvage their merger, but by nightfall, neither  company had tipped its hand about the next move.  </P> <P> Rumors of the meetings -- on the ninth day after Paramount Communications made  its surprise $10.7-billion cash bid for Time -- provoked long debates on Wall  Street about whether Time and Warner can find an expedient solution together,  or whether the two companies will ultimately go their separate ways.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis stepped up the pressure on Time's  12 directors with a letter reminding them that Paramount is prepared to sweeten  its offer. Davis asked for a meeting and said Paramount would "be prepared to  review any non-public information which you believe could justify a higher  price."  </P> <P> Neither Time nor Warner would confirm that its directors had been summoned, but  several out-of-town members of each board were in Manhattan on Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Help Finance'  </P> <P> Although Time has not responded formally to the offer, the media giant has  demonstrated its anger over the unsolicited Paramount bid, which has almost  certainly derailed the non-cash stock swap with Warner that was to be put to a  shareholder vote next week.  </P> <P> Wall Street sources reiterated their belief that Time has encouraged investment  bankers to search for prospective buyers of Paramount itself. One investment  banker said Time is believed to have offered to "help finance the bid" if a  buyer for Paramount can be found.  </P> <P> Nearly 2.8 million Paramount shares changed hands Thursday on the New York  Stock Exchange, although the closing price of $59.50 was unchanged from  Wednesday's close. Warner's stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $55.625, while  the price of Time shares fell $3.625 to $171.50, below the $175-per-share offer  made by Paramount.  </P> <P> In a related development, Warner and Time announced that the City of New York  has cleared the way for the transfer of Time's and Warner's six cable  franchises in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens to the new company  if the merger takes place. The cable systems serve nearly 9% of the 5.5 million  subscribers in the combined Time and Warner cable systems. Some analysts are  betting that Time and Warner will still try to merge but will change the terms  of the deal and offer a handsome dividend to shareholders. One analyst said he  believes that Time is prepared to take on massive debt to complete the merger  if necessary, while Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,  said he believes the merger is "financeable" if the original stock-swap ratio  is changed in favor of Time shareholders and a cash dividend of as much as $125  is paid. The combination would result in a package comparable to Paramount's  offer to Time shareholders, Manson said.  </P> <P> But other traders interpreted the declining price of Time shares and the  increase in Warner's as a clear sign that more investors had come to expect a  Time tender offer for part or all of Warner.  </P> <P> One stock speculator said Time advisers Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. have a  reputation for hard-line defenses, and might urge rejection of the Paramount  bid or even a cash dividend to Time shareholders.  </P></p>

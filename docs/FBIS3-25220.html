			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] A full-scale confrontation is looming between  Nigeria and Cameroon over their long-disputed border region.  Trouble blew up last month with claims that Nigerian villagers  and fishermen on islands and a peninsula in the region were  being harassed and killed by Cameroon gendarmes. Nigerian  troops were sent to the area to protect Nigerian nationals, and  this week the NIGERIAN NEWS AGENCY claimed that 18,000 Nigerians  were fleeing the Bakasi Peninsula after raids by Cameroon  gendarmes. The Cameroon external affairs minister denied the  charges on this program yesterday, but a visit to Cameroon by  Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, apparently  achieved little or nothing. On the line to Abuja, Alice Martin  asked Babagana Kingibe if he thought the two countries were on  the verge of war:    [Begin recording] [Kingibe] No, absolutely not, because it  is our determination and we do have the responsibility to ensure  safety of lives and property of all Nigerians, wherever they may  be, and it is indeed true that, perhaps, these provocations have  reached saturation point as regards Nigerians living in the  (Atabue) local government area of Cross River State, part of  which is on the Bakasi Peninsula. I don't think we are going to  tolerate any more harassment of our nationals from whatever  quarters. We wouldn't tolerate the harassment of our fishermen  and their catch being confiscated at will. But we do not have  to go to war in order to guaratee the safety of life and  property of Nigerians. We are just going to make jolly sure  that it doesn't happen again and it will not happen again!    [Martin] And how can you be sure?    [Kingibe] There has been a continuing neglect and that  neglect will not continue. We'll stop it and we are going to  establish our effective presence over there.    [Martin] So, you are actually moving in now to the peninsula  where Cameroon says it territorial control?    [Kingibe] Not that we are moving in. We are there. We have  always been there.    [Martin] Cameroon says it owns, historically owns that area.    [Kingibe] Now, I don't know how anybody can really come and  claim a territory that is wholly, entirely Nigerian populated.  Really, even from the traditional system of establishing  authority, these are Efik-speaking people and Ibibio-speaking  people who owe their allegiance to the Oba [title of traditional  chief] of Calabar and there all sorts of historical documents to  that effect. So, you don't just wake up and make a claim that  this is your territory. You must have a basis.    [Martin] But the fact is that Cameroon says that the land  itself belongs to Cameroon, irrespective of whether Nigerians  are living there.    [Kingibe] No, the land never belonged to Cameroon. Madam, I  don't think that I am comfortable in negotiating with the  Cameroonians via the BBC. We are brothers, we are very close  brothers and friends and have been able to talk to each other  directly and quietly before. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons pleases There was an immediate positive response to the announcement from Dixons that it was diluting its interest in its loss-making US subsidiary Silo - a move which has long been urged on the electrical group by London analysts. Evidence of the welcome afforded by investors was seen in the stock's biggest turnover in more than three years at 15m. Dixons advanced 27 to 260p. BZW upgraded its profits forecast for the current year from Pounds 78m to Pounds 86m as a result of the move. However, Mr Tony Sherat, the broker's stores specialist, said he remained cautious on the stock, citing doubts over the quality of earnings and the threat of increased competition in the UK. Under yesterday's deal, Dixons will cede control of Silo to Fretter in return for a minority stake in the US retailer.</p>

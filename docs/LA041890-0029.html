			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE  </P> <P> Your March 27 article on the Supreme Court's decision upholding the insurance  industry's exemption from local taxes was damaged by a misleading headline  implying that the court had given the industry a "tax break."  </P> <P> Instead, the court's decision simply means that insurers will not be forced to  pay additional taxes to local government entities.  </P> <P> Such taxes would only increase the cost of insurance to policyholders. We need  to work toward ways of lowering insurance costs, not increasing them.  </P> <P> The story failed to point out that the more than $1 billion insurance premium  tax is the fifth largest source of state revenues.  </P> <P> The insurance industry is paying its fair share of taxes and is working hard to  change the insurance system so that insurance is more affordable to consumers.  </P> <P> GEORGE W. TYE  </P> <P> Vice President  </P> <P> Assn. of California Insurance Cos.  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Bosnian Serb leader promised an  immediate cease-fire in Gorazde following a long meeting with  the UN'S special envoy. [passage omitted] RDP-1 has learned  that the city is under heavy fire, tens of thousands of people  fleeing. There have been more than 1,200 casualties since the  beginning of the Serb offensive. The Serbs have entered Gorazde  with combat vehicles, as UN spokesman Manuel Almeida told us.    [Begin recording] [Almeida] We were informed by our  colleagues in Gorazde that the local people had told them that  the Serbs were entering the city with tanks. [passage omitted]  We did not see this because we are in shelters as the city is  being bombarded. Our colleagues are in protected shelters and  the local people went to see them and tell them. Also, what we  can see is that the population is in a great panic. This is  understandable since we estimate that during the offensive of  the last few days, last two weeks, about 25,000 people have been  moved within the Gorazde enclave; the great majority seeking  refuge in the city of Gorazde or in its outskirts. The city  does not have the conditions to receive so many people, many  buildings have been destroyed.    [Announcer] How many casualties are there?    [Almeida] There are about 1,200 people dead or injured.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Property: Setback for Heseltine - Cadogan's Place Early in the 1980s Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, started the programme which has brought the total of listed buildings in England to almost 500,000. Now, wearing another hat as squire of Thenford, Northamptonshire, he has come a cropper with the listing regulations. South Northamptonshire Council has refused him listed building consent for alterations to a cottage he owns in the village. The roof and the windows are what stymied him. While the cottage now has a slate roof, it is clear that, originally, it did have thatch. Heseltine wants to put this back - but he proposed using Norfolk reed, which is not regarded as the right material for the vernacular architecture of the area. The local product is long straw which makes a rather wispy, shaggy roof  - but this is now difficult to find. A possible alternative is combed wheat, which is neater but still not quite correct. As for the windows, he planned to install sealed, double-glazed units. These may conserve heat but, again, they are inappropriate. Such decisions about details are not easy for local councils although they are crucial for maintaining the character of an area. In any case, since the council's decision, Heseltine has re-applied for consent and proposes to keep the slate roof. A glorious Queen Anne house, listed grade I, comes up for auction on Monday afternoon at the Berkeley Hotel, London SW1. Hinwick House, in Bedfordshire, has been in the Orlebar family since Richard Orlebar built it between 1709 and 1713. The architect was probably James Hunt of Northampton, who is said to have been a pupil of Grinling Gibbons, the wood-carver and sculptor. As with the sale of Brympton d'Evercy in Somerset in 1992, money - or rather lack of it - is the reason for the sale. The house comes with several listed outbuildings plus a park, a lake and woods - 35 acres in all. Also included are five tapestries, 13 bedrooms and a four-seater lavatory. I remember visiting Hinwick 20 years ago when it was open to the public. We were the first group to arrive on a Sunday afternoon when the family was sitting sleepily around the television. As we came in, they threw a cloth over the machine - which carried on all the same - as if it were a parrot. Joint auctioneers Savills (071-499 8644) and Allsop (071- 494 3686) suggest a guide price of Pounds 425,000-Pounds 475,000. Bidders should have a banker's draft or solicitor's cheque for at least Pounds 40,000. In France only lawyers can bid in such forced sales, and they must also arrive with a certified cheque. Chartered surveyor Armstrong McCrea, in Monte Carlo, bought a villa at Grasse last week with two guest houses, two tennis courts and a swimming pool. It used to be rented by 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, son of Haiti's infamous dictator, and was on sale privately last year for Pounds 1.5m. French auctions receive little publicity - just three brief visits in the company of the bailiff before bidding. The house went for Pounds 450,000, most attractive to the buyer but probably less so to the French tax collectors, who had foreclosed. More often, it is the bank that is the vendor. Armstrong McCrea (33-93 50 71 97) runs a Riviera Vulture Fund to look for similarly unusual chances to buy on the Cote d'Azur.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Moody's upgrades debt ratings of two US banks MOODY'S Investor Service has upgraded the debt ratings of Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan, two of the US's largest banks. The ratings increase follows similar upgrades given by Standard &amp; Poor's, and underlines recent improvements in the banks' earnings and capital levels. The upgrades on senior and subordinated debt affect about Dollars 8bn of debt in each bank. Moody's increased the long-term debt ratings of Chase Manhattan senior debt to Baa1 from Baa2, and of Chemical Banking senior debt to Single A3 from Baa1. Both banks have recently raised capital and improved the quality of their loans in an effort to boost the ratings on their debt. The rating agency said Chase's upgrade 'recognised the improvement in Chase's capital measures following its recent Dollars 650m equity offering as well as from future earnings retention'. But Moody's noted capital ratios at Chase continued to be lower compared with other US banks, and that 'asset quality was somewhat impaired'. Chemical Banking was said to have benefited from its merger with Manufacturers Hanover, and from 'substantial progress' in reducing its portfolio of impaired loans. Underlying earnings had benefited from non-interest income from Treasury and trading activities.</p>

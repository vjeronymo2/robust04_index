			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: L&amp;G increases weighting of bonds in pension funds LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the UK insurance company, has increased the proportion of bonds held by its pension funds and expects to further increase the weighting in favour of fixed-income investments through the 1990s. Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income investment, said the return on UK bonds and UK equities was likely to be much closer in the 1990s than in the 1980s. Since 1986, the total return from UK bonds and equities has been virtually identical, he said. L&amp;G now holds 5 1/2 to 6 per cent of pension fund assets in sterling bonds, against an industry average of close to 3 per cent. Mr Shaw pointed to two main reasons why fund managers are reluctant to switch cash out of equities: Most institutional investors are keen to retain existing fund management business. Maintaining portfolio weightings in line with the industry average is the safest way to achieve this 'defensive' goal. Asset allocation decisions are guided by an actuarial assessment of the returns needed to meet pension fund liabilities. Since most UK pensions are linked to final salary, real dividend growth from equities is the only way to match liabilities in periods of high inflation. Fund managers will be unwilling to switch into bonds until actuarial assumptions about inflation and dividend growth are changed.</p>

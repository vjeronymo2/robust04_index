			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone calls collect Vodafone has a charmingly ruthless approach to maximising value for its shareholders. By any measure the return on capital of its UK cellular phone operation is extraordinary. Operating profit is 46 per cent of sales and cash flow is 58 per cent. Vodafone clearly intends to milk the highest returns it can from this franchise for as long as possible. To that end it is developing a variety of offers to separate its lucrative business users from the lower cost alternatives like Mercury's 'one-2-one' service which is about to be launched. So far the company has been successful in defending its revenue base. It has been helped by apparently price-insensitive customers, few of whom have bothered to switch down to the low-usage tariffs despite the fact that many would be better off. Cellnet has been a weak competitor and, given the similarity in pricing combined with the high returns, there is an argument that competition is not working. Indeed, were it not for the variety of standards about to be introduced, the case for an investigation of pricing by the Office of Fair Trading might already have proved overwhelming. Still, Vodafone cannot defy gravity forever. The company hopes for growth in the UK market, and judging by recent connection figures there is a new nest of chirruping yuppie chicks somewhere. It has also bought overseas franchises to generate future sales. But foreign authorities may take a dim view of excess profits from cellular operations as the price of technology falls. Even the UK government may eventually get the same message.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER HAYDEN AND 'BIG GREEN'  </P> <P> Hayden's Proposition 128 is more than 16,000 words long and contains 39 pages  of mandates, prohibitions, restrictions and new laws that would be forced on  every Californian.  </P> <P> One section of Proposition 128 reads that "No later than January 1, 1995: Any  person shall be prohibited from manufacturing, selling or offering for sale or  use any new motor vehicle . . . if such vehicle contains a vehicular air  conditioner which uses a Group 1 chemical."  </P> <P> Since Hayden's "Group 1" chemical list includes chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) --  the primary chemical used in automobile air-conditioning systems -- the  proposition would result in a substantial portion of new automobiles not being  equipped with air conditioners. And there's nothing -- not even on the drawing  board -- that could replace CFCs.  </P> <P> If Proposition 128 passes and you plan on buying a new car five years from now,  be prepared to sweat a lot!  </P> <P> RON GONG  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

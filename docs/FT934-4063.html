			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Observer: Bank bubble Good news for central bankers. They are in one of the few long-term growth businesses still showing no signs of flagging, according to Morgan Stanley's latest Central Bank Directory. There were more than eight times as many central banks in 1990 as there were in 1900, and in the last three years another 22 have popped up, bringing the total to 170. The bad news for central bankers is that job security is not what it was. In the past year, the bosses of more than a third of central banks have been changed, nearly twice the rate that might have been expected, says editor Robert Pringle, if all had seen out their full terms. Prize for the longest suffering (sorry, serving) governor goes to Erik Hoffmeyer in Denmark, in situ since 1965. He is one of the lucky 19 who have been appointed for an 'indefinite' term. However, this is not always a ticket for life, as Brazil's recent central bank bosses will testify. They have served on average for less than 12 months each, despite having the same sort of deal as Hoffmeyer.</p>

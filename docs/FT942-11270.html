			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not at Harrods Sir, Harrods serves 15,000 cups of coffee a day to the patrons of its 12 restaurants and sells 30,000lb of coffee beans every year to customers of its food halls, but Starbucks does not operate 'a coffee kiosk in Harrod's of London', as you report ('The US wakes up to a new aroma', April 30). Nor does Harrods take an apostrophe. Michael Cole, director of public affairs, Harrods, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7XL</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political desk and agencies] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong legislators yesterday united to condemn  President Jiang Zemin of China for saying that five years of  prosperity and stability proved that the June 4 massacre was  correct. "A bad thing has been turned into a good thing," Jiang  was quoted by official media yesterday as telling the Malaysian  Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. "As a result, our reform and  opening programme has forged ahead with steadier, better, and  even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into  fuller play."    Jiang said the communist leadership had no choice on June  3-4, 1989, but to crush the mass protests. "History shows that  anything conducive to our national stability is good," said  Jiang, who rose to power with the removal of Zhao Ziyang as  party leader. "Without the resolute measures taken then, China  would not have enjoyed today's stability. In the past five  years, China has enjoyed economic development, social stability  and improved livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent  efforts to take stability as an overriding priority. Facts  prove this is absolutely correct."    But Robin Munro, the Hong Kong director of Human Rights  Watch/Asia, questioned whether the suppression of June 4 has  really made China more stable. "The increasing number of  strikes and peasant protests suggest a social pressure cooker  that has all the signs of being dangerously unstable," Munro  said. "By crushing the Tiananmen protests, they enforced a  short-term stability, but evidently at a higher long-term cost."    Jiang's comments -- carried in the Communist Party's  official  mouthpiece, the People's Daily, and other newspapers -- are  likely to be repeated in coming weeks as Chinese people and the  world media reflect on the deadly collision of hope, chaos and  force five years ago.    Hong Kong legislators were dismayed by Jiang's comments. Lau  Chin-shek, a United Democrat, said he believed those who  committed the massacre would be held responsible "sooner or  later". "Jiang's hardline remarks will only remind people to  commemorate the massacre and rekindle people's hatred," he said.    Cheng Kai-nam, the general secretary of the pro-Beijing  Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, urged the  Chinese government to recognise the "mistake" of June 4. "If  people are not happy with their government, they have every  right to express their feelings," he said. "There is no way the  government should use violent means."    Frederick Fung, the leader of the Association for Democracy  and People's Livelihood, said it showed that Beijing had not  modernised in the past five years. "To have a good economic  performance is the basic obligation of a government.    "It is no big deal and should not be linked up with the  philosophy of political repression," he said.    The Liberal Party's Henry Tang also questioned the  justification for the use of force. "There could have been  other means to solve the problem like the use of plastic bullets  and water cannon instead of tank and guns. That is not the only  way of crowd dispersement."    An independent legislator, Andrew Wong, said there was a  simple explanation for Jiang's remarks. "China and Malaysia see  eye to eye on the philosophy of feeding their peoples first.  The two leaders share the same culture," he said. "Second,  China has to show that they do not buy the Americans' concept of  human rights. They made it clear that the renewal of MFN must  not be linked with human rights."</p>

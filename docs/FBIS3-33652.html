It said the group members would provide "more than 120  million dollars to cover the budget deficit of 158 million  dollars" in connection with Palestinian autonomy this year.    The donors -- including the European Community, the United  States, Japan and some Arab countries -- also agreed to the  broad outlines of expenditures and receipts contained in the  first Palestinian budget, developed by the Palestinian Economic  Council for Reconstruction and Development, the announcement  said.    The consultative group, grouping 24 countries and five  international institutions, was supposed to cover the entire  budget deficit. Palestinian delegation head Nabil Kassir told  correspondents that "We did not get everything we need to ensure  economic stability. But we did not come out so badly."    The donors' meeting was held Thursday and Friday at the  World  Bank's European headquarters in Paris.</p>

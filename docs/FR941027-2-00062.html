As part of this process, HHS is piloting an on-line grant information service that will serve the general public, grantee organizations, and government grant-making agencies. This new service, GrantsNet, is a free public-access computer network for finding and exchanging information about HHS and other Federal grant programs. Anyone having a personal computer with internet capability will be able to access GrantsNet. Conceptually, GrantsNet has two components: (1) An on-line informational reference service using gopher server technology; and (2) an interactive mailing list service which groups subscribers with common interests into computer-managed mailing lists for sharing of information and dialogue on certain subjects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This mission of GrantsNet is to serve as a vehicle and catalyst for continuous improvement and innovation in Federal grants management practices, policies, and information dissemination. It will provide a medium for the sharing of ideas, successes, news, lessons learned, and an archival reference library of grant-related legislation, regulations, and policies. GrantsNet will also provide a yellow-page style directory of granting offices, grants management staff and grant program personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major thrust of GrantsNet is to allow members of the public to cut through government red tape_to find the information they want, when they want it, and whom to directly contact for additional information. As such, it is one of the 11 NETworks created under the auspices of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review (NPR). The aims of the NETworks are to provide government-wide information and resources in an on-line, easily accessible, and meaningful manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> When Will It Be Implemented? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HHS has established a gopher and world wide web (WWW) server to facilitate the GrantsNet mission and vision, assisted by the Parklawn Computer Center which provides selected communication services. The Department is taking a phased approach to the implementation of GrantsNet. It is anticipated that GrantsNet will be up and running by the end of October 1994, with fiscal year 1995 serving as the pilot-testing period for populating the gopher information service with grant resource data pertinent to HHS and further developing the interactive mailing list service. Once success of the system has been established and tested, HHS intends to expand the scope of GrantsNet to governmentwide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development and implementation of GrantsNet are carried out by the GrantsNet Core Team which is managed and directed by the Office of Grants and Acquisition Management in the Office of the Secretary. The Chair of the GrantsNet Core Team is Suzanne Neill. Also, as a complement to the Core Team, HHS intends to establish an Advisory Team comprised of individuals from other Federal agencies. By doing so, interagency collaboration and insights to shaping the development of GrantsNet will be gained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> For Further Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be placed on a mailing list for receiving news and updates on GrantsNet, send your name, organization, mailing address, internet address, and phone number to: Suzanne M. Neill, Internet: sneill@os.dhhs.gov, OR, Charles Bish, Internet: cbish@os.dhhs.gov.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, HHS recognizes that for GrantsNet to become a practical and user-friendly information service to the Federal grantee community and to the general public, coordination with interested parties and feedback from users will be important. To that end, the GrantsNet Core Team is interested in any questions or suggestions you may have. This includes recommendations for improving GrantsNet services, as well as the identification of additional grants information, resources, and/or activities that you would like HHS to post. Please address your comments to the GrantsNet Core Team Chair. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Terrence J.

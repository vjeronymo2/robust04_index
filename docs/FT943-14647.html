			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gannett reports record earnings Gannett, the US publishing and broadcasting group, reported record after-tax profits of Dollars 131.8m, or 90 cents a share, in the second quarter as its newspaper advertising revenues climbed and operating costs remained level. A year before, net income was Dollars 113.6m, or 78 cents a share. Gannett, whose publications includes USA Today, earned advertising revenue of Dollars 540m in the period, up from Dollars 513m, while income from newspaper circulation edged up by Dollars 3m to Dollars 213m. Other sources of revenue were broadly in line with the year before, while costs (excluding interest payments) were flat at Dollars 736m. The company, which publishes 83 newspapers across the US, attributed the advance to gains in help-wanted advertising. The 13 per cent increase in classified advertising sales contributed to a 5 per cent overall gain in newspaper advertising revenues, it said. Broadcasting revenues fell slightly, to Dollars 107m, reflecting the sale of three radio stations, though profits climbed 29 per cent to Dollars 39m. Profits from outdoor advertising, by contrast, slid 8 per cent to Dollars 8.2m as revenues fell 1 per cent to Dollars 63m For the first half, net income of Dollars 210m or Dollars 1.43 a share was up from Dollars 180m or Dollars 1.23 a share a year before. Higher revenues in its information services business were behind a 16 per cent rise in net income at Dow Jones in the second quarter. The company, whose interests include the Wall Street Journal, said revenues from information services, which include the Dow Jones/Telerate services, rose 12 per cent to Dollars 239m. The group reported net income of Dollars 46m, or 46 cents a share, for the period, and Dollars 86m, or 86 cents a share, for the first half of 1994, compared with Dollars 40m or 40 cents and Dollars 71m or 71 cents in the same periods a year ago.</p>

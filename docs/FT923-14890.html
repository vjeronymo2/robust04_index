			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Belgium ending conscription Belgium, a Nato member, is to end military conscription by 1994, a move that will roughly halve the 86,000-strong armed forces and allow big savings now the Cold war threat has gone, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Leo Delcroix, defence minister, said yesterday the changes would not mean Belgium would let its Nato partners down or renege on other commitments such as taking part in United Nations missions.</p>

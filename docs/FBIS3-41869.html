			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel is studying the U.S. President's nuclear  nonproliferation initiative. Government elements are currently  discussing the details of the initiative in preparation for the  formulation of Israel's official position, which will then  require the approval of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and  defense minister. The review is taking into account political  and technical considerations, such as the international policy  on the prevention of nuclear proliferation, the U.S. position on  Israel's nuclear capability, and the future of this issue in the  era of peace arrangements.    Senior government elements said in the past that ``Israel  has  no problem with any part of the initiative, and it can live with  it,'' but divergent opinions have been voiced in internal  debates, leading to sharp disagreements.    Various elements have voiced reservations about Israel's  joining the Clinton initiative, asserting that Israel should not  make commitments that will confine its future activities.  [passage omitted on the Clinton initiative and foreign reports]    Senior government elements said that the main problem facing  Israel's nuclear policy is the renewal of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which Israel refused to sign.  This treaty, which was first signed in 1968 and went into  effect in 1970, acknowledges five nuclear states: the United  States, Russia, Britain, France, and China. Many countries, as  well as U.S. Administration figures, have urged Israel to sign  the NPT. The belief in Israel, however, is that the United  States will not exert pressure to secure Israel's signature to  the treaty as long as the peace process continues and Israel is  required to take territorial risks. According to this theory,  Israel will be able to withstand pressure from the international  community, but will find it difficult to stand up to direct U.S.  pressure to join the NPT.    In 1969, the U.S. Administration endorsed the understanding  achieved between President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister  Golda Meir, and that understanding remains the foundation of  Israel's nuclear policy.</p>

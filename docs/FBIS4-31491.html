			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 8 (CTK) -- Slovak ex-Premier  Vladimir Meciar believes the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS), of which he is chairman, will "definitely" win the  autumn elections. "The question is only by how many percent --  whether it will be enough to form a government or whether there  will have to be a coalition," Meciar said today at a meeting  with journalists.    "We're not closed to anybody... we'll go with anyone who the  voters choose for us," he said, adding however that he would not  like to have Hungarian minority leader Miklos Duray as a  coalition partner. If the other parties were not interested in  cooperating with the HZDS, it would be their mistake if they did  not get into the government, Meciar said.    "We are not isolated. We have our half of the playground  which we're playing on, and all the others are in the other  half," he said. The HZDS had calculations of the results, and  they would be totally different from what was forecast in the  polls.    He also said that dispute reigned in the coalition, that the  Hungarian parties were distancing themselves from it because of  rivalry with the Democratic Left Party (SDL) concerning its  position in southern Slovakia. Once again, he forecast that the  SDL, his main political rival, would break up after the  elections.    Meciar presented himself as a defender of the Romany  minority, and "let on" that negotiations between the HZDS and  Romany leaders were in their final phase. Many Romanies are now  declaring themselves to be of Hungarian nationality. "With  today's spread of power, it could happen that the Hungarians do  not get into power if the Romanies come forward as one political  grouping," he said.    If the HZDS wins the elections it will be able to come to a  agreement with Hungary on the conclusion of a basic treaty,  Meciar said. "I am an optimist as far as finding a solution to  relations with Hungary in the near future goes," he added.  Interest in European integration would result in a "major  settlement" between the two countries, which would put aside  historical and psychological barriers such as memories of  Magyarisation, wartime occupation and the presence of Hungarian  troops in Slovakia in 1968.    While his opponents accuse him of worsening relations with  Hungary, Meciar said today that during secret talks the late  Hungarian president, Josef Antall, had agreed to Slovakia's  request that the inviolability of borders be confirmed. "The  only problem was whether to declare it directly or with  reference to international documents," Meciar said, adding that  the same agreement had also been made with ex-Premier Peter  Boross, but had not been made public due to the Hungarian  election campaign.    On the situation after the socialist election victory in  Hungary, Meciar said that two groups were forming. One wanted  relations with Slovakia to improve first, and then a solution to  the minorities issue, while the other wanted to solve the  minorities issue first and then improve relations.    "The rhetoric of Gyula Horn (chairman of the Hungarian  Socialist Party) is not so very different from Antall's  rhetoric. He has changed the terminology, but as regards  autonomy (for the Hungarian minority) he has not changed  anything. Some of the things he has said about Slovaks have not  inspired hope either. Nonetheless, we believe that it was  pre-election or post-election euphoria, that he will return to  political realism and that in the interest of improving  relations we can sign an agreement in a few months.    Meciar ascribed his bad reputation in the media to  "expedient  propaganda" which until the end of 1992 was supposed to save  Czechoslovakia and afterwards served new interest groups in the  world. However, he admitted that the HZDS and former government  information policy had been "catastrophic" and "sinfully  neglected."    He added that "one neighbouring state last year alone spent  98 million dollars on creating its reputation," part of which  had been allegedly spent on forming a negative image for Meciar.  "And we did not put up even a heller [as recieved] against it.  That is not the way to build an image," Meciar said.</p>

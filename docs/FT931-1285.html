			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / South Africa admits it produced nuclear arms: Weapons were dismantled in 1989, de Klerk says SOUTH AFRICA admitted yesterday that it had developed and produced nuclear weapons in the late 1970s. President FW de Klerk said, however, that such weapons were dismantled after he took power in 1989. In a statement to parliament in Cape Town, Mr de Klerk provided the first confirmation of what international atomic experts had long suspected: that South Africa had produced weapons-grade uranium and used it to produce a nuclear bomb. Mr de Klerk said he took the decision to dismantle the weapons soon after becoming president in September 1989, in an apparent attempt to prevent nuclear weapons and technology falling into the hands of a future black government dominated by the African National Congress. He came under heavy pressure to wind up South Africa's weapons programme from the US and other foreign governments concerned at the ANC's links with Col Muammer Gadaffi of Libya. South Africa's six nuclear fission warheads were dismantled early in 1990, and the nuclear material used to produce them was downgraded so that it could no longer be used for weapons. Mr de Klerk said all hardware and design information used in the bombs' construction was also destroyed - again, to frustrate attempts by a future government to revive a nuclear weapons industry - although many of those who developed the weapons remain in government employ. He insisted that South Africa had developed the weapons entirely with domestic technology, and that it neither imported nor exported technology or materials. There has long been speculation that South Africa co-operated with Israel on its nuclear weapons programme. In July 1991, South Africa acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which it was required to declare its uranium stockpiles to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr de Klerk said yesterday that South Africa held no further stocks of weapons-grade uranium. In Vienna, the IAEA said it would send inspectors to verify that the nuclear programme had ended. The airborne warheads were constructed at a cost of R800m (Pounds 170m) after a decision in 1974 to launch a nuclear weapons programme aimed at deterrence, Mr de Klerk said. The plan was to make their existence known to the US if Soviet military expansion in southern Africa threatened South Africa, he said. Under further pressure from the US, it is understood the government will soon terminate a separate programme to develop launch vehicles for space satellites - long viewed as a smokescreen for a ballistics missile programme. George Graham reports from Washington: Mr de Klerk's announcement seems likely to clear up a dispute with the IAEA and the US about whether South Africa was accounting in full for its production of nuclear material. 'I think this is just the kind of thing South Africa should have done and North Korea may yet have to do,' said Mr Gary Milhollin, an arms proliferation expert at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington. Nuclear proliferation experts say there was a discrepancy between South Africa's uranium enrichment records and independent calculations of the likely output of the plant.

Teammate Dan O'Neil  completed 14 of 22 passes for 204 yards, including a 49-yard touchdown pass to  Tino Chavez.  </P> <P> Vince Church, a Kennedy running back, ran for 107 yards in 12 carries and  scored three touchdowns to lead the Fighting Irish to a 28-12 Garden Grove  League victory over Los Amigos.  </P> <P> Estancia's Josh Wojtkiewicz ran for a season-high 173 yards and a pair of  touchdowns in 21 carries, lifting the unbeaten Eagles to their eighth victory  in a row, a 28-10 Sea View League decision over Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> ODDS AND ENDS  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery's giant nose guard, Chris Maumalanga (6-3, 330), announced  after his team's 26-6 loss to Mater Dei that he had made an oral commitment to  attend Arizona State next fall.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach's cheerleaders came up with the most original, yet least  original, banner of the season. Before the second half, the cheerleaders  brought out a banner with a blue strip across the middle which read "Run  Through." The Oilers proceeded to run through the plain-wrap banner.  </P> <P> Marina inside linebacker David McLeod, a three-year starter, established a  school record with 282 career tackles. McLeod's 15 tackles in Marina's 20-8  loss to Edison Friday night moved him past Lee Knowles, who had 271 tackles  from 1977-79.  </P> <P> DEFENDER OF THE DAY  </P> <P> Ocean View linebacker Greg Johnston, 5-feet-8 and 180 pounds, deflected four  passes and had one sack Friday night. Johnston intercepted one of his  deflections to set up a touchdown in the Seahawks' 21-7 Sunset League victory  over Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD  </P> <P> 'We made him look pretty good, I think.'  </P> <P>  -- Dave Holland, Corona del Mar coach, after Tustin quarterback Andy Borza  completed 11 of 14 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns in a 24-7 victory  over the Sea Kings.  </P> <P> SHOWDOWNS  </P> <P> El Toro boosters wore T-shirts that read: "This Valley's Not Big Enough for  Both of Us" and the novelty items were appropriate for its showdown with  Mission Viejo. Fans arrived as early as 5:30 for the South Coast League game at  expanded Mission Viejo High and nearly 1,000 were in the stadium by 6 p.m. The  stadium, with a capacity of 6,000 after the addition of bleachers, was full by  kickoff, but no fans were turned away from the 21-14 El Toro victory.  </P></p>

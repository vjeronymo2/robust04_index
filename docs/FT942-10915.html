			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: New 'Cos' with a twist The question one always wants to ask at this opera is 'How do the couples pair off at the end?'. Mozart and Da Ponte left the conclusion of Cos fan tutte ambiguous and it seemed that productions have tried out every possible answer - until this one came along. The new management at English National Opera has already stated that it sees one of its prime duties as renewing the standard repertoire. During the 1980s Mozart was kept out of the hands of ENO's band of fire-raisers, who wanted to watch traditional stagings burn. Jonathan Miller and John Cox were more interested in period social values and left behind Mozart productions of a gentler nature. Nevertheless, a start has to be made some time and this new Cos fan tutte is presumably the beginning of a renewal of the Mozart/Da Ponte trilogy. The opera is an open invitation to a producer. Its six characters live in a world of their own, untouched by any outside intervention as they play out all the roles in a patently unreal comedy. Almost any time or place will do. ENO's producer, Nicolette Molnar has chosen the 1950s. The villa has a telephone, natty silk pyjamas are coming into fashion and the home-help finds an amusing new use for her vacuum cleaner, but all this is mere cosmetics: despite its trendy 1950s hairstyle, the opera has the same profile underneath. In Jacqueline Gunn's semi-abstract set, a mixture of decaying neo-classical columns and fancy 1950s iron work, the locale also remains Naples. Despina is very much a dark-haired Neapolitan, neatly played by Sally Harrison. Don Alfonso looks more a debonair man of culture from the North, in whose cravat and white trousers Richard Van Allan looks entirely at ease, even if he needs more voice these days. Neill Archer is a vocally rugged Ferrando; Christopher Booth-Jones puts the words across strongly as Guglielmo. The two men play well together and their disguise as a gross pair of Texan cowboys works better than one feels it should. Like the production, the conductor Nicholas Kok gives the opera more pace than depth. One of the main pleasures is the musical care taken over the ensembles, not least the well-matched singing of the two ladies. Vivian Tierney's soprano has a fine strength and poise, while Susan Bickley's mezzo complements her with a darker bite to the tone. After the men have left for war, it is touching to see Fiordiligi cuddling her teddy and Dorabella sniffling into her tissues - humour and sentiment on a knife-edge, as they always should be in this opera. And what of the twist at the end? As the two couples get ready for the wedding, it is Fiordiligi and Dorabella lookalikes under the brides' veils who are masquerading this time. The real girls are making a quick exit out of the back door, leaving the men to learn their own lesson. After all, if they think all women are the same, it does not matter which they marry: Cos fan tutte indeed]</p>

Denktash complained that some Turkish Cypriot politicians have accused him of  being too uncompromising in talks on reunifying Cyprus. The latest round of  U.N.-sponsored talks collapsed earlier this month over Turkish Cypriot demands  for self-determination. Cyprus has been split into northern Turkish and  southern Greek sectors since 1974.  </P></p>

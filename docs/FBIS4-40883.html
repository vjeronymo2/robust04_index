			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Donetsk 20 June TASS -- "Unless the price of  Ukrainian goods is lower than that of Russian goods, customs  checkpoints must continue to function," Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk said.    Speaking at a meeting with the workers of the Azovmash  machine-building plant in Mariupol, Ukrainian port city on the  Azov Sea, on Monday, Kravchuk said that "we cannot allow the  scanty Ukrainian market to become empty. If we open up the  borders now, the major part of consumer goods and agricultural  produce will be taken out to the Russian Federation."    "Presently, due to objective reasons we have a situation  when  the same goods made in Russia and Ukraine have different  production costs," Kravchuk continued. He believes that  production cost largely depends on the price of energy carriers,  the bulk of which Ukraine receives from Russia.    "If Ukrainian enterprises paid for oil and gas as much as  Russian plants and fabrics pay, then we would need no customs  checkpoints. Trade between Ukraine and Russia would become state  business, not private," he said.    Kravchuk stressed that "trade relations between Ukraine and  Russia must develop and expand." "Such great powers must have  strong friendly and economic ties," he added.</p>

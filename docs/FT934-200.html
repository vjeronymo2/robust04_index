			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Eurotunnel drops Pounds 1bn suit against UK, France: Deal gives operator 10 more years to run tunnel Eurotunnel is to drop most of its estimated Pounds 500m-Pounds 1bn of claims against the British and French governments in return for winning an extra 10 years on its concession to operate the Channel tunnel. The concession will now end in 2052. The deal between Eurotunnel and the two governments, announced last night, clears the way for Eurotunnel to complete negotiations with its bankers for additional funding to cover start-up costs for the tunnel, which opens in March. 'It's a deal, and yet another settlement of an open issue, about which we can be pretty pleased,' Eurotunnel said. A French government official said: 'This largely resolves the outstanding issues between the French and British governments and Eurotunnel.' The cost of the tunnel has risen from Pounds 6bn in 1987 to about Pounds 10bn, partly because of the costs incurred by Eurotunnel on safety, security and environmental measures demanded by the two governments. Eurotunnel had intended to make claims against them to recover the costs. 'In the past six years the tunnel has evolved significantly, and in costly fashion,' it said. Under a deal agreed in principle on Christmas Eve and signed yesterday, Eurotunnel's concession is extended from 55 to 65 years, running from enactment of the Channel Tunnel Act in 1987. In exchange, Eurotunnel will drop most of its intended claims. It would still have to find the whole cost of the project. The agreement should facilitate, and is conditional upon, Eurotunnel raising enough finance to start operations. Eurotunnel has raised about Pounds 8.95bn, but has said it needs at least another Pounds 1bn, mainly to cover debt servicing before the tunnel begins to break even on a cash basis in 1998. It has to reach agreement with its banks by January 4 on the financing plan for the Pounds 1bn, of which at least Pounds 500m should come from a rights issue in spring 1994. The latest deal comes a month after a CDollars 746m claim over cost overruns was settled between Bombardier, a Canadian supplier of trains for the tunnel Shuttle services, and Transmanche Link, the main contractor. In July, TML itself and Eurotunnel ended their long conflict over who should be responsible for heavy cost overruns. The only remaining issue involves Eurotunnel's claims against British Rail and France's SNCF. See Lex</p>

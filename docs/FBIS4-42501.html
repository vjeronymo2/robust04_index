			<p>BFN     [Text] Rostock (DDP/ADN) -- FDP [Free Democratic Party]  Chairman Klaus Kinkel has today, as expected, proposed to the  federal party conference of the Free Democrats in Rostock that  the Bonn Government coalition with the Union [CDU/CSU] be  continued after the general election on 16 October. Kinkel  stressed that the party conference should "send out" this signal  "to all parts of the country." The FDP, "on the basis of its  liberal program," intends "to continue the successful coalition  with the CDU/CSU in the next legislative period."    The party conference is to vote on this proposal this  afternoon. Kinkel expects that an overwhelming majority of the  approximately 660 delegates will vote in favor.    The FDP chairman pointed out that the election program of  the  Free Democrats would be adopted by the Rostock party conference.  He emphasized that this will give a distinctive stamp to the  FDP. At the same time, Kinkel warned against a red-green or a  grand coalition in Bonn. A strong FDP would be the guarantee  that this would not happen and that "common sense" would  continue to govern for the benefit of the country.    [Berlin DDP/ADN in German at 1323 GMT on 3 June adds the  following: "Rostock (DDP/ADN) -- The FDP national party  conference has voted by a great majority in favor of continuing  the Bonn coalition with the CDU/CSU after the general election  on 16 October. The approximately 660 delegates in Rostock today  voted in favor of a proposal to that effect by the party  leadership."]</p>

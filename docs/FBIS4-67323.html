			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Additional New Charges for </F> Heroin Smuggling"]    [Text] Two Nigerian men who are suspected of possession and  smuggling of heroin received new charges when Helsinki Municipal  Court heard the case on Thursday [5 May].    The men, who are suspected of belonging to an international  syndicate distributing Nigerian heroin, were arrested in  Helsinki at the end of March. According to police, the heroin  was smuggled to Germany and the United States via Finland.    Police have seized as much as 700 grams of heroin from an  indicted 24-year-old student. This amount would have been worth  several million markkas on the street. The student had been  previously charged for possession of approximately half a  kilogram of heroin.    On Thursday the prosecutor asked punishment for two other  Nigerians for aggravated narcotics violations.    According to the indictment, a 32-year-old public relations  man had, with the aid of a Finnish passport, sent out 250-350  grams of heroin from this country. The man denied all charges.  He was previously sentenced to five months imprisonment for  having smuggled marijuana into Finland. The prosecutor now  demanded punishment for him and for a 36-year-old student for  possession of heroin.    The student denied he had sought economic gain from the  activity, saying he had been holding the narcotics as a favor.    All three men have resided in Finland for many years.    The National Criminal Police got on the gang's trail through  cooperation with the DEA and U.S. Customs. Authorities in  Finland and the United States moved against the gang at the same  time in the United States and Finland. Several suspects have  also been indicted in the United States.    The court will continue dealing with this case on 19 May.  Pending this, the three are being held.</p>

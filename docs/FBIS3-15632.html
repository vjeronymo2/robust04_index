			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruta Skatikaite: "Local Rather Than Seimas </F> Deputies Are Concerned With the Ignalina Plant"]    [Text] Having demanded information about the planned  construction of a monstrous storage site for radioactive waste,  local deputies expressed their doubt in the need for such a  facility two and a half years ago. This affected energy  specialists who later abandoned this outdated project. Ignalina  deputies are now concerned with choosing a site for containers  of radioactive fuel. Participants in a 23 February meeting of  local deputies with Energy Deputy Minister S. Kutas and V.  Shevaldin, director of the Ignalina nuclear power plant,  discussed the expediency of enlarging the area of the  radioactive waste storage yard in Lithuania. Are imports of  radioactive waste -- which bring only modest income to energy  workers and leave the most dangerous source of radiation in  Lithuania for centuries -- permissible? Why has the foundation  for managing the nuclear plant after its closure not yet been  established, even though the plant has 10-15 years of operation  remaining? Why are research studies about the concentration of  radioactive materials in the air, water, and soil not  publicized? Why are the health of people living near the  Ignalina plant and the possible changes in their bodies not  examined?    Since the energy minister has not submitted any definite  proposals concerning the future of the nuclear station, local  deputies protest against the increase in radioactive waste on  their territory. Moreover, they are interested in benefits for  people living within a 30-km radius of the plant. They also  demand that bonuses for discomfort be paid not only to employees  of budget organizations, but also to all inhabitants.    Deputies will also adopt a final decision at their session  in  mid-March.</p>

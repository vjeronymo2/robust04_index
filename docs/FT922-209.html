			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Fed chairman faces pressure for rates cut MR Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, is under increasing pressure to lower US interest rates following a presidential demand last week to do so. Whether or not he will resist this pressure is to be settled at today's meeting of the Fed's open market committee, which sets guidelines for monetary policy. President George Bush said in an interview with the New York Times last week: 'I'd like to see another lowering of interest rates. I think there's room to do that.' Unless a batch of economic statistics due this week is stronger than expected, the betting on Wall Street is that the Fed will lower rates again. Mr Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, believes pressure on Mr Greenspan will prove 'irresistible'. However, he and other analysts say the Fed may delay the cut to avoid appearing to respond to overt political pressure. If the Fed decides to ease, a move could come before Mr Greenspan delivers his Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony on July 21. Most likely would be a quarter point cut in the overnight federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent. This might be accompanied by a half point cut in the discount rate to 3 per cent if the Fed felt the need to send a powerful expansionary signal to financial markets. The mounting pressure for another interest rate cut will seem puzzling outside the US. The Commerce Department has just reported growth in the first quarter at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent, stronger than in most big economies. The dollar is weak and inflation is running at about 3.5 per cent, well above the level that would be regarded as desirable in Japan or Germany. US rates, moreover, are already at their lowest level in a generation. US analysts see things differently. They fear economic growth in the current quarter will fall well short of the first quarter rate, mainly because of a slowdown in consumer spending and housing, which powered the first phase of recovery. Figures for new home sales released yesterday showed a 5.6 per cent decline in May, the fourth monthly fall in a row. The fear is that a slowdown in domestic demand will feed through into renewed weakness of industrial production and jobs.</p>

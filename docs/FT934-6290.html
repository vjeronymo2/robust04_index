			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lonrho in Dollars 250m Uzbek gold venture More than USDollars 250m will be spent over eight years on a gold mine in the newly-independent republic of Uzbekistan, once part of the former Soviet Union, Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate, announced yesterday. Lonrho will develop the mine jointly with two Uzbek government-owned companies. Mining is scheduled to start early in 1996 at an initial annual rate of 320,000 troy ounces, increasing after about four years to full production of 480,000 ounces. The first phase would cost Amantaytau Goldfields, set up to develop the mine, Dollars 100m. Lonrho would contribute about Dollars 30m and the International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, Dollars 5m. Lonrho gave a strong hint that bacteria might be used to produce the Uzbek gold. The group's 45-per-cent-owned associate, Ashanti Goldfields in Ghana, is at present installing the world's biggest biological oxidation plant, using technology developed by Gencor of South Africa. This will use a naturally-occuring bacteria, thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, to release gold from difficult ores instead of employing heat and pressure vessels. Lonrho said tests carried out so far indicated that the Uzbek ores were particularly amenable to biological oxidation. The process was particularly attractive because it would not leave any harmful soluble materials in the waste to damage the delicate desert ecology - the proposed mine will be in the Kyzylkum desert, about 560km north-west of Tashkent. Other finance for the project will come from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The UK Know-How Fund helped to finance a pre-feasibility study.</p>

[Demirel] At this time, Turkey continues to enjoy the fruits  of democracy with all its principles, bodies, and concepts.  Democratic freedoms have been institutionalized and the  constitutional system guarantees democratic freedoms and the  observance of human rights for everyone.    Turkey has successfully gone through the transition process  to a free market economy. So far 70 percent of Turkey's economy  has been liberalized. A substantial improvement in the  qualification of human resources and of the potential of  entrepreneurs have helped us open rapidly to the world.    Along with the conclusion of the Cold War, Turkey's  geopolitical and economic situation gained in importance and we  have become an island of stability both in our area and in the  world. At this point, we are in the midst of the instability in  our area. In accordance with the UN Charter and international  law, we assume responsibility in bringing peace and stability in  these sources of conflict.    [Oroveanu] Mr. President, with what thoughts have you come  to Romania on this visit?    [Demirel] The Turkish people have always harbored feelings  of friendship for the Romanian people. We have lived in peace  throughout history, both during good and bad times. We share  common ideals and aims regarding the promotion of our nation's  wellbeing and regarding peace and stability in the area in which  we live. Our relations are based on mutual respect and  cooperation. Thus, the means to intensify relations between the  two countries have always been clear.    It is enough to consider the list of recent official visits,  at all levels, to Turkey or to Romania to realize the potential  of our political will to continue to develop our friendly  relations. These visits are excellent opportunities to identify  -- on the basis of the already existing potential -- new and  varied realms of cooperation between our countries. These  visits also permit us to consult each other about important  questions of regional interest for both countries.    The search for new opportunities of cooperation regarding  global problems is also one of our common aims.    Finally, we believe that the "Treaty of Friendship,  Good-Neighborliness, and Cooperation" between Turkey and Romania  reflects the desire for peace by the two peoples.    With these thoughts I am looking forward to my visit to  Romania.    [Oroveanu] Considering the political, historic, and  geographical situation, in your opinion, what role may Turkey  and Romania play together in our area and in the existing  overall international relations?    [Demirel] The traditional friendship between Turkey and  Romania does not only represent the foundation for intensifying  cooperation between the two countries in all areas, but also  constitutes a factor for ensuring an atmosphere of peace,  understanding, and cooperation in the Balkans.    Turkey and Romania are two important countries in this area.  From a regional point of view, our countries are important in  the Balkans both in terms of population and economic potential.  Both endorse a responsible policy of promoting peace and  stability in this area. Both are struggling for seeking a just  and lasting solution to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Their desire to contribute to peace in this area is welcomed by  the international community. Therefore, it is natural for the  excellent relations between Turkey and Romania to contribute to  establishing stability in the Balkans.    At the same time, both Turkey and Romania want to be part of  the European structures, whose principles they honestly embrace.  They are both members of the Treaty of Cooperation in the Black  Sea Area and both support the initiatives for cooperation in the  Balkans. Turkey and Romania and, like them, the entire area have  gained a great deal from cooperating within these forums, as  well as within other regional and international organizations.    [Oroveanu] Mr. President, in your view, what are the chances  for the cooperation projects in the Black Sea area and its  immediate vicinity?    [Demirel] As you know, there is a significant economic  potential in the Black Sea area, including natural resources.  We believe that economic cooperation in the Black Sea basin  will help the countries in this area benefit from this  potential. We are confident that the establishment of lasting  multilateral economic relations based on free trade will  contribute to the prosperity of this area.    The chances for the success of the Treaty of Cooperation in  the Black Sea Area (BSEC) affirm themselves along with the  transformation process experienced by most of the economies in  the BSEC countries. One has to bear in mind, however, that BSEC  represents a long-term investment the fruits of which will be  noted in the long run. Anyhow, there are already a number of  short-term projects under way; the accords on their  implementation have already been signed. These projects will be  followed by short-, medium- and long-term projects in the area  of transportation.    A problem we may confront is the one of identifying  appropriate sources for financing these projects. Our  experience proves that the true problem consists in presenting  feasible projects. The creation of the Bank for Trade and  Development of the Black Sea proves the growing interest of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and of  international financial circles in the BSEC projects, and it  also proves that feasible projects may ensure their own  financing.    Thus, if the private sector, the leading force behind BSEC,  may come up with feasible projects, there is a great chance that  they will be implemented.    Within this context, we attach particular importance to  developing economic and trade relations with Romania. I would  like to remind you that the number of Turkish companies doing  business with Romania has exceeded 2,500 in the past four years  and the capital invested in this country amounts to $30 million.  During my visit, we will attend the opening of the  Turkish-Romanian Bank. The results we have achieved in these  four years should not be underrated. We are sure that this  positive trend will also continue in the not too distant future.    [Oroveanu] Mr. President, would you like to address a few  words to the readers of our paper?    [Demirel] As I have mentioned before, Turkey and Romania  share numerous goals and ideals regarding the promotion of the  well-being and prosperity of their two peoples and in the area  as a whole. We have to continue to make efforts in this  direction. Both our countries have large resources, both human  and natural, supported by their attachment to the democratic  ideals and the principles of the free economy, so that nothing  can hamper the settlement of the problems we are facing. From  this point of view, we are ready to support Romania by any  possible means. We wish the Romanian people success in  fulfilling their aspirations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Corneliu Coposu, president of the National </F> Peasant Christian Democratic Party, by Roxana Badralexi; place  and date not given: "It Is Not Up to the Social Democracy Party  of Romania To Make Concessions and Mr. Iliescu Is Not Ready To  Make Concessions"]    [Text] [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, have you noted any  compatibility between your party and the ruling party?    [Coposu] It is obvious that, regardless of the  incompatibility and doctrine differences between various  political groupings, there are also prospects of compatibility.  Normally, each political grouping should give priority to the  struggle for a program that can please the citizens they are  representing. Consequently, this is a likely common target. Of  course, one can also add that there are very many demagogic  political groupings. However, one should generally proceed from  the viewpoint -- incontestable, in principle -- that all parties  want the good of the people.    [Badralexi] What about the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR]?    [Coposu] This is a party without a program. It is being  kept together by the temporary interests of its members. If  these interests disappear, the party will disappear, too.  However, even without this lack of a program, one cannot say  that all its components are totally devoid of good intentions  for the country. In my opinion, there are two trends within the  PDSR. One -- which for the time being is in a majority -- is  the radical trend, consisting of people with a crypto-communist  mentality, who have not yet rid themselves of the Stalinist  methods.    [Badralexi] Can you give some names?    [Coposu] I do not want to get that specific. There is a  known group which has emerged along these lines and which does  not make any bones about its orientation. Another group, more  modest in numbers, which is unfortunately subject to the moral  pressure of the radicals, has a more moderate tinge. Of course,  there are valuable people among the moderates. Do not ask me to  name them, because I will not become personal in this respect,  either.    [Badralexi] At least tell me what you think about Messrs.  Nastase [PDSR executive president] and [Pdsr President] Gherman:  Are they moderate or radical?    [Coposu] Both are moderates, in my opinion. However, as I  have already said, this group is unfortunately under the moral  pressure of the others. Our older hopes about the increase of  the moderate group's share have not come true. Therefore, if  the situation is not worse than a few months ago, it is at least  the same now as then. However, to answer your question, I will  just refer to the moderate group. There would be some  compatibility between that PDSR group and our party -- not  necessarily programmatic, but a compatibility regarding the  short-term common targets for this period and a pragmatic  approach to working out a crisis program.    [Badralexi] Is it possible that the PDSR might see no other  way out at this point than to leave the initiative up to the  moderate group? If so, do you think it possible that the PNTCD  would back a monocolor PDSR government?    [Coposu] In my opinion, it is not up to the PDSR or one of  its two aforementioned groups to make concessions. This is the  prerogative of President Ion Iliescu, who has a monopoly over  the political power in Romania. But Mr. Iliescu is not ready to  make any kind of concessions; he wants to keep all levers of  power.    [Badralexi] What might prevent him from realizing that he  has no other choice?    [Coposu] Maybe an unjustified fear of the consequences of a  change in his absolute power.    [Badralexi] Consequences that might affect him personally,  or are you talking about political consequences?    [Coposu] I think he is worried about his person. All the  assurances we gave him were disregarded by him, as they are  difficult to be believed by a man who thinks with another kind  of logic than ours. Of course, Mr. Iliescu has not yet realized  that our party and the opposition in general has other goals  than witch hunting. Proof of our mentality is the fact that in  the past four year no serious member of the PNTCD or the  Association of Former Political Detainees [AFDP] has expressed  any desire to take revenge against the inquisitors.    [Badralexi] Will the president manage to suppress this fear  for his own security?    [Coposu] Unfortunately, I am pessimistic in this respect.  My impression, which I do not want confirmed, is that the  president is not ready to give up his monopoly of power, unless  he is faced with the threat of popular wrath. This is something  that should be avoided, since it might have a destabilizing  effect and might delay the normalization of the situation in  Romania. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, after following a  logical line of thinking which I believe he has also followed, I  have come to the conclusion that he is reticent about the  usefulness of concessions that can lead to the pacification of  Romanian society and to reconciliation.    [Badralexi] Let us talk now about the president's  government. Would a possible change of premiers also change your  position on backing a monocolor government?    [Coposu] No, because it is not Mr. Vacaroiu's presence  that prevents a change of attitude. Right now, there are only  two solutions: a change of the parliamentary majority or early  elections. The governmental reshuffle should be done in such a  way as to gain internal and external credibility. This cannot  be achieved through a simple rotation of persons and an abusive  interpretation of the constitution, by avoiding to submit the  new cabinet members to the Parliament's vote. As long as a  parliamentary majority that supports a credible and competent  government cannot be put together, there is only the alternative  of early elections. However, nobody wants them, since that  would mean further social destabilization that could drag on for  half a year, let alone the inherent expenses and the stagnation  of reform that a ballot would imply. However, I would like to  be proven wrong and a new parliamentary majority can be formed,  a majority which will support a stable and more credible  government than the one which has brought the country to the  threshold of disaster.    [Badralexi] Would a PDSR government with an authentic  reforming program, which enjoys the support of the parliamentary  opposition, imply a change of the parliamentary majority?    [Coposu] Provided that this government is supported by that  part of the PDSR which we have called moderate. But this is not  the important thing. The important thing is to work out a  crisis program supported by all responsible forces, at least for  a certain period of time.    [Badralexi] How do you concretely see such a parliamentary  change?    [Coposu] There are several aspects here. There is the  possibility of a minority government which has abandoned its  alliance with the extremist parties and is supported in all its  democratic initiatives by the current opposition. What I have  in mind is a government set up by the moderate wing of the PDSR  and the representatives of the opposition, that is the  Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the Democratic Party  [PD(FSN)]. Together, these forces could put together a  comfortable majority. There is also the possibility of an  opposition government supported by the PDSR moderate wing.    [Badralexi] Would that be enough?    [Coposu] Yes, provided that it gets the support of a part of  the PDSR. This hypothesis cannot be excluded. However, in  order to achieve this, there must be a political will for change  -- something which unfortunately does not yet exist. For the  time being, the only valid hypothesis remains that of a minority  government. As far as the support of the opposition is  concerned, this could be granted not only to back the  implementation of the IMF memorandum, which is non-negotiable,  but also to promote a number of indispensable laws which have  been deliberately postponed until now. Without these laws, one  cannot even dream of a process of normalization or a beginning  of democratization. One must prove in actual fact the desire to  carry out the reform. The first stage of any negotiations  should be the working out of a program. The other aspects are  secondary and giving priority to them is proof of a lack of  seriousness.    [Badralexi] If we believe that President Iliescu reaches the  conclusion that he has no other choice than to make concessions  and part with his pathological fear, what would be the maximum  concessions that the PNTCD is ready to make for a possible  cooperation with the rulers?    [Coposu] Our party's principles are nonnegotiable. I  believe that one should not ask from us to make any greater  concessions than our declared readiness to support all the  democratic measures designed to take the country out of the  crisis. Therefore, instead of isolating ourselves and watching  the catastrophe unfold, we have expressed our readiness to  partake effectively in solving the crisis. However, I do not  consider it as a concession, since this is the moral obligation  of all responsible political factors in Romania.    [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, before we wind up this interview, I  would like you to tell me whether a Romanian politician today  can say what Iuliu Maniu [leader of the National Peasant Party  between the two world wars] said at one time: "I have ruled the  country for 20 years from the opposition."    [Coposu] Well, Maniu did not lie...    [Badralexi] We know that, but would such a thing be possible  today?    [Coposu] This would be possible -- if not today, then  tomorrow. After all, the role of the opposition in a democracy  is equally as important as the role of the government. The  checking done to the government's administration by a strong  opposition is equally as important as the governing act itself.  Maniu was right, the country can also be governed from the  opposition. On the other hand, the absence of an opposition  leads to either totalitarianism or catastrophe. Particularly if  the political power gets into the hands of incompetent people  devoid of patriotism, whose only preoccupation is to ensure the  endless prolongation of their power of decision, which they have  acquired at a certain point.</p>

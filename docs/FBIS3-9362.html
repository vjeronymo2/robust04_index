			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oliviu Gherman, president of the Senate and </F> the Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, by Ileana Lucaciu;  place and date not given: "Stupidity Means To Be Frozen in  Blueprints"]    [Text]  <H3>  There Is No Contradiction Between Monarchy and  Progress or Between Republic and Progress </H3>   [Lucaciu] I know from very reliable sources that you are a  passionate and very good bridge player. When do you find the  time to indulge in your hobby?    [Gherman] Unfortunately, I do not have too much time for it.  After all these things quiet down -- which make each week seem  like the week in which the world was created, since we have so  much to do each week that when we reach the seventh day we no  longer feel like resting any more -- that is, after we finish  with these weekly remakes of the initial week of the world  creation, I will find some time for bridge.    [Lucaciu] Do you think that this race against the clock will  ever end?    [Gherman] It is not fully up to me to ensure that we reach  such a normal working week; to a large extent, it is up to the  wisdom of the political forces in Romania.    [Lucaciu] Your duties as Senate president have made you  travel abroad quite a lot. If you were ever to return to those  places as a simple tourist, which country would you choose?    [Gherman] First of all, I would like to specify that my  function makes me do some traveling abroad, but not quite a lot,  as you said. All these duties at the head of various  delegations have meant that, with very few exceptions, I saw  almost nothing of the countries I visited. If the schedule for  the delegation members is somewhat more flexible and allows them  to also tour a given city, my program is usually so heavy that I  can hardly see anything of it at all. Let me give you an  example. I attended a NATO meeting in Denmark and I did not  even find the time to go out into Copenhagen's streets even  once. If I were to return to one of these countries, I think I  would choose one of the two Asian countries I visited, and not  because they happen to be among the ones I visited recently. I  would choose Japan because it managed to achieve a formidable  blend of historical tradition and the people's spirit of  sacrifice and devotion to work. I would also go back to India,  the country I fell in love with when I was invited there in the  70's to give some lectures in physics at three or four  university centers. India has instilled in me a certain  philosophy of peace and nonaggression.    [Lucaciu] You have recently returned from Japan, where you  had the honor of being received by Japan's emperor. At this  point in history, Japan is one of the important economic forces  of the world. It is an overdeveloped country headed by a  traditional monarchy. How do you see the relationship between  the monarchy and Japan's development?    [Gherman] There is no contradiction between the monarchy and  the development of that country. Japan has built its political  balance around the Imperial Court and around the structures that  have led to the existence of the Imperial Court. I visited  several homes of shoguns from the last century. There was a  prevalent cult of power and of the master, and this has reached  extraordinary dimensions in Japan. In 1868, the powers that be  came up with the current solution of an imperial family, which  took over the country's leadership, with all the shoguns  accepting that solution. The life of the Japanese society, which  first developed around the courts of the shoguns and later  around the Imperial Court, has created a most respectable  tradition. You must realize that there is no contradiction  between monarchy and progress, as there is no contradiction  between the republic and progress. They are accepted forms in  various countries. One cannot say that the Nordic countries,  which are all monarchies, are economically backward. That would  be a formidable gaffe. I do not believe that a certain form of  government, be it monarchy or republic, could be the key to  success per se. It is more a matter of choice by the respective  society and none of the aforementioned models of government can  open the gates of paradise by themselves.  <H5>  Politics Are Being Played by Ear </H5>   [Lucaciu] I know that you are a great lover of classic  music. Could you make an analogy between our political life and  a famous musical score?    [Gherman] Paradoxically, I would compare our political life  to Bartok's orchestra concerto. There is a great sound  potential, both in our life and in Bartok's music. Bartok  managed to produce complete order in his music, although a  superficial listening to his concerto might not reveal this  complete order. There is a sensation of musical cacophony  there, but if you listen carefully, you realize it is an  extraordinary score. If you look at the political effervescence  of our society, everything seems to be a political cacophony.  However, I believe that there is a basic substance there which,  if one watches carefully, can be discovered in our social and  political life. However, we will have to create some order in  our own backyard.    [Lucaciu] You mention the need for order. It does not seem  to exist in many parties. Let us take for example the liberal  movement, which is almost entirely crippled.    [Gherman] The liberal movement in Romania -- just as the  other political orientations in our country -- is substantially  influenced by the people that head it. The liberal movement  only stands to gain a lot if the egos of the various figures  belonging to the movement's subdivisions are put in the service  of the movement. Our country needs a liberal movement. I have  talked to older and more recent liberals and I can tell you that  the distance between the older approach and the neoliberal  concept is as from heaven to earth. They will have to clarify  and substantiate their neoliberal arguments and solutions,  because, right now, politics is being too much played by ear.  But this applies not only to the liberals, it also applies to  other parties, as well.    [Lucaciu] You are heading a social-democratic party. In its  turn, the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)]  also considers itself to be a social-democratic party. Then,  there is also Sergiu Cunescu's Social Democratic Party [PSDR].  Therefore, it is not only the liberal trend that has several  directions, but also the social-democratic one. Do you see the  likelihood of a unification of the social-democratic movement?    [Gherman] Not only that it is possible, but, over the medium  term, that it is also an obligation of the social-democratic  movement in Romania. One will have to establish the landmarks  of social democracy, regardless of the figures that currently  dominate the various social-democratic groupings. I believe  that not enough has been done to clarify the content of the  social-democratic concept. To this, one should add the  confrontation of egos, which is quite apparent both in the case  of the social democracy and in the case of the liberal movement,  something which hampers the movement's natural regrouping. It  is like a typical childhood illness at the beginning of  Romania's political life. Within a reasonable period of two,  three, or four years, we will eventually reach a balance in our  political life with its basic components: neoliberalism,  Christian democracy, and social democracy.    [Lucaciu] You are a politician of vast parliamentary  experience. In your capacity as president of the Senate, you  often have to quell your colleagues' outbursts of temper. In  your opinion, how can one avoid such outbursts in the future, as  they occasionally cast an unfavorable light upon our  parliamentary life as a whole?    [Gherman] I would like to remind you that in 1926-1927, a  great statesman who made an enormous contribution to Turkey's  progress, namely Ataturk [Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern  Turkey], was confronted by one of the ministers during a cabinet  session he attended. Ataturk took out a pistol and shot the  minister. In general, I do not carry guns and I do not plan to  shoot anyone. To answer your question, I will cite to you a  Japanese joke. Two students, one Japanese and one French, were  sharing the same room in a students' hostel. Each day the  French student used to punch the Japanese one, who did not reply  at all. After a year, the French guy told the Japanese that he  has had enough of hitting him without riposte. At which, the  Japanese told him that was a wise decision, since he himself had  gotten fed up spitting into the French student's tea....  <H5>  I Do Not Consider Myself President of the Party </H5>   [Lucaciu] You are the president of the ruling party.  However, many analysts claim that the true president of the  PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] is Mr. Ion Iliescu, who  is allegedly making the important decisions in your party.    [Gherman] The analysts are right, but only half way. They  are right to the extent that I do not consider myself the  party's president and that President Ion Iliescu has been our  party's polarization factor. In this respect, they are right.  However, as far as the taking of decisions is concerned, they  are totally wrong there. President Iliescu -- regardless of the  way or the light in which some people want to present him -- has  a certain kind of delicacy and does not want to impose his  viewpoints, not even in political matters. We often consult  each other, out of a sense of being colleagues in our civic  duties. It will soon be two years since I began --  unfortunately for myself -- to fulfill this task as PDSR  president and I have never had the feeling that President  Iliescu was imposing a certain viewpoint upon me. Usually,  during the discussions we have, we reach a viewpoint that is the  result of arguments and not of pressures coming from either  side. Therefore, regarding your question and the assessments of  political analysts, I can say that the truth is somewhere in the  middle.    [Lucaciu] As your colleague Alexandru Popovici [senator of  the Civic Alliance Party, PAC] very well expressed it, the  recent governmental reshuffle was done in a conspiratorial  manner. You were in the middle of negotiations with other  parties when you brusquely proceeded to change four ministers.  Will this reshuffle not affect the further negotiations with  the opposition and the parties of the governmental coalition?    [Gherman] I would like to tell you that all reshuffles come  rather brusquely in any society with a serious political life.  Reshuffles that are announced with much ado weeks in advance do  nothing but harm the political life. I must tell you a little  secret. We are deliberately introducing viruses, that is,  misleading information.    [Lucaciu] We call them intoxications.    [Gherman] We are causing such intoxications of the mass  media so that we can be left alone to thoroughly examine the  situation in peace. I believe that -- if the political forces  with which we are engaged in talks take a dispassionate look at  the reshuffle and think of the country's future -- the reshuffle  should not only fail to negatively affect the negotiations, but  on the contrary, it will become an argument in the hands of our  partners in the future talks. If you read the press of recent  years, you will note that it has insistently demanded the  replacement of the ministers of defense and interior with  civilians. Now that we have done just that, we are being  accused for having done it! If you read the newspapers of  April-June 1993, you will see with what satisfaction the papers  wrote about the failure of the talks with the IMF; when the  talks ended with the signing of the "Memorandum," the same  newspapers began finding fault with the "Memorandum" as such.  There is a kind of journalistic infancy at the level of our  mass media, too. It does not bother or upset me. Anyhow,  coming back to the substance of these reshuffles, they should  not really upset anyone; on the contrary, they should be an  additional proof of our openness.  <H5>  The Ministry of Industry Is a Colossus </H5>   [Lucaciu] The appointment of civilians at the Ministry of  Defense and Interior is a good chess move on the part of the  ruling party, since it is in agreement with the requirements of  the Council of Europe. However, I would like to remind you that  both the government party and President Ion Iliescu admitted  that we are going through a period of serious economic crisis.  Therefore, it seems at least strange that, at a time of  economic crisis, with its inherent blockages, you are changing  the ministers of defense, interior, or justice. One would have  rather expected a change in the sphere of industry or  agriculture.    [Gherman] The timing you are suggesting does not always  coincide with the timing one can politically accept. Apropos  the productive spheres, since you were talking about industry  and agriculture, it is up to the prime minister to replace the  respective secretaries of state whenever he wants, since this is  part of his prerogatives. On the other hand, such a change  cannot be done without planning. I am against frivolous moves  in the political life. I believe that one should proceed from  the bottom to the top in the aforementioned areas. This does  not mean that one cannot operate some changes at the top, too.  One should first see what can be done to amend the situation  where irregularities occur. Let us take for instance the  Ministry of Industry, which is a colossus; it has 14 or 15  secretaries of state, in charge of various directorates.  Decentralization could not be achieved here overnight. The  ministry still suffers from the centralized economic  coordination of certain industrial sectors. If anyone believes  that Minister of Industry Dumitru Popescu can be blamed for  various shortcomings in his ministry, he is wrong. This does  not mean that there may not be some shortcomings in Dumitru  Popescu's own activity; if we ever come to the conclusion that  these shortcomings exceed his merits, then we will replace him  at the right moment. For the time being, we do not intend to do  so. Therefore, any attempt by you, no matter how able it is, to  channel the discussion toward second-guessing our future  approach to the government's activity is doomed to failure. You  will not get any information out of me.    [Lucaciu] You said that a change does not necessarily mean  to operate at the top, but rather to go from the bottom to the  top. The PDSR, which has been in power for almost one and a half  years, is accused of contributing to the phenomenon of  restoration, through this concern with consolidating the basis.    [Gherman] In this respect, the opposition has been quite  ingenious in using all the possible pejorative terms it could  find against the PDSR. We thank it for this lesson, because it  is also teaching us how to treat it when it has the pleasure of  coming to power. The metaphors they are using are the most  authentic proof of a typically dictatorial frame of mind, which  they themselves criticize in another context. In the communist  regime, everything was placed in little boxes clearly labeled:  leftism, opportunism, and so forth. Now we have more  "ism"-endings than we could ever imagine. It looks like the  mirror has turned the other way round, toward the opposition.  We have become used to these invectives and each time we  discover another one, we nurture a feeling of satisfaction,  since we are confronted with yet another argument that unmasks  the users of those metaphors for what they are -- their way of  thinking is an accusation against themselves.    [Lucaciu] Since you have talked about "ism"-endings, you are  also being accused of centralism.    [Gherman] Well, it is incomparably easier to criticize than  to do something. We are in the unpleasant position of people  obliged to do something. It is very easy to see everything that  is wrong or looks like being wrong. As a matter of fact, this  is why I agreed to become involved in political life. I never  liked to sit in judgment of others without doing anything. I  prefer to be judged and cursed. It is a feature of my character.   <H5>    Everybody Votes as He Deems Fit </H5>   [Lucaciu] There was much talk about the PDSR being a united  and monolithic party. However, it has ceased to manifest itself  as such for some time and speculations are now being made about  the existence of two trends within the PDSR. For instance, on  Monday 7 March we were taken by surprise when the former  minister of justice, Mr. Petre Ninosu, did not obtain the  necessary vote for his election to the position as vice  president of the Senate from some of his own party colleagues.  Mr. Ion Solcanu managed to obtain it, but with difficulty.    [Gherman] When you show me a united and monolithic party in  Romania, then I will start being again afraid of a restoration  and the revival of dictatorship. As for the incident you  mentioned, well some people liked one solution, others another  solution. The only thing they did not think of during the vote  was that their gesture took place at a time when the people had  already been taken by surprise by the governmental reshuffle.  There has not been enough time to let things settle and quiet  down; otherwise, that incident might have been avoided. From a  human viewpoint, I am very upset with what happened to Mr.  Ninosu, as I can well imagine what he must be feeling right now.    [Lucaciu] I gave an example that involved people, therefore,  one could conceivably say that subjective considerations might  have been at play here. However, one gets the same feeling of  the existence of various trends within the PDSR when seeing the  fate of the Law on Radio and Television Societies. After it  passed through the Senate, it is now bogged down in the Chamber  of Deputies. The PDSR deputies tried to introduce a lot of  substantial amendments, after the PDSR senators passed it in a  certain formula. We are talking here about different and even  divergent concepts.    [Gherman] The law has been worked out by the Senate Culture  Commission, which did not pay due attention to my observations  during its discussion in the Senate. Some of these observations  coincide with the amendments brought now in the Chamber. One  should also take into consideration the fact that the Senate  Culture and Mass-Media Commission is headed by Mr. Adrian  Paunescu [vice president of the Socialist Party of Labor-PSM],  who is a real volcano. Sometimes you can block a water overflow  or you can put out a fire. But I have not yet heard of anyone  managing to contain a volcanic eruption. Therefore, the law  that has emerged from the Senate bears the imprint of Adrian  Paunescu, with all its good and bad points. Generally speaking,  all the cultural laws we promulgated bear his imprint. The rule  of the game is that man creates history, not the other way  round. Consequently, we are dealing here with a natural  evolution within this legislative process.    [Lucaciu] I have to insist on another subject, namely the  Law on Land Leasing. There are divergent opinions on this  subject within the PDSR. Some party people, particularly the  senators, favor leasing the land to AGROMECS  [agricultural-mechanization stations], others, particularly the  deputies in the Chamber are against this measure.    [Gherman] We fully observe a constitutional provision that  forbids compulsory mandates. We put forth arguments and  counterarguments, after which everybody votes as he deems fit.  That famous Article Four of the law is hard to evaluate. It is  like launching a cosmic missile from a l9th-century cannon.  Maybe the leasing of some lands by the AGROMECS will prove  beneficial. If the world were ideal, it would certainly have  proved beneficial. But the world is not ideal, and here comes  the doubting. I, for instance, doubt that an AGROMEC that is  leasing land will resist the temptation to pass part of its  expenditures onto the poor peasant, who has nobody to apply to  for machinery but the AGROMEC. Others say that if we do not  permit the leasing of the land, then the fields will remained  untilled. Both are right in their way. As the famous rabbi of  Buhusi said: "You are right and you are right." The political  decision is not an easy thing and not absolutely univocal. Here  lies, maybe, the unique appeal of the political life. Time will  prove who better foresaw the effects of a certain deed. Let me  give you an example: When the law on the legislative elections  was discussed in Parliament, I foresaw some effects, which  eventually proved right. My colleagues did not accept my  conclusions at the respective time. I said that the  proportional variant that was accepted can lead to aberrations.  In a given county or constituency, one may not obtain enough  votes to obtain a seat as senator, but may obtain two seats,  through the redistribution of the votes. There are other  aberrations, too. But they did not accept my arguments. We do  not give "directives" or "precious recommendations" to our  colleagues about how to compulsorily vote a certain law.    [Lucaciu] The curious thing is that, regardless of the law  submitted to discussion, the same people are making up the two  groups. Hence, the conclusion of the analysts that there are  two trends within the PDSR.    [Gherman] But it is only natural that it should be so. I  can tell you that even I, of today, no longer coincide with the  I of yesterday, and I hope not to coincide with the I of  tomorrow.    [Lucaciu] But you must remain faithful to a certain belief.    [Gherman] If I come to the conclusion that this belief is  detrimental to society, then I must accept that other beliefs  are better. Despite the fact that I am not a great admirer of  Liiceanu's [prominent member of the Civic Alliance] political  opinions -- actually, the reverse is true -- I would like to  quote a very good statement of his: "Stupidity means to be  frozen in blueprints." We must realize that each one of us is  duty bound to change, if we do not want to be frozen in a  blueprint."   <H5>    Early Elections -- A Disastrous Solution </H5>   [Lucaciu] Apropos freezing, there is much talk about being  "frozen" in the likely parliamentary blockage. This situation  should inevitably lead to early elections.    [Gherman] I believe that the greatest tragedy for our  country would be to interrupt the normal process of reform  already started and enter a period of early elections. Whoever  does not see this, should remember that he stood for this  disastrous solution, when disaster strikes. Now, more than ever  before, we need tranquillity so that all political forces can  focus on implementing the process of reform. We also need a  timetable of the reform, as implied by the "Memorandum" [with  the IMF]. If somebody does not learn from experience, then he  will have to break his own neck before he learns anything.    [Lucaciu] At the Cotroceni [presidential palace] meeting  between the PDSR and Mr. Ion Iliescu -- a meeting that launched  the second round of negotiations with the political parties --  Mr. Adrian Nastase, your party's executive president, said that  if these negotiations yield no solutions, then the PDSR will  call early elections. You were absent from that meeting.    [Gherman] We must first try to find all possible solutions!  We are not against early elections because we are afraid of the  results our political grouping will obtain. We are afraid of  the eight to nine months that we will lose from the process of  the reform, which will cost the country dearly. I am also  afraid that some people's vote will not be for a political  solution but rather a negative, protest vote against certain  failures. Generally speaking, negative votes are detrimental to  society in the long run. I repeat, we do not fear early  elections, but we do not wish them, since they will delay the  reform by eight to nine months. We are not only talking about a  delay here, but also about a leap backward of Romanian society  by more than one year. Moreover, it is also possible that the  extremities of the political landscape will increase their  numbers. If this is what some people want, then let us go for  early elections. However, I repeat, they are against the  country's interest.    [Lucaciu] Do you recognize that we have extremes in our  political spectrum?    [Gherman] There are definitely extreme positions,  particularly individual. From a programmatic viewpoint, I have  seen so very few coherent programs, that I even got scared.  Some of them cannot even be labeled. I have heard of a  colossal program of some party, which I do not even want to  name, only to ascertain that it was nothing but an enumeration  of mediocre slogans. There is plenty of noise, but no programs.  Consequently, the political landscape covers a whole spectrum,  with individual presences in all zones, but with much fewer  programmatic presences in some of these zones, except for  certain programmatic presences that scare me and remind me of  the horror years of the 40's.  <H5>  I Have No Spirit of Adventure </H5>   [Lucaciu] It is usually lawyers who become involved in top  politics. You are a scientist, a known physicist. How does  physics go with politics?    [Gherman] You touched a sensitive cord here. Maybe my  answer will be interpreted as a political gaffe, but, believe  me, I do not consider myself a politician. I only consider  myself as the owner of a floating bridge, that carries things  from one bank to the other. Political life in our immediate  past was totally anomalous. I am referring to the dictatorial  period. I hope that a normal political life will prevail in our  country over the medium term. I am only a raftsman, trying to  transfer the Romanian society, with as little damage as  possible, from the aberrant zone of the dictatorial past to a  zone of normalcy. Consequently, I am now a kind of political  clerk, who regrets that he cannot be a very good, as he would  hope, physics professor. However, someone had to ensure the  crossover of the Romanian society to the other bank of the  river. I never liked to stay on the sidelines with my arms  crossed.    [Lucaciu] Professor, I would like you to answer another  question from the sphere of physics. What are microwaves?    [Gherman] There are all kinds of microwaves. It depends on  where they are placed. Microwaves in the electromagnet field  are placed in the extreme zone of mechanical access to  electromagnetic waves. It is a kind of extreme zone of waves  produced by normal oscillating circuits. Consequently, the zone  of electromagnetic waves is pushed up to the remote infrared  optical range. I would say that the microwaves are  electromagnetic waves that are accessible through special means  of production, not through the traditional oscillating circuits.    [Lucaciu] Please, stop this scientific explanation. I was  never any good at physics. Actually, I wanted you to tell me  whether these microwave devices are good in the kitchen. I am  referring to microwave ovens, which, even though they are not  "accessible" to us -- because of their stiff price -- have  conquered the world.    [Gherman] They are very good for heating up food without  altering its vitamin content.    [Lucaciu] Are there any similarities in politics with the  microwave phenomenon?    [Gherman] You cannot find similarities there. Politics is a  step by step phenomenon. To find something similar to  microwaves in politics, there must be a political continuum  there. But then, there is no such thing as a political  continuum, since only undulating phenomena are typical of such a  continuum. One can talk about a hypothetical kind of  communication, through suggestion or extrasensory means, in  politics. Some believe in that, some do not. That is a sphere  of adventure, and I have no spirit of adventure whatsoever.</p>

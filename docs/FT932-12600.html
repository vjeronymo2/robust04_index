			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Sharif emboldened by street support: Dismissed Pakistani PM is in uncharacteristic fighting mood NAWAZ Sharif is in fighting mood. For Pakistan's former prime minister, widely regarded as something of a reticent man with an awkward manner, that is a change. What helps is that Mr Sharif is convinced that a growing number of people, especially businessmen, oppose the dismissal of his government by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on charges of corruption ten days ago. Mr Sharif's drive to regain power comes as Pakistan's week-old interim administration, which has promised to hold national elections on July 14, is showing signs of rifts between its key members. Public support for Mr Sharif first became evident during his train journey from Islamabad to his home city of Lahore last week. Showered with rose petals during stopovers, he promised to fight back. 'Only one man (the president) is playing with the destiny of this nation,' said Mr Sharif. 'My jihad (holy campaign) is for the future of Pakistan. I am certain that the decision on July 14 will be in my favour.' He later visited Karachi, Pakistan's business city and capital of Sindh province, home to his political foe, Pakistan People's Party leader Ms Benazir Bhutto. Police used batons to fight back a crowd which swelled to thousands. Now Mr Sharif is expected to travel to the North Western Frontier and Baluchistan provinces to try to establish himself as a national leader. The business community is seen as vital to Mr Sharif's campaign. During his 29 months in office, Mr Sharif's government initiated wide ranging economic reforms aimed at unshackling the economy from the hold of the bureaucracy. Although the interim government has insisted it will not reverse any of those measures and promised that Pakistan will honour all its domestic and international contracts, nervousness continues. Pakistan's leading stock market, the Karachi Stock Exchange, lost 37 points, or roughly 3 per cent of its value the day after Mr Sharif's fall, the steepest drop on a single day this year. Since then, two government supported financial institutions have bought shares to prevent further falls. The index has recovered about 1 per cent since then. Mr Naeem-ul-haq, a director at the Karachi-based Schon group which bought 3 of the 56 public sector companies sold by Mr Sharif's government, says: 'Nawaz Sharif's downfall has shattered business confidence. I have yet to meet one businessman who feels positive about this change.' Another leading businessman says planned new investments have been put on hold 'until it becomes clear that signs of uncertainty have ended'. 'Mere statements of reassurances from the new government will not do the job,' he says. The uncertainty has been further intensified by differences within the new government. Ms Bhutto wants the dissolution of the four provincial assemblies so that national and provincial elections are held simultaneously. But her call is being resisted by the president and the interim prime minister, Mr Balakh Sher Mazari. One of Ms Bhutto's aides says: 'The option of (Bhutto supporters) leaving the new government is very much alive if (our)demands are not met'. The president's resistance to dissolving the provincial assemblies appears to be because he is due for re-election this November. According to senior officials, Mr Khan could rely for support in the presidential election on three of the four existing provincial governments. It is difficult to assess the likely outcome of the emerging rivalries between the different factions. What is clear is that Mr Sharif is taking his campaign to the streets with uncharacteristic boldness.</p>

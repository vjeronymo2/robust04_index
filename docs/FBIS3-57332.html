			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F> "North Ossetia Against Bringing Additional Russian Troops.  State of Emergency Regime Will Apparently Be Extended"]    [Text] Vyacheslav Titorenko, representative of the Russian  Federation Government interdepartmental commission for the  elimination of the aftermath of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict,  has arrived in North Ossetia, in the zone under the emergency  situation regime. According to INTERFAX, the purpose of his  arrival is to coordinate the actions of all interested  ministries and agencies, including "power" ministries and  agencies, to implement the Russian Federation president's edict  on returning to their homes refugees and those who have been  forced to resettle.    In the meantime, there is growing dissatisfaction in the  republic at an alleged introduction of additional Russian  military formations onto its territory. The All-Ossetia  "Greater Council" ("Styr Nykhas") and the pan-national movement  "Our Ossetia" have passed a request to Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin to confirm or deny this information. A  statement circulated by these movements says that on the  territory of North Ossetia now "there are more than enough  military formations to ensure security in the zone affected by  the emergency situation regime." In the view of the statement's  authors, troops are being brought in the republic in order "to  create a powerful military fist in the center of the Caucasus,"  capable of "pacifying" the Caucasian peoples." North Ossetia's  public movements have demanded that the Russian Government  withdraw the additional troops from the republic's territory,  and discontinue support to extremist circles in Georgia's  leadership.    It appears that the possible introduction of additional  Russian troops is causing such dissatisfaction because the  emergency situation regime is to end on 31 January. On 28  January, North Ossetia's parliament intends to discuss this  question, and, according to information from Vladikavkaz, many  deputies will speak categorically against extending the validity  of the emergency situation. However, INTERFAX reports, it is  known from competent sources that the president of North Ossetia  is now ready to sign an edict extending the state of emergency,  but that would affect a considerably smaller area.    The edict will apparently be signed after Akhsarbek Galazov,  former chairman of North Ossetia's Supreme Soviet, is sworn in  as president. The inauguration ceremony has been scheduled for  26 January. Invitations for the ceremony have been forwarded to  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, government chairman  Viktor Chernomyrdin, and to the leaders of both chambers of  Russia's Federal Assembly. The leaders of the North Caucasus  republics, krays, and oblasts are also expected to arrive in  Vladikavkaz for the ceremony.</p>

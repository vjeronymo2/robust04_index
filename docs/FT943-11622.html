			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / AZT wins recommendation in US AZT, Wellcome's controversial HIV and Aids treatment, was yesterday recommended for use against the transmission from mother to child of HIV by an anti-viral drugs advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration. The committee voted unanimously to recommend the drug for use by HIV-positive pregnant women and infants based on a study of 477 women, of which 364 finished the trial. The trial concluded that the risk of transmission was 8.3 per cent compared with 25.5 per cent for those not taking the treatment. The recommendation is not binding, but the advice of committees is usually followed by the FDA. Analysts do not expect a substantial increase in AZT sales if it is given a licence for this particular use. In the US, about 100,000 women of child-bearing age are HIV-positive and about 7,000 HIV-positive women give birth each year. Between 1,500 and 2,000 infants are infected with HIV by their mothers. The treatment was started as early as 14 weeks into pregnancy, administered to the mothers intravenously during delivery, and given to the child for six weeks after birth. The recommendation will help to re-establish AZT's reputation, also known as Retrovir. Sales collapsed last year after a study questioned its effectiveness in the treatment of HIV-positive people who did not have Aids symptoms.</p>

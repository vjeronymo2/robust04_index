			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Future of Work: Prospects look rosiest for the rebels If it had not been for that damned apple, of course, the question need never have bothered us. The only work in our lives - as Genesis 2:15 makes clear - would have been a bit of light gardening. In the event, the work question has bugged us ever since, albeit in different ways. Right now, for instance, it is worrying political leaders in the opposite of the form in which it threatened to unseat their English predecessors in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The trouble then was too much work for a plague-thinned labour force, whereas the contemporary version is not enough to go round. What makes it no less of a danger to today's politicians is that the problem has shifted from peasants to floating voters higher up the social scale. That is particularly so in Britain, where in the recession, managerial as well as clerical classes lost their jobs. Hence, if you happen to be job seeking, the outlook will depend much on which kind of worker you are. The question of work prospects is never easy to answer, but clues lie in the three basic types of worker identified by the US psychologist Albert Bernstein: rebels, believers, and competitors: Rebels are typically expert in some technical field, and often creatively intelligent to boot. The drawback is that, while toiling unstintingly at things they are interested in, they have little time for routine and still less for 'people problems'. So they are apt to be a mixed blessing as colleagues, and an absolute pain as managers. The best managers - from the viewpoint of those working for them - are believers. Besides being fair-minded, they spare no effort even at tasks they dislike, fuelled by their faith that labour will bring its reward. Alas, the same faith blinds them to all evidence to the contrary, which means they rarely rise beyond middle management. The types who tend to get to the top are competitors who believe in winning personally. They swiftly learn how their organisation's system really operates, as opposed to the way it is supposed to, and manipulate it in their own self-interest. Even so, their political smartness makes them adept at outwitting rival companies as well as colleagues, and at wringing good deals out of customers. If competitors are out of work, therefore, it is probably because they are too smart for their own good, or in their last job they came up against a cannier competitor. The good news is that there will always be a demand for competitors' drive and fixing skills. That inevitably means bad news for the other two types, and especially so for believers. For one thing, the scrapping of whole ranks of middle management means that instead of just losing out to competitors in the promotion race, believers have far less chance of even entering it. The irony for believers is that, although civilisation would crumble without their sterling abilities, it is harder and harder to get paid for using them. In Britain at least, believers' best hope is a revival of real industry, where their qualities count much more than in service operations such as investment banking, hairdressing and the like. The best prospects would seem to be for rebels, provided their technical skills and interests keep pace with the times. There will always be a demand for their problem-solving on a self-employed basis. The only trouble is that self-employment places a high premium on the routine tasks and people-handling abilities for which rebels typically have little time or talent. So for many, the way ahead could be stony. . . .unless they are in the lucky position of this particular rebel, to whom the question 'What is the future of work?' presents no difficulty. The answer is 34 days. Roll on retirement]</p>

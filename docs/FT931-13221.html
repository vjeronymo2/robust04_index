			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The task for Mr George THE NEW governor and deputy governor of the Bank of England can have no doubt what the government thinks they are there to do. In announcing the appointments, Mr Norman Lamont insisted that their responsibility 'should be to support the government in our determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'. So the old lady of Threadneedle Street is to remain submissive, though ostensibly submissive in a good cause. The question is how far the new team will accept being neutered. After the French decision to make the Banque de France independent, the Bank of England will be the least independent central bank in the Group of Seven industrial countries, not so much the Old Lady, more the eunuch of Threadneedle Street. In the international meetings he will attend as governor, Mr Edward (Eddie) George will have to defend what he has influenced, but not made. Worse, on past form the policy he will have to defend will not only be the most political, it will also be among the least competent. The government justifies its determination not to grant independence to the Bank by the political sensitivity of interest rate decisions. Yet that sensitivity is itself a legacy of past inflation. The high proportion of owner-occupiers, the dominance of borrowing at variable rates of interest, the fluctuations in short-term interest rates, all these have been caused by inflation. Will any politician be prepared to break this vicious circle, especially when an election looms near? Unfortunately, it seems quite unlikely. Mr George and Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea must try to increase the chances. After they get over initial disagreements - Mr George's greater scepticism about the exchange rate mechanism, for example and The Economist's support for Lord Lawson as the next governor - the two men will find happy agreement on the importance of keeping inflation down. Thereupon the new team should decide not to be as submissive as the government wants. To Mr George's ability to speak with authority on central banking, Mr Pennant-Rea must add a journalist's willingness to be outspoken. They will need to be precisely that, because there will be little else for the Bank to deploy, bar influence behind closed doors. Should the new team have the courage to speak out, it will be effective. A recently humiliated government will find it impossible to brush aside warnings from the Bank. What is more, in the Bank's new quarterly assessment of inflationary trends lies its opportunity. It offers independence in embyro. The Bank should say precisely what it thinks and let the government, which must borrow some Pounds 50bn a year for many years to come, cope with the consequences of ignoring it. In analysing the appointment that the government had to make, the FT argued that 'the new governor must be capable of representing and defending the Bank's policy views both in the UK and abroad; he should be able to contribute to a national debate on the proper functions and structure of the Bank; he should be open to new ideas; and he should be able to tackle the managerial failures of the Bank that have been revealed so starkly in the case of BCCI'. The new governor and deputy governor have many of the required qualities between the two of them. It is now for Mr George to prove that he has not been too thoroughly house trained during his 30 years at the Bank and has learned from recent disasters as well. It is for Mr Pennant-Rea to help him to reach out to the public and shake up the Bank. If they are to succeed, they must remember that the Bank exists to serve not the interests of the government of the day, but those of the British people. What the latter need from their central bank is sound finance and sound money. The new team must be prepared to risk all for that cause.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: OMI Intl expands with Pounds 7m acquisition OMI International, the manufacturer and supplier of products and services based on the application of measurement technology, yesterday announced it was to acquire Castlet, a private company, for Pounds 7m. Castlet manufactures electronic devices and control systems used mainly to collect dust and other particles from waste gases such as those emitted by power stations. To pay for the acquisition, OMI is proposing to raise Pounds 9.5m net of expenses via a rights issue of 27.8m shares at 37p each on a 5-for-8 basis. The shares closed at 43p yesterday, down 6p. In addition to the purchase price, the share issue will provide Pounds 2.5m of extra working capital. It has been fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Castlet made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.01m on turnover of Pounds 7.4m in the year to April 30 and on completion of the deal should be free of bank debt and have net assets of not less than Pounds 2.7m. OMI also announced results in line with expectations for the six months to September. On sales down slightly from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 17.4m, pre-tax profits for the half year fell from Pounds 237,000 to Pounds 18,000. Mr Gil Williams, chairman and chief executive, said the electro-optics and instrumentation businesses had performed well and had healthy order books, while the move of Thin Films to Plymouth remained on schedule for the fourth quarter. Forward Industries also met expectations. Logistics, which had a disappointing second half last year, had shown a marked upturn, he added. Borrowings over the period rose by Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 8.59m - giving gearing of 71 per cent. Earnings were nil (0.5p); the interim dividend, however, is maintained at 0.75p. BZW, the house broker, has upgraded its current year profits forecast from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.3m.</p>

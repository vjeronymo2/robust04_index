			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / German-Soviet air link could be resurrected A PARTNERSHIP first established between Germany's Weimar Republic and Lenin's Bolsheviks could be revived under a proposal being examined by airline executives in Frankfurt and Moscow. Aeroflot, the airline of the now-defunct Soviet Union, is considering a possible alliance with Lufthansa, the German national carrier. It would involve route-sharing and other joint operations to help the former Soviet carrier survive international competition. Both airlines have invoked the memory of Deutsche Russische Luftverkehrsgesellschaft, or Deruluft. This was an alliance begun in November 1921 to fly between German cities and eastern Europe, including the then-independent Baltic states. Mr Vladimir Potapov, director-general of Aeroflot's international air services, said: 'We want to return to that (relationship).' Such an alliance would go beyond the joint venture it already has with Lufthansa to modernise Moscow's Sheremetievo airport. Mr Potapov gave no more details of talks with Lufthansa on further co-operation, but said work was progressing despite problems with financing the DM800m (Pounds 277m) airport project. The main problem was that plans for a loan from a consortium of German banks needed new guarantees.</p>

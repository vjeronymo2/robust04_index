			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN AFFECTIONATE PROFILE OF MILOS FORMAN  </P> <P> The hourlong profile of Czech-born director Milos Forman that is part of the  PBS "American Masters" series (KCET Channel 28 tonight at 8) is urbane and  affectionate. It contains clips from his droll Czech films and his major  American ones: "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Amadeus," "Hair," "Ragtime"  and "Valmont" -- the latter while it was still being shot.  </P> <P> Unsurprisingly, you do not hear a discouraging word from any of Forman's stars  or from such associates as his cinematographer, his longtime screenwriter or  his agent, something of a legend himself. If the program also works as a  behind-the-scenes promotional trailer for "Valmont," well, it's an intriguing  project to eavesdrop upon.  </P> <P> The only drawback to such a generous viewpoint is that it doesn't probe very  deeply -- if at all. There might have been a chance of that, since the film  maker is Forman's own mentor at the Czech film school in the 1950s, Vojtech  Jasny, but if there was any notion of revealing the drive that kept Forman  going during his lean early years in the United States, it's long since  abandoned.  </P> <P> Born in 1932, Forman tells a haunting story about his last view of his  teacher-father who, like his mother, perished at the hands of the Nazis in  World War II. The 8-year-old Milos was called out of class one day because his  father had -- unexpectedly -- come to see him. Putting his hand on his son's  head and giving him a message to tell his mother that he loved her, his father  left, flanked by the two men in long brown leather coats who had accompanied  him. The boy cheerfully ran home to pass on the loving message, oblivious of  the meaning of the scene. A year later, his mother too was seized.  </P> <P> As Forman elaborates on the influences that formed his early droll Czech  successes "Loves of a Blonde" and "Fireman's Ball," the film provides clips  from those treasures. Later, when Forman explains that his first American film,  "Taking Off" was a flop, carrying as it did the young director's hopes of big  American success, you hope for some critical balance, someone knowledgeable  recruited to point out that it was only a flop financially, but that it was  well-loved critically and almost a cult film now. In fact, some of its  stylistic innovations are used to this day: "Taking Off's" delicious audition  sequence was duplicated in no less recent a success than "The Fabulous Baker  Boys." But the mainstream -- box-office -- view is the only one given any  weight.  </P> <P> In written articles about those early days, Forman himself has detailed his  awful period after "Taking Off," but you won't learn about them here. He seems  to float from success to success with the ease of Danielle Steele moving from  tome to tome. Even the piquant sentence by his agent, Robbie Lanz, underlining  the fact that Forman had completely assimilated himself into the United States,  in the process jettisoning a nationality, a language and a family, goes  uninvestigated. That could hardly have been a move without consequence, psychic  or otherwise, but we get only a wealth of anecdote to bury the pain -- if  indeed there was any.  </P> <P> The most penetrating view of Forman at work, even rivaling the one of his  distinguished co-screenwriter, Jean-Claude Carriere, comes from character actor  Vincent Schiavelli, part of the Forman repertory family since his role as the  dope-smoking instructor in "Taking Off." Having worked repeatedly with Forman,  Schiavelli observes that his talent with actors is that the director "puts  himself at the center of conflict of a scene." Therefore, in "Valmont," he is  restrained, gentle and elegant. But in "Cuckoo's Nest," his comments were  pointed, unsettling, couched in language that matched the film's; he would  begin a criticism with "You're crazy!" "He really put everything off-center and  put everyone ill-at-ease; he became Big Nurse at the hospital."  </P> <P> Wreathed in cigar smoke in his handsome library, in anecdote after anecdote  that he is happy to tell on himself, Forman emerges as a deceptively open man,  cultured and wide-ranging. Since these glimpses of his working life are so  tantalizing, it's no wonder we want to do more than scratch the uncomplicated  surface this film provides of an obviously complicated personality.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKING TICKET REVENUE IN L.A.  </P> <P> I am angered to read that the mayor is upset with the traffic officers wherein  he contends that they are not writing enough tickets.  </P> <P> Although the annual revenue has increased from $18 million in 1985 to $90  million last year, this just isn't good enough, according to our esteemed  mayor.  </P> <P> It is reprehensible to think that the mayor of this city is angry because more  citizens are obeying the law!  </P> <P> But then again it really isn't surprising that this muddle-headed man who has  lived for so long under a cloud of murky and nefarious transactions would think  in a more positive vein than having to enrich the city coffers through such  punitive means.  </P> <P> Come on, it's time to pat him on the head with two lumps of sugar, and put him  out to pasture.  </P> <P> ALAN A. ROSS  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

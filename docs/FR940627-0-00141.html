			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Verification Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of mechanisms can cause emissions to be captured in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dilution and sampling system before they can be characterized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or used for animal exposures. Verification testing is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the ratio (``recovery factor'') of emissions that exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sampling system to those that enter the system. This ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be high in order for subsequent emission testing to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requires testing to verify the exposure atmosphere and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to monitor the performance of the dilution/sampling system and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixing chamber, ensuring the repeatability of test results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Verification testing of the dilution/sampling system must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished by injecting a known sample at the inlet and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring the amount that exits the sample probe. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chromatograph and flame ionization detector to estimate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery factor. Similar verification procedures apply to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification testing of the mixing chamber. Verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for the dilution/sampling system and mixing chamber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are included in &sect;79.57(e)(2)(v) of the accompanying regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional requirements include the monitoring of conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., air flow, CO levels, etc.) in the inhalation exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chamber and verification of test animal exposure levels (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;79.61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Evaporative Emission Generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section III.A.2 discusses the RVP criteria which determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicability of evaporative emission testing to specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures. Evaporative emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from in-use vehicles include diurnal, hot soak, resting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> running loss emissions, and refueling emissions. However, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplify the generation and collection procedures and to supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emissions of sufficient concentration for biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure testing, today's rule requires that evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions be generated using an evaporative emission generator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (EEG). Emissions to be used both for characterization tests and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological exposure tests are to be generated in this way. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied to cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to evaporate at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a desired rate. Manufacturers will have flexibility in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design of the EEG used to test their particular F/FA. The size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or number of EEG units to be used for evaporative emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing will depend on the rate of emissions needed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhalation study. The vapor pressure of the F/FA product may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence the required tank size, as well. Emission rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission composition is sensitive to temperature changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / General Motors to inject Dollars 10bn into pension fund deficit General Motors yesterday took a significant step towards the reduction of its serious pension fund deficit - by far the largest of any US corporation  -when it agreed with government regulators that it would inject some Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) of cash and stock into the scheme. Investor concern about GM's unfunded pension liabilities, some Dollars 22.3bn at the end of 1993, has hung over the group's stock in spite of a sharp improvement in operating profits. The group announced last November that it was considering ameliorating its pensions problem by contributing to its plans some Dollars 6bn-worth of GM class E stock held by its treasury. The E stock represents a claim on the dividend stream of Electronic Data Systems, GM's information technology subsidiary. GM said it had agreed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government agency which insures private-sector benefit plans, to contribute 177m Class E shares, worth Dollars 6.2bn at current market prices, and a further Dollars 4bn in cash. The recent rise in US interest rates - if sustained - will also sharply reduce GM's deficit, as bond rates are used to calculate the company's pension liabilities, and each 1 percentage point rise in bond yields cuts the liability by some Dollars 5bn. US 30-year Treasury bond yields have risen by well over 1 percentage point since the start of the year. GM said yesterday that the Dollars 4bn cash contribution would come out of cash flow. Under the deal with the PBGC, still subject to the approval of the US Department of Labor, it must contribute at least Dollars 2bn at the same time as the E shares and the balance no later than September 30, 1995. When a company contributes to its pension fund above the annual minimum it normally creates a credit balance which the company can use to reduce pension contributions. GM has agreed to defer the use of these credits for several years and will not be entirely free of the restraints until 2003. Joint venture in India, Page 27</p>

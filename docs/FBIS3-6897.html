Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister in charge of  economic affairs, told a news conference that measures for  deregulation in priority areas such as government procurement,  automobile and auto parts imports and insurance now are being  scrutinized at the order of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.  Hayashi added, however, that it would be difficult to complete  a comprehensive package comprising all priority areas as well as  policies for free competition.    Referring to a U.S. threat to take retaliatory action  against  Japan under the controversial Super 301 clause, Hayashi said it  is natural for Japan to seek judgment from the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if such a step is invoked. Hayashi  added Japan is allowed to take countermeasures against such  moves under GATT rules.</p>

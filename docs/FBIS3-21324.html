			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bangalore, January 14--The election commission is  considering a proposal to limit the number of observers and  agents at the polling booths and counting centres to minimise  chances of malpractice, the chief election commissioner, Mr T.N.  Seshan, said.    Mr Seshan, who began the first of the meetings of regional  electoral officers here yesterday, in anticipation of elections  due at the end of this year, told reporters that barring the  national parties, observers and agents would be allowed into the  booths by rotation and only 10 to 15 percent of the agents of  independent candidates would be permitted at a time. The  presence of a large number of persons when the officials were  involved in the nitty-gritty of elections would only be an  unnecessary diversion, Mr Seshan said.    The meeting also had on the agenda measures to restrict the  "manipulative, muscle and money power of privileged contestants  that could affect the prospects of other candidates." This  included controlling excessive and ostentatious expenditure and  restricting the issue of facilities to the election staff to  keep dummy candidates and other irritants at bay.    There would also be a bar on ministers and candidates  attending official meetings and any meetings that could  influence the officials, as this would only divert attention of  the staff during the elections.    Mr Seshan was firm on the issue of the photo-identity cards  to voters and said he would brook no excuses from any state  government on that. If some state governments complained that  they could not afford to spend Rs 100 crores on the cards, his  stock answer was, "democracy doesn't come cheap." The deadline  for completing the process of issuing identity cards is January  1, 1995. There would be no elections in states where this  process is not completed by then, he reiterated.    The process of issuing the cards had been "deliberately"  decentralised, and besides the identity and other details of the  voter, the card would sport a laser hologram of the state symbol  to distinguish the card. The card would be as complete as  possible, but the ultimate responsibility of ensuring that the  entries were correct was on the voter himself.    On the restriction of the number of vehicles and security  provided to candidates, Mr Seshan clarified that it was subject  to the needs of the security of the candidate concerned.  Restricting the number of candidates to accommodate the  "privileged" ones was no solution, and the election commission  generally proceeded on the assumption that all candidates were  serious candidates. The idea was to convey to the people the  seriousness involved in the conduct of elections, he added.    No decision has yet been taken on the use of electronic  voting machines, since the government was not in a position to  expend Rs 1,000 crores over three years to deploy them  nationwide. Besides, the machines have several limitations,  which could not be taken care of in the available time.    The southern meeting was to be followed by those of the  other  five regions, including the central, northern, western, eastern  and north-eastern regions in the coming weeks. The agenda for  all these would be the same.    Programmes to increase voter-awareness, and all measures to  minimise violation of election norms were also considered at the  meeting. Asked about the measures to deal with election-day eve  malpractices, Mr Seshan said, "If I were to tell you that the  entire election process can be finished in one shot, and  everything taken care of, it would be stupid on my part."    He stuck to his guns about the orders to political parties  on  cleaning up the walls and hoardings and removal of posters. "If  I am ignored on this, I will bark, I'll bite, I'll shout and  fight and do whatever needs doing to be obeyed on this," he  warned.</p>

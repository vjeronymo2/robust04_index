The differences between grades are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of this order does not include: (a) Garlic that has been mechanically harvested and that is primarily, but not exclusively, destined for non-fresh use; or (b) garlic that has been specially prepared and cultivated prior to planting and then harvested and otherwise prepared for use as seed. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Fresh Garlic from the People's Republic of China,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Inv.

The subject garlic is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, 0710.80.9750, 0711.90.6000, and 2005.90.9500 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to be excluded from the antidumping duties ordered in this notice, garlic entered under the HTSUS subheadings listed above, that is (1) mechanically harvested and primarily, but not exclusively, destined for non-fresh use; or (2) specially prepared and cultivated prior to planting and then harvested and otherwise prepared for use as seed, must be accompanied by declarations to the Customs Service to that effect. We invite interested parties to provide suggested language for the certifications within ten days after publication of this order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Antidumping Duty Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 735(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on September 19, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) made its final determination that fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 49058, September 26, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 7, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its final determination in this investigation. In its determination, the ITC found three like products: (1) Fresh garlic, defined as garlic that has been manually harvested and is intended for use as fresh produce; (2) dehy garlic, defined as garlic that has been mechanically harvested and that is primarily, but not exclusively, destined for non-fresh use; and (3) seed garlic, defined as garlic that has been specially prepared and cultivated prior to planting and then harvested and otherwise prepared for use as seed. The ITC determined that the industry in the United States producing fresh garlic, as defined by the ITC, is materially injured by reason of less than fair value (LTFV) imports from the PRC, but that critical circumstances do not exist with regard to such imports. The ITC further determined that the industries in the United States producing dehy and seed garlic are not materially injured nor threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV imports from the PRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding fresh garlic, since the ITC determined that imports of such merchandise are materially injuring a U.S. industry, but that critical circumstances do not exist with regard to such imports, retroactive imposition of antidumping duties is not necessary. All unliquidated entries of fresh garlic from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 11, 1994, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination (59 FR 35310), will be liable for the assessment of antidumping duties. The Department will direct U.S. Customs officers to terminate the suspension of liquidation for entries of fresh garlic from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before July 11, 1994, and to release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit, posted to secure the payment of estimated antidumping duties with respect to these entries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United State price for entries of fresh garlic from the PRC. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of fresh garlic from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of Order'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 11, 1994. The Customs Service must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following cash deposit for the subject merchandise:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/Producer/Exporter <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Weighted-average margin percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> All Manufacturers/Producers/Exporters  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 376.67 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to fresh garlic from the PRC, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act.

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Waiting for the 'D' word Churchill once said 'one vote is enough'. The same applies to the narrow Yes win in the French referendum. It does not clear up all the doubts about the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The Danes have to be squared. And British MPs - now in one of their least attractive xenophobic moods - need to be calmed; or some alternative way found of carrying on without the UK. At an immediate financial level, a powerful effort will obviously be made to shore up the exchange rate mechanism. One lesson, which should have been reinforced by recent events, is that half-way houses between fixed and floating rates - like the original ERM or Bretton Woods - are only transitional. They either harden into rigidly fixed exchange rates - a common currency in all but the convenience - or they break down into some kind of 'dirty' floating. ERM members would be well advised to press ahead with maximum speed to monetary union. Many of the moves, such as locking the French and German parities together, can be taken at central bank and finance ministry level. Also, the Bundesbank will have to recognise that it can no longer behave like a purely provincial organisation, but is now the central bank for at least the inner core of the European Community. We are likely to see not a two-speed but a three-speed Europe. There will be the inner core of Germany, plus its smaller neighbours, reinforced by France. Second, there will be an outer core of Mediterranean countries committed to staying in or rejoining the ERM as soon as possible. Third, there will be the UK, back on the sidelines, having zero influence on the reform of what John Major calls the faultlines of the ERM. Or if I can put into plain English recent statements about rejoining the ERM from Norman Lamont, they mean: 'Never, if I can help it, and in any case not for a very long time.' His conditions, perhaps intentionally, remind one of those laid down by Lady Thatcher. What I have missed most from the statements of the prime minister and chancellor is the 'D' words. I do not mean devaluation but admission of defeat. Time and again they said that the ERM was at the heart of British economic policy. Most human endeavours end in defeat. But it is gracious and decent to recognise the defeat, instead of beating the patriotic drum and pretending that all is well. The defeat is not only for the government, but for the vision of an economy based not on the literally zero inflation, but on reasonably stable prices. The first signs were beginning to appear - businesses were revolting against upward-only rent reviews, people were starting to view houses as places to live in rather than as investments, renting was coming back in fashion and even expense account restaurants were offering relatively cheap fixed-priced menus. These gains will not disappear overnight. It is a characteristic of currency depreciation, like all other drugs, that the early effects are stimulating. A tabloid headline saying 'Joy in a sinking pound' had it all. Interest rates can now be a little lower. Exporters will find the going a little less difficult but - and the full process can take years - the internal value of the currency catches up with the external. The 1972 departure from the monetary 'snake' was hailed as an act of liberation. But it led in a straight line to Denis Healey turning back on his way to the IMF in 1976. The long decline of sterling after 1981 paved the way for the inflationary credit boom in the last years of that decade. Until well after the forced devaluation of sterling, I wanted Norman Lamont to stay. Otherwise we would be playing the old game of making a scapegoat of successive politicians, while leaving those who really made the mistakes to advise their successors undisturbed. The Bank of England cannot be a candidate for independence until its role in last week's debacle has been scrutinised. But after pretending that a defeat was a matter of adopting the British policy, as distinct from the presumably non-British policy which he himself had earlier been following, I no longer care whether the chancellor goes or stays. Some 90 per cent of what politicians say is disbelieved. The discount factor should now rise to 99.9 per cent. This is the sense in which what should have been a technical issue has become a moral one as well. But let us not dwell further on this, after all very ordinary government. The faux pas of the Bundesbank could not have led to devaluation unless the Bundesbank's views had struck a parallel chord in the financial talking classes - from learned professors to the famous dealers in white socks. The code was to say that the sterling parity was fixed at too high a level. What they all really meant was that the effort to dump the inflationary habit was too great - which is why the recession has been so much more severe in Britain than in France, a country which has had appreciably higher real interest rates.</p>

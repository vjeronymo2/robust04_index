			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cranfield's 'marketing excellent' companies One of the 'marketing excellent' companies selected by Cranfield was Land Rover, part of the Rover Group. Everyone who buys a Discovery (above), Defender or Range Rover gets a telephone call or a postal questionnaire asking about the product and service they have received. The boundaries between engineering and marketing are being blurred through training: recruits are expected to have practical experience of assembling work, as well as marketing. Even Land Rover's security man in the UK, on duty over Christmas, was able to deal with a Defender driver stranded in Croatia. An ex-sapper himself, he arranged for spare parts to be despatched and talked the driver through their fitting. The other companies studied for the report are: In the service sector: Allied Dunbar; British Airways; British Telecommunications; Rentokil; Standard Life. In consumer manufacturing: Black &amp; Decker; Boots Healthcare International; Johnson &amp; Johnson; SmithKline Beecham; Sony (UK); In industrial manufacturing and distribution: AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions; Electrospeed; Renishaw; Rolls-Royce Aero Engines.</p>

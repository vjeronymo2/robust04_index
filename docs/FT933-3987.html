			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Austin Reed opens shop in Japan Austin Reed, the upmarket clothing retailer, yesterday opened its first shop in Japan, through a licensing agreement with a Japanese tailor, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The move comes as the country's prolonged economic slump has affected consumer confidence, especially in clothing. Leading department stores have been forced to offer cheaper suits due to the aggressive price cuts by discount retailers, which have gained popularity as more Japanese have started to refrain from spending. Mr Barry Reed, chairman, said he was aware of the latest trend in the men's clothing market, but he believed that in the long run, the Japanese would opt for quality clothing. Austin Reed has been available in the Japanese market for the past 20 years, through licensing agreements with the country's apparel makers. The company hopes to attract customers, who are familiar with its flagship store on London's Regent Street. The outside appearance of the new shop, located in Ginza, the luxury shopping centre of Tokyo, is modeled after the Regent Street store and is made of the same stone material. The retailer expects to see sales of Y70m (Pounds 430,000) in the first year.</p>

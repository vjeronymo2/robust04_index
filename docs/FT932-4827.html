			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / EC warns of poor recovery outlook THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday delivered a grim warning that economic recovery in the EC is unlikely before the second half of 1994. The poor outlook for growth means that unemployment will top 18m this year and could rise to more than 20m in 1994, Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, told EC finance ministers in Luxembourg. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer, acknowledged that the weakness in the European economy was taking the edge off UK recovery and called for a 'spirit of co-operation' among his EC partners. On his debut in the Ecofin council, Mr Clarke, said Europe remained the most important export market for British goods. 'Getting the European economy going again is very important for us all.' Mr Clarke afterwards voiced concern about the depth of the German recession, and said the German and UK economies were 'so far out of line that the conditions are not remotely there' for Britain to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. The Commission forecasts that the UK economy will grow by 1.7 per cent in 1993, compared with an earlier estimate of 1.3 per cent. This is faster than its main EC competitors, but not one EC economy is likely to register an impressive performance, said Mr Christophersen. During the meeting, Mr Christophersen confirmed that the Commission's new internal forecasts estimate the EC economy in general will contract by 0.3 per cent, compared to 0.8 per cent growth forecast earlier this year. The commissioner said that next year the EC is likely to grow between 1 and 2 per cent - far less than the 3 per cent seen as necessary to stop job losses and create employment. Mr Christophersen called on member states to consider measures to stimulate growth, citing the recent tax reform and job-creating measures adopted by the Danish and French governments respectively. But he acknowledged that members states' public deficits - which could reach an EC average of 6 per cent of GNP this year - were too high to leave much room for budgetary manoeuvre. Mr Padraig Flynn, EC Social Affairs Commissioner, insisted that the struggle against growing structural unemployment would make headway only if it was tackled with the vigour seen in Europe's efforts to set up the single market. 'The single market was a success because it had an agenda and a timetable,' he said. Mr Flynn was disappointed with the inconclusive debate on the Commission's framework plan to tackle the jobs crisis when employment ministers met last week, and are still pushing for it to be considered at the Copenhagen summit on June 21 and 22.</p>

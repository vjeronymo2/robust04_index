			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Italian minister urged to resign ITALY'S health minister, Mr Franco De Lorenzo, yesterday faced calls to resign after deputies voted to remove his immunity from prosecution. Mr De Lorenzo, a Liberal from Naples, is under investigation following allegations that he, along with other Naples politicians, exchanged political favours, such as guaranteed jobs, for votes. The decision on Mr De Lorenzo's immunity still has to be ratified by the full Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower house. On Wednesday , the lower house committee also voted in favour of lifting the immunity from prosecution of the two other MPs involved in the case, Mr Giulio Di Donato, a Socialist, and Mr Alfredo Vito, a Christian Democrat (DC). The latest twists in Italy's corruption scandal could complicate moves by leaders of the four-party coalition to bring other parties into government. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, yesterday declined to comment on Mr De Lorenzo or a possible cabinet reshuffle, before delivering a statement to the Senate, the upper house, today. Early next month the committee on immunity is expected to hear testimony from Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist party leader, before opening discussions on whether to lift Mr Craxi's immunity on two of the six requests by Milan magistrates. Meanwhile in Milan, magistrates yesterday began questioning Mrs Enza Tomaselli, Mr Craxi's long-standing private secretary in his Milan office. Mrs Tomaselli, who was arrested on Wednesday, is reported to have denied allegations of corruption and collusion in illegal party funding. According to testimony from other witnesses involved in the corruption scandal, leaked by the Milan magistrature, Mr Craxi's office was a focal point for the payment of illegal kickbacks to the party.</p>

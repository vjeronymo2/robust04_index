			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the required long-term period applicable to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the unit to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it has been sold to a household with an income that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board requests comments on two proposed options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this requirement. These options incorporate the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sampling to monitor AHP-assisted projects. The Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that as the number of AHP-assisted projects in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence grows, the costs of monitoring these projects may place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an undue financial burden on the Banks and the AHP. Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted projects on a sample basis may be one way to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the costs of monitoring while continuing to meet the monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of relevant reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including any reports or certifications received pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule and, at least on a sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, periodic review of land title records at intervals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Bank, based on the amount of funds received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project, or other factors deemed relevant by the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative option would be to require that the Bank only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to review land title records on a sample basis, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Rental housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank shall require an AHP-assisted rental housing project to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to a deed restriction or other legally enforceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism which requires that upon sale of the project prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by households with incomes at or below the level committed to in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP application, the Bank or its designee must receive notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the sale, and:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The project's rental units, or portion thereof, must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be affordable for and occupied by households with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, and the purchaser agrees to be subject to the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the seller must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay a pro rata portion of the grant to the applicant, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in &sect;960.16(d)(1) of the proposed rule; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seller, then the provisions of &sect;960.16(d)(2) shall apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing project or one year after initial disbursement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidized advance or direct subsidy, whichever occurs first, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the owner that the project's units, or portion thereof, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy at or below the levels committed to in the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the long-term period for which the units, or portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereof, of a rental housing project must remain affordable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall monitor the project to determine whether the project's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, or portion thereof, remain affordable for and occupied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP application. The Board requests comments on several options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for implementing this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of relevant household income and rent reports or certifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from the sponsor or the owner and, at least on a sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, periodic inspections of the project at intervals to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Bank, based on the amount of AHP assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by the project, the type and complexity of the project,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other factors deemed relevant by the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

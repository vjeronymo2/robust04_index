			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage unwinding reverses Nikkei's recent uptrend Arbitrage unwinding hurt share prices, and the Nikkei 225 average closed lower for the first time in four trading days in spite of buying by banks and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 62.02 at 19,013.60 after fluctuating between 18,961.79 and 19,111.42. The market fell below the 19,000 level in the morning due to arbitrage unwinding triggered by a decline in futures. Financial institutions supported the index, but failed to counter continued futures-linked selling. Volume contracted to 270m shares from 335m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 1.21 to 1,519.20, and the Nikkei 300 edged down 0.34 to 279.74. Losers led gainers by 543 to 482, with 164 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.25 firmer at 1,256.19. Brokers and corporate investors were also buying in small lots. Overseas investors, who have been liquidating holdings in steels and shipbuilders, continued their sales but traders noted that they were purchasing banks and car shares. Traders expect arbitrage unwinding to continue through to the December 9 futures settlement. However, the outstanding level of unsettled arbitrage positions has declined to 690m shares, alleviating fears of a sharp drop in cash prices ahead of the settlement day. The steels sector, reflecting the foreign selling, had Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, Y10 cheaper at Y374 and NKK Y6 weaker at Y267. Airlines were lower on profit-taking, All Nippon Airways shedding Y20 to Y1,090 and Japan Airlines Y10 to Y720. Banking stocks were higher on position-covering. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank put on Y40 at Y1,800 and Mitsubishi Bank Y50 at Y2,260. Toshiba rose Y9 to Y701 on buying by investment trust funds. Other electricals eased on profit-taking, Sanyo Electric losing Y6 at Y574 and Hitachi Y2 at Y975. Privatisation issues were weak, with Japan Tobacco off Y3,000 at Y960,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone losing Y5,000 at Y835,000. In Osaka, the OSE average was up a slight 0.67 at 21,179.01 in volume of 18m shares after profit-taking eroded earlier gains. But Nintendo, the video game maker, ended Y290 stronger at Y5,680 and Ono Pharmaceutical Y120 ahead at Y4,840. Roundup Regional markets moved in divergent directions. KUALA LUMPUR saw a steady stream of selling triggered by a spate of bearish market rumours, ranging from programme selling, the redemption of shares by foreign investors and a private placement of shares. The composite index closed 27.00 or 2.7 per cent down at 986.13. Losers included Tenaga and Telekom, which receded 50 cents to MDollars 10.50 and 40 cents to MDollars 18.40 respectively. Among the day's gainers were shares that were added to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index. Ekran advanced 25 cents to MDollars 9.15 and Mycom moved up 22 cents to MDollars 4.80. SINGAPORE was dragged lower by the fall in Malaysia and on light programme selling by Hong Kong institutions. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 12.74 at 2,229.35, off the day's high of 2,246.21. Brokers commented that Malaysian shares traded over the counter faced fresh turbulence, driven by renewed rumours of growing dissent in the ruling Malay party, UMNO. MANILA fell 1.7 per cent on the continued weakness of overseas markets and news that an oil well in the south was not commercially viable. The composite index slipped 45.83 to 2,645.36 in volume of 5.5m shares worth 1.3bn pesos. The announcement of 5.9 per cent third-quarter growth came too late to affect the day's trading. Selling in oil stocks was brought about by an announcement from the local division of Occidental Petroleum that it planned to abandon its Bantac-1 well. SEOUL lost ground in hectic trading after aggressive institutional profit-taking took its toll, in spite of active foreign buying of blue chips as the authorities raised the ceiling of foreign ownership of shares by 2 percentage points to 12 per cent. The composite index was finally off 8.20 at 1,066.21. The Securities Supervisory Board official said foreign investors bought their traditional favourites - blue chips and shares with low price/earnings ratios - to their permitted new limit in early trading. As a result, local investment trusts sought to materialise recent gains in their holdings of the blue chips. Both Korea Mobile Telecom and Samsung Electronics went limit down, losing Won12,000 and Won3,000 to Won499,000 and Won123,400 respectively. HONG KONG was modestly lower after a solid technical rebound in the morning evaporated in late trade on declining index futures. The Hang Seng index fell 35.46 to close at 8,430.80 after jumping to a day's high of 8,555.26. Turnover dropped to HKDollars 3.0bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 4.3bn. Property issues were the hardest hit, with Henderson Land slipping HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 40.50, Cheung Kong 40 cents to HKDollars 31.80 and Sun Hung Kai Properties 20 cents to HKDollars 49.50. SYDNEY ended higher after recouping earlier losses, led by a recovery in futures and a gain for BHP. The All Ordinaries index rose 9.7 to 1,900.4, its best for the day and well off its low of 1,881.2. Trade was moderately active, with stock valued at ADollars 434m changing hands. The futures contract was up 14 at 1,904, just below its high for the day of 1,905. Brokers said that trade was moderate overall, with turnover boosted by a portfolio transaction of more than ADollars 60m handled by County NatWest Securities. BHP finished at ADollars 19.06, up 38 cents and well off its low of ADollars 18.62. BTR Nylex added 4 cents at ADollars 2.44 following news of a debt for equity swap and the appointment of a new chief executive. News Corp weakened 7 cents to ADollars 5.15 on nervousness over possible moves by the US FCC on a challenge to its ownership of the Fox network. TAIPEI added 1.3 per cent in modest trade, with rises mainly in state-run banks boosted by buying from the ruling Nationalist party's investment divisions ahead of tomorrow's elections. The weighted index gained 80.33 at 6,444.05, after a 6,471.41 high. Turnover was TDollars 42.74bn. Financials, especially state-run banks, led the gains, with Farmers Bank climbing by its daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 58. Textiles moved ahead on polyester filament and nylon filament price rises, with China Manmade closing limit up at TDollars 37.30 and Hualon 90 cents higher at TDollars 24. BANGKOK rose on buying of finance stocks led by local funds. The SET index was 9.16 ahead at 1,371.60 after touching 1,380.73. Turnover amounted to Bt7.3bn, compared with Bt3.99bn on Wednesday. Plastic bag and straw maker Thantawan, which made its debut, closed at Bt73.50 after peaking at Bt75. The inflated volume was attributed to trading of the new listing and large-lot trading in shares of New Imperial Hotel worth a total of Bt2.3bn because of a change in ownership. The finance sector was the biggest gainer and the most active, strengthening 2.84 per cent on Bt1.3bn turnover.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA CHAMBER'S TAX STAND CRITICIZED  </P> <P> Perhaps there are good reasons why Pasadena should not tax interstate and  foreign phone calls, but the Chamber of Commerce failed to mention any in their  arguments to the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> Chamber President Don Pollard claimed that businesses pay 60% of all city taxes  and receive only 40% of the services, and that a new tax would weigh more  heavily on the business community. He recommended that the city cut expenses  for citizen committees and commissions rather than impose this new tax.  </P> <P> I'm not in favor of this new tax, but I am disappointed in the chamber's  attitude and in its apparent disdain for the residents of Pasadena. Because  about one-third of the taxes the chamber says Pasadena businesses pay are in  the form of sales taxes, and because most of this is paid by consumers when  they purchase goods and services, it seems to me that the chamber's opinion  lacks credence.  </P> <P> The chamber goes on to say that some businesses would be severely impacted by  the phone tax. However, companies generally pass every cost on to their  clients.  </P> <P> To me, the most offensive part of the chamber's recommendation is the proposed  reduction of spending for citizen committees and commissions.  </P> <P> Yes, there will always be inefficiency, but as a free people, this is a small  price to pay for democracy. Our committees and commissions cut across ethnic  and economic barriers, bring our people together for a common purpose and give  vitality to our community. One neighbor told me that, if that's the way the  chamber feels about us, she'll do all her shopping in Glendale, Arcadia and  Alhambra.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is time for the chamber to spend less time whining about the taxes  that are passed on to consumers and more time insisting on such things as more  city parks.  </P> <P> It's time for the chamber to stop thinking in terms of "us versus them" and to  start taking pride in Pasadena, as a whole, and in the residents who play a  large part in making Pasadena businesses a success.  </P> <P> DAVID W. STOVER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (10): Unsatisfactory term, must try harder - The Schools, anxiety for the class of '91 THE UK schools' computer business has been going through an unsatisfactory term and there seems little prospect of improvement in the near future. The two principal manufacturers in the sector, Acorn Computers of Cambridge and Research Machines of Oxford, have been monitoring their sales figures anxiously as the financial year draws to a close and are becoming convinced that economic circumstances and legislative changes are conspiring to force into decline a market which normally expands reliably if unspectacularly. Mr Michael Fischer, chairman and chief executive of Research Machines, said the sales bonanza which usually characterises the first three months of the year had failed to materialise. 'It is pretty bad news for us,' he said, adding that the sales decline was disappointing after the company's record results last year. Its turnover was Pounds 63m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.25m. Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director of Acorn Computers, said sales had been uneven through the year. He did not think there would be a first-quarter sales increase and overall he believed total spending in schools would decline. School computer sales normally surge in the first quarter of the year because, with the end of the financial year in sight, special grants for computer purchase, worth perhaps Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m, become available on an ad hoc basis from the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Trade and Industry. In the current economic climate, however, suppliers are not optimistic that money will be available from these sources this year. Schools and local education authorities have traditionally raced to spend their financial allocations by the end of the financial year with the result that money from a variety of budgets becomes available for computers. This year, suppliers believe that schools are storing cash away against a bleak economic outlook. The evidence is that they are deferring decisions to buy more computers. While exact numbers have yet to be collated following the end of the government's financial year this month, it seems likely that a market that was expected to grow by 10 per cent will contract by the same amount, an overall decline of some 20 per cent. This bad news comes at the end of 12 months of unsettling volatility in what is normally a predictable market. The spread of local management of schools (LMS), which by 1993 will ensure that all schools in England and Wales with more than 200 pupils will control their own budgets, has resulted in confusion and uncertainty among those newly responsible for, but unused to, taking decisions about computer hardware and software. In the past, they have relied heavily on advice from local education authority advisers. Some will continue to do so. Also, difficulties local authorities are experiencing in administering the poll tax has added an element of uncertainty to the value of capitation grants they will make to schools. School computing is not big business - the whole UK educational computer market including colleges, polytechnics and universities is worth less than Pounds 200m. It is, however, a niche market par excellence in the computing business and those companies which have made it their own have enjoyed steady returns in recent years. The principal players, Acorn and Research Machines, derive their strength from the intimate relationship they have built up with their customers, their understanding of the educational process and their willingness to provide extensive service for modest returns. Large suppliers like IBM and Apple, while strong in the universities and colleges, have little part in school computing and are unlikely to make inroads. School computing is two markets in one - the market for educational computing and the market for educational administration. Research Machines and Acorn, with a wealth of ready-written, high quality educational software have cornered the market for educational computing in schools. They are less dominant in educational administration where there is more of a need for conventional computer power. Acorn, part of the Italian Olivetti group which developed the BBC microcomputer, has dominated the schools market since the early 1980s. Acorn systems are installed in 85 per cent of schools. It is especially strong in the primary sector where it boasts familiarity and an impressive range of educational software, with more than 1,000 programs listed in the Acorn Education Directory. Company's latest machines feature a high-performance microprocessor of its own design which has persuaded Apple Computer of the US to establish a joint company with VLSI Technology and Acorn to exploit the technology. About half Acorn's revenues of about Pounds 50m come from sales to schools. Research Machines of Oxford, privately held, is second overall to Acorn, but holds 44 per cent of the market in secondary schools and 29 per cent in colleges. About 60 per cent of its sales of Pounds 63m are to schools and it has a strong toehold in government computing and computer-aided design. Research Machines competes in both the computers for education and computers for administration sectors. Recently it won a Pounds 4m order to provide every secondary school in Northern Ireland with the hardware and software for LMS. While the combined effects of LMS, the economy and the poll tax on computer sales are depressing for the companies involved, they also raise questions about the preparedness of schools to teach the national curriculum. A recent study by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology - the independent body that reports to parliament on the scientific and technological implications of big issues such as food irradiation and the greenhouse effect - suggested that schools in England and Wales would need Pounds 310m during the next five years to deliver the computer education required by the curriculum. It is worrying that that sum is unlikely to be made available. It is equally worrying that nobody seems sure of how much money schools will be prepared to spend on computers in the next few years.</p>

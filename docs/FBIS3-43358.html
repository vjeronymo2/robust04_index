Indications are that the Angolan foreign  minister will present Luanda's latest national reconciliation  proposals to Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN  special representative in Angola, confirmed today that the  government and the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] will resume their peace talks in Lusaka tomorrow,  after the festive season recess. The UN special representative  announced this to the media shortly before leaving Luanda for  quick visits to Gabon and Zaire. He will be briefing the heads  of state of those two countries on the reality of the situation  at the Angolan peace talks. It is also noteworthy that a team of  U.S. senators is to arrive in Luanda today, after postponing  their scheduled visit late last year. Gustavo Costa, our  correspondent in Angola, provides some details concerning the  national reconciliation counterproposal that Foreign Minister  Venancio de Moura will be presenting to the UN secretary general  today.    [Begin Costa recording] According to a source close to the  Angolan peace talks, the new national reconciliation  counterproposal includes three ministerial portfolios for UNITA  to be indicated by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,  two to be suggested by Prime Minister Marcolino Moco, and at  least three embassies to be led by UNITA, among other new  developments. Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de  Moura is expected to deliver that proposal to UN Secretary  General Butrus Burtrus-Ghali in New York today.    Some observers feel that Venancio de Moura's call on the UN  secretary general one day before the talks are due to resume in  Lusaka shows that the Luanda government intends to use Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's personal influence with UNITA leader Jonas  Savimbi so the latter will accept the government's  counterproposal and will agree to the setting of a date to sign  the cease-fire accord.    Diplomatic sources say that Luanda's response suggests an  attempt to meet UNITA's initial proposal halfway. It is already  known, however, that UNITA will not be given some key ministries  it has demanded. Luanda is reported to have shown inflexibility  concerning the Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior  Ministries, but it may be more open to UNITA holding ministerial  portfolios linked to social and production sectors. Luanda is  keeping open the possibility that UNITA will retain the Culture  Ministry and it has replied that UNITA will only control three  of the six embassies it has demanded.    Meanwhile, moves linked to the Angolan peace process are not  taking place in New York alone. In fact, the seriousness of  this country's situation is such that a team of U.S. congressmen  [as heard] has come to Luanda to assess on the ground the  complexity of a problem whose solution seems increasingly linked  to a higher U.S. profile in a bid to reduce mistrust between the  government and UNITA. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos  received the U.S. team in Luanda this afternoon, but UNITA,  through its Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel radio  station, has already announced that it would like to see the  team of U.S. congressmen in Huambo tomorrow to discuss troop  demobilization and national reconstruction issues with UNITA  leader Jonas Savimbi.    It appears, though, that such a visit is not on the agenda  of  the U.S. congressmen's stay in Angola. An official source has  disclosed that, contrary to initial reports by sources in the  Angolan Parliament, tomorrow the U.S. team will visit Malange  rather than Bie [Cuito].    UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the (?key  figure) in the negotiation process, is one person who does not  appear to be satisfied with half measures. Today, he stopped  over in Libreville, the Gabonese capital, and Gbadolite, in  Zaire. Upon his return from Sao Tome and Principe yesterday, UN  Special Representative Blondin Beye said that military issues  will not be up for discussion again when peace talks resume in  the Zambian capital tomorrow. Diplomatic sources say that such  issues will only be the subject of adjustments when the  government and UNITA military leaders meet in Sao Tome on 10  January to define practical measures conducive to the signing  and effective implementation of the cease-fire accord.

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New issues machine back in gear - Institutional mood towards flotations is changing After a summer of discontent for the city's vast new issues machine, which almost ground to a halt in the face of institutional hostility, recovering share prices have cranked up the machine once more. The Stock Exchange estimates that it has between 40 and 50 companies currently in its new issues pipeline. A further 25 have made initial approaches, which could be translated into flotations by the year-end. The net result is that 1994 will overwhelmingly break both the 1986 record of Pounds 9bn of flotations for a year and the 1993 record number of 180 initial public offers. This year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick's figures, an estimated 147 flotations have sucked up Pounds 7.5bn of institutional capital and added companies with an initial market value of close to Pounds 13bn. These statistics might suggest a return to the euphoric reception of new issues during the bull market of the mid-1980s, but the reality could hardly be more different. Institutions all demonstrate an enormous wariness towards the flood of new scrip. Companies such as Canadian Pizza, United Carriers and Nottingham Group, which encountered unexpected sales declines shortly after flotation, have made it more difficult to persuade fund managers to support less than quality issues. As Mr Neil Austin, of Peat Marwick Corporate Finance, says: 'One of the advantages of the shake-out is that those opportunistic, or downright greedy, companies that shouldn't float will not be able to. I think we have lost that fringe element for the moment.' Primary causes of the recovery in confidence were the 3i and Exco flotations. Both received strong institutional support for share offers despite uncertain market conditions. Backers were rewarded with share price increases of 18 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. However, enthusiasm will be tempered by less successful flotations such as on-line business information group MAID, whose shares fell 61 per cent below the 110p issue price, before recovering to a 36 per cent discount. Investors are likely to be faced with a mixture of both. Larger companies, such as Thorn Lighting and ED &amp; F Man, have experienced managements and long track records, and are expected to get positive responses at the right price. By contrast, there are a number of smaller companies that have been touting themselves over too many months, which may encounter less enthusiasm. The list of impending floats will include names such as Ashbourne Homes, Bright Reasons, Century Inns, Compell Group, Datrontech, Filtronic Comtek, Optus, Seaperfect, Servisair and USM Texon. Brokers said they hoped that these would be evenly spread throughout the remainder of the year, but the reality will be the opposite. There is a sense that there is only a limited window of opportunity. Companies and their advisers are therefore already jostling to get to the front of the line, to ensure that they are not left exposed when institutional appetites are satiated. The dangers for those that miss the boat are great. London Capital's flotation was pulled at the last minute, as major shareholder Citibank refused to sell out at the prices dictated by its advisers - close to a 15 per cent discount to assets. Analysts said there were concerns over the LCH's management, which might have been ignored in a stronger market. However, having withdrawn once, it would be likely to struggle to get a positive response a second time and a trade sale is now considered a more likely exit for Citibank. British Printing Company was another casualty, but it was beaten more on price than quality and is expected to relaunch its offer, after completing accounts for the current year. In the past, marginal flotations could be propped up through support from the small retail investor, but this year the public have played only a limited role. The Capital Shopping Centres public offer was only 14.4 per cent subscribed, and even after an aggressive marketing campaign, the public portion of the 3i offer was only 1.1 times subscribed. Institutional shareholders are therefore the key to success, and they are returning from summer holidays with money to spend from recent bids and dividends and a more positive outlook for the market. The race is now on to see how many new issues can get through before the mood changes once more.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour presses government over party funding THE Conservative party disclosed yesterday that it had been contacted by Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrators, for the first time since giving the accountants details of the company's donations to the party some 18 months ago. The move came as Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, led a vigorous Tory assault against labour accusations of 'sleaze and corruption' in the party's funding. During a stormy Commons debate Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said that he had just received a letter from Touche Ross. The administrators had not previously been in touch since Sir John Cope, then party deputy chairman, had written to them in October 1991 giving details of the company's Pounds 440,000 donations to the Tories. Sir Norman added: 'I hope Touche Ross now start dealing with us and will not seek to pursue this through the newspapers.' This latest twist to the saga came as the Conservatives argued strongly that financial support for political parties should be left on a voluntary basis and should not be made a compulsory burden on the taxpayer. Mr Hunt told MPs that Labour's hidden agenda in the row over Conservative finances was to get its 'paws' on the public purse by forcing the introduction of state funding for political parties. In a fighting speech which provoked howls of outrage on the crowded Labour benches opposite, the employment secretary said Labour's financial 'crisis' had left it eager for the taxpayer to 'bail out their sinking ship'. Both Mr Hunt and Sir Norman attacked Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour party deputy leader, for choosing to lace her opening speech in yesterday's debate on the funding of political parties with 'rumour' and 'innuendo'. Mr Hunt said it was a 'shabby, irresponsible, miserable' speech of which he thought Mrs Beckett would one day be ashamed. Mrs Beckett repeatedly sparked pandemonium on the Tory backbenches with the forthrightness of her allusions to recent reports about the alleged trading of contributions for honours and the extent to which the Conservative party is funded by undisclosed or foreign donations. For as long as the Conservative party would not reveal where it got 'more than 50 per cent' of its money from, she said, the suspicion would exist that the damage that would be done if voters found out must be 'even worse' than the damage being inflicted at the moment. While Mr Hunt attacked Labour's links with the trade unions, Mrs Beckett maintained that the 'heart of the matter' was that a wide range of allegations could be made because of the 'secrecy' that surrounded the accounts of the Conservative party. In one of her more telling thrusts, Mrs Beckett said that the Hartley Investment Trust - the company which had given the largest ever recorded donation to the Conservative party - had broken the law by failing to file accounts for the years ending March 1991 and March 1992 on time. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful Tory 1922 committee of Tory backbench MPs, was a director of the company, she said.</p>

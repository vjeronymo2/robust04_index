Ms Harriet Lamb, development movement campaign officer, said Africa in particular would suffer as, on the ODA's own calculations, the percentage of total British aid to Africa was set to fall from 14.4 per cent in 1994-95 to 12.1 per cent in 1997. Mr Ben Jackson, the movement's campaigns co-ordinator, complained that the chancellor had had to stump up Britain's share of the Edinburgh summit's commitment to increase European aid by 60 per cent by the end of the decade.

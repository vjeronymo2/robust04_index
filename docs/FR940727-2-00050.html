If not complete in that period of time, the order would require the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In addition, the proposed consent agreement would require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years, before acquiring any similar business interest in any of the three specified towns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be directed to FTC/Office of the Secretary, Room 159, 6th St. and Pa.

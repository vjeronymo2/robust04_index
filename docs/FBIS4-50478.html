			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 May, the Hainan Provincial Higher People's  Court, the provincial people's procuratorate, the provincial  public security department, and the provincial judicial  department issued a circular on severely cracking down on  criminal activities in which guns are used. We publicize the  circular's contents as follows:    To maintain social security stability and to protect the  safety of people's lives and property, it is necessary to  severely crack down on criminal activities in which guns are  used. Relevant matters are announced as follows:    1. The gun-related crimes discussed in this circular refer  to such criminal behaviors as the use of guns to murder, harm,  rob, kidnap, and engage in gang fights; the illegal manufacture,  trade, and running of weapons; the illegal storing of firearms  and ammunition, including simulated guns; and the harboring of,  and divulging secret information to a small number of criminals.    2. Those engaged in these activities must cease all their  criminal activities from the date of the promulgation of this  circular and willingly surrender themselves to local public  security organs, relevant departments, or their work units;  confess their crimes; and surrender all their firearms and  ammunition so as to seek lenient treatment.    3. Those illegally possessing various kinds of military  firearms, guns for shooting purposes, hunting guns, and other  self- made antipersonnel firearms, detonators, and ammunition  who continue to hide them after the termination of the time  limit set by this circular will be severely published for the  charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition.    4. Various types of criminals using the guns mentioned above  who surrender themselves between the date of the promulgation of  this circular and 1 July 1994, and who perform meritorious  services by informing against other offenders, will be punished  leniently, given mitigated punishment, or excused from  punishment according to law. Those in custody and criminals  serving their sentences who willingly confess their crimes and  render meritorious services by reporting and exposing criminal  activities in which guns are used will be punished leniently or  given mitigated punishment according to law.    5. Those who refuse to surrender themselves and confess  their crimes, who destroy evidence, who spirit away their  firearms and ammunition, who shield one another, who form pacts  to shield one another, or who abscond so as to avoid punishment  and refuse to be arrested, and who are brought to justice after  the termination of the given time limit will be firmly and  severely punished.    6. Those who know of criminal activities in which guns are  used all have the duty to report and expose them to public  security organs, judicial organs, or relevant departments.  Those who have made contributions in informing against and  helping the authorities capture criminals using guns will be  rewarded on the merits of each case.    7. Those who intercede for and personally shield criminals  using guns or who hide and destroy evidence and arrange and  create false evidence for criminals will be severely punished.    8. Those who illegally carry firearms and ammunition, once  discovered, will be subject to forceful measures and will be  investigated and handled according to law.    9. Public security personnel discharging duties in  accordance with this circular are entitled to shoot those who  are committing a crime using guns and criminals armed with guns  who are resisting arrest.</p>

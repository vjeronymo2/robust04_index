			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECOND BLAZE BURNS BRIEFLY AT PENDLETON;  </P> <P> BRUSH FIRES: THIS ONE SCORCHES ABOUT 200 ACRES JUST EAST OF THE THREE-DAY FIRE.  BOTH ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.  </P> <P> Another brush fire broke out Friday morning in the Camp Pendleton hills, just  east of the acreage scorched in a dramatic three-day fire earlier this week.  </P> <P> Marine Cpl. Connie Panichi said the latest fire burned 200 acres and lasted  from about 11:15 a.m. to 2 p.m., bringing to about 5,000 acres the total amount  blackened by fire this week on and near the Marine Corps base.  </P> <P> As in the earlier fire, the cause of Friday's blaze is "under investigation,"  Panichi said. Reports that the earlier fire, which started Tuesday night, was  sparked by military maneuvers could not be confirmed.  </P> <P> "We have no word at all on anything like that," Panichi said.  </P> <P> Capt. Dan Young, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Department, said the  location of a fire's beginning can usually be determined quickly. He added that  if something like downed power lines ignited the fire, that would probably  already have been determined.  </P> <P> "Most of the time, investigators can identify at least where a fire started  within minutes," he said.  </P> <P> Jack Stubbs, a spokesman for the San Clemente Fire Department, the first  department called to assist Camp Pendleton firefighters Tuesday evening, said  he was convinced that the blaze was not arson.  </P> <P> "Downed wires are what our people are talking about now," Stubbs said. "I am  satisfied it was not arson or a Marine maneuver-related start."  </P> <P> Stubbs, who was at San Clemente City Hall working on election results when the  fire call came in about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, said the inordinately strong winds  were the reason the fire burned until about 4 p.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> "Our firefighters were saying that the wind gusts were up to 65 m.p.h., maybe  higher," Stubbs said. "When you charge up a hose line, turn on the water and  then see it blown right back in your face, it makes conventional firefighting  equipment seem pretty inadequate. We have veteran firefighters here who have  seen a lot of fires, and they said this was exceptionally bad."  </P> <P> Young said his firefighters estimated the wind gusts hit 80 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "That fire jumped Interstate 5 like it was nothing," Young added.  </P> <P> About 450 firefighters, 71 fire engines and four bulldozers from 12 fire  agencies worked on the three-day blaze, but only one injury was reported. San  Juan Capistrano firefighter Shawn Barret suffered an injured ankle.  </P> <P> "That's a pretty good safety record," Young said.  </P> <P> Young warned that the fire season has a long way to go.  </P> <P> "November is historically the worst fire month in this area, probably all over  Southern California," he said. "We need some rain, not one day of rain, but  three or four good days of rain, before we are out of trouble. It is very dry  out there."  </P></p>

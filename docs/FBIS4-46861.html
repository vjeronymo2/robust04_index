Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the RF Government,  recently issued concrete instructions regarding its  implementation to a number of federal ministries and departments.    In particular, A. Chubays (Russian State Committee for the  Management of State Property) has been instructed to submit  draft legislative acts on the reform of state enterprises. The  Russian Finance Ministry is to submit to the RF Government  before 20 July 1994 proposals regarding the organization of  funding for the elimination of a federal state enterprise and  settlements with creditors.    The corresponding federal bodies have been instructed to  draft and submit to the government prior to 20 June this year a  coordinated draft decree on the ratification of the model  charter of a state-funded plant (state-funded factory,  state-funded farm) created on the basis of an eliminated federal  state enterprise.    July 20 this year is the date prescribed for the submission  of proposals regarding the procedure for the elimination of a  federal state enterprise, the creation of a state-funded plant  on the basis thereof, and the confiscation from the state-funded  plant (state-funded factory, state-funded farm) of property  which is not used by it or which is not used as specified, and  also for the submission of a draft RF Government ruling on the  procedure for planning and funding the activity of state-funded  plants.    RF ministries and departments have been asked to verify, in  accordance with prescribed procedure, documents and facts  pertaining to the activity of state enterprises and to draft  before 1 September 1994 proposals regarding the creation of  state-funded plants (state-funded factories, state-funded farms).</p>

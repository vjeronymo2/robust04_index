			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 22 (XINHUA) -- China will give  priority to the development of chain stores in order to boost  its retail trade and better adapt its commercial activities to  international standards.    This was recently stated by He Jihai, vice-president of the  State Ministry of Internal Trade, at the national spring  commodity fair held in Tianjin.    According to He, China will soon lift certain restrictions  on  its retail trade to encourage the growth of chain stores.    Foreign investors are welcome to set up and develop more  chain stores in China in order to promote the reform and renewal  of China's traditional ways of operation in commercial  activities.    Commercial enterprises are also encouraged to take advantage  of the new round of reforms in the transformation of operating  mechanisms and to establish chain shops or chain commercial  groups with Chinese characteristics but strictly in accordance  with international standards through combination, transfer of  assets and introduction of stock system.    Enterprises allowed to set up chain stores include  restaurants, supermarkets, book stores, jewelry stores and  pharmacies.    Statistics of the Ministry of Internal Trade show that China  now has 100-plus chain stores, concentrated in large cities.  Less than one-third of them have reached international  standards.</p>

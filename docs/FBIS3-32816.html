			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Enrique Santos Calderon] </F>   [Text] How things change. Until a few weeks ago President  Gaviria enjoyed a prestige and popularity not very common for a  president so close to the end of his term. He was way ahead,  perhaps too far ahead.    In less than a month his radiant image has dimmed  noticeably.  The airplane episode [in which musicians traveled on government  aircraft] and the Juanchaco problem -- the disappointment  ["Juanchasco" -- play on Spanish word chasco] -- has eroded  presidential credibility. Paraphrasing the latest vallenato  [Colombian folk dance] tune, one could say that the bottom has  fallen out of Gaviria's popularity.    The truth is that it is regrettable. But one could see  something of the sort coming. I hate quoting myself, but 15  days ago I warned in this column that one got the impression  that the president was slacking off certain affairs and that it  was not advisable to let go of the reigns of power in a country  as unpredictable as ours. Among other reasons, this is because  there is nothing so fickle as public opinion about a president  and any negligence in an area sensitive to public opinion can  wipe away any prestige in a matter of days.    The affair dealing with the presidential airplane -- one of  those slips that public opinion tolerate less and less from  politicians and presidents -- has taken a back seat in the face  of the Juanchaco affair following the unanimous decision by the  State Council to request the Chamber of Deputies Accusation  Commission to investigate the president's conduct.    This is how a white lie, the negligent and light treatment  of  a potentially explosive topic, became a crisis of state in a  delicate legal-political process that can end up as a trial  against the president by Congress for violation of the country's  Constitution and national sovereignty.    If the country is spoken to clearly and frankly on the  presence of U.S. military units in Juanchaco and if the people  are told directly why they are here or even told that they are  here to help us fight drug trafficking and terrorism, I am sure  that a very positive current of opinion would have been  generated in favor of the arrival of the corps of engineers  military battalion.    But when trivial explanations or artful subterfuge are  resorted to, when legal entities are bypassed for the sake of  commodity or ease, and when contradictions and inconsistencies  begin to appear, public opinion starts to become distrustful and  critical. The fact is that nobody, even if they are in total  favor of the U.S. military presence, likes to be told half  truths or have the pill sweetened.    Openness is what was lacking right from the start. Such a  fashionable concept was totally absent, especially in the  statements of many high-ranking government officials who forgot  to apply it when they should have remembered it the most.    The closest presidential advisers are to blame in this  regard. Perhaps they have been too naive, dull, or slow, or they  are simply inexperienced.    The lack of a more open and honest attitude with the public  during difficult moments has affected the Gaviria administration  on other occasions. The blackout, Escobar's escape, and the  presidential plane incident have been situations in which  Colombians got the impression that they were being cheated. It  is true that every time this impression has become general, the  president has faced up to things and has called news conferences  to clear any doubts. But it is always difficult to erase the  initial bad taste of knowing that someone was trying to deceive  you.    This said, I should add that I believe the Juanchaco  situation is being blown out of proportion. It seems as though  we are being invaded militarily by an enemy foreign power. But  anything is possible in a country where more value is given to  the form than the spirit of the law.    We should not forget either the repeated tensions between  the  Executive Branch and the State Council, whose statement will  create a difficult political situation for the president,  particularly because we are in an electoral campaign toward the  end of an administration. This is the time in which all  opportunisms emerge, new opposition members sprout, and  everywhere the most unsuspected defenders of national  sovereignty appear.    The electoral use of the Juanchaco episode should not  convince anyone. Its political use is too obvious and clumsy.  That the campaign against the "yankee invasion" is being led by  those who are encouraging the terrorist destruction of our  economic infrastructure -- which is truly vital for our  sovereignty -- is just another depressing chapter in this  electoral chauvinism.    It is sad, ironic, and certainly unfair that a good and  capable president must suffer all these hardships toward the end  of his mandate. Everything indicated that Gaviria would finish  his presidential period with flying colors. However, instead of  being carried out on people's shoulders through the big door, he  suddenly ends up gored in the infirmary.    The reason behind this is that this mad bull called Colombia  charges without warning and gores treacherously. That is why it  is always advised to take the bull by the horns without letting  go for a minute until the next bullfighter comes along -- never  before then.</p>

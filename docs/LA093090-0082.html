			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTS FESTIVALS;  </P> <P> IT'S SAN FRANCISCO'S TURN;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL 2000 CELEBRATES CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND IS SEEN AS A "BOOKEND" TO  L.A.'S RECENTLY COMPLETED ARTS FEST  </P> <P> As Los Angeles winds down from its arts festival, San Francisco is gearing up  to launch a 23-day extravaganza of its own.  </P> <P> Grandly billed as "one of the most ambitious celebrations of the arts ever held  in an American city," Festival 2000 kicks off Saturday with a gala "Sole Night"  dance concert at the War Memorial Opera House, hosted by legendary  choreographer Katherine Dunham and featuring the American Indian Dance Theatre,  the Muntu Dance Theater of Chicago and Jelon Viera's DanceBrazil.  </P> <P> Budgeted at $2.5 million, with $500,000 from the City of San Francisco, the  Festival 2000 tab amounts to half what the 1990 Los Angeles Festival cost. But  in its own fashion, the San Francisco event is as logistically complex and  controversial as Peter Sellars' elaborate undertaking.  </P> <P> Both festivals were planned around the guiding principle of "multiculturalism"  -- that ubiquitous buzzword for the ethnic diversity that is already a  demographic fact of life in California, if not yet a social reality. But, while  the Los Angeles event presented traditional art forms from "root" cultures of  the Pacific Rim, Festival 2000 is commissioning new works by American artists  of many backgrounds. Half the offerings are original, cross-ethnic "fusion"  pieces; the remainder are imported existing works in a similar vein.  </P> <P> Lenwood Sloan, the ebullient director of the festival and its chief architect,  views the L.A. and San Francisco events as "bookends."  </P> <P> "There have always been festivals of looking back, and they're important," says  Sloan. "But they also tend to freeze-dry cultures into dashikis and kimonos and  mariachis and drums.  </P> <P> "We're not doing an ethnic festival, but a presentation of futuristic pieces by  artists of color," he emphasizes. "You won't find any exotic food booths at  Festival 2000, or any exotic crafts on sale. And we're not talking about Africa  or Asia or South America -- we're talking about Chicago and Oakland and San  Antonio. We're dealing with living, kinetic expressions, and trying to create a  body of exciting collaborative work that will be infused into the national  culture."  </P> <P> Other key players in the festival echo Sloan's commitment to work that is  contemporary and culturally eclectic. They stress that such collaborations by  white, black, Asian American, Native American and Latino artists may help  ameliorate the ethnic divisiveness some social critics disparage as a "New  Tribalism."  </P> <P> "Festival 2000 is either ahead of its time for going beyond the 'New  Tribalism,' or it's hopelessly out of step," comments Kary Shulman, the  director of the city's Grants for the Arts funding agency and an instigator of  the event. "I think we're onto something important here, because I do believe  the arts speak to our common humanity. At its very best that's what this  festival will demonstrate."  </P> <P> "We're looking toward the future, to remaking the ways traditions can encounter  each other and result in innovation," observes artist and educator Amalia  Mesa-Bains, who sits on the festival's board of directors. "Ethnic specificity  may be a point along the way to cultural identity. But most people in this  country live in a bicultural world by now. We grow up next door to each other,  eat each other's food and listen to each others' music, and there are bound to  be more and more cross-overs and partnerships."  </P> <P> Few in San Francisco's large, diverse arts community are quarreling with  Festival 2000's multicultural theme. After all, the city has been a prime  example of ethnic multiplicity since 1849, when waves of Chinese, European and  Hispanic immigrants converged here to join in the Gold Rush. In more recent  times, San Franciscans have honored their heritage in such popular annual  events as the Ethnic Dance Festival, the city's Carnaval parade, and the Native  American Film Festival.  </P> <P> But a lot more is riding on the aggressively pluralistic Festival 2000. For one  thing, the city pumped a large sum of money into it before the recent economic  dip; the event will probably not be repeated again unless it can generate  substantial support elsewhere. The festival has also raised expectations among  local artists that it will bring them more exposure and, perhaps, national  bookings.  </P> <P> The festival may also forge a fruitful new partnership between San Francisco's  low-budget, multicultural arts sector and the city's well-heeled, classical and  European-oriented ballet, symphony and opera. In recent years, arts activists  have criticized the city for giving these prominent companies too large a share  of local arts funding. The institutions have also been attacked  </P> <P> for inadequate ethnic representation on their boards and staffs.  </P> <P> "One of the hot agenda items on the table when I started organizing the  festival was, 'What is the relationship between the major institutions and  multicultural arts groups?' " Sloan says. "I found there was a desire to talk  and a mandate to engage on both sides."  </P> <P> That engagement has resulted mostly in practical, behind-the-scenes help from  the larger institutions. San Francisco Opera chief Lofti Mansouri and San  Francisco Ballet general manager Joyce Moffatt served on the festival's  steering committee. The War Memorial Board, which governs the city's larger  arts facilities, donated use of the Opera House and Davies Symphony Hall for  two events. The San Francisco Symphony gave proceeds of a pops concert with Cab  Calloway to the festival effort, and the ballet and opera have, according to  Sloan, "been instrumental in the design and production of the opening night  concert."  </P> <P> Direct artistic involvement was not feasible, says Sloan, because season  calendars had already been set two years ago. But he contends that groundwork  has been laid for the future.  </P> <P> Amid the high hopes, though, serious questions have been raised about Sloan's  grandiose festival design, the effectiveness of his 18-member administrative  and production staff, and the organization's handling of a serious budget  crisis last spring.  </P> <P> One frequently heard concern is that the festival's marketing campaign is too  little, too late. A key participant (who asked not to be identified)  complained, "The vision is great, but I wonder if the staff is capable of  bringing the whole thing off. The promotion has been really mismanaged." And  recently the music critic of the San Francisco Examiner groused in print about  the event's "tardy publicity campaign" and its "cluttered and complicated"  calendar of events -- a charge also leveled at the L.A. Festival for its  confusing program.  </P> <P> Sloan bristles when these criticisms are raised. He insists the festival will  sell the 60,000 tickets it must to break even. And he points to the television  public service announcements, the several million Safeway shopping bags  emblazoned with the Festival 2000 logo, and the posters on city buses as proof  that word is getting out.  </P> <P> But Sloan does not deny that over 18 months of planning he has endured some  tough stretches and a few run-ins with the city's highly politicized arts  community. That, he contends, was inevitable in a project of this scope.  </P> <P> "I've learned from Peter Sellars in L.A., and from Michelle Smith, who directs  the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, about the tightrope you walk when  you try to do something that's grounded in your community but also of national  significance," Sloan remarks. "It's a tightrope made tighter by lack of funds."  </P> <P> The financial outlook for Festival 2000 seemed rosy in 1988, when Grants for  the Arts catalyzed the event with a $500,000 infusion. The money came out of  the 12.5% portion of the city's Hotel Tax Fund that is distributed each year to  local cultural institutions, parades and festivals.  </P> <P> The notion of presenting a major multicultural showcase, says Shulman, "bubbled  up simultaneously from several sources. It just seemed to all of us that it was  the right concept at the right time for this city."  </P> <P> Sloan came aboard in January of 1989 to head the newly formed, nonprofit  festival organization. Though based at the time in New York, he was no stranger  to Northern California. While Jerry Brown was governor, Sloan served as deputy  director of the California Arts Council and helped organize CAC's State/Local  Partnership program. He headed East to work as a consultant for the National  Endowment for the Arts and to produce a festival of black dance at the Brooklyn  Academy of Music.  </P> <P> "We felt Leni had the kind of background and experience we needed to bring this  thing off," Shulman recalls. "We left the shaping of the artistic concept up to  him. When you hire an impresario, you need to trust that person and their  vision."  </P> <P> Sloan's vision of new, hybrid works, initiated by local and out-of-town artists  of color and produced with future touring in mind, didn't please everyone.  </P> <P> "Jewish and Irish arts groups in the city got mad at me, saying 'We're ethnic  too,' " Sloan reports. "Some black and Chicano artists were angry because we  didn't just automatically fund them. My answer was always that this is not an  ethnic event, but a contemporary festival of fusion work. I don't see  'multicultural' as a term of entitlement, but as a term of inclusion."  </P> <P> Sloan's national call for commission ideas generated 300 proposals. A jury of  artists then selected 23 to receive awards of up to $40,000. Some of the more  expensive productions -- Urban Bush Woman's "Praise House," the  Balinese-American piece "Body Tjak" -- were planned as joint ventures with  presenters from outside the area, including the Walker Art Center in  Minneapolis and the Festival of Indonesia. Many of the other events are  co-productions with Bay Area venues.  </P> <P> Last September, Festival 2000 unveiled its plans to the public at a Union  Square rally with Mayor Art Agnos on hand. A few weeks later came the severe  earthquake that rocked the Bay Area. The festival had already received major  gifts from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trust, San Francisco  Foundation and other sources. But $600,000 in promised corporate contributions  dried up in the aftermath of the quake.  </P> <P> "The last quivers hit us," Sloan says, "because economically the Bay Area  didn't have a fourth quarter last year. Every arts organization in the city had  to cut back, and so did we."  </P> <P> But it wasn't until May that the festival's board of directors decided to trim  $500,000 from the budget by eliminating 14 commissioned projects.  </P> <P> "This was not something we did lightly," says Fran Streets, the board  president. "We spent a great deal of time soul-searching."  </P> <P> That was no comfort to the nine local arts groups who suddenly received letters  rescinding their commissions; many had begun working and incurring expenses.  Angered by the lack of warning and other communication problems, they swiftly  demanded a meeting with Sloan and festival staffers. That encounter, recalls an  observer, "was very tense but ultimately productive." In the end all but three  of the canceled commissions were restored, though at much-reduced levels.  </P> <P> "Controversies over empowerment and turf are ongoing issues, and that's nothing  new," comments Cowell Theatre director Bob Martin, the presenter of several  festival events. "What excites me is the quality of artists involved. I think  there's going to be some really outstanding work."  </P> <P> As the festival appraoches, Sloan prefers to take a more philosophical  overview. "A lot of people use your turnstile as the yardstick of success," he  suggests. "But one of the reasons I respect Peter Sellers so much is because he  knew that a festival is a dividend project -- and the dividends may come six  months or even a year later. A festival is a catalytic agent. It creates new  ways to talk, new schools of expression. You can't weigh it in pound for pound.  For me, the real dividend will come after the festival, when the art work goes  out there to the rest of America and has an impact on the body culture."  </P></p>

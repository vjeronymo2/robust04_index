			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: CandoCo and NDT3 - Dance Ideas about the limitations we impose upon performance - through age or disability - were challenged in a double bill marking the opening of the Spring Loaded free dance festival on Monday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. CandoCo is a group of dancers, three of whose members are confined to wheel-chairs, though not confined as performers. Nederlands Dans Theatre 3 is a quartet of professional dancers in middle life, whose careers might be supposed to be waning, if not waned. Its purpose is to show that there is performing life after 40, though in view of the repertory on view retirement might be considered a blessed relief. NDT3's personnel for this visit were Martine van Hamel, Sabine Kupferberg, Niklas Ek, Gerard Lematre. The two offerings were vexatious, and served with malign skill to make the dancers look foolish. Jiri Kylian's No Sleep till Dawn of Day featured the two women, a line of 18 wooden chairs, a lullaby from the Solomon Islands (a miserable four-note phrase) and witless fragments of activity that conveyed nothing so much as the fact that the performers could do much better if given the opportunity. Mats Ek's Journey (with two scores by Steve Reich; three painted, dull and ambulant flats), found Lematre as a railway porter, the others as travellers. Niklas Ek was more boyishly vivacious than his years should permit; Miss van Hamel wore an unforgiveable red jersey tube. The movement was minimal, tiresome, and, as far as I could discern, pointless. A lengthy programme note by Mr Kylian offered pietisms about the value of mature dancers. It is a platitude that experience brings technical wisdom, mastery of the stage, and that these are of incalculable value. Curious, then, that this repertory should so diminish the presence and skills of its performers. I thought it especially sad that Martine van Hamel, a distinguished and fascinating ballerina, should be seen in this galere. She and her companions deserve much better. Many dancers have performed magnificently into their 50s without NDT3's special pleading. CandoCo avoids NDT3's mistakes. It neither patronises its artists, nor makes them objects of a Poppy Day appeal for sympathy. Of course, we feel for the disabled members of the troupe. Most especially we recall Celeste Dandeker, a touchingly elegant dancer with the London Contemporary company, who broke her neck during a performance of Stages 20 years ago. Confined to a wheel-chair since then, she has found a way to continue as an interpretative artist: Darshan Singh Bhuller's haunting film, The Fall, seen on television two years ago, revealed her as a still potent figure. With the dancer and choreographer Adam Benjamin as director, CandoCo proposes a dance text - a corporate effort - which confronts ideas of mobility, of how we expect people to move and how they may learn to move. Wheel-chairs can be abandoned; the severely disabled can create vivid emotional and dynamic situations away from their chairs as well as in them. The able-bodied and the physically limited jointly prove that limits are there to be overcome. It is on these terms inspiring, brave. As choreography the piece - Flying in the Face of . . . - is uneven. Imagery feeds from the special circumstances of its casting, often powerfully: a duet for two men, one without legs, is astonishing both in its dynamic outlines and in its psychological resonances. Because of the huge sincerity of the movement, we believe and accept its structural premises. I found, though, a lack of aesthetic purpose which a single choreographic decision should impose. If I have a hope for CandoCo it is that a major creator be invited to work with the group: its idealism and artistic bravery merit the very best collaborators. The Spring Loaded festival continues with 30 companies in various theatres until April 10</p>

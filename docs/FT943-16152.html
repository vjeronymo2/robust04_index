			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: BR cuts annual loss to Pounds 108m - Service claimed to be more punctual British Rail achieved improved financial results, a smaller call on government subsidy and a more punctual train service in 1993-94, according to its last annual report as a centralised organisation. But this positive picture of the last 12 months of the nationalised railway was matched by the shedding of a further 9,000 jobs and substantial losses in large parts of its freight and parcels operations. Sir Bob Reid, chairman, said: 'The popularity of road and air travel has at times raised questions about the (rail) industry's very survival. But the programme of change that is now beginning is happening at a time when the potential for rail has again come to the forefront of the transport debate.' The cost to British Rail of preparing for privatisation was Pounds 92m, including Pounds 48m for the creation of Railtrack, the company which has taken over BR's track, signalling and stations and is in dispute with signalling staff. A 10 per cent cut in operating expenditure, much of it from reducing staff numbers, allowed BR to report an operating profit of Pounds 23m in the year ended March compared with a previous loss of Pounds 94m. The recession reduced passenger numbers and turnover fell from Pounds 3.12bn to Pounds 3.1bn. After interest charges and other costs British Rail's loss was Pounds 108m compared with Pounds 183m the year before. Government subsidies fell nearly 20 per cent to Pounds 930m. BR invested Pounds 828m in renewing and upgrading the present rail network and Pounds 378m in developing the Channel tunnel. The InterCity division achieved its punctuality and reliability targets for the first time, while Network SouthEast improved performance. Turnover rose slightly in BR's passenger divisions but fell sharply in its two freight divisions and parcels. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour transport spokesman, said the BR figures confirmed that 'BR has returned an operating profit through massive cuts in costs. However, the profit would be far too small for private investors, while costs are soaring under the newly fragmented system'. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / InterCity combats recession BRITISH Rail's InterCity sector is to launch a vigorous marketing campaign tomorrow to try to counteract a decline in revenues caused by the recession, Richard Tomkins writes. InterCity, which receives no government subsidy, reported operating profits of just Pounds 2m in the year to March. It has since taken steps to cut its cost base, notably through the ending of services to Shrewsbury, Shropshire; Cleethorpes, Humberside; and Blackpool, Lancashire. The marketing campaign is believed to include a relaunch of the scheme offering free travel to shoppers collecting vouchers from Boots stores, and a revamp of the Silver Standard service for holders of full-fare standard class tickets.</p>

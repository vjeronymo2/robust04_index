			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, Mexican presidential  candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI],  speaking before the Mexican medical community, condemned the  Guadalajara, Jalisco State car bomb attack.    [Begin Zedillo recording] Anonymous violence is one of the  most brutal criminal actions; it attacks Mexican society's most  appreciated values and must be strongly rejected. We demand  that the circumstances regarding this crime be clarified and  that those responsible receive harsh punishment. We Mexicans  want to live safely, with tranquillity, and with unity.  Criminal forces must not be allowed to disturb our country's  social peace. [end recording]    The PRI candidate sent a message of solidarity to the people  of Guadalajara:    [Begin Zedillo recording] Once again, Guadalajara and all  Jalisco residents suffer events that have absolutely nothing to  do with these civic-minded and hard-working people. We join  them in their demands for justice. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

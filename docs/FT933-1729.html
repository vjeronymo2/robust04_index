			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Former Merck head to join rival MR RICHARD Markham, who resigned in July as president and chief operating officer of Merck, the US's biggest pharmaceuticals company, is to take up a similar position at rival Marion Merrell Dow. His appointment will also lead to a reshuffle among the senior management at Marion, following similar shake-ups at other leading drugs companies in recent months. Mr Markham, 42, was considered a strong contender for the top job at Merck before his departure, which was said at the time to be for personal reasons. Merck hinted at the time that he would not be joining a rival drugs group. To make way for Mr Markham, Mr Fred Lyons, 57, president and chief executive, will give up the president's job and become chairman. Mr Joseph Temple, 64, will step down as chairman but remain a board member. Mr David Sharrock, 57, chief operating officer, will retire but also remain on the board.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and the United States have decided to request  a UN Security Council debate on convening an international  conference on North Korea and sanctions against it. As is  known, Pyongyang has announced its withdrawal from the nuclear  nonproliferation accord.    An appropriate Russian-American agreement was reached by the  presidents of the two countries in a telephone conversation  Monday night. In an interview with Interfax at Moscow airport,  before flying off to the Far East on Tuesday, Boris Yeltsin  reported that he had a detailed discussion with Bill Clinton on  the North Korea issue, which he described "as a very serious  matter," and about a resolution being drafted by the UN  Security Council in regard to North Korea's nuclear program.    As a Yeltsin's spokesman explained after the conversation,  the resolution on North Korea being drafted by the UN Security  Council "should express along equal lines the possibility of  both sanctions and an international conference for a  comprehensive solution to the problems of the Korean peninsula."    In Yeltsin's words, Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher are to meet in  Brussels Wednesday-Thursday to scrutinize the issue.    He also revealed that the issue of his visit to the United  States next September had been set for good in his conversation  with Clinton. During that visit, he intends to make a speech at  the UN General Assembly. A tentative date for the address,  according to him, is September 25.    Asked whether Russia could sign an agreement on partnership  with the European Council at an EC summit in Corfu, Yeltsin  replied: "I have been informed that an agreement with the EC is  basically prepared. This is no good. When I am told it's  completely ready, then I'll go for sure."    Meanwhile, as Interfax has learned, a group assigned to  prepare a trip for Yeltsin has already been to Corfu. It was  led by the Protocol Service's Chief Vladimir Shevschenko. A  team of Russian experts is going to that Greek island soon.    Speaking about his current working tour of the Amur Region  and Tuva, Yeltsin noted that he intended to learn more about  regional problems on the spot and added that, in his opinion,  Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean investments could be highly  instrumental for the economic advancement of those areas.</p>

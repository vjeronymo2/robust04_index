			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bondholders accept NY building OLYMPIA &amp; York, the ailing Canadian developer, is turning over ownership of its biggest New York office building to the property's bondholders. The deal involves a 53-storey building at 55 Water Street in Manhattan's financial district. It marks a rare vote of confidence in the future of the New York office market - plagued for four years by high vacancy rates and tumbling rentals. Besides exchanging their Dollars 548m in secured notes for a 100 per cent equity stake in the 3.3m sq ft building, the bondholders have agreed to invest an extra Dollars 21m in preferred shares. The deal is expected to be finalised early next year. The biggest bondholder, the Retirement System of Alabama, has expressed a willingness to buy out the remaining investors as well as to contribute their share of the preferred share issue. Mr Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild, which has advised the bondholders, said this commitment could require an investment of up to Dollars 140m by the Alabama pension fund. Mr Ross interpreted the pension fund's commitment as a vote of confidence in the New York property market. 'This is not some real estate speculator doing it on borrowed money. This is a very serious investor,' he said.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dixons hit by rising losses in US DIXONS GROUP, the electrical retailing company, yesterday confirmed it had joined that unhappy throng of UK retailers which have invested heavily in the US market without making a reasonable return. Silo, its US chain acquired for Pounds 240m in 1987 and which operates 230 stores in 29 regional markets, yesterday revealed that losses had accelerated over the past six months from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 10.9m. In spite of the company's promise that 'determined action' would be taken to ensure a return to profitability, it is hard to see that the position can be quickly reversed. Dixons forecast that Silo would remain in loss in the second half. The severe retail recession has, of course, been the prime cause of Silo's difficulties and although overall turnover rose from Pounds 245.3m to Pounds 288.3m sales on a same-store basis showed a 5 per cent decline. Dixons has long promised drastic remedial action to turn Silo round but the problem only appears to have become progressively worse. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman, argued yesterday that Dixons could apply the lessons it had learned from revitalising its UK operations. 'We have battled against and overcome these problems how to manage costs and margins when sales are flat. I have no doubt that the benefits of this performance can be used to return to profitability in the US,' he said. 'We are basically running the same business on both sides of the Atlantic. Silo and Currys have more in common than Currys and Dixons in the UK,' he added. But although the operations themselves may be similar the structure of the markets in which they operate is clearly very different. In the UK the group can derive great benefits from being the market leader controlling an 18 per cent share of all electrical goods sales. In the US the position is starkly different; Silo commands less than 2 per cent of a vast market. Mr John Smith, retailing analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said there were three basic problems with Silo: 'The whole US electrical market is very weak; the company's cost base is too high, and the market is suffering from massive overcapacity which is driving prices down.' Although the US recovery may pick up speed in the foreseeable future and Dixons can take action to prune the cost base, the problems resulting from overcapacity will continue to plague many regional markets for years to come. In the past Mr Kalms has hinted that Silo might withdraw from the worst-affected regions of the US market if they did not improve. Although the company did not repeat the suggestion yesterday analysts believed it must remain a distinct possibility. Mr John Clare, the newly-appointed group managing director, and his retail management group have been entrusted with the task of sorting Silo out. He immediately hinted that support functions would be centralised and pay structures reviewed. And he bravely pinned his reputation on achieving such a turnround. 'I know not many UK retailers have succeeded in the US but I would just ask you to watch this space.'</p>

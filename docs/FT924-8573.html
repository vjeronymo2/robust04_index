			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Aircraft stocks upset REPORTS OF financial problems at GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, along with fears of impending defence cuts, sent a chill through the aerospace and engineering sectors, bringing heavy falls in several of the major stocks. Shares in Rolls-Royce took the full force of the worries surrounding GPA, falling 10 1/2 to 124 1/2 p in trade of 5.1m, with the market worried about the firm orders GPA had placed for 45 Boeing 757s, all of which are due to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines. Smith New Court, Kleinwort Benson and Nikko Securities were among brokers advising investors to sell the shares. Strauss Turnbull also issued a 'sell' recommendation and suggested 80p as a fair price for the shares. However, it was British Aerospace which recorded the day's biggest fall in the market in percentage terms, dropping 14 to 135p. BAe owns 20 per cent of Airbus Industrie, with which GPA has a large order for A320 aircraft. Sentiment was further weakened by speculation that the UK government would announce further defence cuts in Thursday's Autumn Statement. Also affected were Smiths industries, 10 lower at 318p, and TI group, 6 lighter at 287p. Lasmo easier There was widespread consternation around dealing rooms as Lasmo shares wilted in the face of stories that a big institution was seeking to unload a block of between 8m and 10m shares in the oil exploration company. Marketmakers lowered their prices for Lasmo stock, expecting the shares to come off sharply after the rumoured sale had taken place. But no large trades in Lasmo were forthcoming, with the day's total recorded turnover reaching only 2.4m. Stories doing the rounds in the market suggested that the institutions were unhappy at the rather downbeat presentation delivered by the company in the City last week, and that one of the big US investment banks was offering the big line of shares. Oil shares have generally been unsettled by the recent bout of weakness in crude oil prices, which have reacted to fears of increasing output. 'It looks as though the market was spoofed and somebody got rid of a long position,' said one oil specialist. Lasmo announced yesterday the start-up of production from its Markham gas field, located in the Netherlands area of the North Sea. BCI in the frame Last week's move by Hanson to withdraw from the battle to take over Ranks Hovis McDougall unleashed another bout of speculation that Hanson has lined up another target. And some market observers took the line that the conglemerate may well have Blue Circle Industries (BCI), the big UK building materials group, in its sights. The shares rose 4 to 170p, after 172p. Hanson slipped 2 1/4 to 227 1/4 p. The market's suspicions were further aroused yesterday when a buyer of 2.5m BCI shares appreared in the market. The shares were acquired in various parcels during the day, dealers said. Turnover reached a hefty 5.5m shares, the latest in a series of larger than usual busy days in the stock. Takeover speculation has surrounded BCI for a number of years. During the late-1980s Hanson was thought to have been behind a market raid for BCI stock that netted only a handful of shares. More recently a number of overseas companies are thought to have taken a hard look at the company. Among the names mentioned were Lafarge Coppee and MB Caradon. Worries over future profit growth persisted around Granada as speculation continued that the group was ready to table an offer for Forte's catering subsidiary, Gardner Merchant. Analysts said that Granada's reliance on cost-cutting to bolster profits meant that a sizeable acquisition was important to any future growth strategy. However, this also exposed concerns that such an undertaking - Gardner Merchant would command a price tag of some Pounds 400m - would require a rights issue, a precarious undertaking in the present climate. It was also suggested that weekend press reports on Granada's intentions came from the group itself and were designed to manouevre Forte away from negotiations believed to be under way with the Gardner management. Granada shares tumbled 10 to 283p. Forte was steady at 158p. In a busy oil sector, British Gas eased a penny to 276p after a block of 4.1m shares was placed in the market at 273 1/2 p. Very late in the session dealers said another big institution had sold a line of 6.4m shares at 271p. BP was active and managed to edge up 2 1/2 to 228p on 5.4m traded. Shell, scheduled to report third-quarter numbers on Thursday, hardened 2 to 530p. Calor shares, aggressively bought in recent sessions by one of the large UK integrated houses, retreated to close 7 off at 233p. Oil specialists expect SHV, the private Dutch investment group, to announce that it has topped up its shareholding from 46 per cent to 48 per cent. Barclays remained the most heavily traded stock in the banks, rallying 7 more to 363p on 5.1m. Lloyds rose the same amount to 492p. HSBC, now ranked the UK's fifth biggest company measured by its market capitalisation, which is more than twice that of the next bank, National Westminster, added 5 at 560p. SG Warburg, expected to report lower interim figures this morning, fell 14 to 524p. Composite insurances showed General Accident a vulnerable market in front of today's third-quarter numbers, which County NatWest expects will show a sharp reduction in losses. County estimates that the company will report a quarterly loss of Pounds 10m, against last time's Pounds 129m. The shares weakened 12 to 536p. Royal, due to report on Thursday, receded 11 to 226p. Among internationals, BAT Industries continued to bask in the glow of last week's favourable results and added 10 at 937p. The weak copper prices seen at the end of last week and reports of sell advice from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew left RTZ 14 lighter at 629p. A profits downgrade said to have come from Nomura hit Inchcape, 9 cheaper at 490p. In transports, reports of profits downgradings weakened BAA, which reported a 46 per cent jump in interim figures. The shares slipped 11 to 747p. Also in the doldrums was British Airways, where a sell recommendation from a leading broker clipped 11 off the stock to 292 1/2 p. Weakness in SmithKline Beecham was attributed to a warning of tough trading ahead from leading US drugs group Merck last Friday. It was also revealed that Merck would not be co-marketing one of the UK group's products. SmithKline shares finished 11 1/2 lower at 512 1/2 p. Leading property stocks were mildly positive on the weekend press speculation over interest rate cuts. Slough Estates put on 3 at 137p. Confirmation that resignations among Virgin executives had occurred sent Thorn-EMI lower. The stock ended 10 down at 807p. Rank Organisation retreated 9 to 615p as profit-taking took its toll. A shortage of stock sent Booker forward by 15 to 390p. Unilever retreated on nervousness over the Gatt talks, although analysts pointed out that the company would suffer little should a trade war break out. The stock declined 14 to 1066p. Unigate strengthened 10 to 297p. Early talk that an unnamed German group was scanning the European foods market for a baby foods group was said to have helped. Nervousness ahead of results due on Thursday dented Burton, the retail clothing group, which eased 2 1/2 to 45p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (142).

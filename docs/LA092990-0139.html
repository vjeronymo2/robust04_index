			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHAKESPEARE NOT DESCRIBED AS 'UN-AMERICAN' ON TAPE;  </P> <P> THEATER: COUNCILMAN LITTRELL SAID WORKS ARE 'NOT AMERICAN,' TAPE RECORDING OF  MEETING INDICATES.  </P> <P> City Councilman Raymond T. Littrell did not say that the works of William  Shakespeare are "un-American," as a Grove Shakespeare Festival official  asserted, during recent public debate over city support of the financially  troubled theater troupe.  </P> <P> Thomas Bradac, producing artistic director of the Festival, had told The Times  that he was "surprised to hear that Littrell believes Shakespeare and the  classics are un-American."  </P> <P> A review of a tape recording of the City Council meeting in question revealed  no use of the term "un-American." Littrell did note that Shakespeare is not  American and that he believes the troupe should concentrate on American  culture.  </P> <P> Littrell, calling for clarification, said he believes the distinction is  important because he feels that "un-American" connotes subversion, and "I don't  believe that people who go to Shakespeare are that," he said.  </P> <P> "I wasn't quoting him," Bradac said yesterday. "I'm restating what he said. In  essence, that's what he said," the director maintained. JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Global problems follow LME to its new home / A look at the market's rows with Chilean and Chinese customers Two items of unfinished business failed to spoil the celebrations yesterday as the London Metal Exchange started business in its new home. The LME prides itself on being a truly global exchange and, as if to emphasise this point, it finds itself in conflict with customers as far away as Chile and China. The difficulties go back to the turmoil in the LME's 'flagship' copper contract last year. Prices slumped by one quarter in only five weeks, reaching in May their lowest level for five and a half years. Then came a severe supply 'squeeze' when, in spite of lacklustre world economic conditions and LME copper stocks reaching a 15-year peak, the copper price rose strongly. The LME board issued two public warnings about the squeeze and eventually took emergency action to unwind it. This was a market only for brave and truly professional traders. It was a market of large profits and losses. Among the losers was Codelco (Corporation Nacional del Cobre de Chile), the state-owned Chilean group. Codelco says Mr Juan Pablo Davila, its chief futures trader, lost more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 126m). Mr Davila and his two immediate superiors were charged with deception and Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco's president, resigned. Codelco and the Chilean government want to lay further blame - particularly in London's metal trading community. Another loss-maker, Citic Shanghai, a subsidiary of China International Trust and Investment Corporation, owes about Dollars 40m to LME brokers who extended it credit and is claiming it cannot meet these debts in full. The problems of both Codelco and Citic Shanghai can be traced to an esoteric LME trading practice known in the jargon as 'carries at historical prices'. In practice this means that, instead of paying up at the end of a contract, it is rolled forward again but at the original price rather than the price prevailing in the market. There are genuine reasons why some customers want to make use of this system but traders suggest it can also be used to disguise, temporarily, loss-making positions. LME brokers prefer not to give these 'carries' because they tie up credit lines and take some financing. So the service is provided only to substantial customers with deep pockets. Both Codelco and Citic Shanghai come into this category because they are state-owned and traders assume that ultimately their governments stand behind them. Codelco and the Chilean government have been excoriated by their domestic press and have been pressing for the maximum punishment for those they claim are responsible - without much luck so far. Mr Davila and his two superiors were released from prison in May when the Santiago Appeals Court drastically reduced the charges against them. No longer are they accused of defrauding the state (maximum sentence five years) but instead are charged with causing the company losses by deception (maximum sentence 541 days). Meanwhile, Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president, says an investigation by accountants Ernst and Young showed 'the existence of systematic deceit aimed at distorting the economic outcome of copper futures transactions, creating fictitious profits and postponing losses'. But he stressed this did not necessarily mean that LME brokers had deliberately colluded with Mr Davila. The LME has agreed to investigate 'unusual transactions' between Codelco and several brokers. At the LME's annual dinner last month, Mr Villarzu made it clear that he feels there must have been some collusion between his company's trader and some counter-parties in London. 'Had you the opportunity to examine the trading contracts which Codelco entered into during 1993, you would have been amazed at the number of transactions whose prices had no direct relationship with the market prices ruling at the date and time of the transaction,' he complained. Mr Raj Bagri, LME chairman, promised that if any exchange member had transgressed, 'we will not hesitate to take the appropriate action'. However, he echoed other traders' assertions that poor management controls were mainly responsible for Codelco's losses. Mr Bagri said the breakneck speed at which derivatives and futures trading had taken root and spread across the financial and commodity markets 'has in many instances left managements far behind in having in place adequate, effective and timely supervisory measures to monitor and control risks'. Nevertheless, the LME hoped to implement by early next year measures 'to limit any perceived dangers of historical price carries'. Opinion is split among LME members about whether incidents such as these involving Citic and Codelco are damaging to the exchange's image. Yesterday's move to another premises in London's financial district was in part prompted by a fourfold increase in turnover in the past six years. So the LME - trading primary aluminium, aluminium alloy, lead, nickel, tin and zinc as well as copper - is now the second-largest futures exchange in the UK and the seventh largest in the world. It will trade futures and options valued at nearly Dollars 2,000bn this year. Commodities, Page 33</p>

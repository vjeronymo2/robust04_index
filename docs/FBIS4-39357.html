			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko for </F> KAZTAG]    [Text] Almaty, 7 June -- "The main goal of my visit is to  speed up the implementation of the accords between the two  states which were attained earlier," Salman Khurshid, India's  minister of state for external affairs, said at a press  conference here today after completing his visit to Kazakhstan.    "We have seen once again," the minister said, "that  Kazakhstan leadership adheres to the strengthening of ties with  India and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation of  businessmen from both countries." He noted with satisfaction  that a business council to coordinate joint activity had been  set up. A solemn ceremony to inaugurate an Indian cultural  center will be held in Almaty soon, and an Indian restaurant  will open. By late June, regular Almaty- Delhi flights will  start, something to boost bilateral relations even further.    "During the visit," Salman Khurshid stressed, "mutual  understanding of the need to sign accords on avoiding double  taxation of exported goods and providing firm guarantees for  investments took shape." He expressed the confidence that  Kazakhstan and India would actively cooperate in many  international organizations to secure peace and stability on the  Asian continent.    The Indian delegation left Almaty for Bishkek today.</p>

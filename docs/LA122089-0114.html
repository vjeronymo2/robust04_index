			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> PESTICIDES CITED IN DECLINE OF FISH  </P> <P> Pesticides in runoff farm water may be a key factor in the sharp decline of  striped bass in the Sacramento River, state scientists reported. Staff of the  Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board said in a report circulated  among government agencies that they have detected levels of pesticides that are  lethal or toxic to tiny animals in the striped bass food chain. The pesticides  are carbofuran, ethyl parathion and malathion. "Pesticides in rice discharge  water may be responsible, in part, for the decline in size of the striped bass  population in the Sacramento-San Joaquin (rivers) Delta," the report said.  Scientists noted that striped bass production in the delta is at an all-time  low. Responding to the report, Brian Finlayson, supervisor of the state  Department of Fish and Game's pesticide unit, said more scientific studies are  needed to prove that farm chemicals are to blame. Water diversions and other  factors may have much to do with the decline, he said.  </P></p>

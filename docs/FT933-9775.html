			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Corporate Germany confident worst is over - Are hopes riding too high Ignoring mutterings, mainly from beyond Germany's borders, of the threat to industrial competitiveness posed by the effective removal of the European exchange rate mechanism's corset last weekend, the markets have continued their modest but determined upswing. Not even a post-war high in western Germany's July unemployment figures, reported yesterday, could deter traders. As far as the markets are concerned, the general rise in the jobless is a further sign that industry is seriously getting to grips with its structural problems. The DAX index closed yesterday up 8.68 at 1,869.38. On Thursday, for example, news of a further 3,000 job losses looming at Volkswagen was seen as a sign of determined management and credited with some of the DM12.50 rise in the shares after an extended twitchy spell due mainly to the so-called 'Lopez Effect'. Yesterday the shares were unchanged at DM374. Markets have also been encouraged by a detectable increase in business confidence. In spite of an unexpected 1.5 per cent drop in incoming industrial orders in June - a figure affected by a dip in capital goods demand which concealed progress elsewhere - the Bundesbank and government appear to have convinced corporate Germany that the worst is past. Cyclical stocks, especially chemicals, have been among the chief gainers. Apart from the boost given by hopes of an end to recession, chemical sector shares have also been helped by rapid implementation of restructuring. Schering which this week reported a stout half-way performance, is well ahead in transforming itself into a pure pharmaceuticals company, by off-loading its agrochemicals divisions into a Hoechst-controlled joint venture. Its shares closed yesterday up DM18.30 at DM888.80. While the mood is not exactly euphoric, the markets reflect the widespread belief within Germany that when the international upswing comes, industry will be best placed to take advantage of increased demand, particularly for capital goods. While other European economies have seen industrial bases eroded by recession-induced disinvestment, German industry is packed with plant installed in the post-unification rush. Even so, as Mr Gunther Merl, head of the publicly-owned Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen (Helaba), warned this week: the trees are not likely to grow all the way to heaven in the foreseeable future. Hopes of recovery still have to be realised, he warned. While the DAX index seems to be heading steadily towards 1,900, he believes a dip to around 1,750 is still possible. At best, he forecasts sideways movements in the coming weeks. The 'air is getting thin' he says, noting that large institutional investors are currently operating more on the sell side, while private investors are still buying. Some are even more pessimistic. Among others, Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of the Bayersiche Vereinsbank, warns of a possible 'double-dip' recession. While the Bundesbank has shown itself to be pleased by the government's commitment to slashing federal spending by around DM25bn next year, the cautious observers point out that this sum, amounting to almost 2 per cent of gross domestic product, is to come mainly out of unemployment and other welfare benefits. In effect, it spells a looming potential cut in domestic consumer demand of around this order, which is bound to have a detectable impact on company prospects. Frankfurt analysts suggest that the present index levels reflect expectations of profits to come in 1994 and 1995 rather than any actual developments. To justify current prices, the pessimists say, earnings will have to grow by 45 per cent. Closer to hand remains the persistent, if still unrealised, expectation that France will reduce its short-term interest rates by at least two points and that the franc will depreciate against the D-Mark by at least 5 per cent. France buys around 17 per cent of German exports. While there will be corporate gains to be made on incoming trade, outgoing business seems bound to suffer. The engineering and car sectors, equal first export earners, both rely on France for more than 10 per cent of their annual sales. Markets also have to reckon with the prospects of domestic rate cuts, although the Bundesbank's recent performance does not provide much ground for optimism. Although long-term rates, at which most of industry does its borrowing, are close to record real lows of about 2 per cent, the central bank is still reluctant to loosen the reins too soon. Once again, the government, which is now the main driving force in credit markets at present and is mainly responsible for above-target monetary growth, has yet to deliver the promised spending cuts. The last thing to be expected from the incoming leadership at the bank is a reversal of existing policy. Mr Hans Tietmeyer replaces retiring president Mr Helmut Schlesinger in September, with a hard-headed monetarist Mr Hans-Wilhelm Gaddum as number two. Neither of them has a reputation as a soft touch.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commissioner for Competition Policy </F> Karel van Miert by "A. Bo." in Brussels on 19 May: "Yes, Your  Funding Operations Are Irregular"]    [Text] Brussels -- Even now that he had overcome his great  wrath -- and was sitting in his quiet commissioner's office --  Karel van Miert was holding out: "I submitted the plan, and I  then withdrew it. I fail to see how we can go back now," he  said.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is there really no way, then, of  reviving this plan for the steel industry, despite the fact that  you have now declared it dead?    [Van Miert] I see no way. We are not in the position to  reach, or even to approach, the 19 million ton productive  capacity reduction quota which had been set by the Council of  Ministers as a minimum target. We have stopped at 11 million  tons. Now we have also lost the opportunity to cut back 5 or 6  million tons in Italy.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] How did this failure come about?    [Van Miert] On the one hand, we had received promises of  closures which did not materialize. On the other hand, if we  interpret the aid regulations rigorously, we are forced to  acknowledge that the Italian funding operations are irregular,  and therefore the solution envisaged for Italy has also become  impracticable.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is there no other way to break the  deadlock?    [Van Miert] I can see no other solution. The aid regulations  are adamant: There can be no funding for partial closures,  which is what many Italian firms would be prepared to do. Given  that cutting back 5 or 6 million tons in Brescia was essential  to the plan's success, we tried to find a solution based on a  less stringent interpretation of the aid regulations. I did  everything I could, right from the beginning, to try to  implement this plan in the interests of the steel sector as a  whole. However, the Commission has now reached this decision,  and it has done so knowing what it was up to. I highlighted all  the consequences of such a decision. I did everything in my  power.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So what will happen now? Will the  plants have to close down without receiving any aid?    [Van Miert] I do not know. We will see. Some will close  down, others will not. Actually, government funding only  accounted for a relatively small amount compared to the extent  of the planned closures. Just think that, in order to cut back  5 million tons in the public sector, aid had been authorized to  the tune of 5 billion ECU. Here, barely 400 million ECU had  been earmarked for an even larger reduction.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So will you now impugn the Ciampi  government's decree?    [Van Miert] Of course. I will be forced to do so. Out of a  sense of loyalty, I must accept the Commission's decision.</p>

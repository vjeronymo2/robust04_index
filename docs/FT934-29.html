			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Relentless rally lifts US maize prices to 5-year highs US maize prices are ending the year at 5-year highs, maintaining a gentle but relentless rally that began in early November on news that 1993 crop disasters had reduced US grain production by as much as 25 per cent from the previous year's record. Maize futures for March delivery have rallied 13 per cent since the November crop production report, topping Dollars 3.04 a bushel yesterday. Despite the feed price inflation US cattle and pig farmers have not yet begun to trim their herds, and maize processors who make high fructose corn syrup are continuing regular production schedules. Analysts say that maize prices will have to remain over Dollars 3 a bushel for a sustained period before domestic consumers begin to ration use. Export demand for US maize is dismal, but domestic use is high. US poultry flocks and cattle herds are at record levels and the US pig crop is only slightly smaller than a year ago. Mr Dan Basse, analyst for the consulting group AgResources, says that he expects livestock farmers to make more efficient use of grain and to feed low quality wheat, instead of maize, to reduce feed costs. Mr Steve Freed, an analyst with ADM Investors services, says maize prices will continue higher at least until January 12, when the US Department of Agriculture releases its final estimate of maize, wheat, and soyabean crop sizes and its assessment of how many bushels of grain the US holds in stocks. The ADM analyst expects the USDA to lower its US maize production figure for 1993 to 6.4bn bushels, from November's 6.5bn-bushel estimate, and to put maize stocks at 5.9bn bushels, far lower than last year's December 1 supply of 7.9bn. 'Everyone's plugged into the idea that this will be the most bullish crop report of the year,' Mr Freed says. 'If the (maize) stocks number is much below 6bn bushels, prices will go higher to ration use. There will be no margin for error in the '94 crop.' However, he said, if the report showed more grain in storage than expected, the market was poised for a downward correction. Prices for the other dominant feed crop in the US, soyabeans, have lagged the maize price rally, in part because traders are eyeing South American soya farms with caution. South America's soyabean crops will be harvested before the next US maize crop, providing some relief to worldwide tightness in feed grain supplies. Despite some early problems in Argentina, analysts said soya crops there and in Brazil are in good condition and could produce record yields.</p>

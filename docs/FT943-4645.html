			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Mitterrand prefers Delors as his successor President Francois Mitterrand has endorsed Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, as the left-wing politician best placed to run in France's presidential election next year. Asked who would be the most competent candidate, the Socialist head of state said in an interview published today by the newspaper Le Figaro: 'On the left, Jacques Delors, since he is the best-placed to win, everything points to this.' Mr Delors, whose term as Commission president ends in January, has not said whether he would stand, but Mr Mitterrand strongly hinted that he would. Mr Mitterrand added that he saw Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, as the main challenger from the right.</p>

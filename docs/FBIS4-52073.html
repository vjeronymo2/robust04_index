			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 4 May, Ke Kimyan, ancillary  commander of the communist Vietnamese puppets and chief of the  General Staff of the two-headed government, issued an order to  all armed units of the communist Vietnamese and American puppets  on battlefields throughout the country. The following is the  content of Ke Kimyan's order:    Top secret message:    1. The royal government will declare the implementation of a  cease-fire. This declaration is only of a political nature.  Militarily, the situation remains unchanged. All armed units  should grasp the political trick of our royal government.    2. All armed units and military regions should continue to  intensify their military activities to fight the Khmer Rouge  ceaselessly.    3. As for our political and military objectives, they remain  totally intact. This is only a tactic to enable us to have time  to reorganize and muster forces and prepare weapons to  counterattack the Khmer Rouge.    4. This is a direct order from Samdech Kromluong [title as  heard] Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen.    [Signed] Ke Kimyan, chief of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces  General Staff.    Note: We do not need to comment on the content of the above  message.    [Dated] 4 May 1994.</p>

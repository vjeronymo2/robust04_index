			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico divorces farm subsidies from output PRESIDENT CARLOS Salinas of Mexico yesterday unveiled a radical reform of his country's agricultural sector, announcing that price supports for basic grains such as maize would be replaced by cash payments to farmers according to the amount of land they owned. The programme breaks the link between subsidies and production, as farmers will receive the same payment for land whatever and however much they produce. Under the new scheme there is bias in favour of maize production and well-off farmers who sell a lot of maize will not receive the bulk of government aid. 'Mexico is moving to the most efficient agricultural support system in the world,' says Mr Luis Tellez, the MIT economist turned agriculture under-minister. 'We will be the only developing country where people look at a vector of international prices when making their production decisions.' The new system commits Mexico to opening the way to maize imports in two years - which it had promised to do in 15 years under the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. The price liberalisation will enable the government to direct subsidies to the most needy farmers but will increase agricultural imports and very probably accelerate migration from the country's rural sector to cities and to the US. Government officials say the reform will go ahead even if Nafta is not approved by the US congress. Under Nafta, the US and Canada would be the main beneficiaries of increased grain exports to Mexico, while without the treaty the rest of the world could export to Mexico on equal terms, they note. At present the Mexican government pays farmers about 750 new pesos (Dollars 242) for a tonne of maize, the national crop, and transport and marketing costs (worth another 160 pesos), compared with an international price plus delivery of about 450 pesos a tonne. (Consumers pay an average of about 450 pesos a tonne, although those in Mexico City pay 350 pesos, and those in the countryside up to 750 pesos). The land subsidy will be given to farmers who were producing subsidised grains, although once the scheme starts they can produce whatever they want. The subsidy will be given for 10 years and then phased out over the next five years. The price support system is being scrapped, in part because it over-stimulated maize production and so held back other crops. The value of maize output increased from 408m pesos in 1989 to 1.635bn pesos in 1992, while the rest of the agricultural sector stagnated. This both increased the financial burden of maize price support and threatened to turn Mexico into a one crop country. The government further contends that farmers over-exploited marginal land for maize production, since the return from selling the crop was artificially high. For example, farmers might deforest land and plant maize at a maize price of 750 pesos, but not at 450 pesos. The old scheme did little to help Mexico's poorest farmers, who do not sell maize but consume it themselves. For this reason one of the plan's strongest supporters is Dr Arturo Warman, the government's agrarian attorney and a left-leaning anthropologist. According to government figures, the average farmer in the northern state of Sinaloa produces six tonnes of maize a hectare, giving a subsidy of about 2,760 pesos a hectare. The average farmer in the southern state of Oaxaca produces about two tonnes a hectare, most of which he consumes, so that he hardly benefits at all from the price subsidy. It is reported that the direct support will give all of Mexico's 2.5m maize farmers a minimum of 400 pesos or so for each hectare of land they own, with farmers on the most productive lands obtaining a little more than double. The government is planning to increase the total financial subsidy for agriculture from 6.4bn pesos this year to some 11bn pesos next year. Observers point out that farmers will receive their cash payments a few months before next year's presidential election, and describe the programme as a vote-buying scheme. The government contends that large numbers of rich, politically important farmers will lose out from the programme. While the political impact of the reform is hard to predict, there will certainly be a switch from grain to non-grain production, such as fruits, vegetables or tobacco. Officials hope that farmers will be able to borrow against future land payments to make necessary investment in converting to higher value crops. But in many cases farmers will not be able to sell maize or any other crops profitably at international prices. Some recent studies by academic economists suggest that as many as 700,000 farmers could be forced out of work by full liberalisation of maize prices. While offering direct subsidies will soften the blow of price liberalisation, one official says: 'In the end we will have fewer people working in agriculture as a proportion of total employment. You cannot expect to improve the standard of living in the countryside when you have 22 per cent of the economically active nation producing just 8 per cent of GDP.'</p>

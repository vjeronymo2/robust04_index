			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MACHINIST LEADERS URGE REJECTION OF NEWEST BOEING CONTRACT OFFER  </P> <P> The president of the aerospace machinists local said today the union will  recommend its nearly 60,000 members turn down Boeing's last contract offer,  increasing the likelihood of a strike.  </P> <P> "The union is recommending that the proposal be rejected," said Tom Baker,  president of Local 751 of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace  workers.  </P> <P> Baker would not discuss details of Boeing's final offer, which was presented by  company negotiators Monday. However, at a meeting scheduled later today, union  members will hear the details of a proposed three-year contract that reportedly  would provide pay increases of 4% the first year and 3% in each of the last two  years, as well as production bonuses of 8% and 4% in the first two years.  </P> <P> Similar meetings were scheduled at Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore. and several  other cities where Boeing plants are located.  </P> <P> If the contract is rejected, Baker said he anticipates that machinists will  strike Boeing for the first time since 1977. A strike would be effective  midnight today.  </P></p>

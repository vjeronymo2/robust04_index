			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 10 (CNA) -- The GATT working party  screening Taiwan's membership application will postpone its  fifth meeting from April to mid-May, Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said Thursday [10 March].    "The change in meeting schedule is not expected to delay  Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT)," Sheu noted.    Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade  regulatory body in 1990 as a separate custom territory. The  GATT working party has already met four times to discuss  Taiwan's membership bid.    Sheu said as Taiwan has not yet completed bilateral trade  consultations with many GATT contracting parties, the  postponement of the working party's fifth meeting will not have  an adverse impact on Taiwan's GATT admission.    Taiwan is scheduled to hold bilateral tariff-reduction talks  with six GATT contracting parties -- South Africa, Australia,  New Zealand, Hungary, Chile and Turkey -- in Geneva starting  March 21. Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of  Foreign Trade will act as chief negotiator for the talks.</p>

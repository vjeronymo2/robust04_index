			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: New ways needed to support and protect Kurds in northern Iraq Sir, John Murray Brown reports the call by Bernard Kouchner, France's minister of humanitarian affairs, for a new cross-border programme of assistance to the Kurds of northern Iraq ('West faced with political minefield over Kurds', July 9). Save the Children, which is rebuilding schools and supporting agriculture in the region, believes the UN and western governments should urgently consider such innovative ideas, as it is clear that the current UN operation simply is not working. The Kurds are suffering the effects of sanctions and an internal blockade imposed by the Iraqi government as they struggle to rebuild their lives. They need urgent help to reconstruct their communities in settlements which have been bombarded, razed and looted over the past decade. The decision on how to protect and support the Kurds in this crucial phase has been too long delayed. Now the Memorandum of Understanding which governed UN-led humanitarian operations in Iraq has expired, and harassment of UN and aid agency staff is escalating. Mrs Mitterrand and Mr Kouchner narrowly escaped death in a car bomb attack on July 6 and there are daily hand grenade attacks on UN guards in the main Kurdish towns. The Iraqi government is blocking the efforts of UN agencies to improve water, health and primary education in the north. Most crucially, no UN agency currently has responsibility for 'contingency planning' against the possibility of a future large-scale evacuation or displacement of the Kurdish population. Emergency supplies in the area are being withdrawn to neighbouring countries, and UNHCT staff will shortly leave. It is time for the international community to acknowledge the failure of its current approach and make strenuous efforts to find new ways of supporting and protecting the Kurds of northern Iraq.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Schaumann: "Industry Optimistic About the </F> Future"]    [Text] Industrial leaders' future expectations have moved  from black pessimism to radiant optimism in less than a year.    The leaders of a majority of Denmark's 700 largest firms  have  undergone a striking change in attitude. Not since the  "unbelievably" good years in the mid-1980's when Prime Minister  Poul Schluter (Conservative) was at the helm have industrial  leaders believed as strongly as they do today that they will  both employ more workers and increase investments.    BERLINGSKE TIDENDE asked Jyske Bank to analyze a survey of  the industrial situation that the Danish Bureau of Statistics  published yesterday. The results can be seen in two of the  graphs below [not reproduced here]. It is less than a year since  a large majority of industrial leaders anticipated layoffs and  no investments.    "The shift is quite striking. It is very, very fine," said  economist Jorgen Damgaard of Jyske Bank, who analyzed the survey.  <H5>  Positive View of Own Possibilities </H5>   "When industrial leaders are asked to give their opinion  about the possibilities of the general national development with  respect to creating more jobs, they are still negative. But when  it comes to their own firms most have finally become positive,"  Damgaard noted.    The 700 industrial leaders, whose firms account for a good  60  percent of the jobs in Danish industry, answer questions from  the Danish Bureau of Statistics each quarter. The assessments in  the new edition of the survey apply to the first three months of  the year.    When the answers are corrected for the size of the firm and  the traditional annually recurring pessimism here before spring  arrives, they show that a majority of 12 percent of the firms  anticipate hiring more workers in the first quarter of the year.  <H5>  More Will Invest </H5>   And an equally strong shift has occurred with respect to  investment plans.    A majority of 12 percent of the firms are also considering  concrete investment plans.    If these figures are more or less borne out -- and they  usually are -- it is only a question of time before surveys of  what has actually happened also document progress.    It is also worth noting in relation to industry's situation  that inventories are at their lowest point in several years. At  the same time export orders have now risen to such an extent  that they are back to normal.  <H5>  Marked Change in Attitude </H5>   If the new indications from industrial leaders are viewed in  light of the fact that private consumers are also optimistic now  -- as shown by a poll conducted by the Danish Bureau of  Statistics at the beginning of January -- there has been a real  change in people's attitudes.    According to the poll, people think Denmark's economic  situation is already better than it was a year ago, and they  also believe that things will be even better a year from now.    A good 12-percent majority of those questioned also believe  that the family's economic situation will improve within the  next year.  <H5>  Less Anxiety About Unemployment </H5>   At the same time, people's anxiety that unemployment will  rise further is receding very quickly. All in all the so-called  consumer confidence index has risen from minus three to plus  three in a single month.    Economy Minister Marianne Jelved (Radical Liberal) said:  "People have begun to believe that it is true that there will be  an upswing. And then there is a positive spiral. When  expectations are positive, people also behave differently. I do  not believe we will have total lack of restraint and  overheating. However, loan conversions and tax reform have  really put more money in people's pockets. The extra available  cash that families have has increased in a way that they can  really feel. At the same time unemployment has stopped rising."</p>

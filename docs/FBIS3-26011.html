A  revitalized science and technological structure is gradually  taking shape, which will benefit basic research and economic  development.    In 1994, organizational reform in science and technology  research institutions will be further carried out in depth, with  structural readjustment and the flow of talent as the main  tasks. Through readjustment, the contingent of science and  technology workers, who are either engaged in basic scientific  research, high-tech research, or tackling major science and  technology problems and developing research projects for social  benefits, will become more highly trained and the structure will  become more reasonable. The internal structures of various  science and technology research institutions will be further  readjusted and new and more competitive management and  operational systems will be adopted. The duplicated  organizations will be merged and streamlined and the excess  personnel will be allowed to flow and enter the market. Large  numbers of technological development and technology service  organizations will march toward the market at a faster pace.  They will establish enterprises or be changed into science and  technology enterprises or enterprise groups. At present, there  are already dozens of high science and technology enterprises in  China, which were established by science and technology research  institutions. They receive an income of some ten million yuan or  even a hundred million yuan a year.    The civilian-run science and technology enterprises will  develop at a higher speed. China now has a total of 40,000  civilian-run science and technology enterprises, of which more  than 10,000 were established last year. Henan, Shaanxi, and  other provinces have made decisions on speeding up development  of civilian-run enterprises in the name of the provincial party  committee and government and have worked out some new measures.  The number of newly established civilian-run enterprises will  be much higher this year than last year.    Development of the technological market has entered a new  historical stage. According to calculations, the turnover of  technological transactiona reached more than 18 billion yuan in  1993. The figure was just a little higher than 10 billion yuan  the previous year. All kinds of technological transaction  activities have been frequently and dynamically carried out in  various localities and at various levels. Intermediary  organizations, such as invisible assets assessment offices and  science and technology agents' offices, have emerged everywhere  in the country. Experiments in selected areas on a permanent  technological market have also been carried out smoothly.  Barriers between the various regions and departments have been  smashed and an open and unified nationwide technological market  system has begun to take shape.    Legal construction for science and technology has been  developing steadily. With the promulgation and implementation  of the "Law on Science and Technology Progress," science and  technology work has been brought onto a track of operating in  accordance with the legal system. The task of working out and  implementing relevant laws and regulations on protecting  intellectual property rights will be continued this year. The  establishment of special court of science and technology and  court of intellectual rights in Beijing and other areas has  provided an effective guarantee for fighting against the illegal  practices of violating intellectual property rights and  plagiarizing and forging achievements of science and technology  research and for protecting the legitimate rights of science and  technology institutions and personnel. The number of such  courts can increase this year.    In 1994, the management method of science and technology  management departments at all levels will be further improved  and geared to the needs of the market.    The 21st century will be one of science and technology. The  Chinese people are still faced with a grim reality. According  to the latest statistics, China ranks 12th in the world in the  number of science and technology treatises published, rising  three places from last year, but it is 17th in the treatises on  basic research, dropping two. The ultimate purposes of China's  reform of the science and technology structure are: First, to  combine science and technology with economic development more  closely and second, to promote the development of science and  technology, especially basic research. Whether China's reform  of the science and technology structure is successful or not  will chiefly be reflected by the achievements in these two  fields.</p>

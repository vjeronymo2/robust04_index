			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RIDERSHIP UP FOR 6-MONTH-OLD TRAIN  </P> <P> Six months old today, Orange County's commuter train is carrying 61% more  passengers per day than when service started and reached a one-day, record high  of 302 riders last Wednesday, officials said.  </P> <P> Using double-decked passenger coaches obtained from Caltrans, the County  Transportation Commission's commuter service has one train operating daily in  each direction between stops in Orange County and downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> OCTC officials on Monday called the six-month start-up period a success.  </P> <P> "The first commuter train has been a strong performer," said OCTC Chairman Dana  W. Reed, a Corona del Mar lawyer and political consultant.  </P> <P> OCTC is funding the rail service and contracts with Amtrak, which operates the  train. The cost is about $1.5 million per year, with ticket sales covering  about 40% of the cost.  </P> <P> Critics of rail service argue that the subsidies needed to pay for it would be  better spent on new freeway construction. But rail supporters contend that it  is too difficult environmentally and politically to build enough freeways to  satisfy rush-hour demand. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Out of the shadows Mr Kim Jong-il has already surpassed his father, the Great Leader, in one regard. He enjoys an even worse press in the west than Mr Kim Il-sung. Newspaper accounts have painted the junior Mr Kim as an unstable alcoholic, a womaniser who likes to import foreign call girls, and a cinema fanatic who maintains a library of 20,000 movies and supervises seven movie studios. South Korean intelligence has claimed Mr Kim masterminded several North Korean terrorist actions in the 1980s, including the mid-air bombing of a Korean Airlines airliner in 1987 - although it has not offered convincing evidence to substantiate this charge. But the bad publicity does appear to contain grains of truth. Diplomats in Pyongyang report regular sightings of all-female 'cultural groups' travelling to North Korea under the patronage of Mr Kim. In the late 1980s, according to well-substantiated accounts, his interest in cinema prompted him to order the kidnapping of a South Korean film director and his actress wife so they could make movies for North Korea. Mr Kim cuts a strange figure, adding to his enigmatic image. He is small in stature, bespectacled and pudgy, sports a bouffant hairstyle and his dress resembles a Chinese factory manager. In sharp contrast to his charismatic father, Mr Kim in his rare public appearances has appeared unhappy and nervous. He is described by those who have met him as being both shy and arrogant. His lifestyle is reclusive and he avoids meeting foreign visitors. This might help explain why overseas delegations will not be allowed to attend the funeral of his father on July 17. But North Korean defectors claim that Mr Kim is a 'techno-freak' whose interests range from computers to watching foreign satellite programmes, including Cable News Network. 'Kim Jong-il is well aware of what's happening in the outside world,' said one analyst. There are strong psychological and political reasons for Mr Kim's insecurity. Born in a Soviet army camp near Khabarovsk in February 1942, his childhood included 'a dreary life in Siberia; his father's ill-treatment of his mother and her sudden death; his father's remarriage; and a war,' according to a South Korean government publication. Although relations with his father appeared to be cool during his youth, Mr Kim was groomed for power. He attended the Mangyongdae Revolutionary Academy, an exclusive school for children of the political elite. He graduated from Kim Il-sung university with a degree in political economy and is reported to have studied briefly in the former East Germany. He used his school ties in the traditional Korean manner to cultivate friendships with people who now hold key government and party positions and who are his chief political allies. Mr Kim was officially appointed his father's successor in 1980, but family conflicts still pose a challenge to his role as heir. His step-mother is supporting her son and Mr Kim's step-brother, Kim Pyong-il, as a potential rival. Another challenge could come from his uncle, Mr Kim Yong-ju, who was believed to be Mr Kim Il-sung's chosen successor until he was replaced by the junior Mr Kim. Mr Kim Yong-ju disappeared from public view in the mid-1970s, only to reappear suddenly as a vice-president last December. Mr Kim Jong-il might take comfort in the official public adulation that has enveloped him and his father. He is known as the 'Dear Leader' and the country's extensive propaganda machine has attributed him with a long list of extraordinary achievements, from overseeing vast construction projects to creating a revolutionary new form of theatre. But North Korean defectors contend that Mr Kim has expressed profound cynicism about the cult of personality that surrounds him, even though he helped create it. Mr Kim appears to be driven by a need to prove himself and escape his father's overwhelming shadow. This may provide him with the motivation to abandon his father's juche (self-reliance) ideology and open up the country to the outside world.</p>

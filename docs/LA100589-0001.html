			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY WILL PAY $9 MILLION IN FLOODING SUIT  </P> <P> The city of San Diego, settling another liability case that will further strain  city finances, Wednesday agreed to pay $9 million to 17 families whose homes  were flooded by rainwater that poured out of a city catch basin during a severe  storm last year.  </P> <P> The out-of-court settlement, reached in a conference before Superior Court  Judge Judith McConnell, calls for the city to pay the 62 plaintiffs within 60  days. The timetable will prompt budget juggling because the city fund  designated for lawsuit payoffs, which started the fiscal year July 1 with $12  million, now contains only about $4 million, City Manager John Lockwood said.  </P> <P> "That's $9 million out of city funds, and that means other things are going to  have to be deferred," Lockwood said. He said he will propose budget amendments,  including the possibility of deferring capital improvement projects in next  year's budget, to the San Diego City Council at its Oct. 16 meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We've Got No Choice'  </P> <P> "It's a real problem," said Councilman Bob Filner, who represents the area.  "We're going to have to postpone some projects to do it. Nobody wants to, but  we've got no choice."  </P> <P> The settlement comes just two weeks after the city agreed to a record  $9.5-million payment to a woman who left brain damaged and quadriplegic after  her car was struck by a speeding police cruiser on New Year's Day, 1988.  </P> <P> Because of the size of that judgment, the city arranged to pay $6.3 million  during fiscal 1991, giving financial staffers the ability to budget that  amount.  </P> <P> Under Wednesday's settlement, the city will purchase 15 flood-damaged homes on  Lauriston, Paxton and Elrose drives in south San Diego, valued at slightly more  than $2 million, said Chief Deputy City Atty. Alan Sumption. The rest of the  settlement is for personal property loss and emotional distress suffered by the  plaintiffs -- 17 families and a corporation that had stored fabric in a garage  at a home.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs will split the funds in an undisclosed arrangement, said Gary  Elster, attorney for the plaintiffs. One more family not represented by Elster  has a pending claim against the city.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs "suffered very bad emotional distress," Elster said. "Their  children had developed an intense fear of water. They were afraid every time it  rained."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Catch Basin Was a Parking Lot  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury last month ruled that the city was liable for the flood  damage because it had leased the catch basin as a parking lot to a trucking  company, Elster said.  </P> <P> When a severe rainstorm hit on Feb. 2, 1988, water swept the trucks off the  basin floor and truck parts clogged the basin drains and spillway, sending the  overflow downhill toward the homes, Elster said.  </P> <P> The city had contended that the storm was a freak occurrence that only happens  every 200 to 500 years and claimed it should not be held responsible for a  deluge it could not have guarded against. City attorneys did not, however,  defend the city property department's decision to lease the huge basin as a  parking lot to bring in revenue.  </P> <P> After losing the liability phase of the trial, the city settled out of court  rather than face a second jury that would have determined the penalty, Sumption  said.  </P> <P> Wednesday's judgment is not the first against the city involving the area. In  1983, some of the same families won a $1.4-million out-of-court settlement of a  lawsuit that contended that construction upstream of the South San Diego  Industrial Park contributed to flooding of their homes. The same claim was made  in the current lawsuit.  </P> <P> Filner said he has repeatedly called for construction of flood controls  throughout the neighborhood, a low-lying area along a creek. Filner predicted  further flooding if the city does not make improvements.  </P> <P> "We've got to do it, because otherwise we're going to have these big  settlements every month," Filner said.  </P></p>

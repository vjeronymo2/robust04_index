Interviewed by the newspaper TISHRIN today, Naji said that  by  this vile, hideous crime, the Zionists have proved their racist,  Nazi, and fascist mentality. He demanded the world to uphold  justice, human rights, and the right to self-determination. He  expressed surprise that the United States was satisfied with the  issuance of condemnation statements despite the ugliness of the  massacre at a time when it would raise a hue and cry if the dead  were Jews. He called on the international community to press  for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  territories and to impose sanctions on Israel for not complying  with the international legitimacy resolutions and charters.    Dr. Naji criticized Yasir 'Arafat for making concessions to  Israel and said that 'Arafat's policy encourages the Zionist  enemy and gives it the green light. [passage omitted]</p>

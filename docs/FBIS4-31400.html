			<p>BFN     [Text] The position of our delegation toward the peace  negotiations in Geneva is evidently increasingly gaining trust  of the international community. A document was signed at the  talks in Geneva that have just ended aimed at halting the combat  in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- by which a one-month cease-fire will  come in force throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina as of noon 10 June.    In a statement for the B-H PRESS [news agency] Dr. Ejup  Ganic, head of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation and vice  president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, emphasized that  the delegation had accomplished [words indistinct] set by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. We have secured the withdrawal of  Karadzic's military formations from the 3-km zone around Gorazde  and afterward an agreement on cessation of combat activities for  the duration of one month. In this way the aggressor will be  forced to negotiate a political solution to the clashes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Ganic believes. Karadzic tried to  accomplish a total cease-fire for the duration of at least four  months in Geneva, which would, on the ground, freeze the  existing situation and practically mean the recognition of the  aggressor's conquests.    The agreement reached in Geneva is interpreted by the  international media as a complete success for the  Bosnia-Herzegovina diplomacy. Our delegation has left open the  option of extending the cease-fire if the negotiating process  about the political solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis  shows [word indistinct] progress, but rejected meeting the  aggressor's side in Geneva directly. The talks were carried out  with the mediation of UN representatives.</p>

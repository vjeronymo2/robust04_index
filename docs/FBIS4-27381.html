			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Cho Yu-sik] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Some parts of the results of  the Uruguay Round [UR] of multilateral trade negotiations are  either hardly acceptable or should be amended because they so  vitally affect our national interests. If so, is the demand  for a renegotiation of these parts realistic?    In this regard, Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry,  spelled out the government position in these words: "Of course,  we need to reexamine our past mistakes to learn a lesson from  them. But we should refrain from wasteful backward-leaning  argument, but engage in constructive and forward-looking  debate." The government's feeling is summed up in the following  words of another concerned official of the Ministry of  Agriculture and Fisheries: "After everyone has gone home upon  completion of the negotiation, we feel we have lost something.  So we are out on the field alone, trying to call back everyone  to the negotiating table. But no one would show up."    Needless to say, these words were uttered on the assumption  that it is impossible to renegotiate. The following are the  grounds of this assumption:    First, it is too late to negotiate because our government  already agreed to the UR basic principles on 15 December 1993,  presented our final "country schedule" for market opening, and  signed the final protocol acknowledging the overall outcome of  the UR round at Marrackech, Morocco, on 12 April this year. It  is no use trying to stop the train after it has already started  out. Trying to overturn what was agreed upon at the  multilateral talks is tantamount to keeping two tongues in one  mouth and would only damage our international prestige.    Second, even if a renegotiation is allowed, it will be  impossible to make an amendment aimed at narrowing the scope of  opening, although it is possible to expand the scope of market  opening. According to this school of thought, inasmuch as it is  the spirit of the UR negotiations to remove the tariff and  nontariff barriers and expand free trade, an "amendment for a  narrower opening" is impossible.    Third, it is difficult to overturn even what was agreed upon  at one-on-one bilateral talks. Then, how could a small nation  like ours hope to bring the whole world into a renegotiation to  change what was agreed upon at the extensive multilateral UR  negotiations?    Fourth, should the National Assembly refuse to ratify the  agreement as demanded by the farmers' organizations, some civic  groups, and the opposition parties, which call for  renegotiation, our country would end up withdrawing from the  Uruguay structure and being isolated from the international  community. (In the words of Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and  industry,) "It is unthinkable for our country, which has  attained economic growth through exports, to refuse to ratify  the UR agreement, for such refusal would make our country an  international missing child. Nor is it possible to renegotiate."    Fifth, should we refuse to ratify the UR agreement, we would  have disadvantages in terms of tariffs and trade and suffer  from a fatal economic blow.    In brief, they argue that now that the negotiations are  over, it is no use crying alone for a renegotiation. It would  only damage our international prestige. If there is to be a  renegotiation, it will be allowed only to expand the scope of  opening. The UR negotiations being multilateral talks, not a  bilateral negotiation, it is all the more difficult to make a  belated amendment to what was agreed upon at the UR talks.  Should our National Assembly refuse to ratify the agreement,  our country would keep out of the UR system and become an  international orphan. As a consequence, we would suffer from a  fatal economic blow.    The UR negotiations came to a close in Morocco on 12 April  with the ministers of participating countries signing the final  protocol and the agreement on establishing the World Trade  Organization [WTO]. As far as the procedure is concerned, the  WTO now only awaits its departure at full steam. All that needs  to be done is for the parliament of each member country to  ratify the results of the negotiations within this year before  the agreement takes effect on 1 July 1995. All countries have  already presented their schedules for market opening.    The proponents of renegotiation argue that, primarily we  should have renegotiated before the Morocco ministerial  conference was held on 12 April and prior to submitting a final  country schedule in order to attain the maximum advantages and  reflect the results in the final country schedule for opening.    Now that the ministerial conference is over and a country  schedule for market reopening has been submitted, there may no  room for amendment. But the proponents of amendment think  otherwise.    First, the basic provisions of the UR agreement cannot be  changed, but it is possible to change the country schedule  before the WTO is formerly inaugurated in the future. In other  words, the scope and timing for opening agreed upon at the  multilateral negotiations cannot be changed, but an amendment  is possible within the agreed upon scope and timing. In  addition, when a far more disadvantageous schedule than what  was agreed upon at the multilateral negotiations is forced upon  a country at bilateral talks, it is possible for this country  to demand a renegotiation "in the name of the UR" or bring the  case before GATT.    Second, in the UR agreement there is no provision that  amendment is allowed only to enlarge the scope of market  opening. Such a provision, if there is one, wouldn't square  with reality.    In fact, after the basic provisions were finally approved on  15 December last year, the United States and Japan attempted to  impose some tariffs on semiconductors, whisky, timber, and in  particular nonferrous metals, by discarding their previous  nontariffication agreement for these items. By seizing this  opportunity, the ROK once drew up a plan to break its  nontariffication promise and impose 3 to 4 percent of tariffs  on specific items. The United States and Canada attempted to  impose quotas on some items with a view to opening overseas  farm markets in a way more advantageous to them. These moves  are the clear attempts by various countries to amend previous  agreements so that the scope of opening might be narrowed,  indicating that depending on circumstances, it is possible to  renegotiate to reduce the scope of market opening. Needless to  say, one-sided change of the agreed upon scope is unacceptable.  But if there is a sufficient ground, renegotiation for an  amendment should be allowed.    The proponents of renegotiation argue that it falls within  the right of contracting parties to reverse an expanded scope  of opening far exceeding the scope required under the UR  provisions to "the normal level," aside from the question of  whether the amendment is aimed at enlarging the scope of  opening or reducing it.    Third, once the contracting parties agree to change the  previously agreed schedule of enforcement, the change needs an  endorsement by all WTO members just as a matter of formality.  But barring a flaw to such agreement, nobody would raise an  objection. The proponents of renegotiation argue that there is  no reason for a third party to oppose an amendment when the  amendment is not to change a basic provision of the UR  agreement, but to change a country schedule for opening under  the basic principles of the agreement, in cases where the  interested parties agree to the amendment.    Fourth, these proponents argue that even in the worst  scenario in which our country withholds the final signing until  after the inauguration of the WTO because of the failure of a  renegotiation to wind up by that time, we will not be kept out  of the UR system. The WTO charter agreement provides that the  agreement be ratified two years prior to the date of  effectuation. Accordingly, all that the ROK should do is to  join the WTO by signing it by a cabinet minister, and pending a  formal ratification by the National Assembly, bring its case  before the WTO as a member, calling for a renegotiation on  matters at issue. Needless to say, if the renegotiation is  completed before the WTO is formally inaugurated, it will pose  no problem at all.    Fifth, therefore even if our National Assembly delays (or  withholds) the ratification of the WTO agreement and our  government tries to renegotiate on some items, we will not  become "an international orphan." The National Assembly's  refusal to ratify the agreement can be fully regarded as a  weapon for strengthening our negotiating position and need not  be considered as taboo.    In the case of the United States, it is unclear whether the  U.S. Congress will ratify the agreement within the deadline. In  accordance with Article 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act  (AAA) which provides that under no international agreement  shall the major agricultural and livestock markets be open to  the outside world, and according to other domestic statutes,  the United States refused to open markets for 14 basic farm and  livestock products in the past. Recently, a large number of  U.S. senators have resolved to reject any opening of markets  for 14 basic farm and livestock products in accordance with the  AAA provisions. With considerable rough sailing and difficulty  anticipated in the process of ratification by the U.S.  Congress, the Congress is hardly expected to complete the  ratification process within the time limit set by the UR  agreement. In India there have been strong anti-UR  demonstrations, and the prospect is dim for an early  ratification by the parliament in which the government party is  in the minority.    It appears that a revision of the schedule for market  opening is theoretically possible. But this possibility cannot  become reality unless our trade officials have a strong policy  will and public opinion unanimously backs them up.    If so, it is necessary to delve into the reasons why our  trade officials have failed in the negotiating process in the  past.    The reason mentioned most often is the lack of expertise on  the part of the trade officials who took part in the  negotiations. It is said that the inadequate knowledge of the  UR negotiating provisions, the lack of international  negotiating experience, and the lack of a good command of  English have resulted in a disadvantage in the negotiations.  Our trade officials were unable to interpret UR provisions  properly and had to seek advice from a relevant U.S. research  institute on a a slew of provisions they did not understand.    A communications official who took part in the negotiation  commented as follows: "We feel that people who talk about the  lack of expertise are playing with words. In fact, where can  you find anyone who has greater expertise than our trade  officials? They do not work alone; they always get help from  research institutions. They marshal all available brains at  home.    "The UR negotiation is not an Oriental style or Korean style  negotiation. It has been conducted according to the practices  of the United States and the EC, and the UR agreement is  written in the letters of their alphabet. Naturally, there are  many things which are in accord with their realities but which  are out of accord with our legal system and our language.    "The ability to negotiate differs not in accordance with  individual abilities, but in accordance with the national  ability. In many cases, the United States or the EC is too  formidable an opponent. That is why we took actions in concert  with countries in the same boat and produced certain results in  areas such as antidumping charges, subsidy, and intellectual  property. However, we could find no country which would act in  concert with us in the field of farm products."    In brief, this official claims that our negotiators did  their best under an unfavorable condition, and that the  unsatisfactory results were due to the inequality in ability  between the strong and the weak. However, did they really do  their best? Can they explain their failure to gain what is  guaranteed under the provisions of the UR agreement with the  idea of disparity in ability between the weak and the strong?    No other country has ever opened its markets for a greater  number of goods at greater rates and at a faster pace than the  ROK did in GATT history. The ROK is among the countries subject  to the greatest trade pressures from the United States. But  never, not even once, has our government objected to U.S. trade  pressures.    "When there is some trade friction, it is not necessary for  the whole country to clamor for an early settlement or make  haste. When there is a demand from one of our trade partners,  what we need is the attitude of trying to understand the  position of the other side and be concerned about it rather  than taking the demand as a pressure.'"    Those are the words of our minister of trade and industry,  the cabinet member in charge of trade matters. Other trade  bureaucrats also stress that the disadvantageous results of the  just-ended UR negotiation was "due to the U.S. pressures."  Among the heads or trade ministers of developing countries, no  one knows better than the head or trade minister of our country  how to refrain as much as possible from making any remarks that  may offend the United States. These days when someone clumsily  makes an issue of U.S. trade pressures, he is apt to be branded  as a sentimental nationalist lacking in international sense.    It is questionable whether this kind of stance will be of  any help in trade negotiations with the United States. Without  a shift in thinking to the stance of regarding any unwarranted  demand of the United States not as an "understandable request,"  but as an "unacceptable pressure," it seems highly unlikely for  our trade bureaucrats to come forward on their own demanding  renegotiation.    Needless to say, we should not negotiate in such a manner as  to harm the opponent in order to gain our own benefits. But  only when we effect a shift in our thinking to an independent  stance, is it possible for us to avoid getting insulted to our  faces. This shifting is what our trade bureaucrats are yet to  accomplish.    In fact, the key to renegotiation is the National Assembly's  refusal to ratify the results of the UR negotiations. If the  National Assembly rejects ratification, the executive branch  will have no alternative but to carry out a renegotiation. It  provides the ground for the government in breaking the existing  agreement and making new demands. It will be alright for the  National Assembly to ratify the revised agreement arrived at  later by renegotiation.    As of this moment, all of the opposition assemblymen have  signed their signatures on the pledge to oppose the  ratification of the UR agreement in a campaign kicked off by  the "National Campaign Headquarters for the Protection of Our  Agriculture. They are 96 DP [Democratic Party], 12 UNP [United  National Party], two KNP [Korea National Party], and one NPPR  assemblymen. Of the 16 independent assemblymen, only two have  signed the pledge, but all of the independents are expected to  sign in the future. Still, the campaign needs to obtain  signatures of between 25 and 30 LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]  assemblymen in order to come up with 150 signatures necessary  to foil ratification in the National Assembly.    Currently, efforts are under way to persuade LDP assemblymen  mainly through each county-level farmers association. As of  early March, five LDP assemblymen, including Kim Pom-myon from  Nonsan County, reportedly signed the pledge to vote no to the  ratification motion. Currently, the signature campaign is in a  temporary lull as DLP issued a guideline and otherwise stepped  up internal control against the signature campaign.    The "National Campaign Headquarters" has concentrated its  efforts on 35 rural districts throughout the country, including  four in the Taejon- Chungnam area and seven in the  Taegu-Kyongbuk area, contacting DLP parliamentarians in these  areas in an effort to persuade them. It is conducting a recall  drive against uncooperative DLP assemblymen by collecting the  signatures of one-third of the eligible voters.    However, it is still questionable how much this campaign  will prove effective. [passage omitted]    The road to a renegotiation of the UR agreement is far and  rough.</p>

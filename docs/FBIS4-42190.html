			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paul Vanden Baviere: "Belgium Blocks Libyan </F> Embassy Accounts -- In Application of UN Resolution 883"]    [Excerpt] Belgium appears to have taken the lead in the  international campaign against Libya, or to have been too  energetic. For the last month or so, it has been blocking the  bank accounts of the Libyan Embassy in Brussels. It is said to  be the only country with such a strict application of Security  Council Resolution 883 of 11 November on blocking Libyan assets.    "Such a measure has not been taken by Italy, Germany, nor  even France and the United States (against the Libyan mission to  the United Nations in New York), two countries which are  directly involved," Libyan Ambassador Muhammad Sharaf al-Fayturi  said. He said the measure infringed on the Vienna convention on  diplomatic relations.    Blocking the embassy's accounts is causing a considerable  nuisance. To prevent electricity from being cut off, the  accounts are being paid in cash. The ambassador and the other  staff of the Libyan People's Bureau have not been affected  personally. Their accounts have been left untouched.    The measure is a consequence of the sanctions imposed by the  Security Council on Libya in connection with the so-called  Lockerbie affair. This involved a bomb on a PanAm plane which  exploded in 1988 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie,  resulting in 270 deaths. The United States and United Kingdom  believe that two Libyans are the perpetrators and are demanding  their extradition. [passage omitted]</p>

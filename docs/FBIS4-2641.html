			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] In a move that has shocked British officials, China  is proposing to further restrict the eligibility criteria for  Hong Kong's new Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Non-Chinese will  in effect be barred from holding the three positions held by  "local judges".    The Legislative Council has already refused to endorse the  1991 Sino-British agreement on the establishment of the  post-1997 CFA because it allows only one overseas judge to join  the other five justices who will make up the court.    Now it appears that China has an even more restrictive  definition of who will qualify to serve as the three "local  judges". A senior Chinese official told Eastern Express  yesterday that they must be "Hong Kong permanent residents  without any right of abode in any foreign countries". This  requirement is the same as that which applies to the Chief  Justice, who will be the fifth member of the CFA.    China's new definition drew an immediate hostile response  from a senior government official. "The Joint Declaration, the  Basic Law and the Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final  Appeal are very clear on this point. The words have a simple  and plain meaning. If this is the Chinese view they ought to  let us know through the formal channels, i.e. the Joint Liaison  Group (JLG). If they would do so they would have to explain how  this view could be made consistent with what the agreements  actually say," the government official said.    The mini-constitution, or Basic Law, for Hong Kong after  1997  does not offer any precise definition for the nationality and  residence status of the local judges. A second draft bill for  the establishment of the FCA is being finalised by the Legal  Department and will be submitted to the Executive Council  shortly.    The Government maintains that the bill will be drafted on  the  basis of the Sino-British agreement, which states that Hong Kong  "local" judges refers to judges who are permanent residents.  They may be expatriates and no nationality requirement should  be imposed.    A locally-based British official said the definition of the  word "local" was a difficult and sensitive issue. We do not  have a definition of right of abode and of what is 'Chinese'  yet. That obviously will affect the definition in terms of  judges in CFA."    The legislator Simon Ip, former chairman of the Law Society,  said the attention of legislators and the legal profession would  be focused on any nationality requirement for the three local  judges.    Ip said that China's requirements would be unacceptable to  the legal profession and to himself.</p>

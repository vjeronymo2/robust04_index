			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / A misguided focus on job creation - America The 'jobs conference' convened in Detroit by President Bill Clinton should really be called a 'wages conference' or perhaps even an 'inequality conference'. Provided wages are flexible there is no reason why jobs should be permanently in short supply in a market economy. If simply 'having a job' were all that mattered, people would work for practically nothing. If necessary they would secure jobs by offering to pay employers to hire them. We do not observe the absurdity of negative wages, of course, because what is really at stake is not employment but the income that can be derived from it. Quite rightly, people will take jobs only if wages more than compensate for the unpleasantness (or 'disutility') of working, taking into account all other means of sustenance. While conceding that the unemployed individual can perhaps price himself into work, some economists claim this option is not generally available. Following Keynes, they stress employees' dual role as buyers of goods and services as well as inputs in the productive process. If all wages were cut, the argument runs, consumers' purchasing power would fall, putting downward pressure on product prices. So real, or inflation adjusted, wages might not decline. This is an ingenious but ultimately unconvincing objection. A fall in wages would cause a shift in the composition of demand, with increased purchases by foreigners, companies and individuals not reliant on wage income. Falling prices would also boost demand by increasing the value of assets such as bonds and bank deposits. The classical conclusion thus stands: in the absence of artificial constraints, unemployment is voluntary because it reflects people's reluctance to accept jobs at the wages offered. The diverse jobs record of the US and the European Union amply supports this unpopular proposition. In Europe strong unions and restrictive legislation have stunted job creation by putting a floor under wages. At the same time relatively generous social benefits have created a viable alternative to work for many adults. In the US both sets of forces have been weaker: there are fewer benefits and wages are more flexible. It is thus hardly surprising that the EU jobless rate has risen steadily and now seems stuck in double digits while the US rate, currently 6.5 per cent, has increased only slightly in recent decades. Yet the domestic unpopularity of the US approach shows that people care not about jobs per se but about the quality of jobs - the standard of living they buy. Middle class families are frustrated by the slow growth of earnings - an inevitable consequence of the enormously rapid growth of employment required to absorb the baby-boom generation. And in urban ghettos, many adult men (especially minorities) have refused to take dead end jobs, opting instead to withdraw from the formal labour market. The lesson is that while market forces can create jobs for all who want them, they cannot be relied upon to create jobs that meet people's aspirations or even that pay enough to lift low-skilled workers above subjective measures of 'poverty'. Meeting people's aspirations is an especially formidable task because they depend largely on relative rather than absolute living standards. What is regarded as a 'good' wage is largely dependent on what others are earning. Poverty is a notoriously relative concept. In modern America many poor families have cars, colour televisions, videos and air conditioning. They live well by the standards both of their forebears and of the middle classes in nations such as India or China. Yet they feel abused because their lifestyles compare adversely to those of affluent Americans. If a consensus emerges at Detroit, it is likely to be that industrial countries can create more 'quality' jobs by taking steps to raise the skills and hence productivity of low paid workers. There is likely to be a strong emphasis on the need for more effective education and training, especially for the bottom half of the ability range. This is an admirable policy, but it would be a mistake to regard it as a solution to present problems. Differences in ability are so great that better training for the low paid will only have a limited impact on disparities in the productivity (and hence earnings) of various social groups within society. As overall living standards rise, so will the minimum requirements for life above the poverty line and the wage at which work is regarded as dignified. If social benefits are raised in line with growing affluence, unemployment will remain high (as it has in the EU in past decades) because many will find that work does not pay. If social benefits are held down and wages kept flexible (as has happened in the US), the number of working 'poor' will multiply. Either way the conscience of society will be pricked. At its roots, the problem of unemployment, or its alternative manifestation as 'low quality' jobs, reflects a fundamental feature of the market system: the fact that it rewards individual effort and ability and so generates grossly unequal outcomes. The way to come to terms with economic inequality is to recognise that the market system is not something that governments either created or can manipulate with impunity. Markets are sets of unplanned spontaneous exchanges; nobody plans the inequality and nobody is responsible for it. Inequality is simply the price we pay for a general level of prosperity unimaginable under any other economic system.</p>

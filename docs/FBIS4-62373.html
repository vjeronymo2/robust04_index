			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Yanayev report in the "Opposition Is Looking for </F> the Leader" column: "All Leaders Are Great but Zyuganov Can  Become Even Greater"]    [Text] Russian opposition groups want to find a single  leader and form a powerful movement around him. As the May Day  demonstrations have shown, there are not a few wishing to become  such a leader. Moreover, even such discarded political figures  as Valentin Varennikov are trying to play first fiddle.  Yesterday Varennikov was registered as a candidate for the  Federation Council in the Chelyabinsk constituency. A founding  congress of the Accord for Russia movement, scheduled for 19  May, is supposed to elect a Russia-wide leader.    The chances of Valentin Varennikov's making it back even  into  a group of opposition leaders, just as of securing a seat in  parliament, are not very good. The opposition has far more  colorful figures capable of claiming a leadership role. These  are primarily Aleksandr Rutskoy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Valeriy  Zorkin, Ilya Konstantinov, and Sergey Baburin.    It was originally believed that they would all rally around  the Accord for Russia movement whose founding congress,  scheduled for 19 May, will clear up who is the most important  among them. It can be presumed even now, however, that one of  the initiators of this movement, Valeriy Zorkin, will most  likely not be such. Obviously the Accord was to have become the  former Constitutional Court chairman's sponsoring organization  because there are no other forces behind him. However, although  representatives of the majority of opposition parties and unions  have signed the program document of this movement, no mighty  coalition has emerged.    "October heroes" Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ilya Konstantinov are  currently engaged in creating a new movement, The State  [Derzhava]; Gennadiy Zyuganov has a self-sufficient Communist  Party which has no particular need for blocs with any other  organizations. Generally it now turns out that the majority of  opposition politicians are convinced that Zorkin is obviously  unfit for the role of leader, while the Accord has no chance of  becoming much more than a Moscow political club.    As for Rutskoy and Konstantinov, it is also difficult to see  any forces standing behind them. Meanwhile Rutskoy has already  promised that the State movement will encompass thousands of  people, that it will have an "iron discipline," and that  finally, it will come to power no later than in a year. Yet it  is absolutely unlikely that the opposition will want to  recognize Rutskoy as leader. Most politicians from this camp  relate to him negatively. Stanislav Terekhov considers him one  of the main culprits for the October defeat while Gennadiy  Zyuganov is convinced that after the amnesty Rutskoy must leave  the political arena altogether. Even Konstantinov, who calls  Rutskoy a friend, says in private that the former vice president  "usually changes his views three times a day."    The political bankruptcy of the majority of the current  opposition leaders could prove beneficial for Communist Party  Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, who will thus get rid of  competition. The fact that Zyuganov heads Russia's largest party  and bears no responsibility for the opposition's October defeat  makes him the most acceptable figure for the role of Russia-wide  opposition leader. How realistic his chances of becoming such  will be shown by the congress of the Free Russia People's Party,  scheduled for 22 May, whose leadership Rutskoy may give up for  the sake of creating the State movement. Then the sole thread  linking the former vice president to any consequential political  movement will be broken. Also critical for Zyuganov's future  will be the Accord for Russia congress.</p>

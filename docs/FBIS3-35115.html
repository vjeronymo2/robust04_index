The ministerial source told AL-HAYAH that arms contracts  concluded between two states or between a state and the  manufacturing company usually stipulate that the country which  purchases or uses the aircraft has no right to dispose of them  without prior approval.    He said that the Lebanese Government will seek France's  approval as soon as it receives an official offer from the  Pakistani Government to purchase the Mirage planes. Lebanon  will thus have complied with the terms of the contract signed  between the two countries. There is no commitment in the  contract as far as Dassault, the manufacturing company, is  concerned.    Discussing numbers, the source said that the Lebanese Army's  Air Force had received 12 Mirage aircraft since 1968, all made  in 1967, and that although they were placed in active service,  they were operated for only a limited number of hours.    He confirmed that the Army command now has 10 aircraft still  parked at al-Qulay'at military airfield in 'Akkar (in the  north), and that the other two were damaged before 1975, one  having crashed during exercises in the early seventies at Riyaq  airbase in al-Biqa' -- the pilot survived.    In conclusion, the source said that "although their  manufacture dates back to 1967, the aircraft are as good as new  and are in good condition because of their limited flying hours  not exceeding 100. They need maintenance to become operational."    It is known that the Pakistani Air Force has some Mirage  aircraft.</p>

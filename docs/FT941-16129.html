			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Cavallo to end his attacks on Brazil To the relief of the Brazilian government, Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, has promised to end his scathing attacks on Brazil's economic policies. Mr Cavallo yesterday said: 'I will not comment any more about Brazil. I will not answer any more questions about Brazil.' Mr Cavallo, who in three years transformed Argentina's chaotic and hyper-inflationary economy, has made a habit of publicly criticising Brazil's economic policies. He often says these are based on 'hunger' and 'impoverishment of the people'. Although the Brazilian government has never protested formally, it has made its displeasure known to Mr Cavallo. A Brazilian official said yesterday 'we are not going to say anything because this should have been his attitude right from the start. These statements harm our relations.' However, Mr Cavallo, is credited with helping convince Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, to propose orthodox policies similar to Argentina's.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1013 GMT on 6 January broadcasts its "Documentary on the Air"  program. During an 11-minute report, correspondent Tatiana  Ulyanova gives brief details about the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkar and introduces its president, Valeriy  Mukhamedovich Kokov, who is interviewed by the program's  presenter.    Asked whether he has established a hard-line dictatorship in  the republic, Kokov replies: "I would not like to say that a  hard-line dictatorship has been established on the territory of  Kabardino-Balkar, but I can assert something else. We are in  favor of discipline and order. It is for that reason that we  take every measure to be in line with the both the political and  economic changes that are occurring in the world, in good time  and without excesses."    The relative calm in the republic is explained by the ways  and wisdom of the republic's peoples. "They demonstrated this,"  says Kokov, "in the elections that took place recently. They  assessed the situation in a fairly wise manner and, in spite of  all the efforts of the political leaders to divide society into  a minimum of two camps, the people of Kabardino-Balkar gave  two-thirds of the votes in favor of stopping the further  disintegration of our fatherland, for law and order, that is, in  support of the constitution. What is more, the people of  Kabardino-Balkar elected a new parliament in accordance with the  new constitution of the Russian Federation."    Kokov then explains that he is giving this interview in the  interval in the session. Kokov stresses that Kabardino-Balkar  has exerted every effort to achieve a settlement in the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict, and is opposed to revenge actions in  such conflicts.</p>

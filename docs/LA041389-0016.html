			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'WINTER PEOPLE': COLD COMFORT  </P> <P> "The Winter People," which opens the AFI/Fest tonight and plays in selected  theaters beginning Friday, has so many arresting characters and facets that  when it begins to go completely haywire it's like watching someone you've  become rather fond of come unglued.  </P> <P> Carol Sobieski's screenplay, adapted from the carefully wrought novel of North  Carolina regional novelist John Ehle, sets a father and young daughter from  more citified Pennsylvania down in the middle of an isolated Smoky Mountains  community, mid-Depression time. Wayland Jackson (Kurt Russell) is a decent,  gentle, humorous man with patience enough to make clocks, which happens to be  his trade. Recently widowered and only now coming out of it, he is the devoted  father to a ferocious, outspoken 10-year old daughter, Paula (splendid newcomer  Amelia Burnette).  </P> <P> When their car gets stuck in a country stream, father and daughter stumble down  through misty woods onto a remote mountain compound belonging to Collie Wright  (Kelly McGillis) a notably suspicious woman, and her beautiful, 6-month-old  son, Jonathan.  </P> <P> Collie, it seems, is a pridefully unmarried mother, although she has kept the  father's identity secret. (It doesn't take vast detective work to ferret out  the man however; if you remember the Hatfields and the McCoys or Romeo and  Juliet you might have a clue.)  </P> <P> Having this baby has alienated Collie from her mother, but not her patriarchal  father (Lloyd Bridges) or her three brothers: the weak, guilt-ridden  storekeeper Gudger (Lanny Flaherty), stocky blacksmith Milton (David Dwyer), or  Young (Don Michael Paul), obviously the youngest, a handsome, traveling,  all-purpose hell-raiser.  </P> <P> Almost instantly, Jackson and Paula are taken up by the lonely Collie, although  the specter of the baby's father, who may return at any moment, hangs over  their growing involvement. Jackson, whom Collie quarters in an out-building, is  introduced to this close-knit mountain community and even persuades the Wright  clan to back the building of an enormous clock tower in the center of town.  </P> <P> Sobieski's dialogue is respectful of Ehle's beautifully written North Carolina  talk, expanding it at times inventively. But, excepting nicely played scenes  between Jackson, Collie and Paula, the tone that director Ted Kotcheff has set  begins to seems ludicrous.  </P> <P> Don Michael Paul has been encouraged to play the lusty Young like every amateur  auditioning for the role of the Rainmaker in a bus-and-truck touring company.  The baby's father looks and acts like a slathering, backwoods Rasputin. It  makes it impossible to imagine Collie with him more than once, and theirs was  supposed to be a love affair that went on for more than two years. The  suspicion rises that this off-beat property may be condemned.  </P> <P> It's a feeling that gets stronger with our first introduction to the Campbell  clan, rivals to the Wrights and headed by elder Drury Campbell (Mitchell Ryan).  They're first seen robbing and vandalizing the Jackson's stranded car like a  pack of howling, bearded degenerates. Granted that these hunters and trappers  are nearly barbaric in the novel; they still cannot be played like the North  Carolina branch of Faulkner's vicious, inbred Snopes family, or the film and  its relationships are in deep trouble.  </P> <P> Ehle has written with the utmost precision, neatly delineating country people  and their beautiful, oppressive surroundings with loving attention. It's  important that the Campbell and Wright patriarchs be imposing, nuanced figures.  Kotcheff slurps effects onto his canvas with strokes broad enough to cover a  barn.  </P> <P> And what, in heaven's name, attracted Kurt Russell to a role where he could be  upstaged by a 10-year-old, by an imitation Rainmaker or by a raving backwoods  madman?)  </P> <P> The melodrama does plays itself out with an uncommon number of unexpected  twists. However, Collie's extraordinary decision near the close of the story  snaps what credulity we may still be hanging onto. It's an essentially literary  device that may hold up better on a page than on a screen. Or better on any  page than on this screen.  </P> <P> Collie's action is like an inversion of the famous Faulkner story in "Knight's  Gambit," which became the poignant film "Tomorrow" and may -- still -- contain  one of Robert Duvall's greatest performances. It centers around a lovingly  raised child taken over by a brutish, vicious family. Because of the way the  Campbells have been drawn here, Collie's act, difficult enough to understand  under any circumstances, becomes absolutely unthinkable.  </P> <P> Finally, in a last indignity, the film makers graft a  sunshine-through-the-tears ending onto Ehle's stoic, entirely fitting  conclusion, a horse-trading session between the patriarchs which conveys  continuity, birthright and dynasty. (Writer Sobieski cannot be entirely removed  from responsibility here, since she was also the supervising producer, under  the principal producer, Robert Solo.)  </P> <P> "The Winter People" (rated PG-13 for some of its brutality and rough language)  is nevertheless a handsomely realized production. Its production designer Ron  Foreman has made details like Gudger's store realistic but never quaint; the  work of cinematographer Francois Protat ("The Hitchhiker," "Joshua Then and  Now") is exquisite and subdued without calling attention it itself, as is the  succinct work of editor Thom Noble.  </P> <P> And given the improbable demands of her part, McGillis makes a heroic Collie,  although the notion of her wild unbridled passion for the baby's ruttish father  seems to fall a little short of, say, Cathy's for Heathcliff. For my money, the  movie's most intriguing performance is by the young, matter-of-fact Amelia  Burnette who, in the freezing cold, manages lines like "I can't move my  fingers" without a hint of whining. Atta girl.  </P></p>

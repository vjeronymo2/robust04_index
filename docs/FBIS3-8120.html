Imports increased by 15.7 percent last  year, reaching $3,707 million, while exports grew by as little  as 5.4 percent to U.S.$3,654 million. In 1993 Bulgaria's  commercial exchanges rose by 10.3 percent, reaching U.S.$7,362  million, Institute of Trade research shows.    The steepest decline of 30 percent from 1992 affected  Bulgarian exports to the Arab world. Exports to EFTA [European  Free Trade Association] countries fell by 9.5 percent, and those  to Central and Eastern Europe by 5.4 percent from 1992.    Goods worth about U.S.$1,500 million, delivered to Bulgaria  from Central and Eastern Europe, accounted for 40.1 percent of  total imports. Deliveries from the EU, worth U.S.$1,167  million, contributed 31.5 percent to total imports.    Last year Bulgaria trade was most imbalanced with Central  and  Eastern Europe ($217 million deficit), the EU ($169.1 million)  and the EFTA countries (U.S.$93.8 million).    The CIS is still Bulgaria's main market, in spite of the  sharp fall of Bulgarian exports to it. To Russia alone,  Bulgaria shipped goods worth U.S.$408.4 million. High tariffs  and taxes as well as the lack of interbank links are the major  obstacles to trade with East European countries, Ivan Kolev,  head of the Transition Economies Department of the Ministry of  Trade, believes.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS EXXON OIL CLEANSER  </P> <P> Scientists have concluded that a kerosene-based chemical Exxon Corp. concocted  to remove oil from Alaskan beaches doesn't work.  </P> <P> A review committee determined that Corexit 9580MS generally is harmless to  marine life but is of little value in lifting oil from rocky shorelines.  </P> <P> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Monday that the  substance will not be approved for use on crude oil spilled when the Exxon  Valdez ran onto a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24.  </P> <P> The review committee, made up of representatives from state and federal  agencies involved in the cleanup, has looked at hundreds of chemicals and  cleanup techniques but so far hasn't found anything better than the  high-pressure washing that is becoming less effective as the oil weathers and  hardens.  </P></p>

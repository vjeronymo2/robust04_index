			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Cary Huang, China editor] </F>   [Text] Shocked by alarming economic data for the first  quarter of this year, China's cabinet has decided to reimpose  its austerity program in an attempt to check the runaway economy.    The austerity measures initiated by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji  last June, but largely lifted later due to pressure from senior  leader Deng Xiaoping, would be reimposed, the State Council said  in a recent circular.    Besides reviving the original 16 measures, the government  has  also banned new investment in fixed assets and banned further  expansion of approved projects, expansion of new economic and  technology zones, and the expansion of those zones already  approved. It has also banned land auctions by local government  agencies for commercial buildings, villas, and luxury  residential housing or the further expansion of such projects  that have already been approved.    Economic analysts said both Hong Kong business and the  mainland economy would be affected by the revival of the tough  policies.    In the circular, the government said the economic  rectification measures introduced in the middle of last year  would continue because the policies had not yet achieved their  objectives in full. Admitting that the economy was now on the  brink of being overheated, the central government called on  regional governments, economic agencies, and financial  institutions to work together to check uncontrolled growth.    Prompted by alarming figures for the first quarter of the  year, the State Council and the Communist Party's central  leading group on finance and the economy called a joint meeting  recently to discuss measures to rescue the fragile economy,  Chinese sources said.    The circular said statistics in the past months showed that  three major economic indicators had been broken by great  margins, which it said was a dangerous signal.    The government had set three major economic targets for  overall economic development this year:    The annual gross national product growth rate should be 9  per  cent, of which the industrial output growth rate should be 10.2  per cent.    Consumer price inflation should be maintained at less than  10  per cent.    Total capital investment should be kept to 1,300 billion  yuan  (HK$1.16 trillion), an increase of about 9 per cent over last  year.    However, statistics showed industrial output had increased  18.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year and 20 per cent  in April; the overall price index had risen about 20 per cent,  with 35 leading cities at 26 per cent, and investment had  increased by 40 per cent, 31 percentage points higher than the  state plan called for.    Mr Zhu unveiled a 16-point austerity plan in June last year  which was aimed at tightening credit, attaining financial  discipline and monetary order and laying down precise directions  on economic growth. The controversial plan was largely undone a  few months later after a remark by reclusive leader Deng  Xiaoping, who apparently favoured a faster pace of reform and  growth. He said that only a certain pace of development would  pass the test of truth.    Mr Zhu's program, which included raising interests rates,  calling in speculative loans, and cutting government  administrative spending by 20 per cent, was a mixture of methods  from China's old planned command-economy and from the new  market-oriented system. It demanded: Forced bond sales,  rolling back an earlier market reform experiment; suspension of  new price-reform measures; a ban on most new government imports  of cars and smaller investment projects; and an end to dubious  fundraising schemes.    The current circular said the revival of the austerity  measures was aimed at containing the three major economic  indicators, saying it was the major task for government  departments and economic officials at all levels. "Local  governments and economic officials at all levels should work  hard to contain the situation from further deterioration," a  Chinese economic source quoted the circular as saying.</p>

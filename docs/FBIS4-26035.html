			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that Sino-French relations have improved greatly  and turned in a new direction since the recent visit to China by  the French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.    Li made the remarks while meeting this afternoon with  Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of the French-China Committee,  a French institution designated for promoting trade and economic  cooperation with China.    Desgeorges, once chairman of the French electric company  Alsthom- Atlantic, has made great efforts to enhance power  cooperation between China and France.    Li expressed his appreciation over the efforts Desgeorges  and  other French friends made toward improving bilateral relations  when the relations met difficulties.    On Sino-French economic cooperation, Li said that the two  countries may increase cooperation on projects with a smaller  scale of investment besides joining efforts on large projects.    Desgeorges said his committee will make greater efforts to  enhance exchanges and cooperation in the fields of trade and  economy between France and China.</p>

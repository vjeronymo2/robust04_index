			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRL PULLED FROM POOL HOME FROM HOSPITAL; OLDER SISTER STILL IN COMA  </P> <P> One of two girls pulled from a back-yard swimming pool Wednesday was released  from the hospital Friday, but her comatose sister remained in critical  condition with little hope of recovery.  </P> <P> Three-year-old Robyn Newkirk left St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center  Friday with her parents, three days after she was pulled out of her  grandmother's pool in Fullerton, authorities said.  </P> <P> Rescuers revived Robyn and her 5-year-old sister, Randi, who was found on the  bottom of the pool. Randi, who is breathing with the help of a respirator,  remains in critical condition at Childrens Hospital of Orange County.  </P> <P> Clint Walker, the family's pastor, said the parents are "holding up real well  for what they are going through."  </P> <P> He said the family has received an outpouring of support from family and  friends throughout the country. "People they don't even know have been calling  to say their prayers are with them," Walker said.  </P> <P> The parents declined to talk about the incident.  </P> <P> "Right now they are concerned about Randi's condition," he said. "In the next  few days, things should become more clear."  </P></p>

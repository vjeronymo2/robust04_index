			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Trading volume was no more than moderate in derivatives markets yesterday but activity in stock index futures offered opportunities for arbitrage activity, writes Terry Byland. Traders identified two of the big US investment banks as present in London's stock index futures trades yesterday, Salomon said to have been a seller and Goldman Sachs a buyer. US selling hit the June future on the Footsie as soon as trading started, and a healthy premiumm of some 12 points to the cash market was quickly trimmed to around 8 points; fair value, the premium allowing for financing and dividends, stands at 3 points. A premium of around 15 points was reopened later. Locals, or independent traders, seized the chance to arbitrage between futures and cash. However, the futures premium quickly shrank and the final reading of 3,132 on the June contract was virtually in line with fair value. Volume, including after-hours' business, totalled 12,434 lots. Traded option activity was headed by British Steel, with 6,005 contracts representing a call-spread in the October option; traders said it was a neutral deal for the market. Total volume for options was 28,028 contracts, compared with 42,093 on Friday.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Criminal injuries scheme attacked The government yesterday rejected calls for changes to the criminal injuries compensation scheme, in spite of Labour's warnings that thousands of victims would be worse off because of it. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, acknowledged that some claimants would get less compensation under the new scheme. But he said at least 54 per cent would get as much or more and receive their award more quickly. Labour's appeal for the new compensation scheme to be withdrawn was defeated by 296 votes to 269, a government majority of 27.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T INCREASES ITS DIVIDEND FOR 1ST TIME SINCE DIVESTITURE IN 1984  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Wednesday that its board raised the  company's quarterly dividend to 33 cents per share from 30 cents -- the first  time AT&amp;T has lifted its payout since the Bell System was broken up in  1984.  </P> <P> Chairman Robert E. Allen said the increase reflects the company's confidence  that 1990 "will be another year of revenue and profit growth."  </P> <P> The company's stock, the most widely held in the United States, rose 12.5 cents  to close at $41.875 a share. AT&amp;T has 2.6 million registered shareholders  and 1.1 billion shares outstanding.  </P> <P> The higher quarterly dividend is payable May 1 to shareholders of record March  30.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T set an annual dividend of $1.20 when it divested its seven regional  Bell telephone companies in 1984. Since then, it has faced long-distance  competition from newcomers to the business, such as MCI Communications Corp.  and US Sprint.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T Vice Chairman Morris Tanenbaum said last week that the  telecommunications giant, whose long-distance market share declined to about  66% in 1989 from about 90% at divestiture, will work to stem the erosion.  </P></p>

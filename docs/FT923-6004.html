			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Technology: No such thing as plain sailing - British Entrepreneurs / Louise Kehoe concludes a series by observing the differences between US and UK risk-takers To British high-technology entrepreneurs, the grass seems much greener on the other side of the Atlantic. American start-up companies, they believe, enjoy big advantages over their UK counterparts. Yet from a US perspective, the struggle to build a new business is fraught with difficulties that Europeans seldom face. While there are more high-technology start-ups in the US, a greater number of them fail. Perhaps because failed ventures are more common, they are more readily accepted in the US. Fear of failure is cited again and again by British entrepreneurs as one of the greatest barriers to the formation of new UK ventures. 'You have got to be able to take risks, knowing that some of them won't pay off and that you will learn from things that go wrong,' says Michael Skok, founder of European Software Publishing, based in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Unlike the UK, stigma seldom attaches to the failure of a new venture in the US and the people involved will, in many cases, return to the same investors with a new business plan. Still, on both sides of the Atlantic, the entrepreneur with a good track record stands a better chance of raising money, says Bob Jones, a data communications specialist who recently raised Pounds 2.1m in the UK and US for his latest venture, Sonix Communications, based in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Jones, who previously founded two other companies, followed the American pattern, seeking out venture capitalists with knowledge of the data communications market. This led him to Schroder Ventures in London and to Greylock Management in the US, which has made its first UK investment in Sonix. For Sonix, having the backing of venture groups with a strong reputation for IT funding provides credibility and a source of market expertise. This contrasts with the traditional British view that financiers are there simply to provide money. Raising money 'is tough on both sides of the water', explains Jones. Perhaps the greatest myth in the UK is that US start-ups have it easy when it comes to raising venture capital. Competition for venture funds in the US has become more intense over the past few years as funding has declined. While UK venture capitalists say they may see a dozen or so new business plans per month, their US counterparts are barraged with almost as many per week. It appears that the smaller number of British enterprises seeking venture capital may have a better chance of raising some money, although the amounts raised are significantly lower than in the US. In 1991, US venture capitalists invested Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 550m) in 465 computer and electronics companies, according to a survey by Technologic Partners of New York. In the UK, Pounds 101m was invested in 194 such companies, according to data from the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA). Overall patterns of British venture capital investing suggest that 'start-up and early-stage' funding is more readily available in the UK than in the US. The BVCA says that three-quarters of the Pounds 445m invested last year across all industry sectors (excluding management buyouts) went to companies that had not previously received any venture capital. By contrast, in the US more than 85 per cent of venture capital investments in the high-technology sector were second or subsequent rounds of financing. Thus entrepreneurs on both sides of the Atlantic complain about a dearth of venture capital. For the US entrepreneur the biggest challenge is to get a foot in the door, raising seed money for a new venture, while in the UK the common complaint is that companies are 'under-funded', which limits their growth potential. Antipathy towards the 'money men' seems to be a characteristic of entrepreneurs wherever they do business. British high-technology entrepreneurs charge that venture capitalists do not understand the capital requirements of their businesses and point to the large number of technology investment specialists in the US. In the US, however, one is more likely to hear the wrenching stories of entrepreneurs who have been ousted from the companies they have founded, to be replaced by venture capitalists. The 'hands-on' American venture capitalist is far less forgiving of an entrepreneur's lack of management skills. And while the British complain about the 'onerous terms' imposed by venture capital investors, such as the demand for preference shares with hefty dividend payments, it is in the US that venture capitalists have been dubbed 'vulture capitalist' for their alleged greed. Apart from the difficulties of raising money, British entrepreneurs generally agree that the regulatory environment in the UK is more favourable. In contrast, their US counterparts complain bitterly about becoming entangled in the bureaucratic red tape of employment and environmental regulations. While Peter Rigby, founder of Computer Specialist Holdings in Birmingham, is proud to share the story of a former telephonist who has become his top sales manager, Ray Fortune, president of Ultra Network Technologies, in California, expresses exasperation over the hoops that he has had to jump through to reclassify the job of a valued secretary and provide her with access to share options. One of the biggest challenges facing ambitious British high-technology manufacturers is cracking the US market. While most are convinced that it is important to establish a beachhead in the US, they lack the resources needed for a large-scale assault. Viewed from 'over there', however, the problem is equally daunting. Unlike the British start-up company, which can begin life by addressing the 'home' market, a fledgling US company rarely has the option of establishing its reputation on a regional basis. Neither do US companies find the transatlantic crossing painless. Many are naive in their approach to the European market, taking at face value the prospects of a 'single market' and failing to recognise at first that within Europe each national market has its own unique characteristics. British entrepreneurs are at least better placed to assess the challenge. One of the most striking differences between start-ups in the UK and those in the US is that most business founders in the UK are British. Not so in the US, and particularly in the Silicon Valley high-technology enclave, where ambitious individuals from Europe and Asia figure high in the ranks of business builders. Also noticeable in the UK is the relative lack of experience of the British high-technology entrepreneur. While some of America's most famous entrepreneurs are start-lingly young, the majority have a long career in established companies behind them. Another glaring difference is that American entrepreneurs rapidly learn the value of 'blowing their own trumpets'. Some of the largest US venture capital groups maintain close links with public relations agencies that promote start-up companies. Call it British reserve, or a lack of marketing expertise; whatever the cause, the result is that few small British high-technology ventures get the recognition that they deserve. While entrepreneurs complain that they are not valued in British society, they fail to recognise that the acclaim afforded to their American counterparts is not automatic. It costs money. In both countries, the building of high-technology winners is a gruelling and expensive business with uncertain returns. The US high-technology industry has a more firmly-entrenched process of business development, but the route that its entrepreneurs must follow is still an uphill struggle. For the British entrepreneur who must cut out his own path, it may be some comfort to know that nobody else has found a short cut to success.

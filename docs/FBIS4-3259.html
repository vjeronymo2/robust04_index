			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Renfang (6392 0088 2455)] </F>   [Text] Newark, 16 Apr (XINHUA) -- Song Jian, Chinese state  councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and  Technology Commission, met with Chinese scientists and  technicians in the United States at the Marriott Hotel, Newark,  New Jersey State, on 16 April. He briefed them on the progress  of China's high-technology industry.    Addressing representatives from the Chinese Engineers  Society  of America [CESA] and the American Association of Chinese  Scientists and Technicians [AACST], Song Jian said: In  comparison to world standards, China's high-technology industry  is still relatively backward. However, since China carried out  reform and opening up, its high-technology industry has  developed very rapidly. At present, China has established 52  new and high-technology zones with 50,000 personnel working in  more than 40,000 high-technology companies and enterprises.  Therefore, overseas scholars are able to find partners for  joint-ventures [he zuo dui xiang 0678 0155 1417 6272] in fields  including agriculture, electric power, law, biomedicine, and  intellectual property rights.    Song Jian arrived in New York on 14 April after attending  the  sixth session of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology  Cooperation Joint Committee in Washington. Hosting the  reception for Song Jian today were the CESA and AACST which are  two relatively large Chinese scientific and technological  organizations in the United States. Their respective members  mainly consist of scholars who came from both sides of the  Taiwan Strait.    Attending the meeting were famous scientists Pan Wenyuan,  Deng Wenzhong, and Wang Shaoguang, and Chinese Consul General in  New York Zhang Weichao. At the end, Song Jian became the AACST  honorary adviser upon request.    According to Zhang Ping, official of the Chinese Consulate  General in New York, Song Jian also met with representatives  from the New York Securities Stock Exchange Commission, the  Morgan Company, and the Meilin [5019 2651] Company this morning.  They discussed issues on integrating financial investments and  new technology industry, and chances and formats of entering  China's markets.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Sell-off begins in Volgograd AUTHORITIES in the Russian city of Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, yesterday began auctioning off large and medium-sized enterprises as part of the government's mass privatisation campaign. Some 350,000 shares - representing for the most part minority stakes after the acquisition of majority stakes by employees - were put on offer in exchange for privatisation vouchers distributed to every citizen. Bids for shares close in three weeks. Enterprises in the first of 200 planned offerings in the southern city include a tractor plant which produced tanks during the Second World War, a margarine factory, a brewery and an aluminium plant.</p>

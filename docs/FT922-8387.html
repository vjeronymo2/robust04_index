			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / British Rail holds up the Euston Stagecoach THE TRAIN arriving at London Euston's Platform One from Aberdeen every morning is the first regular privately operated passenger service to run on British Rail since nationalisation in 1948. But some things never change. The inaugural train, bearing public transport minister Mr Roger Freeman as passenger of honour, pulled in yesterday in much the same fashion as any ordinary BR train: 12 minutes late. In fairness, no blame could be attached to Stagecoach, the entrepreneurial bus operator providing the service. So far, its two carriages are merely appended to BR's existing sleeper service, so passengers remain at the mercy of BR timekeeping. Stagecoach stepped in when BR decided to drop seat-only accommodation on night trains between London and Aberdeen. It has taken over the seat-only carriages, repainting them in its own livery. Hostesses provide Stagecoach customers with a free hot meal in the evening, unlimited soft drinks and beverages (but strictly no alcohol) through the night and a bap with butter and jam for breakfast. Some fares are lower, too. BR charges Pounds 57 for a one-way ticket between London and Edinburgh, plus Pounds 25 for a sleeper berth. The price for Stagecoach's seat-only tickets, which can be bought from BR, is Pounds 33.50. On the inaugural run the worst advertisement for de-regulation turned out to be the minister himself. Under close questioning, Mr Freeman confessed that he had slipped away from the private-sector part of the train to grab a few hours' rest in the comfort of a public-sector sleeping compartment. 'I've got a full day's work in front of me,' he remarked, somewhat testily. 'I am 50 years old and I didn't feel like sitting up all night.'</p>

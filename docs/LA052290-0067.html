			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA SEEKS BOOST IN USE OF WELLS TO EASE DROUGHT  </P> <P> The city of Ventura could make up nearly 75% of its water shortage if the  Regional Groundwater Management Assn. would relax regulations and allow the  city to pump more water out of the Santa Paula Basin, city officials said  Monday.  </P> <P> Vice Mayor Don Villenueve said a study on solutions to the city's acute water  crisis have determined that the city could obtain up to 4,800 additional  acre-feet of water each year by completing work on a well under construction in  Saticoy and by increasing the productivity of the city's well near the Olivas  golf course on the east end of the city.  </P> <P> One acre-foot of water typically takes care of the yearly water needs of a  family of four.  </P> <P> However, the city is under instructions by the regional ground-water board to  reduce usage of ground water by 5%, Villenueve said. "They would have to  approve our expansion of ground-water usage on an emergency basis," Villenueve  said.  </P> <P> In a related development, the city's public information office announced that  the city had cut back its monthly water use from 21 million gallons a day to  16.1 million gallons a day between April 12 and May 11, compared to the same  period last year.  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Romania purges local officials Romania's minority left-wing government has removed 15 mayors and 12 other local elected officials, accusing them of abusing their power and mismanaging public money, the state news agency Rompres said yesterday. The unprecedented wave of sackings, which hit many opposition figures, immediately drew denunciations from opposition parties. The government accused the officials, including the mayor of Bucharest, of 'grave infringements of the law', which included the mismanagement of funds derived from land leases. But the opposition National Peasant party called the sackings 'illegal and abusive'.</p>

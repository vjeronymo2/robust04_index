			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI, SOVIET SCHOOL PROPOSE JOINT MBA PROJECT  </P> <P> Bringing profit to the land of perestroika -- where President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's reform policies have barely begun to penetrate the Soviet Union's  cumbersome bureaucracy -- will be no easy task.  </P> <P> But it is one that Dennis Aigner, dean of the UCI Graduate School of  Management, is looking forward to.  </P> <P> Aigner, in what would be the first program of its kind, is proposing to  establish a joint two-year graduate program for students from UC Irvine and  Moscow State University.  </P> <P> The students would spend a year in each country learning techniques to use in  operating the kinds of joint Soviet-American business ventures cropping up  under the new freedom that glasnost -- openness -- has meant in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The UC Irvine students, Aigner said, would get a close look at just how the  Soviet system works, and the Soviets would be exposed to such un-Marxist ideas  as profit, marketing and customer service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program Intended for Young  </P> <P> Although there are already a number of Soviet-U.S. exchange programs, the one  envisioned by Aigner and his Moscow State University counterpart, Oleg  Vihanskiy, head of the school's new Department of Management, would be the only  one to award an MBA accredited by a major U.S. university.  </P> <P> Besides offering a joint MBA, the UC Irvine-Moscow State University program  would also be the first intended for what Aigner called "the young ones" --  students just completing undergraduate studies, rather than for experienced  managers who may have deeply ingrained habits.  </P> <P> Aigner said he and Vihanskiy want the program to develop a generation of  "outward-thinking" Soviets who will enter their nation's management system and  energize its notoriously stodgy bureaucracy.  </P> <P> The agreement for a two-year Soviet-American MBA program was worked out by  Aigner and Vihanskiy during a recent 16-day study trip to the Soviet Union made  by Aigner and four Orange County business executives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soviet Inquiries  </P> <P> Aigner actually began working on the idea nine months ago, when he learned that  a delegation of Soviet academics was in San Francisco and inquiring about  academic exchange programs.  </P> <P> "I intercepted them and flew them to Irvine and we began talking," Aigner said.  The idea of a joint graduate degree program was first raised in March, he said,  when an important Soviet economist was visiting UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Aigner said the program must be approved by the UC Irvine curriculum committee  and also that the Graduate School of Management must find the money to pay for  the program. The only costs associated with the program would be paying the  expenses of the Soviet students during their year at Irvine (the agreement  calls for the Soviets to cover the expenses of the UC Irvine students during  their year in Moscow).  </P> <P> Aigner said he envisions an enrollment of about 20 students a year, 10 from  each school. He estimates the cost of supporting the Soviet students would be  about $120,000 a year.  </P> <P> Noting that there are dozens of local companies involved in trade with the  Soviet Union, Aigner said he hopes corporations will contribute money for the  program.  </P> <P> He said he has not yet begun pitching the program to officials at UC Irvine but  that he does not anticipate problems because the cost would be minimal. It will  be "embedded" in the regular MBA program and therefore will not require  additional instructors, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Agreements  </P> <P> Should the program be approved, Aigner said, the first classes will probably  meet in 1991.  </P> <P> In addition to the MBA program proposal, Aigner also brought back from his  Soviet trip a series of agreements with officials of other bodies. The Soviet  All-Union Economic Society and the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the  USA and Canada made agreements for annual student and faculty member exchanges  and for periodic study tours of the Soviet Union to be made by UC Irvine  students and local business executives.  </P></p>

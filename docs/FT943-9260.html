			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Value of foreign contracts rises The value of overseas construction contracts won by British companies jumped 16 per cent last year to Pounds 3.25bn. Orders were almost 50 per cent more than in 1991, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. The biggest rise was generated from other European Union countries, where orders increased from Pounds 70m in 1992 to Pounds 234m last year in spite of a general decline in European construction output. The department said the rise reflected successful attempts by British companies to break into EU markets through acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures rather than the award of any single big contract. The total value of European contracts, including those from non-EU countries, increased 48 per cent to Pounds 273m from Pounds 184m. There was also a big increase in Middle Eastern work where the value of new contracts increased to Pounds 400m from Pounds 235m. Sir Paul Beresford, construction minister, said: 'Most of the contracts were won against stiff competition in North America and the Far East, but it is also encouraging to see signs of increased success in Europe.' North America was the biggest single market for British contractors working overseas with the value of new contracts rising from Pounds 998m to Pounds 1.24bn - the first time since 1990 that orders from the region have topped Pounds 1bn. The rise reflected a general improvement in US construction markets where British companies have longstanding interests. Orders from the Far East, the world's fastest-growing construction market, fell last year to Pounds 752m from Pounds 862m. This reflected a slowing in the pace of contract awards for Hong Kong's new airport rather than any general loss of market share by British companies. The value of Hong Kong orders fell to Pounds 471m from Pounds 723m, a decline of 35 per cent. The value of work carried out by British contractors in Hong Kong rose last year to Pounds 409m from Pounds 190m, reflecting the high value of orders won in previous years. The value of work done by British companies in all international markets rose 18 per cent last year to Pounds 2.76bn from Pounds 2.33bn. At the end of the year British contractors had Pounds 3.39bn outstanding international orders, a 14 per cent increase on the Pounds 2.97bn at the end of the previous year. The increase in international contracts comes when UK construction orders have also been rising. The department said that domestic orders in the three months to the end of May were 12 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year, while the Pounds 2.1bn value of orders in May was the highest monthly total for four years.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: US still buyers of Saatchi ADVERTISING agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi continued to attract unusually large interest on the back of encouraging press reports about the general state of the industry in the US. More than 35m Saatchi shares were traded yesterday, and the price firmed a halfpenny to 17 1/4 p. Since last Wednesday more than 130m shares have been traded which, taking into consideration the double counting in recorded turnovers, represents over 4 per cent of the company's share capital. Observers are confident that the interest is motivated solely by optimism for economic and industry recovery, rather than by stakebuilding, although one analyst argued that buyers may be prematurely optimistic. 'There is light at the end of the tunnel, but it is an extremely long tunnel,' the analyst commented. Vickers volatile There was volatile trading in Vickers shares as the market responded to the company's full-year figures. The stock fell 10 initially on the loss of Pounds 12.4m, compared with a profit of Pounds 96.5m last year; the loss was slightly larger than analysts' forecasts. Sentiment was further weakened by a lack of news on the full or part disposal of the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary. The decline was halted after the analysts' meeting and the shares bounced as the market showed appreciation of the 6p dividend payment, which was at the top of the range of forecasts, as well as the probability of further tank orders, and the better cash flow position than had been expected. The shares ended 7 ahead on balance at 169p on turnover of 2.1m. Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'This is a very positive result, despite the continuing weakness in the Rolls-Royce business.' He forecast 1992 profits of Pounds 37m. Hanson saw heavy two-way business and closed a  1/4 firmer at 212 3/4 p with 9.7m shares traded. The buyers, who principally came from the US and appeared to be following a recent push by Goldman Sachs, were given added incentive yesterday with the publication of a weighty piece of research from County NatWest's conglomerates team, which looks at the company's long-term strategy. It argues that in spite of the low rating, negative feelings about the group are already discounted, that Hanson will receive great benefit from economic recovery and that any downside is protected by a large and safe yield. Food retailers were boosted by positive comments from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and James Capel. Argyll moved ahead 9 to 327p, J. Sainsbury 11 to 391p and Tesco 9 to 260p. Guinness rose 18 to 594p on lack of stock and strong demand. Grand Metropolitan climbed 5 to 949p before today's annual meeting. Allied-Lyons, up 8 at 594p, is to buy Modern Maid Products, a US food coating concern, from Dalgety for Pounds 23m. Brewers were generally firm, including Bass, up 9 at 557p on turnover of 2.7m. After a visit to Bass on Friday, BZW said it was very happy with a profits forecast of Pounds 580m for the year to September 1992 and reiterated its buy recommendation. Leisure group Ladbroke continued to attract attention ahead of its results, due in two weeks, gaining 4 to 229p in moderate turnover of 2.2m. Rank Organisation, which went ex the dividend yesterday, surprised some observers by shaking off last week's dip in its price, the shares firming 8 to 665p. Forte rose 1 to 231p. Euro Disney again celebrated its inclusion, in three weeks time, to the CAC 40 index in Paris, the shares gaining 18 to 1573p. Power generators PowerGen and National Power were firmer with the market, and also in reflection of a long-term buy note from SG Warburg. PowerGen put on 6 to 228p and National Power 6 to 219p. The improved political climate for the Conservatives sent water shares higher. Northumbrian Water added 5 at 391p, Severn Trent 6 at 341p and Thames Water 7 at 378p. Renewed optimism over the economic and political outlook, combined with positive reflection from last week's figures from Lloyds Bank, boosted the banking sector. NatWest, which reports today, advanced 11 to 303p as fears over a rights issue receded. Analyst Mr Steven Thorn at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said Lloyds' capital ratio figures were significantly better than had been expected, and the market is hoping NatWest will follow suit. Barclays, which was unaffected by yesterday's Swaps court ruling, rose on the general sentiment in the sector by 11 to 398p. Support ahead off the full-year results, which are due today, helped SmithKline Beecham units to improve 15 to 4150p, although the 'A' shares were flat at 928p. ICI appreciated 22 to 1317p ahead of full-year results expected on Thursday. The stock was also said to have received some support from a strategic note by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Glaxo, which went ex a 6p dividend yesterday, declined 6 to 813p, with some UK doubts still lingering from last week's results. Also, Merck, the US company which Glaxo tends to follow, had fallen by Dollars 1 in the previous session on Wall Street. Turnover in BP increased sharply after Wall Street opened. The shares started quietly in London at the day's low of 255p, but finished only 1/2 off at 258p following good US buying. Volume was little more than 5m shares in the early afternoon, but 18m by the close. Both BP and Shell went ex-dividend yesterday, with Shell losing 3 to 445p. Speculation in the weekend press that British Aerospace was to hive off its business jet and property operations, a move which could raise Pounds 650m for the company, helped the shares remain firm as the company made a 16.1p dividend payment. The stock finished 6 up at 300p. Bargain hunters continued in Tiphook, helping the shares end 33 ahead at 345p on healthy turnover of 2.7m. Initial disappointment at NFC's first-quarter results released on Sunday gave rise to early selling and the shares closed 9 lower at 230p. Hopes of an economic recovery over the past year have been largely shadowed by the banks sector, as it has tried to move out of recession. A year ago, the sector received a boost from the leading banks' results, which were better than expected. A tight UK Budget and pessimistic economic outlook pulled the sector down through the early summer, but it rallied on recovery hopes in July and August. These had receded by September and the banks index fell away. Since then, political uncertainty ahead of the general election, with worries over dividends and provisions, have prompted volatility.

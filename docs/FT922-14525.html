			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Coalition terms will test Liberal Democrat mettle MR PADDY Ashdown admitted yesterday that 'difficulties and tensions' would be created in Liberal Democrat ranks by the party's tough terms for a coalition government in a hung parliament. Reiterating his demand for a commitment to proportional representation in the first session of the new parliament, Mr Ashdown acknowledged that 'the mettle of my party, and the parliamentary party, will be tested'. He also warned on London Weekend Television's Walden programme that, if a second general election were necessary, 'it'll be better that it would be sooner rather than later. At least we would get over the period of unstable, weak government.' He accepted he might be blamed for causing a second contest but denied that the pressures on Liberal Democrat MPs would be intolerable. His comments came amid signs of growing realisation among prominent members of the party that a hung parliament would hold considerable danger, possibly wrecking Liberal Democrat unity. 'Part of the reason why nobody has gone out banging on for a hung parliament is that it is full of pitfalls and problems,' admitted one party strategist. Mr Ashdown has been able to reconcile the comments of senior colleagues with his own stance, but differences of emphasis are evident. Scottish Liberal Democrats, including Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president, and Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, have hinted they would be happy with a less fierce commitment to proportional representation. Many of the Scottish Liberal Democrat former MPs put greater emphasis on Scottish devolution rather than Westminster reform. The Liberal Democrat terms for a coalition government were thrashed out and agreed by the parliamentary party well before the general election. During the campaign, however, Mr Ashdown has had only brief conversations with most of his former parliamentary colleagues. Yesterday he tried to increase the pressure on Labour and the Tories to form a coalition government, while simultaneously remaining firm on his terms for a deal. He called for a 'partnership' working at all levels of government, including cabinet posts for Liberal Democrats. In a party election broadcast last night, Mr Ashdown urged 'the kind of government that has made Germany so strong'. He promised to make compromises and to work for an agreement, but 'we will definitely insist . . . that this should be the last election held on an unfair and out-of-date voting system'. Speaking on LWT, Mr Ashdown warned that if neither Labour nor the Tories formed a coalition 'you would have six months of a minority government - weak, unable to tackle the problems of the recession, with money markets dropping and interest rates rising. Now that is a devastating scenario.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 7323.99.90: Table, kitchen or other household articles and parts thereof, of iron or steel . . . : [o]ther: [o]ther: [n]ot coated or plated with precious metal: [o]ther: [o]ther. . . .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> The general, column one rate of duty is 3.4 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> 8505.19.00: Electromagnets; permanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization. . . : [p]ermanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization: [o]ther. . . .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 --> The general, column one rate of duty is 4.9 percent ad valorem.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Because the article was a composite good consisting of metal, ceramic, textile, and/or plastic, it was prima facie classifiable under two or more headings. Customs would then apply GRI 3(b) to determine the essential character of the article.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) constitute the Customs Cooperation Council's official interpretation of the HTSUS. While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> T.D. 89&hyph;80, 54 FR 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN VIII to GRI 3(b) states as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [t]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the rulings issued, Customs concluded that the magnet imparts the essential character to the article. The plastic, textile or ceramic portion of the article merely embellished the article and acted as a decorative selling feature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Customs precluded classification of the article under heading 8505, HTSUS, which specifically provides for permanent magnets based upon a portion of EN 85.05. EN 85.05, page 1341, states in pertinent part as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [t]his heading does not cover: [e]lectro-magnets, permanent magnets or magnetic devices of this heading, when presented with machines, apparatus, toys, games, etc., of which they are designed to form part (classified with those machines, apparatus, etc.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon this portion of EN 85.05, we held that the magnets were designed to form part of the article. It was concluded that because the magnets are presented with and incorporated into a textile, ceramic or plastic article (i.e., a hook, fruit caricature or advertising slogan), they are precluded from classification in heading 8505, HTSUS. Because the essential character of the article is the magnet, the article would then be classified based upon the composition of the magnet as an article of metal under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading 6912, HTSUS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several rulings were issued following this rationale.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HQs 082500, 083130, 083133, 083134, 089332, 089333, 089760; NYs 860370, 862523. This list may not be exhaustive. There may be others issued by Customs in New York or in the various Customs districts under the pre-entry classification procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33320), Customs furnished notice that the classification of the subject merchandise was under review and requested comments from interested parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only two submissions were received in response to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice. While both agreed to the proposed change of position, they each provided a substantive discussion of the legal issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Articles consisting of small metal or barium ferrite magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing (sometimes referred to as refrigerator or household magnets) are eo nomine provided for under heading 8505 as magnets, based upon GRI 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  O.C.O.D. 89&hyph;1, 23 Cust. Bull. 36, dated September 6, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs disagrees that the subject merchandise is classifiable under GRI 1. Magnets entered unattached to any other object are eo nomine classifiable under heading 8505, HTSUS. Magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing are prima facie classifiable under headings 8505, 3926, 6307, or 6912, HTSUS, respectively. Because the subject merchandise is comprised of two or more articles classified under separate headings, classification cannot be determined by use of GRI 1. Therefore, GRI 3 must be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, O.C.O.D. 89&hyph;1 was issued as guidelines on the proper interpretation and application of GRI 1 to classify merchandise to the importing community. Since the enactment of the HTSUS, Customs has consistently issued binding rulings which set forth the proper interpretation of articles which are prima facie classifiable in two or more headings under the HTSUS according to GRI 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

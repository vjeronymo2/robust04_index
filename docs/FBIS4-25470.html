			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Exchange Rate Reform Won't Hurt Imports"] </F>   [Text] The unification of China's dual track exchange rate  will not affect the volume of the country's imports, said a  foreign trade official.    As the nation continues to develop, there will be an  increase  in both exports and imports, said Liu Xiangdong, Vice-Minister  of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.    Liu told an economic reform seminar at the 5th Asia-Pacific  International Trade Fair that China is keen to increase its  export earnings in order to import more advanced technology,  equipment and materials needed for the country's modernization  drive.    Import costs, tariffs and turnover tax have increased in  line  with the unification of the exchange rates, he said.    But imports will not be affected because the current  exchange  rate is similar to the old swap market rate used to calculate 80  per cent of the imports.    And the State has increased its budget to subsidize the  remaining 20 per cent of the imports using the old official  exchange rate.    And to counteract the slight increase in tariffs and  turnover  tax the State has this year reduced tariff rates of 2,898 import  items by an average of 8.8 per cent.    Moreover, with China's impending re-entry of the General  Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the overall level of  import tariffs will be reduced by 50 per cent compared with 1992  levels.    In a separate development, Yu Xiaosong, vice-minister of the  State Economic and Trade Commission, told the seminar that the  Chinese government is formulating policies to encourage foreign  investment with special focus on China's key industries.    Yu said the government will grant preferential treatment to  foreign investment in the development and construction of basic  industries and infrastructure such as transportation,  communications, energy, key raw materials, agriculture and water  conservancy.</p>

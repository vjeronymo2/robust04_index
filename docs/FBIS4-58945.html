			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Washington, 10 May (MENA)--Field Marshal Muhammad  Husayn Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, has  stated that his talks with U.S. officials during his current  visit to Washington will deal with important issues, primarily  the development of military cooperation between the United  States and Egypt, the Egyptian Armed Forces' needs, and the  modernization of armaments, in addition to issues pertaining to  regional security and Egypt's role in achieving the region's  security.    Speaking at a meeting with Egyptian correspondents in  Washington, Field Marshal Tantawi said: In view of the changes  dictated by the new world order, there is a constant need to  develop and strengthen the Egyptian Armed Forces in the  armaments and training fields. He added: Our Armed Forces  should maintain a particular standard of strength and efficiency  to play their role in establishing regional security in  participation with the international community. He stressed  that achieving this will be an investment in human resources,  which will benefit society in every field.    The defense minister noted that the Armed Forces are  constantly working to introduce advanced technology and modern  training and armament systems and that this will be among the  issues he will discuss in his meetings with U.S. officials.    Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi said: The Egyptian  Armed Forces belong to the Egyptian people alone. According to  this concept, the Armed Forces serve the Egyptian people and  their development is an extremely important investment. The  stronger these Armed Forces are the more capable they will be of  protecting society and the homeland from any aggression.    The defense minister stressed that strengthening the Armed  Forces will make them a deterrent force that others would have  to consider, because any aggressor will have to think deeply  before committing any aggression if he realizes that these  forces can repel him.    Field Marshal Tantawi went on to say that U.S.-Egyptian  cooperation in the military production sphere, both with regard  to the advanced M1A tanks and other weapons, is proceeding well  and that there are numerous opportunities for developing and  expanding the scope of this cooperation.

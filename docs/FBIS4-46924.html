			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Gavrilina: "Soldiers, Gallant Fellows, </F> Where Is Your Conscience?"]    [Text] "The Basics of Security and Vital Activity" is the  subject now being taught in many schools. You will guess at  once that under this name one can infer the formerly named  "basic military preparation [NVP]." Employees of the city draft  board responsible for educational work consider that it is  necessary to resurrect this subject, since the absence of NVP is  one of the reaons for the poor results of the callup.    The draft board polled the draftees. Twenty percent of those  questioned would willingly enter the Army; 15.7 percent intended  to avoid it in any way possible; 33 percent would enter service,  but without enthusiasm. The rest perferred not to express  themselves.    Among the motives expressed by the "draft dodgers," the  youths' fear for their life if assigned to "hot spots"  dominated. Other reasons named were domestic disorder and the  low prestige of army service.    Therefore, jointly with the city authorities, it is planned  to implement a large-scale program for preparing youth for  service in the Armed Forces. Military-patriotic education  occupies first place in this program.    However, in all probability draftees and their parents are  more worried about such things as health, security and the  possibility of completing their education. Letters read at a  press conference held yesterday by acting city draft  commissioner Vladimir Davydov attest to this.    Despite the fact that 11 draft dodgers were sentenced last  year and 177 criminal suits are still ongoing, those subect to  callup are not hurrying to the draft board.    From the point of view of the city draft board the Army is  not at fault. New recruits are sent to "hot spots" only with  their agreement. Draftees from the North-West region,  particularly married ones, as a rule remain in that region. Mr.  Pichikov, a representative of the military-medical commission,  vowed that "the Army doesn't need sick men" and none of the  youths with medical problems would be forced to serve.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Shlomo </F> Ganor in Peres' office on 31 March -- recorded in Hebrew with  Arabic subtitles; processed from Hebrew]    [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Peres, does the agreement on security  arrangements in Hebron provide satisfactory answers to the  special situation and needs of the city?    [Peres] It stems from the special situation in the city, and  in my opinion it can alleviate the tension in the city, as well  as bring about the resumption and early conclusion of the Gaza  and Jericho talks.    [Ganor] Will this agreement serve as an example for other  agreements which could be implemented on the ground before the  autonomy is established?    [Peres] I do not think so. I hope there will be no need to  repeat this thing, meaning that there will be no more terrible  incidents such as at the Cave of the Patriarchs. I want to  state unequivocally that the Israeli Government alone is  responsible for security at the Cave of the Patriarchs and for  enabling Jewish and Muslim worshipers to pray freely and without  any danger to their lives. Not the settlers, guards, or anyone  else is responsible for security -- only we are. Naturally we  are interested in implementing arrangements which would permit  peaceful prayers. In future we will consult with the Waqf on  everything relating to the Muslim side, just as we have done in  the past.    [Ganor] What are the next steps, now that this agreement has  been signed?    [Peres] The main thing now is to facilitate the final part  of the Gaza and Jericho negotiations and to implement this  agreement soon. On the basis of the agreement achieved last  night, seven days following the signing of the agreement on  Hebron Palestinian police units are slated to start entering  Gaza. This is to all intents and purposes the beginning of the  agreement's implementation.    [Ganor] Does the Hebron agreement pave the way for  implementing the Gaza and Jericho agreement?    [Peres] Certainly. The negotiations on Gaza and Jericho  started the moment we reached agreement on Hebron. The Hebron  agreement was signed today at 1100; immediately after that the  Gaza and Jericho negotiations started. We will work ceaselessly  until these negotiations are completed. The implementation  stage will also be considerably accelerated.    [Ganor] Is there an understanding regarding the timetable  for the completion of the negotiations?    [Peres] Some people say it will take a week, others that it  will take two weeks. It depends on the rate of our work and on  the problems we encounter. If we find quick solutions to the  problems -- such as the problems of jurisdiction and authority  -- then the process will be very quick. If there are problems,  this could slow down the process.    [Ganor] Will Israel stick to the target date of 13 April?    [Peres] Israel will strive to honor this date -- whether the  13th, 14th, or 15th of April, the precise day does not matter so  much. Again, this depends on our not encountering serious or  unexpected problems. I hope things will run smoothly. My inner  feeling is that the PLO -- just like us -- is interested in  finally ending the negotiations and turning this into a reality.  This is the first time the Palestinian people will have a  concrete piece of reality, not merely a piece of paper, a  declaration, a congratulatory or condolences letter -- but  rather a territory, an authority, an administration, and  responsibility, as is proper.</p>

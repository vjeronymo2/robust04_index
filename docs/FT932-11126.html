			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / EC in change of heart on openness THE European Commission yesterday took steps to overturn its secretive policy on access to information, suggesting that most EC documents should be available to the public on demand. The move is part of the 'openness policy' through which the Community is trying to rebuild its credibility with European citizens. Foreign ministers of the Twelve will consider the proposals on Monday. They are likely to be refined before endorsement by EC heads of government at the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22. The proposals would turn EC policy on access to documents on its head. Although the Commission itself is a relatively permeable institution, the formal position until now, as one Dutch official put it, is that 'it's all secret unless we decide it isn't' Under the new dispensation, all documents would be public unless their diffusion prejudiced privacy, commercial confidentiality, national security or monetary stability. Between now and the Copenhagen summit there is likely to be considerable scrapping over grey areas of confidentiality. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner behind the plan, for instance, wants the working documents of the EC institutions - which reveal thinking on policy as it germinates - made public. Some member states and commissioners are bound to resist this. The proposal would bring EC institutions into line with the law in the Netherlands, France, Greece and, Denmark.</p>

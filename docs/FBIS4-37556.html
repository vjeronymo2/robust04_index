			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 18 (AFP) -- Foreign television programs  received by satellite have been jammed in Iran since Friday [17  June], viewers said here Saturday.  However the jamming of some 30 European, American and Asian  channels has not been publicly announced.    Viewers said programs received via the Asia-Sat and Arab-Sat  satellites had been garbled more or less depending on the  district, with parallel lines appearing on TV screens. The  jamming follows debate in Iran on whether or not to ban  satellite dishes, which have mushroomed on rooftops in Tehran  and other cities allowing up to two million people to view  foreign broadcasts.    Under pressure from Islamic conservatives and hardliners,  parliament is soon to debate the issue as part of moves to check  Western cultural influence. The jamming also came after Iranian  state television announced it would broadcast the World Cup live  from the United States in a bid to compete with the increasingly  popular satellite programs.    A newspaper reported here Thursday that in a crackdown on  "social corruption," authorities in Iran had seized 1,965  television satellite dishes destined for Iranian consumers.</p>

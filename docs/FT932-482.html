			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / India and China in border deal INDIA and China yesterday agreed to open an additional border trading post at Shipkilah in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, and agreed further confidence-building measures, such as increased transparency about the location of military positions, in order to maintain peace. The agreement was announced by Mr J N Dixit, the Indian foreign secretary, on the concluding day of the India-China joint working group talks between him and Mr Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese vice foreign minister, and senior officials from the defence ministries of both countries. At a news conference in New Delhi, Mr Dixit admitted that India and China had 'a difference of views' on the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. When India voiced concern about the supply of Chinese missiles to Pakistan, the Chinese delegation held that Beijing's policy of arms sales was not directed against India, and said the quantity of arms supplied to Islamabad had been 'small'. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, will visit China in the first week of September for further bilateral talks.</p>

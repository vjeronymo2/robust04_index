			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / SNP will conduct 'referendum' on home rule today AN unofficial 'referendum' on Scotland's constitutional future is being staged today by the Scottish National party in what it sees as a familiarisation exercise for the full-scale referendum it hopes will be staged next year. People will be asked to fill in a ballot paper offering a choice between the status quo, independence within the EC, and a devolved parliament. Choices will be numbered under a preferential voting system. 'We want to show how straightforward it will be to let the Scottish people decide their future,' said Dr Allan Macartney, SNP vice-president, 'and demonstrate the huge level of enthusiasm for the referendum initiative.' The party would not claim that the sample was representative. The SNP is using next Thursday's district council elections to campaign for a referendum. SNP-controlled district councils - Angus in Tayside is currently the only one - will be committed to trying to organise a referendum next year through the local-government machine, but funded from outside sources. Other opposition parties and Scotland United, a fringe cross-party anti-Tory grouping, also want a referendum. 'Scots have a second chance on May 7 to vote in the light of the general election campaign,' Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said yesterday. But the SNP's 'second chance' approach has been condemned by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who said in Edinburgh on Thursday: 'They are basically saying that April 9 was not good enough - 'you gave us the wrong answer, go out there and try again'. I think that is an outrage.' Local elections should be about local government, he said. The SNP has been encouraged by a System Three opinion poll in yesterday's Herald newspaper showing the party's support at 25 per cent, three points more than its vote in the general election. Labour was down three points on the election outcome at 36 per cent, the Tories were up one point at 26 per cent and the Liberal Democrats down one at 12 per cent.</p>

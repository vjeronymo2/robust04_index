			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by JB: "Hot Gas Filter Increases Effect"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt--The Center for Heterogeneous Analysis,  reg. assn. (Rudower Chaussee 5, 12489 Berlin) has developed a  hot gas filter to be used for desulfurization of coal gas. The  filter can be used in future combination power plants. It  consists of a ceramic filter coated with zinc oxide on a  foundation of polyurethane sponges.    In order to produce the filter, the synthetic sponges are  soaked in a clay suspension and fired at temperatures of up to  1,200 degrees Celsius. In so doing the synthetic burns up  completely and leaves behind a ceramic matrix with a structure  similar to the sponge. The ceramic is then dipped in a  zinc-oxide-clay suspension and again fired.    In this way an active zinc-oxide coating is formed, which is  responsible for the desulfurization process. The thickness of  the layer is between 40 and 400 microns. The hydrogen sulfide in  the coal gas reacts with the zinc oxide to form zinc sulfide and  water.    The filter can be used with a gas temperature of up to 1,000  degrees Celsius. At higher temperatures the pore structure is  destroyed. The thicker the zinc-oxide coating of the filter and  the pressure of the coal gas, the greater is also the conversion  rate of the hydrogen sulfide. During the conversion process, the  pore volume of the filter decreases.    In so doing, carbon deposits and small zinc sulfide balls  form in the filter matrix. After it has done its job, the filter  can be regenerated by adding air. In the exothermal regeneration  reactions the deposited carbon is burned and the zinc sulfide  converted to zinc sulfate. The latter again decomposes at higher  temperatures into zinc oxide and sulfur trioxide.    During the regeneration, the temperatures in the filter  increase more the more carbon and zinc sulfide it contains.  Since during this process it is possible to reach local  temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Celsius, the filter  should be monitored and regenerated gently. It works best at a  desulfurization temperature of 560 degrees Celsius and a  pressure of between one and 19 bar.    Conventional gas purification in a wet-chemical process  normally takes place at temperatures up to 175 degrees Celsius.  But the higher the temperature of the coal gas can be for the  cleaning, the greater is the overall effect of the combined  power plant. Hot gas purification at temperatures above 300  degrees generally results in an increase in efficiency of up to  four percent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Clumsy Trick To Mislead Public Opinion" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities  are these days noisily advertizing the "three non-nuclear  principles" and declaring "support to an indefinite extension of  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty" [NPT]. Commenting on this  MINJU CHOSON today says this is intended to evade the  international criticism of their concealment of plutonium and  mislead international opinion which is opposed to Japan's moves  to arm itself with nuclear weapons and become a military power.    The analyst says:    As for the "three non-nuclear principles" peddled by the  Japanese authorities, they are a peace veil which became useless  long ago. While advertising the "principles", Japan has connived  at the entry of nuclear-armed U.S. warships and warplanes into  Japan and left the Japanese territory to the United States as  its nuclear base.    Lurking behind their support to the indefinite extension of  the NPT is the clumsy trick to save themselves from the tough  spot today when their advertisement of "uprightness" in the  nuclear issue has turned out to be a sheer lie with the exposure  of hidden plutonium.    It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese authorities and  reactionaries are working to enact a wartime law to cope with an  "event of contingency on the Korean peninsula" by molding the  public opinion that the fictitious "nuclear threat" from the  DPRK poses a grave menace to Japan's "security".    The Japanese authorities and reactionaries must stop their  evil doing to harm the North over the non-existent "nuclear  issue" and open to the world the data related to their nuclear  issue and immediately stop nuclear armament, instead of  advocating denuclearization only in words.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): Not one of us . . . / Review of the sorry tale of Peter Clowes, and finds that the City must share the blame THE BARLOW CLOWES AFFAIR by Lawrence Lever Macmillan Pounds 17.50, 277 pages THE Barlow Clowes affair, they will tell you in the Square Mile, was not a City scandal. The chap was a complete outsider: no one had even heard of him until he went bust. It is true that Peter Clowes - the head of the failed investment company, who was recently sentenced to 10 years in prison for stealing millions of pounds of investors' money - was never remotely part of Britain's financial establishment. But the first conclusion to be drawn from Lawrence Lever's impressive book is that Barlow Clowes was a City scandal in this important respect: he could never have got as far as he did, or duped as many gullible investors, if he had not been able to exploit the infrastructure of the great financial and commercial institutions in the City of London. There is no suggestion that any of them realised that Clowes was a crook, or willingly went along with his wrongdoing. But the truly remarkable feature is that they were prepared to do business with a man whose activities - to judge by this account - would have been laughable if they had not been so ruinous. Peter Clowes gained credibility by the fact that he had highly respectable advisers: Herbert Smith as lawyers, Spicer and Pegler as auditors. 'The business has now engaged reputable City firms of solicitors and accountants to advise them on their activities . . . I recommend that the licences should be granted without further delay,' wrote a Department of Trade and Industry adviser in a submission that was to legitimise Clowes' UK activities. Top merchant banks - Lazard, Warburg, and Rothschild - unwittingly helped him to syphon money out of his clients' accounts by extending back-to-back loans. Under these arrangements, Clowes was able to borrow large sums from the banks for his own use on security which actually belonged to clients. Two clearing banks, Midland and Lloyds, continued to process his instructions to transfer funds out of the offshore investors' accounts even after suggestions that something funny was afoot. In Lever's words: 'Without their innate caution, Clowes could never have gone as far as he did.' The picture that emerges is of a man who by a combination of luck and brazen effrontery was able to steal many millions of pounds from under the very noses of the regulatory authorities. The story is rife with examples of messages that were ignored by the relevant authorities or did not get through to the right person. Information was held by different regulators in discrete pockets, instead of being brought together to reveal the whole picture. No one wanted to be responsible for the drama which would follow from closing Barlow Clowes: no one had enough initiative to step outside the immediate sphere of regulatory influence and ask the big questions. Everyone wanted to pass the buck. Thus, when the crucial licences were granted, a DTI official suggested that they should be sent with a covering letter to Herbert Smith pointing out that the department had relied heavily on the legal firm's assurances. 'This may give them (Herbert Smith) an incentive to let us know quickly if they find in the future that they have been hoodwinked.' As neat a piece of back covering as you could imagine. In the words of the prosecuting counsel at the trial, Clowes ' was helped by the reactions of those who strayed dangerously near to discovering the truth. There seems to have been a reluctance in some of them to believe that a fraud of this nature and scale could have been perpetrated.' There are obvious parallels here with the Robert Maxwell affair, both in the City's willing suspension of disbelief and in the character of the man and his business. For Clowes, deception became a matter of routine. The process was facilitated by a dense web of offshore companies and by the construction of a financial control system which only he could fully understand. The one thing that really mattered was that more money should be coming in than was flowing out in repayments to investors. That way there would be no awkward complaints from the public, and there would be enough left over for all the trappings of tycoonery. There were the yachts, the private jets, and the imaginative extravagances. On one private jet trip to Jersey costing thousands, Mrs Clowes wrote a single word on the disembarkation card to describe the purpose of her visit: 'lunch'. There are familiar lessons to be drawn from all this. As Lever says, no system of investor protection can cater for people who succumb to promises of excessively high rates of return. He quotes Professor Gower, the architect of Britain's financial services legislation: 'Regulation should be no greater than is necessary to protect reasonable people from being made fools of.' For those who were prepared to look, Barlow Clowes' schemes carried all the well-known danger signals. There was the prominent use of the word 'guarantee' - a promise that should almost always make investors reach for their revolvers, especially if it is made by a tinpot outfit with no record. There were the high rates of return, and the lack of transparency. And yet, right up to the very end, the money poured in. Could it happen again? Lever's verdict is that the Financial Services Act, which came into effect too late to nip Barlow Clowes in the bud, will make it harder in future for frauds to cheat the public systematically on a large scale. If they do, they will be caught sooner under the new system than under the old. But sooner, he warns, could still mean a period of years. It is true that one of the very first acts of the newly-formed Securities and Investments Board was to grasp the nettle which other supervisors had been avoiding for years: in May 1988, it closed Barlow Clowes. But Britain's regulatory structure remains fragmented, with responsibilities shared between the Bank of England and a range of self-regulatory organisations. The story of confusion and buck passing told in The Barlow Clowes Affair will strengthen the hand of those who argue that the UK's system of financial regulation needs to be made still less complex in structure and more pro-active in style. Lever claims that Barlow Clowes was the largest financial scandal of the century. But he is already out of date - and the fact is that the current title holder, the Maxwell disaster, took place largely under the auspices of the new City regulators.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A STRONG VOICE AGAINST MATERIALISM  </P> <P> Since I first saw your (Joseph Bell's) columns in the L.A. Times about four  years ago, I've said to myself that I wanted to write, but being the  world-class procrastinator and disorganized mother of two kids that I am, I'm  only now getting around to it. It's actually better that I've waited this long  because now I have even more admiration for the fresh (and necessary)  counterpoint you offer the rest of us minority free thinkers here in the  bastion of Western Conservatism.  </P> <P> Thank you.  </P> <P> Thank you so much for your column on the movie (and the fundamentalist  knee-jerk reaction to it), "The Last Temptation of Christ." Your column gave me  the courage to stand up to the Christian "religionists" -- thanks for a very  apt label -- who tell us that if our relationship to God doesn't please them,  it can't possibly be acceptable to Him. It cost me a "friend," but it set me  back on a spiritual path I had left years ago.  </P> <P> Thank you for your column on the importance of teaching discernment. It's so  easy to fall into the trap of answering  when-did-you-stop-beating-your-wife-type questions without seeing them for what  they are, and in this time of dangerously narrowing focus, you help by  continuing to remind us of the broader context and background we all fit into.  </P> <P> Thank you for your column on the rip-off valet parking at local restaurants.  Granted, compared to some of the other issues you've tackled, this one really  didn't loom that important on the social awareness scale, but it did address  that disturbing, all-pervasive materialistic mentality that is now the hallmark  of Orange County.  </P> <P> I remember as a child hearing my staunchly Republican parents being both  scornful of and disturbed by those in our society who seemed to feel  automatically entitled to "their share," but now that sense of getting what you  can from whatever situation is at hand, never mind who it leaves impoverished  in the process, seems to be the prevailing "OK" attitude.  </P> <P> Thanks especially for your recent column about the Irvine shoeshine man who  takes food to homeless people. What a wonderful lift it is to know people who  go out and do things to make some of the misery and hurt better, and what a  lesson about the good that just one person can do.  </P> <P> Thanks for today's (Nov. 13) piece about how we tsk-tsk and are scandalized by  people who are on welfare while we admire the societal manipulators who cause  millions and billions of dollars worth of damage to everyone by working "the  system" to their own advantage. These are the same people whose attitude of  unbridled greed is emulated by the upper crust of Orange County.  </P> <P> What's happened to us? I was born here, so was my father and his father before  him, and although I saw the progression from agriculture to our present mix of  land development (and they call it 'progress'!), industry and business, I  didn't see when our values changed so much.  </P> <P> I could go on, but the purpose of this letter was to tell you how much I  appreciate and admire your ideas and your column, not write one of my own,  although reading yours sure makes me want to!  </P> <P> KATIE MACMAHON  </P> <P> Silverado  </P></p>

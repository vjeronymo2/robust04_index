			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Calling on members of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]  from Hong Kong and Macao today, Li Ruihuan, member of the  Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, pointed out: It  is the common responsibility of compatriots in Hong Kong and  Macao, and people of the whole country to maintain the stability  and prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao regions in the last  few years of their period of transition. At present, we should  especially heighten vigilance against the possibility that while  creating political confusion, some people might try to work in  secrecy under the cover of nice words and fashionable  "decorations" in an attempt to empty Kong Kong's economy by  creating chaos.    Li Ruihuan said: Over the past decade and more, compatriots  in Hong Kong and Macao have made significant contributions to  reform, opening to the outside world, and economic construction  on the mainland. Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have made  indelible contributions to the emergence of a situation on the  mainland characterized by rapid economic growth and economic  prosperity. Of course, stability and development on the  mainland have also provided a reliable guarantee and forceful  support for prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao. Stability and  prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao cannot be separated from those  on the mainland. With the approach of 1997 and 1999, this  supplementary relationship between Hong Kong and Macao on the  one hand and the mainland on the other will manifest itself more  explicitly. Both Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and the people  of the whole country should reach this consensus: It is  necessary to closely link the stability and prosperity in Hong  Kong and Macao with that on the mainland, to take it as our  bounden duty to safeguard and promote stability and prosperity,  and to do our utmost to contribute to such a cause. He said:  Continued maintenance of stability and prosperity in Hong Kong  and Macao is not only a political principle but also means the  common economic interests of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and  of the people of the whole country. After resuming its exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the Chinese Government  will, vigorously and yet prudently, handle issues concerning  Hong Kong and Macao. All should rest assured regarding this  question.    Li Ruihuan pointed out: The British side must be held solely  responsible for the suspension of Sino-British talks on the  arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong. Under  the cover of democracy, the British side attempted to take  advantage of its remaining years of colonial rule to create  division and confusion in Hong Kong in a bid to hinder its  peaceful transition, and to influence and manipulate Hong Kong's  political situation after 1997 as much as possible. This is  something we absolutely will not allow. We did not wish to see  the talks break down, but it is not terrible now that they have,  because there can only be two possibilities: You will not  listen to what I say and I will not recognize what you do.  After we resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in  1997, it is reasonable for us to end colonial rule and all  arrangements not commensurate with the Basic Law. Regarding the  issue of the political system, the important thing is we should  all work together with one heart to make arrangements for work  after 1997 to enable the Special Administrative Region's  political framework to be formed quickly and to operate  effectively.    Li Ruihuan said: What is important now is that while we are  concerned about the political question, we must not neglect the  economic question. In the past, the colonialists openly carried  out plundering, but they are now using a modern method of raking  economic benefits. Hong Kong's money belongs to the people of  Hong Kong. If they lower their vigilance, their money will be  hallowed out, and economic confusion will result, thus leaving a  huge financial burden for the future government of the special  region and for Hong Kong compatriots. This matter merits  serious attention, and we should prevent it from happening. He  pointed out: The Chinese Government supports the construction  of the new airport in Hong Kong, but the British Hong Kong  Government has raised the construction cost to an unprecedented  level in violation of the provisions in the relevant  understanding reached between the governments of the two  countries. It is possible to calculate how much money is needed  for building an airport and how much is needed for reclaiming  land from the sea. There are examples in the world we can  follow. As the situation in Hong Kong is special, it is  understandable that the construction cost may be somewhat  higher, but as the cost of construction is exceptionally high,  one cannot help thinking: Who are the contractors? Who is  taking away the money?    Finally, Li Ruihuan said: For years all of you here today  have done a great deal in safeguarding the stability and  prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao areas. It is my hope that  you will continue to work hard to make still greater  contributions. I am convinced that with your unity and  cooperation, and with the backing of the thriving motherland,  Hong Kong's bright future is fully guaranteed.</p>

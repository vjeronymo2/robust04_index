			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Governing in Brazil is put on hold: Talks with IMF called off 'SERIOUSLY now. Let's start governing the country,' was the caption under a cartoon of Brazil's President Itamar Franco addressing his cabinet on the front page of a Brazilian newspaper this week. Ignoring the country's desperate need for direction, Mr Franco has opted to put governing on hold until the Senate judgment on suspended President Fernando Collor on December 18, expected to confirm his impeachment. Tuesday night's decision to call off negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over a new accord was the strongest evidence of the confusion within the two-month-old administration, which has paralysed the country. The querulous Mr Franco has cancelled a planned address to the nation, delayed a new wage policy and dithered over privatisation. Last week he cancelled a privatisation by fax and issued a decree putting himself in control of all prices in order to be able to readjust tariffs below inflation - in direct contradiction of IMF recommendations. His rejection of the orthodox economic programme elaborated by Mr Gustavo Krause and Mr Paulo Haddad, the economy and planning ministers, because it was 'too Collorite' almost caused the two men to quit last weekend. Not only has Brazil failed to meet the targets of the Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) accord signed in January, there seems little prospect of improvement. Inflation has been more than 22 per cent a month for the last year, the fiscal deficit is estimated at 7 per cent of GDP, domestic debt is at its highest since 1989, and tax receipts are down 25 per cent. GDP per capita has fallen 10 per cent since 1990. Financial institutions are in chaos. The Federal Savings Bank has a Dollars 21bn hole. Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, is raising costly short-term money to cover Dollars 5bn owed by the government and other state companies. Mr Murilo Portugal, the Treasury secretary, says the government's cash situation is critical. The lack of policy definition has destroyed hope of a rapid economic turnaround. Consultants are revising forecasts downwards weekly and the government research institute IPEA has changed its projections from a 2.5 per cent growth in GDP to a 1.5 per cent fall, despite an expected trade surplus of Dollars 15.5bn. This is the backdrop to the economics team's reluctance to re-open talks with the IMF. The official reason for the delay was the congressional impasse over a Dollars 12bn fiscal reform project crucial to balance next year's budget. The project is unlikely to pass this year. Congress has already slipped back into its old combination of inactivity and pandering to vested interests, slapping 72,000 amendments onto next year's budget. Bills on intellectual property, patents, and private concession of public services are all stalled, while a much-needed port deregulation has retreated. This year had been seen as crucial for stabilisation because the next two years will be taken up with a referendum on the political system, a constitutional revision and elections for congressmen, senators, governors and president. The hope is that after the definitive judgment on Mr Collor, Mr Franco will begin tackling the array of economic problems. But Mr Luiz Padovani of Trevisan consultants, says: 'This may be wishful thinking. The great fear is that after December 18 we will see Itamar's real nationalist face.'</p>

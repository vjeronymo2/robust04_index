			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Asian workers win race-bias award Seventeen Asian workers disciplined for taking a day off to celebrate a religious festival were yesterday awarded Pounds 1,000 compensation each for racial discrimination. An industrial tribunal hearing in Leeds was regarded as a test case for the Asian community in Britain. The men had received final written warnings when they took the day off for Eid - one of the most important dates in the Muslim calendar - in June 1992. Mr Keith Sugars, managing director of JH Walker of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, had described their action as 'mutiny'. He had banned staff from taking holidays during the busiest period of the year in May, June and July. But the Asian workers did not believe the rule applied to Eid because they had previously been given the day off for the festival. The tribunal decided in November that the men had been racially discriminated against. At the hearing yesterday to decide on compensation Mr Fraser Younson, solicitor for the company, urged the panel to award compensation of between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100. Mr Zafar Iqbal, representing 16 of the men, said a low award might trivialise the matter. The company intends to appeal against the awards to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Observer: Final shift Meanwhile executives who complain of killing work schedules will perhaps count their blessings on comparing themselves with Mitsui official Jun Ishii. His schedule literally killed him, the Labour Standards Inspection Office has just decided in Tokyo. The ruling entitles his family to government compensation on top of Pounds 125,650 already handed out by his company. The fact that he was a white-collar worker makes the ruling a rare one. Although about 30 Japanese a year die of what is officially recognised as overwork, or karoshi, they are usually all blue-collar operatives. Ishii's case is the first of its kind to be accepted in Tokyo. He was found dead, aged 47, in a Nagoya hotel room two years ago after a week in which he'd been kept too busy to take a day off. A Russian speaker, he had been escorting four Russian clients visiting his company.</p>

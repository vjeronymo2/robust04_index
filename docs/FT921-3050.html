			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (12): Outsiders in full command - Semiconductors lack a local hero IN THE build up to a single unified market, concerns over non-European supplies of semiconductors prompted calls to create a European industry heavyweight champion. But as the formation of a single market draws ever closer, the prospect of a powerful European semiconductor group able to take on foreign competitors has faded. Even Thomson-CSF, the French electronics group which until the very end had hoped for a merger of SGS Thomson, its semiconductor business, with those of Siemens and Philips, was forced to admit that there was no European champion. Leading European manufacturers have been left to take their own initiatives in regaining competitiveness. Philips, the large Dutch electronics group, which was the only European manufacturer in the the world's top 10 semiconductor manufacturers last year, has put profitability at the top of its priorities. After a substantial loss in 1990, Philips's semiconductor division managed to record a profit last year, largely through cost-cutting measures. The next step will be to draw up a viable commercial strategy for the semiconductor business, which still depends heavily on internal demand from companies within the Philips group. A huge debt burden means that Philips does not have much financial leeway. It withdrew, for example, from certain programmes in static random access memory chips due to the excessive financial burden that those entailed. Siemens, the German group which is soldiering on as the only European manufacturer of dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMS), is looking to its development agreement last summer with IBM to boost the flagging fortunes of its semiconductor business. The decision by Siemens to co-develop the next generation of silicon memory chips - 16 megabit DRAMS  - with IBM was what, in the end, killed the idea of a strong indigenous group to champion the European cause. The IBM link is not, however, a short-term solution for Siemens. The deal, in effect, allows the German group to acquire a much-needed technology drive from IBM. But this is not without its costs. The group's semiconductor division, which has not been profitable, received a large injection of capital from the corporate side to cover Siemens's contribution to the joint programme with IBM in DRAMS. However, it will be some time before Siemens will be able to derive external sales based on the 16-megabit technology it is developing through the IBM link. The market is just taking up 4-megabit DRAMS and will not be ready for 16-megabit technology for some time, says Mr Jim Eastlake, the senior computer industry analyst at Dataquest Europe. As for SGS-Thomson, the abandonment of the cause by other European groups left it in a rather awkward position. It remained for the French authorities, led by Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, to come up with an ambitious and highly interventionist plan, announced at the end of last year, to secure the future of the group. By bringing it under the control of CEA-Industrie, the profitable industrial division of France's atomic energy commission, the scheme aims to provide a stable financial environment that would allow the semiconductor group to make crucial R&amp;D investments. The French plan to create a national champion in technology is in sharp contrast with the British approach as exemplified by the UK's GEC Plessey, Europe's fourth largest semiconductor group. GEC Plessey has had to stand on its own two feet and make money, a factor which probably makes it more successful, Mr Eastlake says. The group has opted to focus on specialist sectors, specifically on application specific standard products. In terms of application specific ICs (ASICS) GEC Plessey is approaching the top 10 worldwide. These moves highlight the growing trend among European manufacturers to seek their own solutions to problems many of which they share in common. Meanwhile, Jessi, the joint European research effort in semiconductors, is no longer the European flagship that it was meant to be. This has not, however, ruled out collaboration between indigenous groups on a smaller scale. Last year, SGS-Thomson and GEC Plessey agreed to pool their resources in the development of advanced semi-custom chips while the French group and Philips have also signed a letter of intent to build a state- of-the-art chip plant in Grenoble. But as European manufacturers move ahead in their own efforts to regain competitiveness, foreign manufacturers have also been stepping up their activities within the EC. Europe will consume Dollars 20.7bn of semiconductors in 1995, according to a recent forecast by Dataquest. It is a highly attractive growth market. Yet European manufacturers have only 35 per cent of their indigenous market, compared with Japanese manufacturers' 85 per cent stake in their own domestic market and 70 per cent of the US market held by American groups. American manufacturers with plants in Europe may also start simultaneous manufacture of more of their new products in Europe and the US. Digital Equipment (DEC), for example, announced that it will start to manufacture its new Alpha chips, powerful microprocessors theoretically capable of processing 400m instructions per second, both in the US and at its South Queensferry plant in Scotland. Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have forged ahead with plans to set up manufacturing plants in Europe. While these moves could lead to foreign competitors increasing their share of the European market, the trend has been for Japanese manufacturers to win market share from the Americans rather than for both to take share from indigenous players. So, while the share of European companies may not rise dramatically, it is not likely to fall much either but to remain stable at its present level. Regional demand is dependent on regional strength in applications, says Dataquest's Mr Eastlake. The main threat of American companies is in computer applications, an area in which Europe does not have as strong a demand base as in other areas. European manufacturers have strength in communications, auto, industrial and consumer applications where they will continue to see demand from their European buyers. The European semiconductor industry in the years ahead will continue to see manufacturers from the leading industrialised regions co-exist as competition for market share intensifies. For the Europeans, the main question will be what strategy to adopt in trying to regain competitiveness. The relative success over the medium term of those groups which go for profits first, exemplified by GEC Plessey and to some extent Philips, compared with the groups that are guided by an interventionist, nationalist stance, should provide a salutary lesson for European industrial policy not only in electronics but in other areas as well.</p>

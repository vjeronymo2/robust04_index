			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Management: A fresh perspective on training / A look at an innovative Tec that has created real accountability to business Hold a contest for the most innovative Training and Enterprise Council in England and Wales, and the Tec for South and East Cheshire would almost certainly take the prize. The Tec has a long list of 'firsts' to its name, including being among the first to agree a merger with its local chamber of commerce. It has also set up a membership scheme that has created real accountability to local businesses and built strong links with employers. At the core of South and East Cheshire's activities is a philosophy of working as closely as possible with its local community. 'We approached everything we did from that perspective,' says 42-year-old Richard Guy, the innovative chief executive who joined the Tec from the Department of Employment, but who recently took up a new post in Manchester. Tecs, numbering 82 in England and Wales, are private companies established by the government in 1991 to drive a skills revolution in the UK. They receive nearly Pounds 2bn a year to run government-funded training programmes for young people and the unemployed, as well as working with other partners, such as local authorities and chambers of commerce, to improve enterprise activities in their areas. At first, many Tecs found it easiest to continue running training programmes in the same way as the civil servants who preceded them. This approach usually guaranteed a reasonable place on the government's league tables, which measure a narrow range of Tecs' activities and exclude most of their economic development work. South and East Cheshire, however, has taken a more entrepreneurial approach. On Youth Training, for example, Guy jettisoned the system of using managing agents to place young people on employers' training schemes. Such intermediaries he says deprived him of a point of contact with employers necessary to integrate YT operations effectively in the Tec's other work. So Guy started to contract directly with some 800 employers to provide training places. One benefit has been that the Tec has one of the highest levels of young people on YT working as employees. Where managing agents are used, they normally have non-employed status which means the young person is not guaranteed a job at the end of training. As important, the switch has allowed Guy to involve local employers much more in the work of the Tec. They are invited to join a business membership scheme, which also gives joint membership with the local chamber of commerce. Members total 2,000, about 55 per cent of employers with five or more employees in the area. They are able to attend the annual meeting, cast votes on key policy issues and elect board members. The scheme, probably the best developed of the handful set up by Tecs, offers direct accountability to local businesses that is often absent elsewhere. The membership scheme also offers special discounts for business support services offered through Business Link, the 'one-stop shop' the Tec operates with other partners on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry. Each company joining the Tec, or Business Link, with more than five employees is allotted a personal business adviser. Guy's strategy has its detractors. Some critics point to the Tec's comparatively large staff of 120, 50 of whom are engaged in Business Link. They claim that Tecs should not be involved in the direct delivery of services, not least because it can be more expensive than sub-contracting. Guy says: 'We do sub-contract all things that are specialised, and that accounts for 75 per cent of our budget. This does lead to savings. But the direct service is important because we can pull firms together and sub-contract very effectively on behalf of the group.' The strategy has been well-received among its customers in Cheshire. 'The Tec is a good sounding board for impartial advice,' says Garry Crosby, managing director of Alert Reactive System, an 18-month-old building management contracting company in Knutsford. 'I can't praise my business adviser at the Tec enough. The number of times that I have picked up the phone in desperation. It can be a lonely job setting up a business after working for a big company which took care of all the support systems like lawyers and accountants.'</p>

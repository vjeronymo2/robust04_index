			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to work more closely in an  effort to curb illegal salmon fishing in international waters in the Pacific,  the State Department said. Officials said in a statement that the two countries  have decided that illegal salmon fishing on the high seas by other nations  represents an "irrational and wasteful harvesting method and that all efforts  should be taken to prevent the unauthorized possession, harvest, transport and  sale of salmon in the North Pacific."  </P></p>

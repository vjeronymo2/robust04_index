			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: Europe's adolescent identity crisis - Jackie Wullschlager is enthusiastic about a provocative cultural history THE FIN-DE-SIECLE CULTURE OF ADOLESCENCE by John Neubauer Yale Pounds 18.50, 288 pages FROM Sons and Lovers to Lolita, from the Beatles to Barbie dolls to pop art, will our century be remembered as the age which glorified adolescence, just as the Victorians idealised childhood? Cyril Connolly, in his famous description of the 'permanent adolescents' who emerged from Eton, claimed that the British public school produced a ruling class 'adolescent, school-minded, self-conscious, cowardly, sentimental and in the last analysis homosexual'. John Neubauer, in this engaging account of how the idea of adolescence entered western culture at the turn of the century, casts the net wider to suggest that adolescence became an obsession in literature, painting, psychology, sociology and pedagogy across fin-de-siecle Europe, inspiring cultural icons in English, French and German. This is first class, provocative cultural history. The term adolescence, seldom used before the end of the 19th century, became trendy among psychologists in the 1900s. Around the same time a bevy of bewildered and narcissistic teenagers entered literature - in Thomas Mann's Tonio Kroger, Robert Musil's The Confusions of Torless, Colette's Claudine a Paris, Joyce's Portrait of the Artist, where Stephen Dedalus is caught, like most of the others, in a conflict of the bourgeois versus the Bohemian. The fragmented form of modernism, suggests Neubauer, is particularly suited to representing the fluctuations and divisions of the adolescent mind; it is also, like teenagers, self-conscious and often narcissistic in style. The portrait of the emaciated girl with frightened eyes staring out of Munch's Puberty (1895) is a landmark in the painterly treatment of adolescence. The pain of transition, the embarrassed girl hiding her body, the dark shadow behind her symbolising male sexuality, all the themes which Kirchner, Kokoschka, Heckel and other expressionists developed are there. Pechstein, who recruited teenage models to pose nude on a riverbank near Dresden, was arrested while his subjects had to swim to an island to avoid the local police. And Egon Schiele's drawings of pubescent girls, suspended in a vacuum, unmitigated by Kokoschka's backgrounds or Klimt's decoration and often homoerotic, got the artist thrown into jail. Yet the adolescent identity crisis became almost a signature of fin-de-siecle Viennese art, reflecting a doomed Habsburg heritage. In England, meanwhile, the lush Edwardian summer was continuing with those idylls of innocence, The Wind in the Willows and The Secret Garden. Neubauer does not mention them, but explores how the garden, a symbol of childhood, gives way to adolescent settings- the playing field or the room of one's own, the crustacean defence of Tonio Kruger. The literature of adolescence is about banishment from the garden - the lost domain of Alain-Fournier's Grand Meaulne. Instead, sports field culture brings cliques and peer pressure: boarding school stories, Kipling's Stalky &amp; Co, Gide's more menacing gang in The Counterfeiters. The imperialist answer was male bonding - Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and the German Wandervogel were just two of many adolescent groups founded around 1900. Much has been made of the Wandervogel as fodder for Hitler, but Neubauer shows that both groups shared a balance between militarism and a nature-loving interest in the outdoors. I would have liked a more anecdotal approach in such places; Baden-Powell, the 'Boy Man' used to sneak round to Charterhouse to watch naked youths being photographed, and saw Peter Pan on successive nights because the eternal boy so moved him; did his continental equivalents have similar habits? There would also have been room here for some exploration beyond the rigorously aesthetic which Neubauer does so well. The Edwardian cult of the young man, for instance, almost certainly contributed to the enthusiastic response to war in 1914. Rupert Brooke's famous sonnet welcoming the outbreak of hostilities 'as swimmers into cleanness leaping' suggests that, for the former public schoolboy in a culture which made a privilege of youth, there was nowhere else to go but boyish martyrdom; were there parallel cultural forces elsewhere in Europe? Such questions pay tribute to Neubauer for opening up in this book a fascinating topic with impressive range and an easy and lively erudition.</p>

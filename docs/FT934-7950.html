			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Naples to name successor to the mob: A vote that will determine who will replace the disgraced former city bosses - Municipal Elections STREET sellers in Naples have given the ultimate accolade to Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate. As the traditional nativity figures come on the market for Christmas cribs, his effigy has been included alongside the wise men and shepherds. When Mr Di Pietro visited the Naples magistrature this week the throng of well-wishers was so large he was obliged to leave through a side entrance. The man he came to interrogate, Mr Francesco Di Lorenzo, a former Liberal health minister and one of the city's former political bosses, also had to leave by a side entrance - to avoid a hostile crowd. The law has suddenly become a hero in this city with a reputation for cheerful anarchy and honouring the law merely in the breach. In less than 12 months a once impregnable political clique of mainly Christian Democrat and Socialist politicians has been discredited and humbled by revelations of bribe taking on a scale unparalleled elsewhere in Italy. Mr Di Lorenzo this week was even offering to hand back L4bn (Pounds 1.6m) taken in bribes. But if the traditional political bosses have been forced to the sidelines and face jail, no clear successor has emerged to run this chaotic sprawling metropolis, which is due to host the summit next July of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The big test comes this weekend when Naples' 960,000 voters, along with nearly a quarter of the Italian electorate, go to the polls to elect a new municipal administration. Opinion polls suggest that the four parties long associated with governing Naples - Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats - can scarcely muster 20 per cent of the vote against 60 per cent bought with political patronage in previous elections. Their candidate for mayor, Mr Massimo Caprara, a former communist and elder statesman, is trailing fourth. The contest has narrowed down to Ms Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of Il Duce, who is running for mayor on the neo-fascist MSI ticket, and the veteran former communist, Mr Antonio Bassolino, the mayoral candidate of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Ms Mussolini, elected as a Naples deputy in April, is marginally ahead in the polls. Her campaign of photogenic smiles and bold talk of rediscovering the 'real Naples' has little to do with her success. She is a political lightweight riding on the back of nostalgic evocations of the Mussolini name and her film star aunt Sophia Loren's close identification with Naples. She has benefited from the MSI's strong local roots and the party's distance from the various corruption scandals that have seen 60 of the 80 previous local councillors implicated. Ms Mussolini has also picked up support switched from the old ruling parties. The police meanwhile believe the vote controlled by organised crime, estimated to number 80,000, will swing behind Ms Mussolini. The PDS, backed by a leftist alliance, is campaigning hard on promises to restore the rule of law and make Naples work. 'From the traffic to industrial production, from the schools to the municipal apparatus, Naples today is on the edge of collapse . . . . In all these areas the mayor has to and can do something,' says Mr Bassolino of his programme 'My Naples'. In the partial municipal elections of last June, PDS-backed administrations won eight out of 10 municipalities in the Naples area, long dominated by Christian Democrats. In Naples itself, PDS supporters hope enough voters will recognise the city's problems are so dramatic that a Mussolini vote would only make them worse. Naples has been under special administration since the council was dissolved in July and the city declared bankrupt. The 1993 budget had been drawn up with creative accounting that grossly over-estimated sales of municipal property and tax collection while under-estimating expenses. The main municipal services are in chronic deficit, and all the parties are promising varying forms of privatisation. Mr Bassolino has produced a brave 100-day action plan to end years of deliberate municipal neglect in the water supplies, traffic control, accountancy standards, supervision of contracts and building licences and schooling. Naples has school truancy rates as high as 40 per cent in some areas, which both influences, and is influenced by, the high instance of juvenile crime. A combination of low productivity, political patronage, the presence of organised crime and poor infrastructure have long frightened away investment. Recession has made matters worse as have cuts in central government transfers. As a result Naples has 350,000 unemployed, close to 30 per cent of the workforce. The sole element that thrives is the contraband and drugs trade which remain tolerated in part because of the income generated. Against this background, Sunday's vote will mark either the beginning of an attempt to revive the fortunes of Naples or a further stage in its decline.</p>

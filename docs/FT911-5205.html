			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Gulf war cost Asian countries Dollars 1.2bn exports and remittances THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported yesterday that the Gulf crisis had cost its developing member countries more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m) in lost exports and forgone foreign exchange remittances from migrant workers. Added to that is the higher oil price after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That cost runs into many billions of dollars for Asia's many net oil importers, the ADB says in its annual report, released yesterday before the bank's annual meeting in Vancouver on April 24-26. Oil exporters Indonesia and Malaysia benefited in the short run from the higher world oil prices, the report said, but for China, another exporter, 'the loss of remittances and construction contracts wrote off most of the gains'. Before the Gulf crisis there has been about 600,000 Asian workers in Kuwait and Iraq. 'A large number of them were later repatriated, considerably reducing the inflow of remittances and adding to the unemployment problem back home,' says the ADB. The South Asian countries and the Philippines were particularly hard hit because of their close economic relations with the Middle East. 'Their problems were compounded by their big budget and current account deficits and relatively high inflation rates and debt-service ratios,' the ADB report adds. The bank estimated that the crisis had reduced India's growth in 1990 by one or two percentage points and increased its oil bill by more than Dollars 1bn. It said the total cost of the crisis to Pakistan was close to Dollars 1bn. 'These countries will need substantial external assistance to avoid stagflation and keep their balance of payments manageable.' 'The newly industrialising economies (NIEs) were in a much better position than other developing member countries to absorb the shock,' the 50-member bank said. Loans and investments approved by the bank grew by 9 per cent to Dollars 4.01bn in 1990, according to the report. Of the total operation, loans to public and private sectors amounted to Dollars 3.97bn for 57 projects. Project loans accounted for Dollars 2.2bn, or 56 per cent, of the loan volume, programme loans Dollars 820m, or 21 per cent, sector loans Dollars 441m, or 11 per cent, credit lines Dollars 411m, or 10 per cent, and direct priv-ate sector loans Dollars 79m, or 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / National Insurance computer to go private A new Pounds 150m computer system to hold records on National Insurance contributors is to be financed and operated by the private sector. The government is seeking private investors to develop, test and operate a replacement for the ageing National Insurance Recording System, one of the largest computer systems in Europe. The aim is to have the new system in place by April 1997 when extensive government pension reforms are expected to come into effect. The project will be the first of its kind to be funded through the government's private-finance initiative, which aims to encourage private-sector investment in the delivery of public services. If successful it could provide a model for the way the government handles other large investments in information technology. Bidders are expected to come from the ranks of large private information technology companies. As presently envisaged, the successful bidder would bear the entire initial capital cost of the project, meaning that the investment would not count towards the public sector borrowing requirement. The bidder would aim to recoup its investment and generate a profit by charging a small fee for every transaction to users - principally the Department of Social Security's Contributions Agency, which is responsible for collecting and recording National Insurance contributions. Bidding companies will therefore be taking a commercial risk both on the future volume of transactions and the amount of spare capacity they decide to build into the new system. The government is expected to try to build in an incentive for the successful bidder to keep its technology up to date by awarding a contract for a period of between five and 10 years, and not the entire anticipated lifespan of the system. The present magnetic tape-based system holds more than 61m National Insurance records. According to the Contributions Agency, the 20-year-old system is beginning to show its age and limitations. The private-finance initiative was launched about two years ago by Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, but has so far been slow to take off. It is still not clear that the government is prepared to countenance the rates of return required to mobilise the private sector to meet needs that have traditionally been met by the public services. Some civil servants have also appeared to have unrealistic views about the degree of risk that the private sector is prepared to assume in infrastructure projects.</p>

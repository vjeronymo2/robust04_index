			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Fall reported in N Sea exploration Exploration for oil and gas in the North Sea declined this year, a report by Mackay Consultants, the oil industry analyst, shows. Fewer exploratory wells were drilled because of low world oil prices, the attraction of fields abroad and the maturity of the North Sea. Mackay predicts that North Sea oil and gas production will increase by 13 per cent and 8.5 per cent respectively next year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liana Minasyan, under the rubric "Visit": "The </F> Fate of Baykonur Could Be Decided in Moscow: The Negotiating  Parties Should Speed Things Up"]    [Text] Winding up his trip to Kazakhstan, Andrey Kozyrev  flew to Baykonur, whose fate is to be determined by an agreement  that Moscow and Alma-Ata intend to sign when Nursultan  Nazarbayev arrives.    Baykonur, which accounts for a third of all the country's  space launches and from which all the manned programs are  executed, has today become one of the most complicated problems  in interstate relations. After receiving the ministry of foreign  affairs, the Russian military -- specifically, acting chief of  the cosmodrome, Maj. Gen. Grafinin -- assured him that the  solution to the situation would be an agreement in which we  leased, from Kazakhstan, the cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk,  which covers 6,711 sq km of the Kzyl-Orda Oblast.    The cosmodrome can be saved -- that is, not only its  infrastructure of nine launch complexes and 15 launch pads  designed to launch rockets ranging from the small Tsiklons to  the superheavy Protons, but also its unique technologies and  first-class specialists -- only if it is operating, if there are  launches. The military department wants guarantees of ownership  of at least the shipments subsequent to 31 August 1991, which is  when the cosmodrome was declared the property of Kazakhstan,  because the organizations involved in executing space programs  are feel apprehensive about participating in tests at Baykonur  until its legal status is ascertained. Kazakhstan today, of  course, is not in a position to maintain that monstrous complex,  which takes R38 billion monthly to stay in operation.    To many, the creation of a Russian military base at Baykonur  and the status of military specialists for the officers serving  here seems an acceptable way out of the problem. But Kazakhstan  could and apparently will insist on the demilitarization of the  cosmodrome, and in Kiev, Nazarbayev suggested -- the last time,  not the first -- the joint use of the cosmodrome. Be that as it  may, the cosmodrome now exists in the territory of a different  state, and the fact that Andrey Kozyrev in Alma-Ata was  discussing humanitarian problems and questions of citizenship  together with military agreements indicates that Russia and  Kazakhstan cannot resolve their differences on each problem  separately, but are linking them to military-political  concessions they're making to each other.    But for now, the Russian military who are servicing Baykonur  are still facing a legal case: operating here in the Russian  military unit are organs of security transferred to the  jurisdiction of Kazakhstan; in the city, there are two police  forces, two courts -- a Russian court and a Kazakhstan court;  for over a year now, according to the testimony of Maj.-Gen.  Grafinin, there hasn't been a single draftee here, and as for  contract workers, he has only 1,400 of the 8,600 he needs (local  draftees -- who are not citizens of Russia -- cannot be brought  here for contract labor). Meanwhile, the cosmodrome remains  almost R11 billion in debt for construction and repairs, and it  owes Kazakhstan R3 billion for electric power.    That is why the military department, threatening to disrupt  even more the existing space programs, is insisting that the  combat units stationed here be assigned status as Russian units  and that the use of Baykonur and the city of Leninsk be  stipulated in the leasing agreement.    Meanwhile, possibly the strongest impression on the  cosmodrome is made by its satellite city -- and that comes from  the sharp contrast between, on the one hand, the grandiose  cosmodrome structures and the world-class technologies used here  and, on the other, the standard of living of those who service  that space arch. Many officers are hurrying to take their  families out of the city, which used to be under the special  guardianship of Moscow and used to be a relatively pleasant  "reservation" in an impoverished country. Now even the  asceticism of the Soviet example cultivated in the armed forces  cannot stop the grumbling among the military, many of whom --  first-class specialists all -- are making several times less  than are their wives, who left for Russia. Those who remain are  forced to resign themselves to periodic shutoffs of electricity  and heat and to incredible prices in what is one of the most  "expensive" cities. A recent survey of officers indicated that  only 20 percent of them have agreed to continue their service  according to the existing contract, 30 percent will do so on the  condition that they receive a higher allowance, and the rest  would prefer to leave the service. And that when the officer  corps here is staffed at a 70-percent level, which forces them  to work knowing that the production process is being violated.  It needs to be borne in mind here that skills take years to get  and are "passed on" literally from person to person. When the  veterans complete their service and their work, that chain could  be broken. The cosmodrome, over which Russia and Kazakhstan  could be in difficult negotiations for many long years, could  fall into disrepair by the time the negotiations are completed,  and no one knows when it could be resuscitated or who could do  it. The problem, obviously, is not only whether Russia is  capable of executing ambitious space programs, but also whether  it will be possible in the future to make up for the loss of the  level of technology and skills that has been reached.</p>

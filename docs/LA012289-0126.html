			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS SHOOT LONG, DEFEND TOUGH, COAST OVER POMONA, 73-51  </P> <P> You know things are going bad for a basketball team when the ball it selects  for a game in its home gym is rejected by the officials before the opening  tip-off.  </P> <P> Such was the case Saturday night at Cal Poly Pomona where Cal State Dominguez  Hills got a rare breather, tied a team record for most 3-point shots made, and  coasted to a 73-51 California Collegiate Athletic Conference win before only  491 spectators.  </P> <P> Anthony Blackmon led the Toros with 18 points, although he slightly twisted an  ankle 1:20 into the game. It didn't seem to bother the senior on the boards,  where he led both teams with 10 rebounds, or in assists, where he tied his  career best with 7.  </P> <P> About the only thing Pomona could do more of than the Toros was free-throw  shooting. The Broncos went to the line 25 times, Dominguez Hills 5.  </P> <P> Still, this one was over long before referee Bill White asked for the new ball.  Pomona fell to 0-3 in the conference and 6-9 overall.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills on the other hand, is playing the best basketball it has  exhibited in the past two seasons. The win improved the Toros' overall record  to 10-6.  </P> <P> "I don't know if you can call this a breather," said Dominguez Hills Coach Dave  Yanai. "Pomona has been decimated with injuries. . . . Pomona played hard. They  can be very proud."  </P> <P> Pomona Coach Dave Bollwinkel agreed: "We're tying to do things with mirrors out  there. . . . I'm proud of our kids. They played hard."  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills used nine 3-pointers en route to its fifth win in the last six  games. The only loss was a 1-point defeat to second-ranked UC Riverside last  Thursday night, a game that Riverside Coach John Masi said his team was  fortunate to have won.  </P> <P> In that game Dominguez Hills held Riverside, averaging 96 points a game, to 59,  so it figured that Saturday night the Toros could improve upon their  league-leading defensive posture. For the season Dominguez Hills has held its  opponents to less than 63 points a game, less than 60 in each of the past three  games.  </P> <P> The Toros' defensive superiority was never so obvious this year than against  the depleted Broncos. In the first half Dominguez Hills allowed Pomona just six  field goals. Half of those came in the final five minutes.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills led after the first 20 minutes, 44-22, thanks in part to six  3-point field goals.  </P> <P> Segario Bozart had 16 points, Bryan Dell'Amico 12, and Barksdale 10 for  Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Guard Nate Macon led all scorers with 20 points and center Jim Skinner had 11.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona 83, Dominguez Hills 51 -- The fourth-ranked Lady Broncos toyed  with the Lady Toros while improving their CCAA record to 3-0 and overall record  to 14-4. Dominguez Hills is 5-9.  </P> <P> "(Pomona Coach) Darlene May was very nice to us," said Dominguez Hills Coach  Van Girard. "It could have been a lot worse."  </P> <P> All 10 players scored for the Lady Broncos, who coasted to a 47-23 lead after  the first 20 minutes. Guard Devon Akita led Dominguez Hills with 12 points but  was just 4 of 9 from the field. Center Brigitte Frazier scored 11. Guard Khyra  Anderson had 14 rebounds.  </P></p>

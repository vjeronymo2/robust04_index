			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> PARKING FINES RISE, SPENDING PLAN OKD  </P> <P> A budget package of more than $85 million was approved by the City Council this  week, including an increase in the fee for parking tickets on street-sweeping  days.  </P> <P> On a 3-2 vote, the council increased the penalty from $19 to $21 for a  violation of the city ordinance banning automobiles on the streets during  street-sweeping times.  </P> <P> The fee increase takes effect July 1.  </P> <P> According to city staff, the increase was necessary to offset costs associated  with the city administering the collection process instead of the municipal  court system, higher charges from the firm that handles the street sweeping,  and increased landfill fees at county dumps.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert F. Dinsen complained that he could "see no connection between  what the county charges for dumping and raising" the parking ticket fee, noting  that Anaheim charges $16 for a similar violation. Santa Ana charges $27 and  Orange charges $20.  </P> <P> Garden Grove's budget for 1990-91 also includes $15.5 million for the  Redevelopment Agency and $10.6 million for the city Housing Authority.

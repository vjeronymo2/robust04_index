			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / VSEL job cuts add to Cumbria gloom A FURTHER 390 redundancies were announced yesterday by VSEL, the nuclear submarine shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The cuts will reduce the workforce to under 8,000 from 14,500 two years ago. The company said yesterday that it might eventually have to slim down the workforce to about 5,000 because of defence cuts following the end of the Cold War and the difficulties of breaking into depressed civilian markets - such as offshore components - in the continuing recession. It had previously hoped to bottom out with about 2,000 more jobs. The latest job losses will add urgency to the visit to Barrow today of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who will launch the Pounds 1m Cumbria Marketing Initiative, aimed at improving the promotion of Cumbria to potential inward investors. The initiative is supported by British Nuclear Fuels, Cumbria County Council and the Department of Trade and Industry. The chairman will be Mr John Hancock, chief executive of Sealy, Silentnight's bed-manufacturing subsidiary, in Aspatria. BNF is shedding about 1,000 local jobs over the next six months, now that construction of its thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield is over. But while BNF and VSEL are creating structural unemployment, Cumbria is also counting the cost of recession - more than 1,850 other jobs have either gone since 1990 or are scheduled to by next March. Seven companies are involved, in the textiles, footwear, bus manufacture and computer-aided design and manufacturing sectors. The effect will be to wipe out most of the 4,000 jobs brought in by intensive economic development initiatives since the last big wave of structural unemployment caused by steel and coal closures in the Workington and Whitehaven areas during the 1980s. The latest cuts by VSEL will take effect in January. Numbers needed for the development stage of Britain's Trident submarine programme peaked at about 14,500 just as construction of HMS Vanguard, the first of four boats, began. The next two submarines - Victorious and Vigilant - are in production at 18-month intervals behind Vanguard, while parts of the unnamed fourth boat are in the pre-assembly stage. The programme will guarantee about 5,000 jobs to the end of 1994. By then, unemployment is predicted to rise to 15.4 per cent in the Barrow area, to 16.5 per cent around Whitehaven and to 17.7 per cent around Workington. Industrial and county leaders will today press Mr Heseltine for development area status so the area can compete with Scotland and Wales in offering financial aid to potential inward investors. Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, yesterday called for another interest rate cut and urged a 'coherent' approach to economic policy.</p>

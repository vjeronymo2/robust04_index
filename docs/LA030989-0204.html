			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOROLA SET TO RE-ENTER CHIP MARKET AFTER 4-YEAR ABSENCE  </P> <P> Motorola, one of five U.S. semiconductor makers that stopped making the memory  chips nearly four years ago because of Japanese competition, has started pilot  production at its once-idled Phoenix plant -- the first of the five to return  to the market.  </P> <P> The Schaumburg, Ill.-based communications and electronics company, which  shuttered the plant in 1985, has begun producing one-megabit dynamic random  access memories, or DRAMs. These are the tiny slices of silicon used to store  data in most electronic devices, from personal computers to toasters to weapons  systems. One-megabit chips are capable of storing 1 million bits of data.  </P> <P> The company is now the third U.S. maker of DRAMs, along with Texas Instruments  in Dallas and Micron Technology in Boise, Ida., which never stopped  manufacturing the chips.  </P> <P> Motorola, along with four other U.S. chip makers, pulled out of the DRAM market  in 1985 amid charges that their Japanese competitors had artificially depressed  prices for the devices by dumping huge quantities of them on the U.S. market.  Of the five companies that abandoned the market that year, Motorola is the only  one -- so far -- to return.  </P> <P> Analysts say the DRAM market has become more attractive to U.S. semiconductor  makers because they are increasingly viewing the DRAM as a fundamental  component of a complete product line. Equally important, a 1986 trade agreement  with the Japanese stabilized prices for the chips.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Venture Will Continue  </P> <P> Semiconductor industry sources say that other U.S. chip makers are studying the  market and may be poised to re-enter. Last week, the Semiconductor Industry  Assn. said it was developing plans to re-establish large-scale U.S. production  of DRAMs. Also, a small Silicon Valley firm, Alliance Semiconductor, has said  it will begin producing semiconductors at an abandoned American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph plant in Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> Production at Motorola's Phoenix facility is still in the test phase, but  shipments to customers will begin later this year. The company also plans to  start shipments to its European customers of one megabit DRAMs from a plant in  Scotland later this year.  </P></p>

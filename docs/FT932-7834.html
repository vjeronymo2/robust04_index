			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Ballot despite the bullets - Cambodia's continuing civil war is unlikely to stop Sunday's election The calendar on the wall of a Pakistani-manned UN police station north of Phnom Penh has only one entry for May 23: 'Election - Inshallah (God willing).' In spite of a continuing civil war, in spite of the failure to implement the peace plan signed by the four main Cambodian factions in Paris in 1991, and in spite of threatened attacks on polling stations by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the United Nations is grimly determined to go ahead with Sunday's election. Nearly Dollars 2bn has been committed to one of the UN's costliest and most criticised peacekeeping operations. Short of an overwhelming upsurge of violence, it is unlikely that the UN will risk further attacks on its performance by cancelling or postponing the election, being contested principally by the government communist party (the Cambodian People's party or CPP) and the royalist party, Funcinpec. Mr Yasushi Akashi, who leads the 22,000 peacekeepers of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), said yesterday that political parties had held more than 1,500 peaceful meetings during the six-week campaign period, but admitted that the five-day elections would be held in less than satisfactory conditions. 'We are going through this important chapter in the history of Cambodia, in the history of south-east Asia, in the history of the UN itself,' Mr Akashi told Untac staff this week in a rousing pre-election pep-talk. The election itself would be 'fairly respectable and credible', he added. But the obstacles to a 'free and fair election' in Cambodia in the 'neutral political environment' outlined in the Paris peace accords have been evident for many months. Untac was charged with monitoring a ceasefire, but the two principal combatants - the Khmer Rouge and the Phnom Penh administration installed by Vietnam in 1979 - never stopped fighting. Untac's mandate was confined to peacekeeping, not peacemaking, and it was not allowed to impose peace by force of arms. The Khmer Rouge also denied Untac access to most of its strongholds in the north-west and refused to disarm its guerrillas or regroup them in cantonment areas in accordance with the peace plan. With Khmer Rouge fighters still at large, the other factions decided to keep their own soldiers armed. This year the Khmer Rouge withdrew from the peace process altogether and threatened to disrupt the election; the government, meanwhile, mounted a campaign of assassination and intimidation against its remaining election rivals, which Untac was unable to stop. Mr Akashi managed to persuade Funcinpec, which says at least 50 of its supporters and officials have been killed, and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic party (BLDP) to stay in the running; their withdrawal would have further undermined the election's credibility. But even if it is deemed reasonably fair, with no serious outbreaks of violence or vote-rigging, the election's outcome is not guaranteed to bring peace to Cambodia, or to allow the UN to withdraw with its reputation intact. Consider the options. If the government wins, it will achieve the international recognition and foreign aid denied it since the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime 14 years ago. France and Russia both favour a government victory. Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, says that if the government wins, it will treat Khmer Rouge guerrillas as 'armed bandits'. The idea would be to wear down the Khmer Rouge until it becomes a containable left-wing insurgency that can be eventually defeated. The newly-elected government would still be riddled with corruption. But, like its patron in neighbouring Vietnam, it would probably be quick to accept economic reforms and might even adapt to the democratic ideals enshrined in the Paris peace plan in coming years. Unfortunately, many Cambodians and western diplomats doubt that the government would be able to crush the Khmer Rouge. If the CPP wins, the opposition parties are likely to cry foul and point to the UN's own numerous reports of government human rights abuses and intimidation during the campaign. Some defeated opposition leaders may even join the Khmer Rouge, as they did in the years before the peace agreement. 'If the CPP wins, we've got another Angola on our hands,' says one UN election officer, referring to the decision by Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan opposition leader, to resume fighting after the communist government in Luanda won the Angolan election. While the Khmer Rouge guerrilla force is not thought strong enough to hold important towns, it has used the 19 months since the peace deal to enlarge its presence in the countryside, partly by seizing territory from other factions. Though China may have stopped backing the Khmer Rouge, Thai generals and businessmen remain its staunch supporters. The elusive Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, has a house in eastern Thailand and has close relations with the Thai military. The government is by no means certain to win. A Funcinpec victory would at least convince most observers that the election result was fair. Funcinpec has only a vestigial army and has been on the receiving end of government-sanctioned attacks on its campaign workers and supporters. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader, has promised to try to appoint his father Prince Sihanouk as the Cambodian president if his party wins. Prince Sihanouk, backed by China, has spoken of the need to bring all four factions, including the Khmer Rouge, into a government of national reconciliation. However, few believe that if Funcinpec wins the government - with more than 200,000 soldiers, policemen, and militiamen - will hand over power to a party which it regards as infiltrated and easily influenced by the Khmer Rouge. 'The UN must make sure that power will be transferred to whoever wins the election,' says a somewhat hopeful Mr Ung Huot, the Funcinpec election campaign manager. If the election proceeds and results emerge on schedule in early June, even an outright winner may decide that it is wiser to form a coalition government. As one western diplomat puts it: 'We are not going to wake up on May 31 and find ourselves with an ideal political situation.' Untac's mandate is due to expire in August, and pressure is mounting for a withdrawal because of the rising cost and the dangers to UN staff. But many UN officials believe some kind of presence will be required for the foreseeable future no matter who wins the election. For Mr Akashi, who once described his job as suitable for a 'masochist', the pain is not yet over.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> Z Pizza, 30902 S. Coast Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-4949. Open daily from  11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> 7th Heaven, 3333 Bear St. in the Crystal Court, Costa Mesa. (714) 668-9464.  Open Mondays through Fridays 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturdays 9 to 6, Sundays 10 to  6.  </P> <P> Z Pizza serves eccentric, internationally accented pizzas that have plenty of  flash and flavors. Particularly engaging is a Moroccan style pizza with  eggplant and pine nuts, and the Pissaladiere Nicoise, a cheeseless pie with  anchovies and Provencal herbs. The chewy, fragrant crusts are mini-masterpieces  all by themselves.  </P> <P> 7th Heaven is a movable feast, a full-blown urban takeout emporium for grown-up  tastes. Don't miss such specialties as Chinese lacquered chicken, jalapeno corn  pudding or a dazzling array of trendy salads. There are abundant pastes and  cheeses for the picnic basket. Desserts like bread pudding and rich chocolate  cookies are terrific.  </P> <P> Scott's Seafood Grill, 3330 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-2400. Open daily  from 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Scott's Seafood Grill made a killer impression on me the first time I ate  there, but the year was 1976 and the city was San Francisco. That was then,  this is now. Today, in a stunning new Coast Mesa location, the romance wears a  bit thin. Good oysters, rich clam chowder and a good wine list make for  pleasant beginnings but the fresh mesquite-grilled fish is often devoid of  flavor, as one would expect in such a high-volume operation. Save room for the  homemade desserts and the good espresso.  </P> <P> Stix, 28251 Crown Valley Parkway at the Center at Ranch Miguel, Laguna Niguel.  (714) 831-7849. Open 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. weekdays, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.  weekends.  </P> <P> Stix is a bright, airy, mirror-lined new Chinese restaurant where the cooking  offers few surprises but is straightforward and safe: no MSG, high-quality oils  like peanut and sesame, you get it. The various kung paos, pan fried dumplings  and twice-cooked pork may lack the hotness and brio they have in Chinatown or  Monterey Park, but added color and crunch make up for it.  </P> <P> Gustav Anders, (South Coast Plaza Village), 3610 S. Plaza Drive, Santa Ana.  (714) 668-1737. Open daily, 11:30 a.m. to midnight.  </P> <P> Gustav Anders is a recent arrival from La Jolla, where it received critical  raves from customers and critics alike. Here, in a beautiful setting, it fails  to live up to its promise. Service is spotty and disorganized. The kitchen  shows only occasional flashes of the brilliance for which Anders once was  known. Chef Ulf Strandberg has a deft hand with smoked fish, pate, and salads.  But his main dishes, such as the insipid deep fried sweetbread or too-sharp  rabbit livers, are disappointing.  </P> <P> Mayur, 2931 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-6622. Open Mondays  through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 11:30 p.m.; Saturdays 5:30  to 11:30 p.m.; Sundays noon to 11:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Breads like naan and aijwan paratha are perfect, steaming from the tandoor.  Fish tikka comes dripping spice. Lamb vindaloo, a Goan preparation with  vinegar, chili and potato, is hot, fragrant and well balanced. Be wary of the  oily vegetable dishes and the unctuous service.  </P> <P> Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach. (213) 596-2199. Open Mondays  through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 10 p.m.; Saturdays noon to  3:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 10:30 p.m.; Sundays noon to 3:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 9:30  p.m.  </P> <P>  A swank Seal Beach grill and pasta house, Spaghettini gets by largely on  beauty: The food is somewhat spotty. Appetizers have little character, but  pizzas are full grown and yeasty, fresh from an oak-burning brick oven. Pastas  are made fresh daily but are not necessarily well prepared. Linguini clams  turns out to be a bowl of sticky glop. It's best to stick with items from the  restaurant's mesquite grill, like the perfectly blackened veal chop or the  excellent mixed grill.  </P> <P> El Ranchito, 1351-H Beach Blvd., La Habra. (213) 943-6020. Open Sundays through  Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Manana, 17171 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 963-8673. Open Mondays  through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 11 p.m.  </P> <P> La Salsa, Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, Fashion Island, Newport Beach ((714)  640-4289) and Santa Ana MainPlace ((714) 543-9524). Open weekdays, 9 a.m. to 9  p.m.; weekdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends.  </P> <P>  Everyone, it seems, has his secret Mexican haunt, where the chilies are hotter  or the tortillas fresher. El Ranchito is the place for carnitas, chunked pork  marinated in lemon and garlic, and for some of the most toothsome handmade  tortillas in the area. Larry Cano's Manana specializes in fajitas, giant  portions that easily feed two, loaded with trimmed meats, red and yellow  peppers, tomatoes and carmelized onion. Best of all is La Salsa, a humble food  stand dispensing antojitos, soft tacos, quesadillas and Mexican sandwiches.  Meats here are impeccable, accompaniments rapturous.  </P> <P> Gemmell's, 3000 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 751-1074. Open Mondays through  Fridays, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays, 6 to 10:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  You've seen it all before: the quiet, understated rooms, the tables draped  like ballroom gowns, the silver domes, the brandy cart. At Gemmell's, thank  heaven, it all makes sense. Treat yourself to an evening here, feasting on such  specialties as goose liver wrapped in blackened cabbage, lobster in Sauteres,  veal chop with morels. Chef Byron Gemmell has a carefuly designed menu with  nearly every item on it worthy of praise. Prepare to pay handsomely for the  privlege of praising.  </P> <P> McCormick and Schmick, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (714) 756-0505. Open Mondays  through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturdays, 5 to 11 p.m.; Sundays, 5 to 10  p.m.  </P> <P>  McCormick and Schmick is the latest member of an exclusive chain that started  in the Pacific Northwest, a slick, muscular operation specializing in fresh  seafoods and the food is terrific. Oysters like Quilicene, Olympia, Golden  Mantle, and Skookum taste as if they have just been dragged from the sea. Fish  like Copper River salmon in cream wiith bay scallops, or sea bass with Jamaican  spices, are good enough to make a grown man weep. Non-fish eaters can feast on  marinated chicken, or Cajun cheeseburgers. Head of the class.  </P></p>

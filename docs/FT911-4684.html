			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard in Indian venture HINDUSTAN Computers (HCL), India's largest computer group, and Hewlett Packard, the large US group, have established a joint venture intended to increase their share of the Indian mini and micro-computer market. Hewlett-Packard is paying Dollars 23m for a 26 per cent stake in the venture which will cover HCL's computer and computer aided design and manufacturing divisions. Hewlett-Packard's investment is more than all US investment in India over the past year - a clear indication of the way foreign investment in the sub-continent has tailed-off. HCL currently has 21 per cent of the Indian micro-computer market and 29 per cent of the mini-computer market.</p>

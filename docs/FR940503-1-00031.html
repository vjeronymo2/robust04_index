			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Program Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to guidance on the penalty amounts assessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the field citation program, EPA plans to issue guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing a wide variety of other implementation issues. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance would be carefully designed to spell out and restrict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the day-to-day practice under this program. EPA believes this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach will facilitate achievement of the goals for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, and still provide the flexibility necessary for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement program designed to address a wide variety of factual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. This section describes EPA's current ideas on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain elements of this program guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field citations may be issued either in the field or from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an EPA office. Violations of reporting requirements, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, will typically involve desk issuance since discovery of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these violations normally occurs not in the field, but in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office designated to receive such reports. Even where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation is discovered in the field, an inspector may elect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return to the office for further review or discussion with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management prior to issuing a field citation. In order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promote consistency, inspectors will be encouraged to return to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the office for clarification whenever there is any doubt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the nature of a violation or the appropriate penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount. During the initial phase of program implementation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency anticipates that most field citations will be issued from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an EPA office, based on field inspections. After a suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of experience with the program, it is expected that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of inspection-based citations will be issued on-site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will then establish guidelines for particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations in which office-only issuance would still be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended, e.g., based on penalties exceeding a specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar amount, or for other relevant considerations. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local employees may not issue federal field citations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to this regulation, EPA employees may rely on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information gathered during State and local inspections as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for issuing field citations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following discovery of a minor violation and issuance of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citation, the respondent will have thirty days in which to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either pay the assessed penalty or to request a hearing. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves the right to revoke a field citation, in whole or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, at any time prior to payment of the assessed penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes this authority is a necessary safeguard in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. It will allow a reevaluation, before the process has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gone very far, of whether a citation should have been issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, this could involve a reevaluation of whether a filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation is the most appropriate enforcement tool, or could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve the early resolution of a citation issued in error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, EPA will prepare detailed guidance for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the field citation program. The guidance will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover such broad areas as coordination of inspections with State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and local agencies, desk issuance as opposed to field issuance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether a violation is minor, and calculation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty amounts. The guidance will also cover such issues as how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to revoke a field citation, and how field citations will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recorded and tracked. Finally, the guidance will include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for determining appropriate penalty amounts, and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual sample of the design and format of the field citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Field Citations as Distinguished From Other Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 113(b) of the Act, the Agency is authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commence civil judicial enforcement actions against certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violators to assess and recover civil penalties of up to $25,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day for each violation, and/or to seek temporary or permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injunctions. Civil actions under section 113(b) are most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantageous when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A compliance schedule or other injunctive relief is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary and an administrative compliance order under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 113(a) is either unavailable or inappropriate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The violator's compliance history indicates that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance schedule should be subject to court supervision and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contempt remedies; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Substantial civil penalties are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, Congress amended section 113 of the Act, providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new authority for the Administrator to issue administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty orders under section 113(d)(1). These administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty orders, which may assess civil penalties of up to $25,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day of violation, may be issued where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The total penalty sought does not exceed $200,000; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

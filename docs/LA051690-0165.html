			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> D.C. DUMPS SPORT LOTTERY GAME  </P> <P> The District of Columbia, fighting an uphill battle to get a National League  expansion team, has thrown out a proposal to create a lottery game that would  allow residents to vote on professional sporting events.  </P> <P> D.C. Councilman Frank Smith, who is also chairman of the city's baseball  commission, said the game would cripple efforts of the nation's capital to  return a major league team to the city.  </P> <P> The D.C. lottery board tentatively approved legalized sports gambling May 2 and  planned to launch its "Sports Pool Lottery" with football betting when the NFL  season opens in September.  </P> <P> The district council took the emergency action, which does not require a 60-day  congressional review period, on Tuesday because of the lottery board's  intention to move quickly to establish the sports lottery. The measure,  effective for 90 days, would prohibit the board from establishing lotteries to  bet on football, basketball and other professional sports. The council is  expected to permanently bar sports lotteries.  </P></p>

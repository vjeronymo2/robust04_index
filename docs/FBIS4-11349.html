			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Garcia Castillo] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Chamorro returned yesterday after  a tour through the old continent. The Governments of  Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg promised to  continue their aid to Nicaragua "at least until I leave office,"  the leader affirmed.    The president signed a letter of intent as an incentive to  foreign investment for the Swiss Government. She noted that  Nicaragua has become the "focal point" of Swiss foreign aid,  which will contribute $3.5 million to the payment balance and  technical assistance.    The Nicaraguan leader said that Non-Governmental  Organizations will contribute funds for local private banks to  finance small business projects, although she did not specify  the amount.    Chamorro said that the Netherlands forgave $3 million of the  Nicaraguan debt. According to sources within the delegation,  there are $15 million still pending. The Netherlands will also  support Nicaragua's efforts at the Paris Club next June to  renegotiate the rest of its foreign debt, estimated at $10  billion. The president said that the Netherlanders will also  contribute $20 million to the San Jacinto geothermal project.  They will also assist Nicaragua in marking its border with  Costa Rica.    Luxembourg, the last stop on her trip, offered to duplicate  its current aid to Nicaragua, which was not specified.    Dona Violeta's trip to the old continent was checkered with  "incidents" that did manage to cause certain alarm and delays in  the itinerary. When she left the country for Europe aboard the  Aeronica plane, she was delayed for two and one-half hours when  the flight crew found a strange-looking bag on board. Fearing a  bomb, the crew ordered the plane evacuated immediately.    Reports from Miami indicated that Mrs. Chamorro's American  Airlines plane was evacuated just before departing, after a  small baggage vehicle hit them as they taxied to the runway.  Maria Alicia Talavera, assistant director of the president's  public relations office, answering a question from BARRICADA,  said the collision between the plane and the baggage car caused  a scratch under right-side windows four and five.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Recession in Europe takes toll on Doeflex Pre-tax profits of Doeflex, the Surrey-based PVC and thermoplastic sheet manufacturer, fell by Pounds 287,000 to Pounds 1.22m in the year to end-December as the recession in continental Europe began to take its toll. Mr Richard Bickerton, chairman, said that many of the group's UK markets had demonstrated growth, but the dominant feature had been its exposure to the first full year of the deep recession in continental Europe. Turnover grew to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 26.1m) but at the operating level profits were down from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.98m. Tax took Pounds 296,000 (Pounds 494,000) and earnings per share emerged at 8.83p (12.28p). The final dividend is again 3p, maintaining the total for the year at 4.6p. Doeflex also announced the exchange of contracts for the sale and leaseback of its freehold property on the Hawksworth industrial estate in Swindon, which houses the main operating facility of its PVC division. The property, which had a book value of Pounds 2.15m at the year end, has been sold to Conegate for Pounds 2.25m cash. Subject to completion, Doeflex will lease the property for 30 years at an initial rent of Pounds 240,000 a year. The proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt.</p>

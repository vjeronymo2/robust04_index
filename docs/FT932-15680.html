			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Science: saviour or tool of the Devil?: AC Grayling argues that it offers hope eventually of defeating oppressive religious superstitions NOVELIST Susan Howatch has offered Pounds 1m to help resolve that great argument of the 20th century: are the advances of science destroying religion? Her gift, to the faculty of divinity at Cambridge university, has been made at a time when science is under fierce attack. The most recent assault is not from organised religion but from those who claim the wider message of science is destructive, presumptuous, or wrong. Despite increasing popular sympathy for this view, Howatch believes science and religion can co-exist peaceably and cites John Polkinghorne, a Cambridge physicist turned cleric, as an example of how this can be achieved, even in the same person. But she faces a battle to persuade sceptics. Richard Dawkins, an Oxford biologist, says: 'What has theology ever said that is of the smallest use to anybody? When has theology ever said anything that is demonstrably true and is not obvious?' Dawkins, who wrote The Blind Watchmaker, a best-seller which champions Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution, seems to suggest that religion is under siege from science. But, in the present debate, the issue seems to be the other way around. Big sales have been achieved by anti-science books, notably Bryan Appleyard's Understanding The Present, which leapt to second place in the best-seller lists in its first week of publication. A more fundamental attack on the basis of scientific method was launched last year by historian John Ralston Saul. In his book, Voltaire's Bastards, he says science has 'turned on man,' poisoning his environment and food and threatening his extinction. Scientists themselves are worried that public hostility to their work is contributing to the chronic shortage of funds for research. In a speech at the Royal Institution in February, Professor Dennis Noble, a distinguished Oxford medical scientist, suggested that British science might be under-funded because it is viewed as 'the ultimate pact with the Devil.' Noble thinks many people regard science as the source of society's ills, not just because of pollution and disasters such as Chernobyl but through 'the perception that science is deeply and irretrievably dehumanising.' Science has always had its critics, but the present attack is remarkable because it comes at the end of a century of scientific achievement which has transformed the human condition - mostly for the good. In the 17th century, science's chief opponent was the Inquisition. Deny that the earth moves, priests told astronomers, or be burnt at the stake. In the 19th century, the anti-science attack was directed at evolutionary theory: in the course of a public lecture, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce tried to rubbish Darwin's theory by asking whether the great scientist was descended from monkeys on his mother's or his father's side. Half the population of the United States in 1993 still shares Wilberforce's creationist view. Today, science's opponents form a coalition which complains that science is destructive, soul-less, and antipathetic to religion. Such people desire personal significance, a safe place in the universe, a sense of ultimate value. All this, they claim, is threatened by science. John Brooke, a senior lecturer in the history of science at Lancaster university, says in Science and Religion (1991): 'Science has generated its own penumbra of ignorance . . . (and) ethical problems that it is powerless to solve.' In reply, scientists point to the enormous benefits of research which, often, are taken for granted: electric light, antibiotics, air transport, telecommunications, central heating and the computer. Indeed, some believe that the achievements of science can be compared with the artistic and humanistic revolution of the Renaissance. Some critics emphasise the destructive effects of science, particularly in war, and its threat to the environment. Others, such as Louise Anthony in A Mind of One's Own (1993), see science as an instrument of oppression in advanced societies. Anthony, professor of philosophy at North Carolina State university, writes: 'Institutionalised science serves, in fact, to sustain and even enhance existing structures of inequality and domination.' But scientists can reply that these are abuses of scientific discoveries and not the fault of those who seek knowledge. Some critics are alarmed by science's picture of the universe as a neutral, contingent realm, purely material in composition and subject to dispassionate laws. They would prefer the universe to have a purpose, to be the outcome of design, and to be governed by benevolent forces. Others are worried by the thought that our cherished view of ourselves as creative, ethical beings, sensitive to beauty and capable of love, will be explained by science in terms merely of chemical processes. These supposed threats have led to violent responses. In his attack, Appleyard claims the 'bitter message' of science is that the universe offers no consolations; it does not exist for a reason, it just exists brutally 'like some thick-witted skinhead - mute, gormless and callous.' Science has emptied the universe of 'goodness, purpose and meaning' and threatens a 'terrible inversion' of human values. It is frightening, spiritually corrosive and belittling. Science's worst crime, says Appleyard, is that it ventures no answer to the question: Why is there a universe at all? It seems to me that the chief reason behind hostility to science is exactly what Howatch wishes were otherwise: its threat to religion. Some argue there is no such threat and point to the many distinguished scientists who have been religious: Newton, Michael Faraday and Howatch's own present-day example, Polkinghorne, who prefers a dog collar to a chair of physics. But the fact is that if the propositions of science and those of religion are taken on an equal footing, as each offering the factual truth about the universe, they are squarely inconsistent. The central, methodological principle of science is that every step in enquiry and experiment has to be public, repeatable, checkable and challengeable. It is this that gives authority to scientific theories. Critics offer alternative authorities for our beliefs: ancient writings, intuition, mystical insight, ethnic traditions, eco-biology, the teachings of sages or the example of heroes. What gives support to the claim that these are genuine sources of knowledge is the new intellectual fashion called post-modernism. This says there is no single set of truths about the world but as many different ways of seeing it as there are cultures or even individuals. There is no legitimate way of judging between viewpoints, post-modernists argue; it is merely intellectual imperialism to claim that, for example, western medicine is better than traditional African witch-doctoring. This view is known as relativism. Thus, Susan Hekman, professor of political science at the University of Texas, Arlington, writes in Gender and Knowledge (1990): 'Post-modernism undermines the rationality of science by allowing us to see that science is rooted in specific historical assumptions and, therefore, is not universal or absolute.' Such critics reveal ignorance of what science really is. It is true that some admirers believe it will provide the answer to everything one day; but this view, known as scientism, is a hopeless caricature of the true nature of science - which is much more sceptical, tentative, and limited in its objectives than either its extreme admirers or extreme critics realise. When people talk of 'science,' they forget there are many sciences. Particle physics and cosmology (the study of the origins and nature of the universe) are the two most-quoted fields of enquiry, not least because great efforts are now being made to bring together the two theories (quantum and relativity) which are central to each and which, so far, appear inconsistent. But other sciences give rise to much less controversy. Many - like medical science - are of such immediate and obvious benefit that it is hard to see how critics can maintain their general hostility. Science proceeds by subjecting hypotheses to rigorous examination, wherever possible experimentally. Failure to prove a theory false does not mean the theory is true - only that it can be used until something better turns up. So, all science is defensible and open-ended; further evidence can refute or change it. Science lives by enquiry, of which the essence is scepticism and open-mindedness. Each branch is concerned with a defined range of phenomena. No-one supposes that the important questions of aesthetics and politics could be resolved in a test tube. Yet critics believe, vaguely, that this is what scientists aspire to - which shows they do not understand what they criticise. The open-mindedness of science, and its need to thrive on challenge and debate, contrasts sharply with religion. Religions are governed by dogma and tradition, in defence of which - incredibly - some people are prepared to kill and die. Religions have been among the most destructive of historical phenomena; examples of oppressive and violent persecution abound. Despite the personal solace religion offers (a psychological function performed by other things also, such as art and love), and the artistic inspiration it has prompted (although such inspiration comes from other sources besides), on the organised scale it can be dangerous and cruel. Science is progressive and cumulative; religion is static and backward-looking. Mankind's hope might lie in this fact, for it suggests that open-minded curiosity might eventually defeat oppressive superstitions. Voltaire once remarked that he loved the man who sought truth, but hated the man who claimed to have found it. One was a scientist, the other a priest. Perhaps Howatch's Pounds 1m will help us to re-discover Voltaire's insight. It might not be what she hoped for, but it would finally end the conflict between science and religion.

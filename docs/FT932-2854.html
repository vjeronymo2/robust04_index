			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Romanian N-plan for Bouygues BOUYGUES, the French construction and engineering company, is negotiating to finance and help build a second unit at Romania's Cernavoda nuclear plant. It has signed a letter of intent with Renel, Romania's state electricity monopoly, according to a company spokesman. Repayment of the project's cost, which could total Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m), would be in electricity once the unit came on stream. Work at Cernavoda, a Candu-type heavy water plant which was begun in the late 1970s, has been interrupted many times. The first 700MW unit, which is being built by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ansaldo of Italy, General Electric and Renel, is expected to start generating power at the end of next year. Five units are planned at the site. Cernavoda would be Bouygues' largest project in Romania to date. The company's first venture, the World Trade Centre costing Dollars 120m, is due to open next year. The company is also negotiating to build an office block in Bucharest's financial district and a 23-storey national communications centre for Romtelecom, the state telecommunications operator.</p>

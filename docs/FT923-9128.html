			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK looks at safe havens BRITAIN is reviewing the possibility of creating safe havens for civilians and refugees in Yugoslavia, Mr John Major, the prime minister, revealed yesterday. But he also made clear that the creation of havens, which won Mr Major praise as a successful personal initiative for the Kurds in Iraq, could have serious drawbacks in the different circumstances of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'A real problem is how to avoid precipitating a further outflow (of refugees) and thereby risk colluding in Serbian ethnic cleansing,' Mr Major warned. The safe havens option was raised in a letter to Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrat party, who had criticised the government for inaction over the Yugoslav crisis. Mr Major rejected the inaction charge, pointing to RAF airlifts, increased humanitarian aid, the London conference scheduled for the end of this month and the visit of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to the region. 'This is hardly sitting on our hands,' he said. Claiming Mr Ashdown had misrepresented Britain's position on refugees, he pointed out that the UK was the only EC country that had no visa requirement for nationals of the former Yugoslavia. Some 4,000 a month had entered the country since the crisis began and 'no one from a conflict area' would be forced to return. But the UK believed the best solution to the refugee problem was for people to remain as near as possible to their place of origin, where relief and medical supplies as well as shelter and protection were available,</p>

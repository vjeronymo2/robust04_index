			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Athens, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Greece, current holder of the  revolving EC presidency, was congratulating itself Tuesday [8  February] for having managed the Bosnian crisis coolly in  Brussels and keeping advocates of force under control.    "Greece has given proof of its sang-froid and  responsibility,  as opposed to the hysterical improvisations made by many  (participants)" in the wake of a weekend mortar attack that  killed 68 people in Sarajevo, government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos said.    "The government has reason to be satisfied (...) that no  step  was taken towards supporting airstrikes."    Greece presided over a meeting of EC foreign ministers in  Brussels on Monday, which turned down French proposals to issue  an ultimatum to Serb forces besieging the Bosnian capital.    There has been growing international pressure for immediate  airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)  following the bloody attack on a Sarajevo market.    The EC meeting called for lifting the siege "by all possible  means, including aerial." According to Venizelos, this implied a  rejection of any immediate intervention.    Greece is alone among EC member states in its pro-Serb  sympathies, and has backed Serb arguments that the attack was a  Moslem provocation.    In Athens on Tuesday, there were headlines saying "Stop  Airstrikes" and "No to Military Intervention" in newspapers  supporting the Socialist government of Andreas Papandreou.    Greece, the only Balkan country in the EC, claims that  military involvement would unleash an inferno and that a  negotiated settlement is the only answer.    Foreign minister Karolos Papoulias has reaffirmed that  Athens  would not allow its NATO bases at Preveza, opposite the island  of Corfu, to be used for any air operation and would withdraw  its NATO airforce personnel.    "It would be a symbolic decision without any operational  importance," a European military expert close to NATO told AFP.    Greece is at loggerheads over the issue with fellow NATO  member Turkey, which is sympathetic to the Bosnian Moslems.    But despite earlier objections Athens has now agreed to join  Turkey in attending a meeting of countries bordering on the  former Yugoslavia, called for Wednesday by international peace  negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.</p>

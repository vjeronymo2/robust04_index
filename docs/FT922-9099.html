			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: When small can be not quite so beautiful - Patrick Harverson charts current disillusion in the US with hard-hit biotech and healthcare stocks WHAT IS wrong with small stocks? While the Dow Jones industrials and the broad market S&amp;P indices have hovered around record highs, indicators of smaller stocks have displayed a marked under-performance in recent months. Since posting a record high of 644.92 on February 12, the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which includes a lot of small-sized companies, has fallen just over 9 per cent, closing at 587.16 on Thursday. Over the same period the even broader Russell 2000 index of small-capitalised stocks has dropped about 7 per cent from the mid-February high of 212, while the Value Line Index of small caps has given up almost as much of its gains. Analysts have been saying the same thing in recent weeks: small stocks are taking a beating because they were driven too high last year by speculative buying that lost touch with their underlying earnings potential. The damage inflicted on some of the high-flyers of six months to a year ago has been remarkable. Biotechnology and healthcare stocks have been hit the hardest, primarily because they enjoyed so much of the attention in the record-breaking rally of 1991. Immunex is a typical example. In January the maker of immunological biological products was trading around Dollars 60; by the end of April it had fallen to Dollars 26. Over the same period Cytogen, which produces biochemical systems for treating cancer, dropped from Dollars 34 to Dollars 17, while the value of shares in another anti-cancer drug maker, Immunogen, was more than halved to Dollars 12. Probably the biggest blow to the biotech sector was administered last month when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to grant approval for Centoxin, a drug for treating septic shock produced by Centocor, whose stock plunged from its high this year of Dollars 60 to Dollars 12 on news of the decision. Analysts had talked of potential sales of about Dollars 1bn for Centoxin, and the FDA's refusal to approve it was a big blow not just to Centocor, but to the entire sector, as expectations that other drugs would be approved were dashed by talk that the FDA was taking a tougher line. Centocor's problems highlight the risks investors face when buying stock in biotech companies whose future may rest on one product, or an awaited scientific breakthrough. The fast-growth biotech stocks were particular favourites of new investors, who read of the extraordinary gains to be earned in the sector and jumped on the bandwagon with little thought or research. As a result, many bought stocks in companies they knew little about. As soon as the sector's speculative bubble burst in mid-February, many of the unsophisticated investors panicked and sold hurriedly. At the same time the more experienced investors were getting out because price/earnings ratios and technical charts were telling them that the sector had peaked and was heading for a substantial correction. Healthcare stocks also ran into heavy selling during the latter part of the first quarter, with analysts blaming the losses on the uncertainty surrounding healthcare legislation in this election year. Health has been one of the biggest topics in the presidential debate so far, and there is concern in the market that after the election the victorious candidate might push sweeping health reforms through Congress. The problems of the biotech and healthcare sectors has inevitably impacted on the market for initial public offerings (IPOs). Between January 1991 and the end of the first quarter this year an estimated Dollars 1.75bn was raised through over 50 biotech IPOs as new and emerging companies rushed to take advantage of the heavy demand from investors for biotech stocks. But in recent weeks several planned IPOs have been shelved because of the sudden absence of buyers. The under-performance of small stock indices has also been caused by a switch of funds into low-priced cyclical stocks. The high p/e ratios on many growth stocks in the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 at the start of the year had set off alarm bells for some investors, who began selling out of small growth stocks and into cyclical broader market stocks. To investors, the recovering economy made cyclicals, whose earnings tend to move in line with the economic cycle, look more attractive than emerging growth stocks, whose earnings are more unreliable. As for small value stocks, which can look slow and unexciting but which usually produce a steady return over the long term, they offer a safe haven with strong defensive qualities for investors tired of the roller-coaster ride of biotechs.</p>

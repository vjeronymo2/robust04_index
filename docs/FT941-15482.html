			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark draws benefit from acquisitions The first benefits from acquisitions made in 1993 lifted interim pre-tax profits of Matthew Clark, the drinks producer and wholesaler, by 42 per cent from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 3.43m. Four months' trading from Freetraders, the drinks wholesaler, and one week from Grants of St James's, the wine business, accounted for Pounds 24m of total turnover of Pounds 47.6m (Pounds 26.1m) and contributed Pounds 1.16m to operating profits of Pounds 3.57m (Pounds 2.45m). Continuing operations had shown only slight growth during the six months to end-October, said Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive. 'Once again the build up to the Christmas trade was slower than we would prefer but we recorded a strong spurt in sales in December itself, although margins remained under acute pressure in the branded drinks division'. Freetraders' performance had been 'most encouraging,' he said. In its year to end-September, it had achieved organic growth of 18.9 per cent in sales and 25.6 per cent in operating profits. But the group's total wholesaling business still represented only 1 per cent of the pubs, hotels and restaurants market. Integration of the Grants business was proceeding to plan and would produce significant cost savings, Mr Aikens said. Redundancy notices were issued yesterday to 225 of the 540-strong workforce and a production unit at Worksop has been closed. Sales of Strathmore spring water - an earlier acquisition in the buying spree that has quadrupled the size of the group in the last three years - increased 20 per cent by volume in a market which grew overall by 10 per cent. Further investment is being made in marketing support to widen distribution. Overall British wine volumes were marginally lower but the group's main brands maintained their position in a market in which commodity products made large inroads into the own label business. Earnings were 16p (15.2p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 7.25p (6.75p).</p>

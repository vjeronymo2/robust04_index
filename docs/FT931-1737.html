			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Treasury only tinkering at edges of problems facing pensions Sir, I refer to the letter, 'Widely differing views on long-term effect of Budget measures on cost of pensions' (March 20). The effect on pensions of the various Budget measures (tax credits, income cap, and VAT on fuel) should not be the main point of concern. What should be is that pensions policy is being decided as a by-product of Treasury mathematics. Tony Cairns' last point touched on this. It is well known that there are fundamental long-term problems in pension provision arising from changing demographics. It is time that these problems were solved with with a coherent plan. That is why it is so worrying to see the Treasury tinkering at the edges; it appears that the government has no intention of devising such a coherent plan. Perhaps, even worse, it has forgotten that there is a problem. Paul Dutton, Badgworth Grange, Badgworth, Axbridge, Somerset.</p>

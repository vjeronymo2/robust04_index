			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Gili] </F>   [Text] We have just established telephone contact with Hugo  Rios, PRENSA LATINA correspondent in Harare, Zimbabwe, where  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has just concluded his  visit. Hugo Rios spoke to Roberto Robaina only minutes before he  left that nation on the so-called Dark Continent.    Shortly before concluding his three-day visit to Zimbabwe,  Robaina told Rios that: We are leaving Zimbabwe with more  motivation to feel a part of Africa. In statements to PRENSA  LATINA, Robaina said that during those three days, he felt he  was back in Cuba, adding that the environment is good for the  strengthening of ties between the two countries. Robaina was bid  farewell at the Harare airport by Zimbabwean Foreign Minister  Nathan Shamuyarira with whom he met three times on the last day  of his official visit to that country.    According to Rios' exclusive report for the "Doing Radio"  newscast, Robaina and Shamuyarira discussed the international  situation, the two countries' determination to strengthen  bilateral relations, and reciprocal ties of solidarity and  friendship were reiterated. Shamuyarira told PRENSA LATINA that  not only Zimbabwe but all of Africa is indebted to Cuba. The  Zimbabwean foreign minister had said these same words on the  occasion of the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Cuban  Revolution and reiterated them in his statements to PRENSA  LATINA. After bidding farewell to Robaina, who has now left for  Zambia, Shamuyarira said he shared Robaina's feelings of  happiness about the meeting.    During his stay in Zimbabwe, Foreign Minister Robaina also  met with the higher education, health, interior, agriculture,  and information ministers, and with the industry and commerce  deputy minister. Robaina met with the mayor of Harare, with  Cubans who work in Zimbabwe, and with the board of directors of  the Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association.    During this morning's telephone conversation with Hugo Rios,  we also learned that Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister  Christopher Ushewokunze was killed in a car accident last night.  The government has reported that the minister was on the road  that links Harare to (Balaguayo), in southern Zimbabwe, when he  crashed into a military vehicle.</p>

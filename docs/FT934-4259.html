			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Delay on super-share ruling Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation will not know until next year whether it is permitted to issue its controversial 'super-voting' shares. After a meeting yesterday between the Australian attorney-general, Mr Michael Lavarch, and Mr Laurie Cox, head of the Australian Stock Exchange, the ASX said that if it decided to alter listing rules to accommodate News Corp's request, it would first issue a formal 'exposure draft', detailing the proposed changes. There would then be an unspecified period during which comments would be sought. The attorney-general would then have 28 days to allow or disallow the decision. This process means that no rule change could come into effect until well into 1994. The ASX is shifting through about 60 responses to its earlier discussion document, dealing with principles underlying differential voting rights. The earliest date on which it might consider the results of this process is December 21 - but it now seems likely that even that determination will be pushed back to late January. In any event, the subsequent comment period on the exposure draft will ensure that no rule change becomes operative until well into the new year. The attorney-general's office, meanwhile, said it planned to set up an 'expert advisory' group, to look at the issues surrounding the introduction of differential voting rights and the implications for public policy. Membership of the group will be announced shortly. The group would be expected to participate in the comment period following publication of an exposure draft. Mr Murdoch in October first outlined his plans to issue 'super voting' shares - ones with multiple voting rights - on a pro rata basis to existing shareholders. But the scheme has generated enormous controversy, with critics claiming it would serve to entrench the Murdoch family at News, at the expense of other shareholders. News, by contrast, has argued that the scheme is required so that it can pursue joint ventures without management becoming vulnerable.</p>

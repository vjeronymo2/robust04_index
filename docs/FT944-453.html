			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei finishes lower after profit-taking The Nikkei index, which started the week higher on arbitrage buying, encountered profit-taking selling yesterday and finished marginally lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average, which rose 93.22 to 19,726.75 on Monday, gave up 15.39 to 19,711.36 after moving between a narrow range of 19,801.30 and 19,628.41. Unwinding of long arbitrage positions and profit-taking countered buying by domestic institutional investors, while individual investors dabbled in speculative favourites. Volume totalled 235m shares against 291m. Although overseas investors picked up shipbuilders and laggard stocks on Monday, most foreigners were absent from trading yesterday. Dealers dominated the day's activity on the last trading day for December settlement. The Topix index of all first section stocks, which advanced 11.21 to 1,556.23 the previous day, sank 1.18 to 1,555.05. The capital weighted Nikkei 300 lost 0.22 to 285.92 after adding 1.44 to 286.14 on Monday. Gainers led losers yesterday by 535 to 435 with 214 issues remaining unchanged, while on Monday advances led declines by 843 to 210 with 155 unchanged issues. Traders said that while investor confidence was generally positive, profit-taking selling could prevent the Nikkei index from rising above the 20,000 level this year. Sakai Ovex, a synthetic textile maker, jumped Y15 to Y735. The issue was the most active stock of the day, on trading by speculators. Individual investors also bought Keisei Electric Railway, which rose Y46 to Y820 and Suzutan, a retailer, which added Y70 to Y1,160. Brokers, which advanced on index-linked buying Monday, lost ground. Nomura Securities fell Y30 to Y2,070 and Daiwa Securities declined Y10 to Y1,440. Banking stocks were also lower, with Bank of Tokyo down Y20 to Y1,520 and Sumitomo Bank retreating Y20 to Y1,880. In Osaka, the OSE average, which rose 184.22 to 21,512.08 on Monday, added another 115.24 to 21,627.32 in spite of the weakness in Tokyo. Volume totalled 66.9m shares against 70.4m. Roundup Many investors extended their Christmas holidays, making for quiet conditions in much of the region. Additionally, Hong Kong, Sydney, Wellington and Bombay were closed. TAIPEI reversed early gains to end lower, but the plastics sector gained ground on bargain hunting. The weighted index lost 11.20 at 6,982.91. Turnover was TDollars 117.6bn against TDollars 72.43bn during Saturday's shortened session. Early buying was noticed in textile stocks following recent buying by domestic mutual funds, but profit-taking soon took the shine off. Fubon and Yuan Ta Duo Yuan both rose by the daily permitted 7 per cent limit to TDollars 15.8 and TDollars 17.1 respectively. KUALA LUMPUR edged lower in thin volume with the market consolidating after its run-up last week. The composite index, which rose 42 points last week, gave up 1.33 to 987.54. Brokers said, however, that they did not expect much activity until after the new year holidays as most fund managers had already closed their books for the year. MBF Capital led activity with 6.3m shares traded, rising to a high of MDollars 2.82 on a buy recommendation by Japan's Yamaichi Securities before closing unchanged at MDollars 2.75. Among the utilities stocks, which had seen a recent surge on institutional buying, Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia each fell 10 cents to MDollars 10.50 and MDollars 17.90 respectively. BANGKOK saw late buying of communications and finance stocks push the SET index up 7.06 to the day's high of 1,359.86, after an earlier fall of more than 9 points. Turnover was moderate at Bt4.48bn. A gain by TelecomAsia in the afternoon from a morning low of Bt65 boosted sentiment, the stock rising Bt1.50 at Bt70. The finance sector was also strong, being the most active sector, gaining 0.6 per cent on turnover of Bt688.9m. SEOUL closed flat after a late spurt of institutional bargain-hunting wiped out early losses from profit-taking by speculative investors in smaller-capitalisation shares ahead of the end of the year. The composite stock index added 0.73 to 1,025.33, of a low of 1,018.21. In spite of the index rise, losers led gainers by 556 to 329 and 175 went limit down, with worries about a liquidity squeeze continuing to cast a gloom over the market. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrials index closed higher but brokers warned that the low volume of trading had exaggerated the advance. The index picked up 7.96 to 2,227.25, off its intraday high of 2,234.68. JAKARTA rose modestly supported by buy-backs on second-line shares. The JSE index inched up 0.115 to 466.307. Advancing issues overshadowed declines by 42 to 23, with 27 issues unchanged and 125 shares untraded. Volume was estimated at 5.92m shares worth Rp11.81bn.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Celebratory pomp marred by circumstances from the row over her tax position and the future of the monarchy to fires at Windsor Castle, from rumours about Royal marriages to an early winter cold - provoked a unregal admission of humility yesterday. She told an audience at Guildhall in the City of London that 1992 had, in fact, been, an 'annus horribilis'. In a rare appeal for personal sympathy, the Queen suggested to her critics that scrutiny 'can be just as effective if it is made with a touch of gentleness, good humour and understanding'. But her speech, at a lunch celebrating the 40th anniversary of her reign, may instead mark a low point in the fortunes of the House of Windsor. An ITN poll this week showed 76 per cent believe the cost of the royal family should be cut, while 61 per cent would restrict the publicly-funded members of the royal family to just the Queen, Prince Charles and the Queen Mother. The Queen said that 'there can be no doubt, of course, that criticism is good for people and institutions that are part of public life. No institution, City, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support - not to mention those who don't' She added: 'This sort of questioning can also act . . . as an effective engine for change.' Speaking to an audience that included the prime minister and Mr John Smith, Labour leader, the Queen said: '1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis'. I suspect that I am not alone.' Her short speech had been brought forward from after lunch to before because her voice was weakened by a cold. Afterwards, her most vociferous critics showed little more understanding. Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West and a noted republican, said: 'I know people in my constituency who can genuinely say it has been a bad year. I don't believe she has had her house repossessed.' But Mr Toby Jessel, Tory MP for Twickenham, said that there was 'far too much malice and envy around'. And, proving that the Queen still commands a majority among Her Majesty's opposition as well as her government, Mr John Smith said: 'She is entitled to defend herself and she did it rather wittily and rather charmingly - it is probably true that she has had a horrible year.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 20 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Andean Group  approved a proposal to liberalize the services trade in the  region, Venezuela's Foreign Trade Institute (ICE) reported. The  proposal calls for full liberalization of the services trade in  seven years. During that time, negotiations would be conducted  to establish a market and a legal system in the Andean countries.    In the proposal, the delegates from Colombia, Bolivia,  Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru say the legal and juridical  standards will be applied to all measures affecting the services  trade. In addition, the services provided in the exercise of  governmental authority, such as state purchases, will be  excluded.    The proposal places priority on market access, national  treatment, and the most-favored-nation clause, which is  unconditional with the exception of agreements limited to  adjacent border areas.    The plan, which must be approved by the Andean Pact's board  of directors, stipulates the commitment to define community  standards on subsidies for services one year prior to the  implementation of the measure. The plan also provides for  special transit methods, the temporary presence of persons, and  the recognition and qualification of professional certificates,  which cannot be valid for more than three and a half years.    The Foreign Trade Institute states that "the document  emphasizes the need to create an Andean council for services  trade to advise and assist member countries.</p>

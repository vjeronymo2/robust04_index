The movement took over this duty some  time after Yasir 'Arafat stopped paying the salaries, aid, and  financial donations he used to give to the wounded Palestinians  and families of the Palestinian resistance martyrs in Lebanon.    According to informed sources, the Jihad movement receives  funding from Iran and gives it to these Palestinian families and  wounded resistance fighters every month. The movement hands  over this funding to some Palestinian officers inside the camps  who have misgivings about 'Arafat's policies, despite their  still being within the Fatah framework.    The same sources say that the necessary monthly funding to  cover the expenses of the wounded and the families of the  Palestinian martyrs in Lebanon amounts to $3 million a month.  It is not known whether the Jihad movement covers this whole  amount. Some sources point out that the movement pays, through  some Fatah officers who have differences with 'Arafat, the  monthly salaries of these families and the wounded men who fell,  after 'Arafat cut salaries and aid to them.    The sources conclude by pointing to extensive Iranian  activity in the camps in Lebanon, especially in the camps in  south Lebanon. This activity centers on providing medical aid in  particular.</p>

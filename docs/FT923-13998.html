			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Study guages competitiveness of accountants ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the UK's sixth-largest accountants by fee income, and Price Waterhouse, the third-largest, were the top firms for profitability and growth last year, according to an analysis by Datamonitor, the consultancy firm. The examination of market positioning is radically different from rankings by fee income, and elevates several medium-sized firms to high positions. The analysis takes into account the diversification of the different business services provided by the firms and the profits, growth rates and volatility of those services. Management consultancy and tax are rated the highest business sectors for growth and profitability, followed by insolvency. Audit and accounting work is rated the lowest. Rankings by competitive performance - which considers staff numbers, listed clients, fees per professional and staff per partner - reflect rankings by fee income more closely. The survey suggests there may be tensions in creating multidisciplinary partnerships in combination with lawyers, because fees per partner are so much higher in solicitors' firms. In a ranking of the firms, Arthur Andersen - which is in third place - is the only accountancy firm in the top 10 measured by fees per partner. There are six accountants among the top 20, while most come at the lower end of the table. Arthur Andersen is the most diversified accountancy firm, with 76 per cent of its income derived from non-audit fees in 1992. A number of the medium-sized firms are also highly diversified, however, with Grant Thornton, Robson Rhodes and Levy Gee ranking next, before Price Waterhouse at 61 per cent. The analysis also shows the substantial fall in graduate intake among the firms during the period 1990-91. New hirings fell the most at Robson Rhodes, where they were down by 45 per cent. Large falls were also reported by Pannell Kerr Forster, followed by BDO Binder Hamlyn, Stoy Hayward, Price Waterhouse, Kidsons Impey, MacIntyre Hudson and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which declined by 10 per cent. Only Touche Ross increased its recruitment during the period, up by 13 per cent. UK Accountants 1992. Datamonitor, 106 Baker St, London W1M 1LA. Pounds 595.</p>

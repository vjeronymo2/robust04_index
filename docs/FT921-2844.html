			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Tenneco creates position of chief operating officer TENNECO, the US conglom-erate in the throes of a restructuring, yesterday named Mr Dana Mead, 56, as chief operating officer, a new position at the company. Mr Mead, formerly executive vice-president and director of International Paper, will have primary responsibility for Tenneco's operating divisions. He will be named president in addition to chief operating officer in May, when Mr Michael Walsh, the group's recently-appointed chief executive, becomes Tenneco's chairman. Mr Walsh said Mr Mead 'will play an important role in moving Tenneco towards our goal of consistent profitability and growth'. In addition to his 14 years at International Paper, Mr Mead was a professor of social sciences at West Point, the US military academy, from 1974 to 1978. From 1972 to 1974 he was deputy director of domestic council in Mr Richard Nixon's administration. Mr Mead's appointment is part of a programme of change at the company since Mr Walsh took the helm last autumn. There is considerable pressure on Mr Walsh to turn round Tenneco's lacklustre performance of the past few years - including severe losses at its J. I. Case agricultural and construction equipment business.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chloride makes Pounds 14m security buy Chloride Group's transformation from a batteries business into an electronics group was reinforced yesterday by the acquisition of ADE Group, an electronic security business, for up to Pounds 14m. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, Chloride chief executive, said that the acquisition would enhance earnings per share and generate cash. Chloride also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04m for the six months to September 30 and a return to the dividend list with an interim payment of 0.1p, the first since the 1989-90 interim. The profit compared with Pounds 1.32m, which included operating profits of Pounds 1.1m from the seven battery businesses in central Africa which were sold in the second half of 1993. ADE manufactures control panels for alarms and distributes electronic security alarm products. In the year to April 30 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.54m) on sales of Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 15.1m). The vendors, principally Mr James Chadwick, chief executive, and Mr Graham Whitehead, deputy chief executive, will receive a Pounds 1.5m distribution from ADE and an initial payment of Pounds 5m, satisfied by Pounds 4m cash and 4m shares. There is a further deferred profit-related Pounds 7.52m, satisfied by loan notes. Turnover was Pounds 50.6m with Pounds 2.47m from acquisitions, against Pounds 51.8m, which included Pounds 9.07m from discontinued activities. As a result of the divestments, tax fell to Pounds 415,000 (Pounds 987,000) and minority interests to Pounds 13,000 (Pounds 210,000) giving attributable profits of Pounds 608,000 (Pounds 124,000) and earnings per share of 0.3p (0.1p). Mr Hodgkinson said: 'We are now in a position where we feel confident about returning to the dividend list.' In the core electronics business operating profits, excluding Ondyne, the power supply business it bought in April, rose to Pounds 1m (Pounds 508,000) on sales up 14 per cent to Pounds 43.5m. Margins and sales in the uninterruptible power supplies business increased and the emergency lighting sector returned to profit for the first time in four years. The power conversion business continued to make losses.</p>

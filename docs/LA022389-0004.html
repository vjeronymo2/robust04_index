			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. JEWELERS RAIDED IN DRUG MONEY SCHEME  </P> <P> Federal agents swept through Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district Wednesday,  breaking up what they described as an international scheme in which more than  $1 billion from cocaine sales was laundered for Latin American drug  traffickers.  </P> <P> At least 24 people, many of them jewelers, were charged here. Seven others were  charged in New York and Florida. Authorities said the money-laundering scheme  was the largest and one of the most elaborate of its kind ever uncovered in the  United States.  </P> <P> Complaints filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles contend that for the  last three years, jewelers allegedly involved in the ring quietly collected  carton after carton of drug money packed like bricks and shipped by armored car  from a web of contacts in Los Angeles, New York City and Houston.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Counted on Machines  </P> <P> In several back rooms of Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district, authorities  said, the flow of drug money was so overwhelming that the cash -- which the  merchants falsely reported as legitimate jewelry profits -- had to be counted  on sophisticated high-speed machines. The money was then transported by  couriers to various Los Angeles banks.  </P> <P> Then, according to agents, the illicit money was wired to contacts in  Montevideo, Uruguay, and Panama City, Panama, and used to export even greater  quantities of cocaine to the United States.  </P> <P> A prosecutor said he spent months surreptitiously watching some of the suspects  spend all day counting cash from drug sales.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, meanwhile, hailed the investigation as a major  blow to international drug trafficking. "This Administration is committed to  tracking down those who profit from all aspects of illegal drug trade," he said  in a statement issued in Washington after the raids. "One way to do this is to  deny the profits of the business to those who import drugs into our nation."  </P> <P> More than 640 pounds of cocaine was seized in the raids.  </P> <P> Hundreds of personnel from half a dozen federal agencies and local police  departments began making arrests in the 13-month investigation, code-named  "Operation Polar Cap," just as most merchants in the jewelry district began  opening for business Wednesday.  </P> <P> Investigators simultaneously raided at least six locations in the district,  causing traffic jams and moving with what stunned workers in the area described  as SWAT-like precision. Scores of workers poured onto the sidewalks to watch as  jewelers were led away in handcuffs.  </P> <P> In all, authorities obtained arrest warrants for 28 people in Los Angeles --  many of them Lebanese and Syrian nationals -- five in New York and two in  Miami. Eight of the suspects were still being sought late Wednesday. The  suspects were expected to be prosecuted on charges of conspiracy to sell and  possess cocaine and defraud the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> Agents identified one of the masterminds of the scheme as Nazareth Andonian,  33, of La Crescenta, who, along with his brother, Vahe, operates Andonian  Brothers Inc., doing business as Nazareth Jewelers, at 220 W. 5th St.  </P> <P> The other alleged ring leader was identified as Northridge resident Wanis  (Joseph) Koyomejian, 47, the owner of Ropex Corp., which has two ninth-floor  suites in the Jewelry Mart Building. Ropex also has maintained offices in New  York and Houston.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman, who is prosecuting the case, argued in  court Wednesday that those accused in the case, especially Koyomejian, should  be held without bail.  </P> <P> Hayman said the government had conducted "intensive electronics surveillance"  on Koyomejian and the others, including court-authorized room bugs, telephone  wiretaps and hidden video cameras.  </P> <P> "Your honor," he told U.S. Magistrate Ralph Geffen, "I have watched this  defendant on almost a daily basis since September of 1988 counting money. . . .  They spend their day counting money. That may be hard to believe, but in a  billion-dollar money-laundering operation, that takes a lot of time."  </P> <P> Hayman argued that Koyomejian is a flight risk because he is not a U.S.  citizen, holds a Syrian passport, travels abroad extensively, has been  overheard discussing plans to flee the country and has Swiss bank accounts.  </P> <P> Federal Public Defender Peter Horstman pointed out that Koyomejian has no prior  criminal record and has "substantial" family and community ties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Center of Scheme  </P> <P> Geffen nonetheless ordered him detained without bail, calling him a "major  factor in this alleged conspiracy of monumental proportions. . . . It appears  it would take more than money to keep him in this country, given his importance  to the scheme."  </P> <P> A man answering the phone Wednesday at Koyomejian's home in Northridge said,  "We have no comment about anything" and hung up.  </P> <P> While several others arrested in the investigation also were ordered held  without bail, Geffen released jeweler Hamyak Atayan, 54, of Encino, on $500,000  bail. Atayan operates Atayan &amp; Sons Jewelers at 650 S. Hill St.  </P> <P> Atayan's attorney, Erroll Stambler, denied that his client participated in any  illegal activity.  </P> <P> According to court affidavits filed in the case, FBI agents first got wind of  the scheme early last year, when informants in New York City tipped agents that  money from cocaine sales in uptown Manhattan was being laundered through  Andonian's business interests in New York.  </P> <P> At about the same time, suspicious Wells Fargo Bank officials in Los Angeles  notified federal authorities that the Andonian brothers had deposited $25  million in cash over a three-month period, documents show.  </P> <P> Agents found that both the Andonians and Koyomejian had allegedly doctored  invoices to show that their cash flow was coming from jewelry sales to  wholesalers. However, when investigators tried to contact those buyers, they  discovered that many of them did not exist.  </P> <P> Merchants operating near the Andonian brothers' Los Angeles shop said they had  marveled over the past few years at how fast the business appeared to grow, but  no one interviewed said they suspected illegal activities at the firm.  </P> <P> Koyomejian's business neighbors, meanwhile, said they were unfamiliar with the  company and rarely saw people at the offices, where curtains were generally  drawn.  </P> <P> Several jewelers expressed little surprise to see a major police action in the  district, but said they were surprised at the reason.  </P> <P> Most thought that the arrests had to do with a continuing investigation by the  Los Angeles district attorney into "short weighting," or mismarking of gold  jewelry.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, investigators with the district attorney's consumer fraud  unit served search warrants on several jewelry business in the downtown  district. They seized some gold jewelry to be tested for its purity, according  to district attorney's spokesman Al Albergate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cause for Concern  </P> <P> The district attorney launched the investigation after allegations that some  businesses were advertising gold products as 14 karat in weight, when in fact  they were 10 karat or less, Albergate said.  </P> <P> The investigation, coupled with the money-laundering case, concerns many in the  business who fear that upscale customers who frequent the market for its lower  prices will become disillusioned and stop shopping downtown.  </P> <P> Ralph Shapiro, president of the Diamond Club of the West Coast and a member of  the board of the Wholesale Jewelers Assn., said most dealers in the district  are responsible, law abiding and adhere to the jewelers' credo:  "Responsibility, reliability and integrity."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles jewelry mart has grown rapidly in the last 12 years to become  second only to New York in terms of annual sales -- estimated at more than $1  billion.  </P> <P> Jewelry dealers occupied just a few aging buildings in the mid-1970s, but now  an estimated 2,000 dealers fill more than a dozen major buildings along Hill,  6th and 7th streets.  </P> <P> In any one of these buildings, shoppers hear a cacophony of languages --  including Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Armenian, Persian and Eastern European --  in a business dominated by immigrants.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Kim Murphy in Los Angeles and Ronald J. Ostrow in  Washington contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUSPECTS IN ALLEGED MONEY SCHEME  </P> <P> Among those charged and arrested in Wednesday's federal money laundering  complaint were:  </P> <P> Dalida Avakian, Burbank; Hamyak Atayan, Encino; Bedros Akpolat, Monterey Park;  Nazareth Andonian, La Crescenta; Vasken Andonian, La Crescenta; Vehe Andonian,  La Crescenta; Harout Beshlian, city not available; Krikor Chahinian, Tujunga;  Salim A.

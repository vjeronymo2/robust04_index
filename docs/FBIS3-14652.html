Sources close to negotiations say that the delay in going to  the venue of the talks is because they want to hold the talks in  a secret place, away from reporters and television cameras. The  delegation is also waiting for instructions from the Palestinian  leadership in Tunis to begin negotiations.    The Israeli delegation to the talks arrived in Cairo at noon  today.</p>

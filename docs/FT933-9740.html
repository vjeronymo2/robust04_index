			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Policies may escape tax MY HUSBAND and I each have 15- and 20-year with-profits endowment policies which mature in 1996. I am considering selling them on the secondary market. One broker has advised that higher rate taxpayers would incur a tax liability which is not levied if the policies are held to final maturity, while standard rate taxpayers incur no tax liability. What is the position? The broker is thinking of section 540 et seqq of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. In a library, you could look this up in one of the multi-volume tax works such as Simon's Taxes (volume G). You will see that, if your husband's policies and your own are 'qualifying' and have not been made paid-up within their first 10 years, then they will escape the tax charge in question by virtue of subsection 1(b) (ii) of section 540. Go back to the broker and ask why he thought that section 540 would catch the sales of the policies (in case there is some crucial point which you did not mention in your letter). The policies should also escape capital gains tax by virtue of section 210(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

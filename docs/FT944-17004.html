			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Lloyd's damages bill doubted Two of the world's largest reinsurance companies yesterday moved to counter suggestions that they would pick up a substantial part of the bill for damages won in UK courts by lossmaking members of Lloyd's of London. Figures released by Munich Re and Swiss Re suggested that the sums they will pay out on professional liability policies taken out by the Lloyd's agencies being sued will be far less than hoped by many of the worst-hit Names. Though few details about the underwriting and reinsurance of such 'errors and omissions' policies have been revealed, the figures indicated that a larger proportion of damages than previously thought might have to be funded from within the London insurance market. As a result, Names may fund a larger proportion of their own damages awards. The figures also suggest that Munich Re and Swiss Re would play only a relatively minor role - if any - in any attempt to strike a fresh out-of-court settlement between Lloyd's, the members' agencies and the Names. Last week, the Gooda Walker Action group celebrated a High Court ruling it said was worth Pounds 504m in damages for losses incurred by Names on Gooda Walker syndicates as a result of catastrophes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The action group expected that a large share of the damages would be paid out of errors-and-omissions policies - either by direct insurers or those who reinsured such policies. But Munich Re yesterday estimated that the maximum amount it may have to pay out was between DM10m (Pounds 4m) and DM20m. The group said this was because errors-and-omissions policies taken out by Lloyd's underwriters had been only partly reinsured outside the London market and that the cover it provided was only 'part of a part'. The group added that it stopped signing such professional liability policies 'four or five' years ago - suggesting the amount it might have reinsured during 1991, when Lloyd's made heavy losses, may well have been negligible. Munich Re added that the maximum losses it expected to incur as a result of other legal action by Lloyd's Names would be 'relatively low'. Swiss Re estimated that it would have to pay out no more than SFr10m (Pounds 4.9m) on the errors-and-omissions policies of the Lloyd's agencies it reinsured. Mr John Coomber, chief executive of the group's British subsidiary Swiss Re (UK), described the group's exposure as 'relatively modest'.</p>

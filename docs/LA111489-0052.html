			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAL REFLECTS JAPANESE PUSH INTO HOTELS  </P> <P> The Biltmore Hotel will become the newest entry on a list of some of the  world's best-known hotel and leisure properties that are now owned by Japanese  investors.  </P> <P> The purchases are part of the massive flow of Japanese investments that have  poured into the United States and other foreign countries over the last three  years. Since the Japanese have exhausted most of the prestige "trophy" office  buildings available for purchase, they have diversified into other types of  properties, such as hotels.  </P> <P> But the interest in leisure properties reflects another strategy as well: To  capture and recycle some of the money spent abroad by the ubiquitous Japanese  tourists, of whom a record 8.5 million are expected to travel to foreign  countries this year.  </P> <P> "The Japanese investment dollar is looking to diversify geographically and by  product type globally," explained Jack Barthell, a managing partner at the real  estate consulting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Century City.  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago, Japanese investments in leisure properties were mostly  confined by choice along the blue shores of Waikiki. Today, they span the world  from Australia to China to Brazil and Great Britain.  </P> <P> The list reads like a Who's Who of a five-star travel guide: Hotel Bel Air in  Beverly Hills, the Inter-Continental Hotel chain, the Algonquin in New York,  Moana in Honolulu, Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Dana Point Resort  in Laguna Niguel and La Costa Resort &amp; Spa.  </P> <P> Purchases of U.S. hotels and other leisure properties accounted for about 22%  of the record $16.5 billion Japanese interests invested in all U.S. real estate  in 1988, according to Kenneth Leventhal. "We expect the dollar amount and  percentage of the total will significantly increase from 1988 levels," Barthell  said.  </P> <P> Japan's move into a more consumer-oriented economy is encouraging more leisure  time. Travel ties in to hotel, resorts, golf courses and other leisure  activities. "It's like ANA (All Nippon Airways) having hotels and flights in  cities, a kind of vertical integration," said Barthell.  </P> <P> That in turn helps from a merchandising standpoint. "It's not unlike United  Airlines a few years ago when it bought Hertz and Hilton Hotels . . . it's good  business," he added. (United's parent company has subsequently divested itself  of those properties.)  </P> <P> "The tourist factor can't be exaggerated," said Christopher Mead, editor of the  monthly newsletter, Japanese Investment in U.S. Real Estate Review. "Southern  California is a major destination for Japanese tourists."  </P> <P> Destinations and places with well-known and prestigious names are a big lure.  "The Japanese focus on prestige properties," added Mead. "Japanese like to  focus on prestige items whether it's hand luggage or suits or foreign guests,  like President Reagan. They are willing to pay top dollar for recognizable  names. The prestige value goes beyond (the tourist), they can list a property  in the corporate brochure of the parent company, it helps to enhance or add  prestige."  </P> <P> Barthell said Japanese investors also like hotels because "they are operating  businesses, not just real estate plays. They can be operated effectively and  more profitably if money is spent on physical appearance and upkeep in the  level of service. Also hotels are perceived in this country to be overbuilt and  risky investments. They are overbuilt and risky but we're not seeing more  hotels coming on line, so those that exist can do better."  </P></p>

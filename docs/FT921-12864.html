			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Stratus to supply International Computers STRATUS COMPUTER of the US has agreed to supply International Computers (ICL), the UK-based company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, with fault-tolerant computers in a deal which underlines the interdependence of computer manufacturers today. Stratus, based in Marlboro, Massachusetts, also supplies its computers under non-exclusive agreements to International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer manufacturer, which at one time comprised 30 per cent of Stratus' market, Olivetti of Italy, Ericsson of Sweden, and NEC of Japan. The company turned over Dollars 448.6m in 1991, a rise of 11 per cent on the preceding year, with earnings of Dollars 49.7m, up 23 per cent. Fault-tolerant or continuous availability computers are designed so that single faults will not stop the system functioning. They have become essential for critical applications including money transfer and security where malfunctioning computers cannot be tolerated. The worldwide market for systems of this kind is estimated at Dollars 12bn. The market leader is Tandem Computers of the US; other manufacturers including Digital Equipment and Hewlett Packard now also offer fault-tolerant systems. Mr William Foster, president and chief executive officer, said Stratus and ICL were complementary; ICL had special expertise in the Unix operating system which was the fastest-growing area of the Stratus marketplace. Mr David Berry, director of associated services at ICL, said he expected to sell Pounds 10m (Dollars 18.1m) worth of Stratus hardware in the first year of a five-year plan in which revenues should reach between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m. Stratus and ICL sales forces would complement each other in the UK rather than compete. ICL's chief aim in selling Stratus hardware would be to strengthen its role in the financial services market as well as public utilities, telecommunications and security. ICL and Stratus have worked together informally since 1987; ICL installed Stratus computers at Deutsche Press-Agentur, Germany's largest press agency.</p>

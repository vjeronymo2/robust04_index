			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: 'WE HOPE TO PROVIDE A WONDERFUL CHORAL EXPERIENCE FOR  STUDENTS.'  </P> <P> Los Angeles Master Chorale Music Director John Currie -- his sleeves rolled up  and an infectious grin on his face -- was spreading his enthusiasm about choral  singing.  </P> <P> "There is nothing on the planet like the sound of voices singing together," he  told Banning High School student singers on a visit to the Wilmington campus  last week.  </P> <P> With a smattering of musical jokes as leavening, Currie coached the students on  breathing and vocalization.  </P> <P> "Sing like fish, not like frogs, drop the jaw . . . sing a big sound," he told  the students as he worked with them to polish the music they'll perform under  Currie's direction as part of an unusual 400-voice South Bay choral festival on  April 3.  </P> <P> Music of Vivaldi, Bruckner, Vaughan Williams and Copland will be sung at the  Norris Theatre for the Performing Arts by students from 12 intermediate and  high schools in the South Bay and South Los Angeles. The singers, who will  perform with piano and trumpet accompaniment, will fill most most of the  Rolling Hills Estates theater's 450 seats. A smattering of invited guests,  including school music teachers, will make up a small audience.  </P> <P> "We hope to provide a wonderful choral experience for students," said Phyllis  Rothrock, chairman of the the chorale's South Bay support group. She said such  a high school music showcase under Currie's direction is "an idea whose time  has come."  </P> <P> Rothrock's group came up with the idea and got an enthusiastic response from  Los Angeles, Torrance, Centinela Valley and Palos Verdes Peninsula school  districts. The chorale, which performs at the the Los Angeles Music Center,  hopes it will become an annual event.  </P> <P> Currie, who visited all of the schools to rehearse singers, calls the festival  a way for student singers to emulate the 130 professional singers in the  chorale. Later, the youngsters will have a chance to hear the group for  themselves because they're getting free tickets for an April concert.  </P> <P> Banning music teacher Laura Young calls the festival "a once in a lifetime  shot" for her students, adding, "Having John Currie here gives me the right to  tell them to try harder."  </P> <P> Student Susan Pickett said the opportunity to sing at the festival "is one of  the most exciting things" that's happened to her.

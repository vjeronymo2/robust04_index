			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ROMANIA STRIVES FOR STABILITY IN BREAK WITH PAST AS ECONOMY TAKES A FREE FALL  </P> <P> What is dividing and conquering Romania nearly a year after its anti-Communist  revolt is that "some people are satisfied with half a loaf of bread."  </P> <P> Engineer Raluca Nan's condemnation of those who feel they have blessings to  count is a view shared by many educated professionals seeking to oust the  Romanian leadership elected only six months ago.  </P> <P> Her assessment is accurate but unsettling, since it highlights a broadening  chasm separating Romania's 23 million citizens.  </P> <P> There are those willing to tough out continued privation, hesitantly putting  faith in government assurances of eventual relief from the suffering  institutionalized under late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> And there are those, like Nan, who accuse fearful countrymen of being taken in  by ex-Communists who hijacked the revolution in order to thwart its intended  reforms.  </P> <P> What bodes ill for Romania's stability is the opposition's ready concession  that it is a minority unwilling to submit to majority rule.  </P> <P> "I don't think the majority supports a second revolution, because the majority  is not thinking," said Nan, one of 12,000 who marched through this  Transylvanian industrial city recently to protest price increases and demand  that the government resign.  </P> <P> Demonstrations that have drawn as many as 200,000 Romanians to the streets have  called for the ouster of President Ion Iliescu, who won 87% of the May vote  that foreign observers said was flawed but generally reflective of the people's  will.  </P> <P> Unrelenting opposition has nudged Romania dangerously close to the kind of  turmoil paralyzing Bulgaria, where another intellectual minority angered by the  peasantry's electoral choice has rendered the new government powerless to  arrest an economic free fall.  </P> <P> Getting tough with dissenters is not an option for Prime Minister Petre Roman,  who has been struggling to show democratic tolerance and win back Western trust  since Iliescu's disastrous June decision to quell unrest with a vigilante  rampage.  </P> <P> Roman and his technocrat allies are intent on radical transition of the  stagnant economy and have vowed not to be deterred by opposition efforts at  "government from the streets."  </P> <P> Yet some ministers seem to have distanced themselves from the president and his  populist National Salvation Front, perhaps hoping to save their reform program  -- and their positions -- in the event Iliescu is forced to resign.  </P> <P> Introduction of sink-or-swim capitalism on Nov. 1 has turned up the volume of  the anti-government protests, but Roman insists the transition to a market  economy is irreversible.  </P> <P> In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, the 44-year-old prime  minister said radical reforms are needed to stir Romanian workers from a  post-revolutionary slumber that has decimated the economy.  </P> <P> "We explained very clearly to everyone several times that price liberalization  is the first tool to affect a new economic dynamic," said Roman, whose  ministerial headquarters is still abuzz with activity at 7 p.m. "It's very  simple. No work, no pay. Now, people have to work at a certain level to live in  normal conditions."  </P> <P> Romanians underwent a much-needed "decompression" after Ceausescu's overthrow  and execution, but Roman said the relaxation has gone too far. Industrial  output is down 30% from last year, threatening Romania's very survival.  </P> <P> "We have calculated that the best way to reduce the adverse effects of  unemployment and inflation is to step very quickly over this transition  period," Roman said. "We believe the old saying 'Long illness, sure death.' I  want to avoid the funeral of the Romanian economy."  </P> <P> Unlike most other countries in Eastern Europe, Romania carries very little  foreign debt, which gives it some leeway with credit to revamp outdated  production equipment.  </P> <P> But Roman said his country will not make the mistake of borrowing to finance  consumption, even though imports could ease mounting popular resistance to his  reforms.  </P> <P> "For the basic, immediate needs, we are not worried," said the English-speaking  prime minister. "Food products exist, as our agricultural performance this year  was acceptable. We can ensure sufficient supply for at least the next three  months, and we are not touching the price of basic foods, heat or electricity  or, for the moment, the question of rents."  </P> <P> Expecting producers to set prices for their goods according to what the market  will bear has effectively frozen internal trade, as inexperienced buyers and  sellers learn the art of negotiation and compromise.  </P> <P> Store shelves are virtually empty, but Bucharest officials promise that relief  is on the horizon. Cars and appliances costing twice what they used to are now  available, and perishable foods not exempt from the price increases are  appearing at random in produce stands.  </P> <P> Most enterprises remain under state ownership but have been put on notice that  they must pay their own way or declare bankruptcy in a state incapable of being  generous with its jobless. A law requiring wages to be negotiated between  management and labor is expected within a few weeks, and modest funds for  unemployment are already being set aside.  </P> <P> The government has advised failing factories that return to a six-day workweek,  as was standard practice under Ceausescu, may be their only hope of recovery  and survival.  </P> <P> Because of the worldwide oil crisis and the trade embargo against Iraq, which  repaid debts to Romania with fuel shipments, Romania's energy outlook this  winter is grim. The government has promised to maintain home heating at 68  degrees Fahrenheit, but harsh temperatures could force rationing of electricity  or closure of inefficient factories on the coldest days.  </P> <P> The economic difficulties add up to living conditions only marginally better  than before the revolution.  </P> <P> At grocery stores in the heart of Brasov, one of Romania's biggest cities, the  stock in mid-November was limited to macaroni, six types of canned fruits and  vegetables, pretzels, Vietnamese shrimp crackers and powdered detergent.  Shoppers queued for hours at separate stores selling meat and bread, which  cannot be distributed efficiently because of a lack of portioning and packaging  equipment.  </P> <P> "There is no cause for hope in young families," complained Ovidiu Popa, a  27-year-old building engineer at a Brasov protest against the ruling front last  week. "There's no money for our work, and now it costs a year's salary to buy a  kitchen stove."  </P> <P> "No leadership can submit to government from the streets," claimed Roman's  chief of staff, Baltazar Bogdan. "But we are powerless to stop the protests."  </P> <P> Western governments have refused to lift economic sanctions against Romania  stemming from the June crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, which has  served to deter further excesses of power as well as foreign investment.  </P> <P> "There is a retroactive guilt complex in the West," Bogdan said, alluding to  U.S. extension of special trade status to Romania during the years of  dictatorship. "They feel they were taken by Ceausescu once, and they will look  very carefully at 'these bloody Romanians' this time around."  </P> <P> But without Western support, "we won't make it," Bogdan said. "Romania is  coming out of a long, long illness."  </P></p>

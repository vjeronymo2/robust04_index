On behalf of the Ukrainian side the agreement was signed  by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and on behalf of  the Japanese side by Japan's ambassador to Ukraine Shoji  Suezawa. "This is the first agreement between Japan and  independent Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic  relations between our two states in 1992. Japan hopes Ukraine  will confidently travel the road of rejecting nuclear weapons  and will accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non  nuclear state," Suedzawa stated. Zlenko pointed out that Japan  was one of the first countries to have signed such an agreement.  In his view, "this document will promote stronger cooperation  between our countries. The signing of this agreement is a  certain contribution to implementing the trilateral statement by  the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, signed on 14  January."    A UNIAN correspondent has been informed by the Japanese  Embassy in Ukraine that the final sum of Japanese aid to  eliminate nuclear weapons in Ukraine has not been determined yet.</p>

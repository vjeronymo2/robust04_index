			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-C&hyph;5-b. BL3&hyph;P or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving plants containing cloned genomes of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental effects on managed or natural ecosystems in which there exists the possibility of reconstituting the complete and functional genome of the infectious agent by genomic complementation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in planta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-C&hyph;5-c. BL4&hyph;P containment is recommended for experiments with a small number of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents, such as the soybean rust fungus ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phakospora pachyrhizi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and maize streak or other viruses in the presence of their specific arthropod vectors, that have the potential of being serious pathogens of major U.S. crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-C&hyph;5-d. BL3&hyph;P containment is recommended for experiments involving sequences encoding potent vertebrate toxins introduced into plants or associated organisms. Recombinant DNA containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of &lt;100 nanograms per kilogram body weight fall under Section III-B&hyph;1 and require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-C&hyph;5-e. BL3&hyph;P or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments with microbial pathogens of insects or small animals associated with plants if the recombinant DNA-modified organism has a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-C&hyph;6. Experiments Involving More than 10 Liters of Culture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules, shall be used. Appendix K describes containment conditions Good Large Scale Practice through BL3&hyph;Large Scale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-C&hyph;7. Human Gene Transfer Experiments Not Covered by Sections III-A-2, III-B&hyph;2, III-B&hyph;3, and Not Considered Exempt Under Section V-U  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that are not covered by Sections III-A&hyph;2, III-B&hyph;2, III-B&hyph;3, and that are not considered exempt under Section V-U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this category prior to their initiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-D. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Notice Simultaneous With Initiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Experiments not included in Sections III-A, III-B, III-C, III-E, and their subsections are considered in Section III-D. All such experiments may be conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration document (see Section III-C) shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional Biosafety Committee at the time the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and approves all such proposals, but Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the experiment is not required (see Section IV-A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic prokaryotes and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III-D and may be conducted at BL1 containment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-D&hyph;1. Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant DNA Molecules Containing No More than Two-Thirds of the Genome of Any Eukaryotic Virus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see Section V-S)) may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments, it must be demonstrated that the cells lack helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used. If helper virus is present, procedures specified under Section III-C&hyph;3 should be used. The DNA may contain fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-D&hyph;2. Experiments Involving Whole Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section covers experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified whole plants, and/or experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified organisms associated with whole plants, except those that fall under Section III-A, III-B, III-C, or III-E. It should be emphasized that knowledge of the organisms and judgment based on accepted scientific practices should be used in all cases in selecting the appropriate level of containment. For example, if the genetic modification has the objective of increasing pathogenicity or converting a non-pathogenic organism into a pathogen, then a higher level of containment may be appropriate depending on the organism, its mode of dissemination, and its target organisms. By contrast, a lower level of containment may be appropriate for small animals associated with many types of recombinant DNA-modified plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-a. BL1&hyph;P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant DNA-containing plants and plant-associated microorganisms not covered in Section III-D&hyph;2-b or other sections of the NIH Guidelines. Examples of such experiments are those involving recombinant DNA-modified plants that are not noxious weeds or that cannot interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area, and experiments involving whole plants and recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic (see Section V-W) microorganisms that have no recognized potential for rapid and widespread dissemination or for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhizobium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp. and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agrobacterium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b. BL2&hyph;P or BL1&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for the following experiments:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(1). Plants modified by recombinant DNA that are noxious weeds or can interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(2). Plants in which the introduced DNA represents the complete genome of a non-exotic infectious agent (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(3). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic microorganisms that have a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(4). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified exotic microorganisms that have no recognized potential for serious natural ecosystems (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

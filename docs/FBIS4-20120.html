			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "VVD Ready To Work With D66 and CDA"] </F>   [Text] Last night in Amsterdam, VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkstein expressed a strong  preference for a new coalition government between the VVD, D66  [Democrats 66] and CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]. He also  announced that the VVD would not enter into a coalition with the  CDA and PvdA [Labor Party].    The chances of seeing a "purple coalition" between the D66,  PvdA and VVD, as advocated so strongly by D66 leader Hans Van  Mierlo, seem very slight following these statements, as PvdA  leader Wim Kok yesterday expressed his preference for a  coalition between the PvdA, D66 and CDA.    According to Bolkstein, only one of the present coalition  members CDA and PvdA can be included in the new government.  "One of the coalition parties belongs on the opposition  benches. This government has seen to that."    He is least enthusiastic about seeing the PvdA return to  government as he sees the party as strongly divided in the light  of contrasting statements by prominent PvdA members. This is  why the liberal leader prefers a government formed by the  expected election winners, the VVD and D66, supplemented by the  CDA. Speaking to EO radio, Kok stated that a coalition between  the PvdA and VVD was less obviously evident than a pact between  the PvdA and CDA. Kok probably does not rule out in advance any  possibility of cooperation with the VVD, but he does not want to  create the impression of exuding an "anti-CDA" sentiment. CDA  leader Brinkman reacted with great satisfaction to this:  "Fortunately, PvdA members are repenting."    Kok admitted that he had agreed with Bolkstein last summer  that the parties would not mutually exclude one another from a  coalition. But yesterday he stated that cooperation with the VVD  was now less evident due to the election programs. Major  obstacles not only include the minimum system of social security  proposed by the VVD, but also authorization for migrants. Kok  believes that speculation regarding a "purple coalition" of the  Pvda, VVD and D66 is excessively dictated by an "anti-CDA  sentiment."    D66 will not join a future government unless there are new  initiatives for social and political reform, D66 leader Van  Mierlo said yesterday in Utrecht. "I do not see us as part of a  government which does not make a start with the referendum. The  D66 is never going to simply shuffle along. We will not be a  part of that. W will press for a new approach."    Van Mierlo stated that D66 has become an essential component  of any new government. He also no longer wants to remain a  bystander.</p>

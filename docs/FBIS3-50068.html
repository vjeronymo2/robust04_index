			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vuk Draskovic, the  leading candidate of Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia],  leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO], declared this  afternoon that he had told Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  that an opposition deputy should be appointed president of the  Serbian National Assembly. After a two-hour meeting with the  Serbian president, Draskovic told reporters that a stable  government can arise from the present parliament -- where  political forces are equally balanced -- only if the post of  assembly president goes to an opposition deputy.    He recalled that Depos holds the largest number of seats  among the opposition parties. The SPO leader said he is  convinced that the Socialist Party of Serbia "will not give up  the position of republican assembly speaker." He added that he  agreed with the Serbian president that there can be no ruling  party and opposition in the struggle against hunger, poverty,  the sanctions, and the war.    We should coordinate political strategy on these issues,  which are common objectives, stressed the SPO leader. Draskovic  said that he reached agreement in principle with the Serbian  president that a spirit of tolerance should prevail in the new  republican assembly where, he said, facts should be at  loggerheads, not people and parties.    The SPO leader underlined that he cannot say he is a greater  optimist after the meeting with President Milosevic, but that he  is not a greater pessimist either. He said that he never  shouted "Saddam, Saddam" [the slogan of the 8 March 1991  antigovernment demonstrations in Belgrade when protesters  shouted "Slobo-Saddam"], and that his criticism is not aimed at  the person, but at the politician's behavior and actions. He  said he is satisfied with the talks with Milosevic, that the  meeting was frank and dynamic, and he described the president of  Serbia, whom he met for the first time, as a congenial and witty  man.</p>

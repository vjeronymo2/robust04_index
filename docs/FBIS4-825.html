			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lena Slachmuiljder and Bereng Mtimkulu] </F>   [Text] Inkatha's war plans began falling into place this  week as the kwaZulu government merged its Umfolozi army with the  homeland's police force -- a move that is seen as an attempt to  licence its private army. This followed the collapse of  international mediation between itself, the government and the  ANC.    Inkatha's Youth Brigade announced on Friday [15 April] that  it would embark on "rolling mass action," involving a week-long  stayaway beginning tomorrow with marches in various cities and  townships.    Reports from sources in Natal indicate that hostel dwellers  were evacuating women and children from the hostels in  anticipation of a civil war which they say will start soon.    In another development, the kwaZulu Police (KZP) has  absorbed  about 1,000 trainees from the kwaZulu government-sponsored  training camp adjacent to the Umfolozi Game Reserve.    This has led to fears that the move might be aimed at  providing cover to the Umfolozi trainees so that they can carry  out attacks with impunity.    The trainees are to be employed by the KZP as special  constables and will be under the command of the KZP's Internal  Stability Unit (ISU). They will then be dispatched in groups of  200 to the districts of Esikhawini, Umlazi, Nqutu, Madadeni,  kwaMashu and Ulundi.    They have been trained in basic skills of self-defence and  shooting, according to camp commander Philip Powell, an Inkatha  Central Committee member. It is also assumed that the trainees  were brain-washed with anti-ANC propaganda.    KZP Commissioner Lieutenant-General Roy During confirmed  that  the recruitment of the Umfolozi trainees -- as they have since  become known -- was underway. He insisted that the recruits  would receive further training by the kwaZulu Police. This is  an unlikely scenario, as the election is due to take place in 10  days' time.    Inkatha's Youth Brigade threatened to turn South Africa into  a second Bosnia if the ANC and the police try to prevent their  planned marches into Johannesburg and parts of Natal this coming  week.    Public transport will be disrupted during the week-long  stayaway and there are reports that taxis, buses and trains that  defy the stayaway call will be attacked as the passengers  travelling in them will be regarded as ANC supporters.    SA Police regional commissioner Lt-Gen Koos Calitz on Friday  banned marches and gatherings in Witwatersrand magisterial  districts. The banning orders, promulgated under the unrest  regulations of the Public Safety Act, were "deemed necessary for  the combating or prevention of public disturbance, disorder,  riot or public violence," Gen Calitz said. The banning orders  cover Alberton, Boksburg, Benoni, Springs, Germiston, Kempton  Park, Johannesburg, Randburg, Roodepoort, Krugersdorp, and  Westonaria.    The ANC and its youth league have called on the security  forces to ensure that it deploys enough personnel to protect  innocent people. The ANC also called on the security forces to  ensure that Inkatha impis [group of warriors] are stopped from  leaving the hostels.    Meanwhile, the Johannesburg City Council yesterday said that  several areas of the city will be cordoned off from 6am  tomorrow. Razor-wire installations will be erected in some of  the streets -- especially along roads leading to ANC  headquarters at Shell House -- and at the Library gardens and  Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) offices in Kruis Street.  A strong police presence is expected in the city centre.    "The city council is opposed to unlawful marches that  endanger the safety of people and interfere with their right to  go about their normal daily lives," town clerk Nicky Padayachee  said.</p>

The guerrillas' plan to prevent the election process has  been  expanded to eastern Santander Department, where the subversives  have intimidated voters in rural areas. Voter lists were  destroyed in the area's municipalities and a warning was issued:  No one will be allowed to go to the voting sites.    In the 12 municipalities where guerrilla raids have taken  place, the rebels have warned that they will control highways  until election day and will close the area to visiting political  candidates.    The area where the death threat against voters has been made  includes the municipalities of Surata, Chata, Matanzas, and  Veta, all of them in eastern Santander, Santa Elena, [words  indistinct], and Pata, where police have not been allowed to  enter, and the entire province of Velez, where the guerrillas  threaten to kill any candidates who attempt to visit the area.  On Monday the mayors will present a report on the situation to  the defense minister and the Army commander.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: 'Final' plan for Uni Storebrand THE board appointed by the Norwegian government to administer Uni Storebrand, the country's biggest insurer, yesterday unveiled a 'final' proposal for recapitalising the crippled group designed to convert debt to equity and to raise fresh capital. Uni collapsed in August into the hands of public administrators under the strain of NKr4bn (Dollars 608m) worth of debt incurred through financing its 28.3 per cent, NKr4.7bn, non-influential stake in Skandia Forsikrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. The proposal is comprised of a write-down of Uni's outstanding shares, conversion of debt to equity and a share issue based on cash payment for subscription. Uni's administration board is hoping to raise about NKr1bn through the issue. The board has set a deadline of November 30 for creditors to respond to the recapitalisation proposal. Uni's biggest creditor is West Deutsche Landesbank with an estimated NKr1bn in outstanding debt. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has outstanding debt totalling NKr400m and the country's three biggest banks - Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank - all hold Uni debt. Under the terms of the proposal, creditors with outstanding debt of more than NKr5m can covert their debt partly to shares in the company and partly to convertible bonds - which can later be converted to shares - and partly to ordinary long-term bonds. Creditors with outstanding debt of less than NKr5m can convert their debt into ordinary long-term bonds which will be bourse-listed. Uni's nominal share value of NKr20 a share is to be written down to NKr1 a share with a subscription price for the new share issue set at NKr2 a share. In an earlier proposal which creditors rejected, shares were to be written down to NKr2 each, while subscription to the share issue was set at NKr3 a share.</p>

We would not like  it to turn into a mere declaration," said Mikhail Poltoranin,  chairman of the Duma Committee for Informational Politics,  during debates on legislative activities held in the lower house  of the Russian Parliament.    Poltoranin cautioned lawmakers against including into the  memorandum the notion of "confronting forces". Poltoranin  described today's Russia as "a raft swiftly carried away by the  stream to a huge waterfall." "We most row together in order to  reach a safe spot," he said.    He believes that the president and the Government must offer  anti-crisis measures which would be adopted by all, parliament  included. For its part, the State Duma must adopt a package of  legislative acts which would ensure full implementation of these  measures, he added.    Poltoranin believes that definite guarantees must be given  both by the judicial power and public organisations, including  trade unions, which "should not shake Russia with strikes," as  he put it. Poltoranin urged journalists to undertake commitments  to objectively cover the activities of all branches of power and  processes which take place in Russia.</p>

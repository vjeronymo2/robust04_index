			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Gandhi unveils radical election manifesto MR Rajiv Gandhi, India's Congress party leader, yesterday launched his party's election manifesto with a pledge to cut government spending by 10 per cent in a first year of office and to embark on a privatisation programme. A Congress government would allow public sector companies to sell stock to the public. And to help mobilise private savings, it would allow the private sector to establish mutual funds - an area now reserved to state owned institutions and nationalised banks. Congress would also throw open road construction to the private sector. Later, the public sector would withdraw from areas such as manufacturing, hotels, petrochemicals, refineries and electric power. The emphasis on deregulation and liberalisation reflects the views of younger economists and politicians close to Mr Gandhi who believe there is no alternative to radical change. In setting out a timetable of reform - a major feature of the manifesto - they believe a new government must act rapidly if it is not to be ensnared by bureaucratic hurdles. With inflation at more than 12 per cent and interest payments absorbing a third of government revenues, the proposed 10 per cent reduction in expenditure represents a substantial cut in real terms. Mr Gandhi said it would be 'spread across the board' - subsidies, salaries and defence. The manifesto adds that expenditure would be held at the same level in nominal terms during the second and third year of a Congress government. Though there must be doubts whether a new government will in practice implement such severe cuts, the manifesto implies that Mr Gandhi accepts the conditions that would go with a substantial IMF borrowing. The most important of these would be a major cut in the budget deficit. The manifesto on this score will help restore Mr Gandhi's credibility with foreign governments and creditors at a time when India is seeking to avoid defaulting on its foreign debt. Mr Gandhi has been blamed by diplomats for the postponement of the March budget which precipitated the decline in India's creditworthiness. The belief that Congress would implement an IMF package and that a Congress-led government will emerge from the elections has prompted a sharp rise on the Bombay stock market this week. Congress party officials are privately less sanguine, believing that no party will gain an overall majority and that this will reduce the prospects for radical change. The passages on the economy constitute only a small part of the manifesto that Mr Gandhi launched yesterday. He answered questions straightforwardly and confidently, and without the facetiousness he has previously shown. The manifesto shows Congress anxious to win votes from the very poor and the Moslems - two traditional sources of support. Mr Gandhi promised Moslems he would prevent further mosques from being 'reclaimed' as Hindu temples. This concession to Moslem sentiment would seem to pave the way for a compromise with Hindus over the proposed new temple at Ayodhya. In contrast to Mr Gandhi's known personal beliefs, the manifesto promises support for job reservation for the poor and backward castes. But unlike Mr V P Singh's National Front which has pledged up to to 59 per cent job reservation in the central government for the poor and lower castes, Congress refrains from giving percentages.</p>

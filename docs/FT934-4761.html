			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Observer: PC plodders They seek him here, they seek him there; but they can't find him because they haven't looked in Bangkok. Scotland Yard had been hunting Brazil's most wanted man, Paulo Cesar Farias, alleged to be at the centre of the corruption ring, the discovery of which brought down former president Fernando Collor. Farias eluded arrest in the UK last month, where he had been living since fleeing Brazil in June. But unfortunately for PC, as he is universally known in Brazil, he has a face as familiar in Brazil as any soap opera star, and was spotted by a visiting Brazilian in a posh Bangkok hotel. He is now, according to the Brazilian government, being kicked out and sent home.</p>

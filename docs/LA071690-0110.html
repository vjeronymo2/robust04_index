			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ROYAL LIBEL DAMAGES AWARDED  </P> <P> A Toronto public relations consultant won substantial undisclosed libel damages  today over a London newspaper report on rumors of a romance between her and  Mark Phillips, the estranged husband of Britain's Priness Anne.  </P> <P> New Zealand-born Kathy Birks sued over an article in the tabloid Today last  September, headlined "Mark's falling under the spell of seductive Kathy."  </P> <P> The report alleged she had become Phillips' constant companion on his business  trips across the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Birks' lawyer, Keith Schilling, told the High Court in London that the article  appeared after the announcement last August that Phillips and Princess Anne  were to live apart.  </P> <P> Schilling said Birks, who lives in Toronto, was "concerned that the article  suggested she had seduced Capt. Phillips and readers might have concluded that  she was to blame, wholly or in part, for the breakdown of his marriage."  </P> <P> Today said any such suggestion would be untrue and agreed to pay Birks damages  and her legal costs.  </P></p>

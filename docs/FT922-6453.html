			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Wine: A visit to the claret frontier - Castillon wines are worth tasting ON THE eastern frontier of the Gironde, opposite the department of the Dordogne, lies the small red wine district of the Cotes de Castillon. The town it is based on is called Castillon-La-Bataille, commemorating a defeat, in the year 1453, which led to the withdrawal of the English from south-west France. The Cotes (which include nine communes) are a continuation of St Emilion in soil composition and grape varieties. In the last century, under that name, they had a high reputation. But then came a succession of setbacks: phylloxera; the banning - in 1921 - of St Emilion or St Emilionnais on their labels; and the start of the Appellation Controlee system in 1935. This reduced the Cotes to little more than generic red Bordeaux; vins de medecine, used by the Bordeaux trade to give body and character to weaker wines from elsewhere in the huge Gironde region. The position improved in 1955, when the appellation Bordeaux Cotes de Castillon was approved. And then, in 1989, the word Bordeaux did not have to be shown on the label; it is now little used. This is Merlot country, as in St Emilion. An average of 70 per cent of the grapes are Merlot, as demonstrated by the single co-operative in Gardegan. The balance of grapes is about 25 per cent Cabernet Franc, with a little Cabernet Sauvignon, although there are exceptions. The wines are less tannic than Bourg and Blaye. other Cotes wines. As in St Emilion, the soil composition varies. Near the river it is more sandy and alluvial. But on the slopes, and above all on the plateau, it is clay-chalk, producing bigger, better-structured and longer-living wines. On a recent visit to the two plateau estates of Castegens and Pitray, I drank 1962s which had plenty of colour, body and character. Castillon wines generally have deep colour, well maintained with age, a welcoming aroma which may recall blackcurrants, chocolate or tobacco, and a powerful but not a coarse taste. Of recent vintages, I found the '90s, shortly to be bottled, outstanding for their concentration. The '89s have, perhaps, more elegance. The '88s are big, firm, traditional clarets. They should keep very well, though for current consumption I tasted more than one '87 which made very agreeable drinking. The '86s still have that strike on the palate, but the '85s are probably at their best: the vintage I would choose for drinking now, and for several years ahead. The '83s are softer, and for opening fairly soon. To buy for laying down, I would acquire '90 and '89. I tasted a range of 16 of the latter (not including those of the two mentioned above) and they are certainly not ready. For the record, those I preferred were Belcier, Grand Tertre, Hauts de Poupille, Lavergne, Poupille, Peyrou and Roc de Joanne. Among other properties I visited, whose wines appealed to me, were Grand Tuillac, Blanzac, Brehat, Montpezat, Estaign and Flojague - but these were a handful in a district carpeted with vines. Estate names to be found on UK merchant lists will largely depend on those favoured by the Bordeaux merchants. Belcier and Pitray may be commoner than most: also Dom La Clariere, owned by Tony Laithwaite, head of Bordeaux Direct, whose wines are sold in its shops in Reading and elsewhere in southern England. However, about 40 per cent of Castillon wines are still sold in bulk to the Bordeaux trade, where they lose their identity in branded blends. A further substantial percentage, depending on the individual estate, is sold direct to private clients within France. A growing problem is the use of oak barrels to mature the bottled wines, which are nearly all developed in cement vats, (though some stainless steel is used for this and for fermentation). Experiments with oak are being applied in wealthy properties like Castegens, Belcier and Estaign, and in other cellars a few barrels will be seen, but the problem is not only the cost of the barrels - FFr3,000 for new ones, and half that for two-year-olds  -but the fact that it puts up the ex-chateau price to the Bordeaux trade by an unacceptable FFr6 to FFr10 a bottle. Traditionally, Castillon has lived in the shadow of St Emilion and even its immediate neighbour, the 'satellite' Puissegin-St Emilion, secures a per tonneau (1,200 bottles) price of FFr12,000 compared with Castillon's FFr8,000. Prices of some Castillon wines on UK lists appear unnecessarily high in relation to growers' receipts, for they should cost from Pounds 4.50 to Pounds 6 a bottle. As with other lesser Bordeaux appellations, few foreign buyers seem to have the time or opportunity for personal visits and direct buying. The Cote commune of St Philippe boasts the highest above-sea-level height in the whole Gironde - more than 350 ft - and the district has surely the most engaging countryside in the whole department, with steep valleys, tree-lined hills, and old stone villages and hamlets. The vineyard estates include such impressive 15th century castles as Castegens and Flojague, and the fantastic mid-19th century Pitray, in Viollet le Duc renaissance-style The cellars of these and other properties are open to visitors by appointment. This can be obtained through the office of the Syndicat Viticole des Cotes de Castillon in the Allees de la Republique in that town.</p>

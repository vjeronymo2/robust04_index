			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Air NZ profits advance as route revenue climbs AIR New Zealand yesterday announced a 21.2 per cent increase in profits to NZDollars 139.5m (USDollars 76.6m) for the year ended June, helped by higher revenue on its routes to Asia, the US and Europe. Directors said that while the airline continued to outperform most of its international competitors, returns were still less than needed to appropriately reward shareholders and finance growth. The profit was some NZDollars 15m higher than analysts had been expecting, and the improvement was unexpectedly helped by abnormal gains of NZDollars 3.7m. Last year the airline reported abnormal losses of NZDollars 13.1m. Air NZ, whose major shareholders are Brierley Investments and Qantas, reported operating earnings of NZDollars 140.3m, against NZDollars 134.3m. Equity accounted losses of associates were NZDollars 4.5m, against NZDollars 6m. Directors said that the group was budgeting for further growth in passenger traffic on Asian routes. However, it expected little if any growth on internal routes or services to Australia and only modest growth in the UK, Europe and US traffic. The company said it had successfully handled an increase in 8.9 per cent in additional capacity. The dividend is being maintained at an unchanged six cents a share, bringing the total to 10 cents this year.</p>

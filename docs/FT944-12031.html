			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Demand for capital behind rate rises Sir, Since January, the US has put up interest rates five times. High yields on fixed interest have become more attractive to institutions, putting pressure on equities. That is why, by October 21, the FT-SE 100 had fallen 12.25 per cent. These rises are America's pre-emptive strikes to prevent inflation. The markets are still nervous about inflation and the implications of further rises in interest rates. Yet there is minimal sign of inflation anywhere in the world, apart from a few commodity prices. So is this the real explanation of the markets' current uncertainty? We are beginning to think not. Five years ago, China began capitalist-type expansionist developments, but had hardly drawn on the world's capital. Nor had Latin America, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany. India is now open for business, as well as all the Russian satellites. Given such an increased demand for the world's capital, surely this is the main reason for the recent rises in interest rates, not inflation.

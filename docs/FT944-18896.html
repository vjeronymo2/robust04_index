			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Bottomley signals delay on NHS local pay deals Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday admitted that locally determined pay could not be introduced comprehensively next year for National Health Service workers. She told the Trust Federation annual conference in Bournemouth that, like the independent pay review bodies, she expected to see a move to local pay in the NHS over the next few years. She described it as a 'natural development' of trust status. This appears to contradict evidence submitted by her department to the independent pay review body for nurses and midwives last month. The submission called for the body not to recommend an across-the-board increase, but to speed moves towards local arrangements. Meanwhile, the leader of the NHS Trust Federation - a group representing the bulk of hospital trusts - warned that most hospitals would not be able to make the move over the next six months. Those that were successful were likely to introduce performance-related pay in stages, starting with awards to health workers rather than core staff, said Mr Rodney Walker, federation chairman. In its evidence to the pay review body the department said it wanted 'a strong steer to the continued development and implementation of local arrangements by leaving employers with maximum scope for local action'. It added: 'Clearly, any across-the-board recommendations would inhibit such developments.' Only about 11 NHS trusts, which include community and ambulance services as well as hospitals, have introduced comprehensive local pay packages, including performance-related pay. Many trusts have expressed concern that they may not have the packages in place by April, the date for review-body pay settlements, and the target set by the NHS executive for local pay packages. Unions representing nurses, which have submitted an 8.3 per cent pay claim when the government is seeking a second annual total pay-bill freeze, said they were bemused by the health department. However, Mr Bob Abberley, head of the health division at Unison, said he was not interested in the confusion. He said: 'We think the whole idea of performance-related pay is daft and wrong and the best thing the government can do is to drop the whole thing entirely.' Mrs Bottomley said in her speech that local pay would only work if trusts worked with staff, explaining and communicating every inch of the way. 'That job starts now,' she said.</p>

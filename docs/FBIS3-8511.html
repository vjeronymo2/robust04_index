			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by S. Lovrenovic on statements of Herceg-Bosna </F> officials in Mostar; date not given: "Federation Simultaneous  With Confederacy"]    [Text] Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential  council, said about the Washington agreement that "all the  positions contained in the Washington documents were supported  by the presidential council and the party leadership, and during  the talks in Vienna we will try to include what was emphasized  at the session in Mostar. My personal opinion is that the  preliminary agreement on the future Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation anticipates a much looser union than the former  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, details and  the final assessment will only be available after the final  proposal for the constitutional documents is put together in  Vienna."    Ivan Bender, president of the chamber of representatives of  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said that "the Croat people  consider these documents and everything they imply to be one of  the possible solutions in the many possible events we may  encounter in the upcoming period. Our negotiating team must get  expert reinforcement, especially now that all the details of the  future union are the issue, to make all the solutions as close  to our positions as possible. This agreement on federation can  only be concluded if the confederacy between the Republic of  Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is established simultaneously."    "After the document drafts are coordinated, the chamber of  representatives will discuss them and give its opinion before  the possible referendum. Our declaration, made at the session  in Livno, is a valid document, and our negotiators bear that in  mind. The preliminary agreement contains certain differences in  relation to the documents passed at the chamber of  representatives, but we will discuss everything after the work  with the negotiations is completed," added Bender.    Pero Markovic, president of the Executive Committee of the  Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] for Bosnia-Herzegovina,  believes that "not all the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina are in  the same position with regard to where they come from. In that  respect, they supported various solutions, which had to be put  into a single solution. This is why we support our negotiating  team and the expert groups in everything they have done so far.  At this meeting, Croat unity was expressed, and there were no  separate positions regarding the agreement and general politics.  The HDZ has not changed its policies. The HDZ of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has not given up on the ethnic principle that  it incorporated in the Cutilheiro, Vance-Owen, Owen-Stoltenberg,  and all other plans," said Markovic.</p>

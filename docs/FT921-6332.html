			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Brazil and Argentina look towards June deal on foreign debt LATIN AMERICA's first and third most indebted countries are on track to secure outline agreements with bank lenders before mid-year. These could represent a significant step towards resolution of the foreign debt problems that have plagued them for a decade, according to bankers. Brazil and Argentina could secure the outline accords by early summer, ahead of the 10th anniversary in August of the announcement by Mexico that it could not meet its debts: a move which marked the start of the third world debt crisis. 'I'm optimistic that we can get agreements in principle with both governments by June,' said Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, the US bank that leads the bank advisory committees to both countries. Agreements in principle leave many details to be resolved, and acceptance by almost all bank lenders is required before they take effect. This process usually takes several months. Bankers have long said that an Argentine deal should be easier to achieve than one for Brazil. 'The Argentine deal should follow the text book more closely. Brazil is improving, but it's more of a minefield,' said Mr Paul Luke of Chartered WestLB, a London-based merchant bank and debt trader. The 'text book' is provided by Mexico's debt restructuring completed in March 1990, the first large deal to be completed under the initiative named after the US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady. The main difference between the two is the availability of the so-called enhancements, guarantees for interest and capital payments on concessional bonds that the governments will issue to banks in exchange for old bank loans. Argentina is well placed to cover the maximum Dollars 3bn in enhancements it will need to restructure roughly Dollars 24bn of bank debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears. Its expected three-year extended fund facility (EFF) with the International Monetary Fund will trigger extra funds from Japan and other sources for the enhancement pool. Brazil, which announced late on Wednesday that it had secured agreement for rescheduling part of its Dollars 24bn debt to government creditors of the Paris Club, has a smaller Dollars 2bn pool available for enhancements on its Dollars 40bn bank debt. Its 18-month standby loan from the IMF attracts less money than an EFF, a facility unavailable to Brazil until it has met its targets for the standby loan. The lack of an EFF means there will be no funds from Japan, which is supporting the Argentine programme, while the World Bank is holding back money until it has had time to analyse the success of the IMF programme. This shortage of funds will have a several consequences. The two sides will have to agree - for the first time in any Brady-style deal - the phasing-in of enhancements over time. Banks accepting concessional bonds will therefore need confidence in Brazil's longer-term ability and willingness to top up the pool of enhancements. It also means that Brazil will have to encourage more banks to make further loans rather than take concessional bonds, in part by asking them to put up a smaller percentage of exposure in new loans (probably 16-17 per cent for Brazil versus 25 per cent for Argentina). This will reduce the scale of debt reduction achieved by Brazil. That is not to suggest that Argentine negotiations will be problem-free. There is concern about inflation - its current IMF standby programme assumes 7 per cent inflation for 1992, while retail prices will have risen by more than 5 per cent in the first two months of the year. There are significant differences too between the latest Argentine proposal and the banks' response. Mr Lawrence Brainard, an economist with Goldman Sachs and a former leading economic adviser to several bank advisory committees, suggests that banks will not gain any benefits if they push Argentina to make greater concessions. 'The Argentine offer to the banks is even a bit generous leaving only modest room, in our view, for further improvements,' said Mr Brainard, basing his analysis on the government's fiscal position. If the banks push for too much, they increase the likelihood that the deal will fail. He has also pointed out that the economic boost obtained by Mexico following its agreement with banks will probably not be seen in Argentina, in part because the accord is already discounted by financial markets. A deal will mean Argentina increasing interest payments to banks from the Dollars 60m a month it is currently paying, rather than reducing them as in the case of Mexico.</p>

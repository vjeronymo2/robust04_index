			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCDAVID GETS 10 3-POINTERS, 48 POINTS FOR CLAIREMONT  </P> <P> Ray McDavid set a San Diego Section record with 10 three-pointers and finished  with 48 points and 17 rebounds to lead Clairemont High School past Kearny,  85-84, in overtime in a City Western League game Wednesday at Clairemont.  </P> <P> Clairemont had 14 three-pointers.  </P> <P> Facing a box-and-one defense, McDavid, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, made 10 of 11  three-point attempts and 8 of 11 inside the three-point line. His three-pointer  with 3 seconds left in regulation sent the game into overtime.  </P> <P> "We would get down by seven or eight points and Ray would just shoot us back  into it by canning a couple three-pointers," Clairemont Coach Greg Lee said.  </P> <P> Kearny (11-13, 3-6) was ahead most of the game on the strength of 29-of-35  free-throw shooting. Clairemont (12-14, 4-5) made 9 of 15.  </P> <P> Kearny's Omar Salihi missed a chance to send the game into a second overtime  when he missed the second of two free throws after time had expired.  </P></p>

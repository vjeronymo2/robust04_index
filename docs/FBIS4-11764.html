			<p>BFN     [Text] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, March 31 (AFP) --  Palestinian leaders here welcomed the imminent arrival of  international observers under Thursday's [31 March] Israel-PLO  security accord, but urged more steps to protect Palestinians.    Former Palestinian mayor Mustafa al-Natshah told AFP: "The  population in Hebron will only be safe when the 30 families of  Jewish settlers situated in the heart of Hebron are evacuated."    Some 400 settlers live scattered through the town of 120,000  people.    Al-Natshah added he was "satisfied" that 160 lightly-armed  observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy were to be sent to the  town under a deal signed Thursday in Cairo.    It is the first time that Israel has agreed to the  deployment  of an international force in territories under its control.    The PLO demanded protection for Palestinians living in  Hebron  after a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a mosque  here as a condition for returning to talks on launching  self-rule.    But leaders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine (DFLP) said in Damascus the agreement would not ensure  the safety of Palestinians in Hebron.    The two dissident factions are opposed to the Middle East  peace process.    PFLP deputy leader Abu-'Ali Mustafa said Palestinian  security  would be "impossible without the dismantlement of the  settlements."    DFLP spokesman Dawud Talhami said settlers would still  "continue to carry out massacres.    "The 160 international observers will not be able to react  seriously in face of the deployment of thousands of Israeli  soldiers," he added.    The president of Hebron university's graduate association  Ahmad Tamimi said the agreement was "a step forward", but added  Palestinians would never "know stability and security until the  settlers have left."    The deal reached between Israeli and PLO negotiators called  for the observers to be deployed immediately in Hebron. It  paved the way for an immediate resumption of autonomy talks on  Thursday, suspended for almost five weeks since the February 25  massacre.    A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the accord was "a first step  in  applying (UN) Security Council Resolution 904."    The resolution adopted on March 18 condemned the massacre  and  called for international protection for the Palestinians in the  occupied territories.    But the spokesman urged extra measures "to guarantee an  effective international protection for the Palestinian people,  its land and its holy sites."</p>

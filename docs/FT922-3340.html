			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Nordic insurer masterplan turns sour - Uni's ambitious merger scheme has come painfully unhinged Three of the most prominent Scandinavian insurers - Skandia, the region's biggest, Uni Storebrand of Norway and Hafnia of Denmark - have seen dramatic share price declines following an unsuccessful bid by the ambitious Uni to lead a merger between them. With premium rates rising and options elsewhere in the Scandinavian financial sector unattractive, the insurers could be worth buying for their recovery potential. Would-be buyers, however, are urged to be cautious. When Sweden's SE Banken sold its 28.2 per cent share in Skandia last November, Uni joined forces with Hafnia to accumulate a 47.7 per cent Skandia stake, and said that it intended to build a Nordic insurer big enough to compete in the newly liberalised European market. The effort has been blocked by Skandia's management and shareholders - which are protected by a voting structure skewed to protect the interests of small shareholders who own the majority of the equity - and the effort has now run into the sand, leaving both Uni and Hafnia substantially out of pocket. Both companies borrowed to fund their Skandia holdings, now worth more than 50 per cent less than at the time of purchase last year. A subsequent resolution of the dispute would have involved Uni exchanging its stake for Skandia's non-US reinsurance interests and Skandia taking over control of Hafnia. This collapsed largely because of nationalist inspired opposition from Hafnia's Danish pension fund owners. The result is a stand-off and continuing uncertainty. Skandia was trading yesterday at SKr109 (down more than 50 per cent on its price nine months ago); Uni Storebrand is languishing at NKr53, while Hafnia has seen over 75 per cent of its equity capitalisation disappear in the past 12 months. Few analysts are interested in the heavily indebted Hafnia which, in addition to its loss-making stake in Skandia, also owns over 30 per cent of its rival, Baltica; but Uni and Skandia excite some interest. Mr Tim Dawson of Merrill Lynch, is an enthusiast of both Uni and Skandia, which he says are 'reasonably cheap on fundamentals. It is difficult to see the downside. Any further price falls and the visible value would just start screaming at you.' Mr Angus Runciman of BNP Securities favours Skandia. With the takeover threat defeated and its potential predators humbled, he says, the Swedish company is now free to pursue a conservative strategy, focusing on the expansion of its less volatile life assurance business and a steady reduction in its cost base. The company has a strong solvency margin of around 75 per cent, and although earnings have slumped - partially as a result of losses from Scandinavian credit insurance and non-life insurance losses in the UK - a return to profits is on the cards in 1993 and 1994. Nonetheless, it remains heavily exposed to property values, with over 60 per cent of its 'solvency assets' tied up in Swedish real estate. Mr Bob Yates, of brokers Fox Pitt Kelton, reckons that property could decline further this year, and further dent the company's underlying asset base. Mr Yates agrees that the shares are around the floor but does not expect the recovery in earnings to be sufficient to provide support for the price until 1994. In the meantime he is concerned by the overhang of the Uni and Hafnia holdings. If a scheme could be found which would place the whole of the stock overhang, then at present price levels the share would represent reasonable value, says Mr Yates. 'If not, the stock could dribble out in bits and pieces and this could act as a brake.'</p>

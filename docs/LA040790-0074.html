			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TAXES AND TURMOIL IN BRITAIN;  </P> <P> WHY A NEW LEVY SPARKED RIOTS IN LONDON AND IS BEING CALLED MARGARET THATCHER'S  TITANIC.  </P> <P> The meeting of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet on Jan. 9, 1986, has  been called one of the most dramatic in British history.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, undercut by his boss in his plan to save  the ailing Westland helicopter firm, scooped up his papers and stormed out. A  few hours later he resigned, triggering one of the most serious political  crises of Thatcher's long career.  </P> <P> Few recall that the next item on the Cabinet agenda that day was a proposal,  warmly embraced by the prime minister, to change the way British citizens pay  for such local services as schools, libraries, street lighting and garbage  collection.  </P> <P> Now, four years later, the decision to levy a "poll tax" to pay for those  services is causing far more turmoil than the Westland affair.  </P> <P> On Friday, the Gallup Poll indicated that Thatcher's popularity had fallen to  the lowest level Gallup has ever recorded for a British prime minister. It  found her Conservative Party trailing its archrival, Labor, by 24.5%.  </P> <P> The main reason for this slide, according to 96% of those questioned, is the  so-called poll tax.  </P> <P> With a 98-seat majority in Parliament and two years to go before there must be  a general election, it would be as mistaken to write Thatcher off as it would  be to regard as typical of her opposition the rioters who ransacked central  London last weekend in an anti-poll tax demonstration.  </P> <P> But political opponents of every stripe see the tax as a possibly crippling  government error, and they are preparing to take advantage of the situation.  </P> <P> "More than at any time since Mrs. Thatcher took office in 1979 (the  Conservative Party) has its back to the wall," the strongly pro-government  Daily Telegraph commented Friday.  </P> <P> Robert Worcester, head of the MORI polling organization, observed: "The  Conservative Party is seen as divided, with an unpopular leader and unpopular  policies, and people are worn out with them. The poll tax is really a symbol --  of Thatcher not listening, not understanding, not trying to understand how  ordinary people react."  </P> <P> As people in England and Wales began receiving poll tax assessment notices in  the mail this week, a common response was that "it's just not fair."  </P> <P> In Scotland, the system went into effect last year, and about a third of the  tax bills have gone unpaid there.  </P> <P> David Griffiths, vice chairman of a fast-growing group that calls itself the  Anti-Poll Tax Federation, said: "It robs the poorest people for the benefit of  the richest. The vast majority of people feel a terrible injustice is being  done to them."  </P> <P> Ironically, one of the arguments in favor of abandoning the old property tax  system was that the new approach would be more equitable. Advocates of change  argued that it was not right that a widow living alone in her own house had to  pay as much in local property taxes as the household next door with five  working adults. Some people paid nothing at all.  </P> <P> The answer was the poll tax -- the "community charge," it is called officially  -- which replaces the property tax with a flat levy on each of Britain's 35  million or so adults.  </P> <P> The Conservatives were enthusiastic about the change because they saw political  advantage in it. They thought that if voters were made to realize the cost of  local services through a highly visible poll tax, as distinguished from the  largely hidden property tax, they would reject Labor Party members of local  councils and replace them with tight-fisted Conservatives.  </P> <P> There were a few naysayers. A Conservative reform group warned last summer that  the change "has all the makings of a disaster." And it went on to say: "The  poll tax is fair only in the sense that the Black Death was fair. It is  indiscriminate, striking at young and old, rich and poor, employed and  unemployed alike."  </P> <P> But the critics were overruled, even when they urged that the new system be  introduced gradually, over a period of several years.  </P> <P> The tax bills going out now vary from place to place. Assessments range from  the equivalent of about $250 an adult to $950, depending on the local  government's other sources of income -- business taxes and central-government  grants, for example -- as well as the relative efficiency of the local council.  The average assessment is about $575.  </P> <P> There are a handful of exemptions -- foreign diplomats living here and members  of some religious orders, for example, do not have to pay the tax. There is  also a scale of percentage reductions for people living on reduced incomes,  including pensioners, persons on welfare and students. Thus, nearly everyone  has to pay something and most have to pay the full assessments for their areas.  </P> <P> "It's not easy to be popular when you're asking 17 million additional people to  pay a tax," a Thatcher confidant said, referring to the impact of the change.  </P> <P> But there is more to it than that. The government calculated that as many as  60% of all households would be better off under the poll tax. Significantly,  that would include the majority of the homeowners, who make up a key  Conservative constituency.  </P> <P> But someone's arithmetic was faulty. According to a House of Commons study, 73%  of the adults in England and Wales will be worse off under the new system. The  study said fewer than 5 million households will gain under the plan against  more than 14 million that will lose, despite a system of "safety net" rebates.  </P> <P> For small businessman Keith Packham, in suburban Wimbledon, the new system  means that he and his wife owe the equivalent of nearly $1,200 in poll taxes,  compared to the $825 they paid last year in property tax.  </P> <P> Part of the problem is that some local councils took advantage of the change to  increase spending, knowing they could blame the inevitable result on the  central government. But the central authorities were also at fault. In  projecting local government costs, for example, they forecast inflation at 4%  instead of the actual 8%.  </P> <P> As a result, the average poll tax is a third higher than it was projected to  be.  </P> <P> Worst of all, many of Britain's wealthiest citizens are getting the greatest  benefit from the new tax system. For example, the head of the Conservative  local council in the Westminster section of London will pay one of the lowest  poll taxes in the country, the equivalent of about $300. This represents a  savings of many thousands of dollars compared to what she paid in property  taxes on her penthouse overlooking Hyde Park.  </P> <P> The injustice of it so bothered 72-year-old Sid Tierney, a retired shop steward  in Coventry, near Birmingham, that even though he stands to benefit from the  change he is campaigning against it.  </P> <P> "I feel we're going back to the Dickens days," Tierney said in an interview.  </P> <P> He said the system is hardest on young working-class families like that of his  daughter and her husband.  </P> <P> "They've shifted the unfairness from one group of people to another group," he  said. "It's so evil I've got to oppose it. And I'm not going to pay it."  </P> <P> Tony Travers, director of research for the Greater London Group of the London  School of Economics and a poll tax expert, said: "The fact is that the heaviest  losers are those who live in small houses and flats. The old rates were levied  based on the rental value of a property, so the bigger the house, the bigger  the rates."  </P> <P> The owner of a small flat in depressed northern England may have paid only $300  or so in property tax, but the poll tax for him and his wife could be triple  that.  </P> <P> The government has tried in a number of ways to make the poll tax more  palatable, in one instance putting a maximum on what certain local councils may  charge.  </P> <P> Officials say there will have to be more changes in the system next year, but  they still support the basic idea, and have announced that they will campaign  for forthcoming local elections under the banner "Conservative Councils Cost  You Less!"  </P> <P> "A desperate piece of cheek," Daily Telegraph columnist Ferdinand Mount  responded. "It cannot be emphasized too strongly that this is not simply an  unpopular tax; it is a rotten piece of legislation, vilely expensive to  administer and likely to clutter up the courts with non-payers in arrears for  years to come."  </P> <P> People who refuse to pay may see their wages attached and their personal goods  confiscated. They may even be sent to jail for up to three months.  </P> <P> The issue promises to be a lightning rod for anti-Thatcher and anti-government  sentiment later this month as the first poll tax installment payments come due  and the boycott movement gets under way in earnest.  </P> <P> "It won't be a deathblow with a sword," anti-poll tax campaigner Griffiths said  of the victory he expects to win. "It'll be more like we suffocate it."  </P> <P> But there will be no compromise, he pledged.  </P> <P> "We want (the tax) repealed, nothing less," he said. "We want it off the books  now. . . . We say that if she doesn't withdraw the tax, this will be her  Titanic. And we hope the captain will go down with the ship."  </P></p>

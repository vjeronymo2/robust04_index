			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ACRA acknowledges that its existing procedures achieve compliance with odometer disclosure requirements, but cites costs to the average nationwide car rental company of tens of thousands of dollars per year and the time-consuming nature of the process. Given the large number of vehicles at issue, this compliance cost does not appear unreasonable, and certainly does not compel a conclusion of hardship. Nor is such a conclusion compelled by concerns about the time expended in achieving compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the world of motor vehicle transfers, NHTSA is aware of other situations in which companies incur similar costs and time burdens associated with the employment of personnel that provide titling and registration services and act as agents for the purpose of odometer disclosure. For example, companies that lease vehicles for long terms also rely on ``drop shipments'' or ``courtesy deliveries'' when obtaining new vehicles. In these situations, the leasing companies typically pay set fees to dealers to prepare the new vehicles for operation and process the paperwork associated with the transfer of both the new and the old vehicles. In many instances, the services performed include executing mileage disclosures. These firms also experience similar, normal delays incident to obtaining the proper disclosures. NHTSA cannot conclude that the costs or burdens to the car rental industry are excessive or beyond those reasonably contemplated by the Congress in enacting the disclosure requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is impossible to downplay the large number of vehicles proposed for exemption or alternate treatment under this petition. The total rental fleet put into service in 1992 numbered 1,532,000 passenger cars and light trucks, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or almost 13 percent of the 12 million new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the country during that year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Moreover, NHTSA cannot distinguish the merits of ACRA's arguments from those that might be advanced by the leasing industry, as discussed above. If a similar exemption were granted to the leasing industry, which placed a total of 1,543,000 passenger cars and light trucks into service in 1992, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it would encompass an additional 13 percent of the new vehicles sold that year. While the risk to the integrity of the system may not appear great in the rental industry situation, the same cannot be said with respect to the leasing industry. Prior to the passage of the Act, odometer tampering in leased vehicles was rampant, and served as a major impetus for Congressional action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Automotive Fleet, 1993 Fact Book, Vol. 32 Supp. 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. 20.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> American Automobile Manufacturers Association, Motor Vehicle Facts and Figures '93, pp. 18, 20.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Automotive Fleet, p. 20.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conclusion, NHTSA does not believe that it possesses the authority to grant the relief requested by the petitioner, based on the intent of Congress and recent court decisions. Moreover, granting the relief requested would be against the expressed interest of the States, the very entities charged with enforcing the odometer disclosure procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the foregoing reasons, the petition is denied.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on April 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John Womack, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Chief Counsel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Highway Traffic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10759 Filed 5&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

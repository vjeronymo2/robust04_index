			<p>BFN     [Text] The Honorary Chairman of the People's Party of Free  Russia, ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy has declared that  the party's prime task must be a fight for early presidential  elections. Speaking at the opening of a party congress in Moscow  on Saturday, he called the current official Russian policy  "economic terror" and stressed that there currently was "an  unpopular police regime" in power.    In Rutskoy's view, the December 12, 1993 elections showed  the  collapse of the centrism concept. "There can be no center  between the robbers and robbed", he noted. In his words, time  has come to decide whether to agree with "the police regime" or  form an opposition to it. He believes the party should initiate  the merger of opposition forces "in a mighty social-patriotic  movement, capable of leading the people and winning elections."  The goals of this movement, he said, will be national,  cultural, and spiritual rebirth of the country, "restoration of  Russia as a great power within the USSR boundaries:, fight  against crime, and creation of a prosperous socially-oriented  economy.    At the same time, Rutskoy admitted that adapters continued  to  work in the party along with those planted to destroy it. "I  cannot extend a hand to those who at the most critical moment  waited to see who would prevail", Rutskoi remarked and added  "time has come to get rid of the junk." However, he recognized  as justified the criticism addressed to him that he had paid  neglected internal party activity and had quite often failed to  consult party officials bodies in decision-making. [sentence as  received]    Recalling what happened in Moscow in October of 1993, he  declared: "We will never forget the died [as received] heroes ,  nor will we ever forgive those who shot at parliament."    Attending the Congress are 126 delegates from 60 regional  organizations. The delegates are to endorse a comprehensive  party declaration and elect the steering bodies.

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON THE TABLOIDS  </P> <P> Teen star Drew Barrymore's account of her drug and alcohol addiction in this  week's People developed partly as a preemptive strike against the tabloid  press, according to the reporter who interviewed the 13-year-old actress for  the first-person account.  </P> <P> Todd Gold of the magazine's Los Angeles bureau says that at least one tabloid  writer was on Barrymore's trail, apparently after overhearing a comment in a  studio commissary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Garbled Accounts  </P> <P> "He heard someone say something like, 'Yeah, Drew can read (for a part) after  she gets out of rehab,' " Gold explained, noting that tabloids did run short,  garbled accounts of Barrymore's hospitalization. The tabloid reporter began  staking out rehabilitation centers in the Los Angeles area and eventually  spotted Barrymore's mother paying a visit to one, Gold added, noting that the  tabloid type passed himself off as a medical professional.  </P> <P> By picking a magazine that offered a first-person format, Barrymore, now free  of drugs and alcohol, was assured that her story would be told her way, said  Gold, who also collaborated with singer David Crosby for a similar article in  April, 1987. Compared with the long lead times for other magazines, the fact  that the weekly could do the story fast also was a plus, Gold said.  </P> <P> Other factors played a role in getting the story for People, said Gold, who got  a call from Barrymore's publicist -- and a friend of the reporter's --  proposing the story. The idea of giving an interview came from Barrymore's  therapists who saw an up-front account as a way for the young actress to deal  with public curiosity about her problems, Gold said. "From now on she can say,  'Yes, I have a problem, I've talked about it' . . . and put it behind her," he  said.  </P> <P> "First and foremost" Barrymore wanted to tell about her slide into drinking and  cocaine abuse to 'help other kids,' " Gold said. The article is accompanied by  an interview with an expert on juvenile alcoholism who said Barrymore's peers  are "a depressed generation." The expert added, "Too many children feel that no  one cares about them, and too many of them are right."  </P> <P> Gold couldn't say whether the actress, best known for her roles in "E.T." and  "Irreconcilable Differences," also might have picked People because she's a fan  of the magazine. But he "saw a stack" of back issues at Barrymore's home, he  said.  </P> <P> Barrymore's narrative of her nightmare seems to pull no punches. She admits to  taking her first drink at age 9, smoking marijuana at 10 and using cocaine at  12. She has been through two drug rehabilitation treatments.  </P> <P> "From the time I became famous in 'E.T.,' my life got really weird," Barrymore  told People. "One day I was a little girl, and the next day I was being mobbed  by people who wanted me to sign my autograph or pose for pictures or who just  wanted to touch me. . . . I was this 7-year-old who was expected to be going on  a mature 29."  </P> <P> Following a relapse, Barrymore says she took a credit card from her mother's  purse and flew from New York to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "In L.A., we went to my house, blasted the stereo and decided to take my  mother's BMW to go out to dinner," Barrymore recalled. "Even though I'm 13, my  driving is pretty good. . . .  </P> <P> "Stacy and I drove around Hollywood for awhile. At one point we were being  tailed by a cop, which was frightening because we had the coke on the  dashboard. But once we got out of that, we went shopping. By that time my  mother had reported the credit card stolen, but we still managed to buy several  hundred dollars' worth of clothes by conning the sales people."  </P> <P> Since the magazine appeared Monday, Gold said he has received a number of calls  about the story, including one from a mother interested in finding treatment  for her daughter and three from book publishers interested in publishing the  teen-ager's life story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fruit on the Bloom  </P> <P> If this is April it must be strawberries -- on the cover.  </P> <P> So goes the thinking behind California Food, a monthly set to debut this spring  as a sort of hybrid -- a trade publication with consumer appeal.  </P> <P> As envisioned by Stan Jones, executive director of the California Commission  for Food and Wines, the glossy magazine to promote California crops to about  20,000 food executives around the country may also appeal to food fanatics who  just can't learn enough about the state's real fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> With the consumer angle in mind, Jones said each issue -- bearing artful photos  of the big crop of the month on the cover -- will include regular features by  leading chefs on how they use California products and by the heads of wineries  about various aspects of wine-making.  </P> <P> Jones said it's premature to estimate how big California Food could grow as a  consumer magazine. But two magazine publishers already have expressed interest  in acquiring the magazine for its potential beyond the narrow world of food  wholesalers and retailers.  </P> <P> Unlike many trade magazines aimed at a specialized audience, California Food  promises to be an attractive package. Prototypes shown by Jones contain a  generous use of color and attractive, uncluttered layouts -- including what may  be a first, a center spread on avocados.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presidential Perfection  </P> <P> Richard Nixon had a deep and abiding concern about furniture and interior  decoration. In fact, the former President and Californian, who resigned in  disgrace in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal, spent a good deal of time  writing memos to his staff and his wife about fixing furniture, acquiring  furniture and preserving historic scuff marks on the Oval Office floor,  according to an article in the January issue of Washingtonian magazine.  </P> <P> Excerpted from the book, "From: The President, Richard Nixon's Secret Files,"  (edited by Bruce Oudes) the selected presidential broodings show a taste for  minute detail as well as global issues.  </P> <P> In a January, 1969, memo to his wife Pat, Nixon fretted that he needed an end  table beside his bed "which will accommodate two Dictaphones as well a  telephone." The impersonal memo, in which Nixon refers to himself in the third  person, also reported that he needed a bigger table in his room for night paper  work. "The table which is presently in the room does not allow enough room for  him to get his knees under it," Nixon wrote.  </P> <P> When the Oval Office floor was refurbished, Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman  cautioned another staffer that "The President wants to be sure that the cork  segments in the doorway leading to the terrace, which bear the marks of  President Eisenhower's golf shoes, are carefully preserved and removed. . . ."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described  the UN secretary general's report on the Cyprus issue that was  released today as positive. Venizelos said that from an initial  evaluation of the report, one can conclude that it is an  objective document. The spokesman stressed that the blame is  clearly put on the Denktas pseudostate and Ankara. In a  diplomatic way, Venizelos said, we should admit that the Turkish  Cypriot and Turkish sides are blamed for a lack of political  will.    The Greek Government, Venizelos concluded, cooperates with  the Cypriot leadership and will carefully examine the  alternative approaches to the problem that UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali has proposed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the wake of the implementation of the autonomy  agreement, Israel will stop financing busywork jobs for  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Security sources noted that in  May Israel employed 18,000 Gazans in busywork jobs at a cost of  20 million shekels. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that  Faysal al-Husayni announced that the Palestinians would shortly  have enough money to finance the expenses stemming from the  implementation of the Gaza- Jericho agreement.    The Agriculture Ministry will immediately proceed to set up  a  special unit to oversee the passage of produce from the autonomy  to Israel. The unit will tighten controls on shipments of  produce from the territories to the ultra-Orthodox community.  Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that the decision  to establish the unit already at this point was made at a  special meeting with the agriculture minister in a bid to curb  the smuggling of produce by taking advantage of the permits  given to the ultra-Orthodox community which is currently  observing a ritual fallow year. Originally, the unit was  scheduled to be established only after the opening of the  borders with the autonomy to the passage of produce.</p>

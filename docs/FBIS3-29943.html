A gift-conveying ceremony took place in Harare, Zimbabwe on  February 14.    Speaking at the ceremony, N.T. Mawema, member of the Central  Committee and director of the Political and Cultural Department  of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and  chairman of the Zimbabwean National Committee for the Study of  the Chuche Idea, referred in detail to the history of the  revolutionary activities of Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The chairman said:    Kim Chong-il, he is just socialist Korea.    It is under the leadership of the great general Comrade Kim  Chong-il with literary and military accomplishments and with  loyalty and filial piety that Korean-style socialism is  imposingly rising in the east of the globe, throwing its rays  all over the world.    According to his interpretation of the gift, the gift "bell"  is symbolic of the sound of the bell of chuche calling mankind  to the accomplishment of the cause of independence and the tiger  inscribed in the "bell" represents the majestic appearance of  the general making the imperialists and the renegades of  socialism shudder.    The gift was conveyed to the DPRK ambassador to Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / GMTV aims for middle ground GOOD MORNING Television, the commercial television company, plans to concentrate on 'the middle ground' in future and may drop cartoons on weekdays in response to unexpectedly intense competition. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of GMTV and chief executive of London Weekend Television, a GMTV shareholder, said: 'We've lost the kids.' The children have left GMTV - which runs only a few minutes of cartoons during the week - for Channel 4's Big Breakfast - except at weekends, when GMTV runs more cartoons. The Big Breakfast matched GMTV with peak quarter-hour audiences of 1.4m each on weekdays, according to ratings published yesterday. BBC Breakfast News had 1.1m viewers. GMTV's reach - those who watch at some time during the programme from Monday to Friday - at 11.6m outstrips The Big Breakfast, which has a reach of 8.3m. GMTV lost Pounds 10m in its first six months on air although it is hoped that cost-cutting measures will keep losses to between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m in the second half. There are still hopes of reaching oper-ational profit next year. GMTV, which bid Pounds 34.6m for its franchise and also has to pay 15 per cent of advertising revenue to the government, hoped to raise Pounds 80m in advertising revenue this year. However, competition from The Big Breakfast and the lingering effects of recession now make Pounds 60m the more likely total, leaving it in deficit. With Pounds 5m savings already made, the pressure on costs continues. For example Central TV, which provides three news inserts for GMTV from its separate areas, has now been asked to cut back to just one. Mr Christopher Stoddart, GMTV managing director, said: 'We are fully sold for the next three months but we could do with some more ratings points.' He believes he has always been addressing the middle ground between The Big Breakfast and Breakfast News. The challenge now was to improve quality, he said.</p>

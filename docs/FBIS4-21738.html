			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tarapoto -- It has been reported here that former  Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) militants have made  known the location of a common grave in Yurimangas that was dug  by the movement's leaders.    The clandestine cemetery is 40 km south of Yurimangas. It is  believed to contain the remains of MRTA members who died in  confrontations with the forces of order.    It is also understood that the grave contains the victims of  the MRTA's subversive insanity who, after being captured, were  murdered without pity and their bodies thrown into the common  grave.

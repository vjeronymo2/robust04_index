			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries retreat on signs of resilient economy US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday as signs of a resilient economy competed with the sickly dollar for the top position on the market's list of concerns. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond had given back 5/16 to 85 3/32 , about the same price as before the previous session's rally began. The yield recrossed the pivotal 7.50 per cent barrier to trade at 7.511 per cent as the session drew to a close. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 lower at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.118 per cent. Early on, the US currency held fairly steady in the foreign exchange markets. However, the market found different reasons to be bearish. The morning brought two pieces of news suggesting that this spring's series of rate increases had not cooled off the economy sufficiently. The first came from the Commerce Department, which announced that sales of new homes in May had climbed 4.2 per cent, more than offsetting an April decline and exceeding the forecasts of analysts. Meanwhile, the Conference Board indicated that consumers were in the mood to spend, fanning fears of inflation in the fixed-rate markets. Its June index of consumer confidence came in at 92.0, against a May reading of 88.9. Again, economists were expecting a much more modest gain. The market reacted by driving down the price of bonds across the board. Commodity prices, which have been a saving grace in recent sessions, showed moderate gains, further souring sentiment. To make matters even worse, activity in the currency markets became difficult to ignore by midday. The dollar again dropped below the Y100 and the DM1.58 levels, setting off a second flurry of Treasury selling. Still, bonds managed to climb off their session lows before the trading day was completed. Most continental government bond markets edged slightly higher yesterday in quiet, largely futures-driven trade. However, analysts said concerns about US Treasuries, the US dollar and the timing of future US interest rate rises continued to dog the markets. The September German government bond contract on Liffe was up 0.24 points at 92.49 in late trading. Attention today will be on the results of the Bundesbank's securities repurchase tender following its announcement yesterday that it was setting a tender for 14-day funds at variable bid rates. Expectations are for a further cut in the repo rate by five basis points from 5.00 to 4.95 per cent. However, Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International said that 'official remarks at last week's Bundesbank council meeting were taken by some as a sign that it may pause in its policy of regular cuts in the repo rate. That would have a significant effect on bond markets.' Lack of follow-through buying after Monday's strong rally and weakness in the US market following the publication of the strong US economic data pushed UK government bonds lower. 'Gilts outperformed other European markets on Monday, pushed up by one substantial purchase in thin trade, and so came off more easily than the rest of Europe today,' said Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The UK Treasury's summer update of its UK economic forecasts was in line with expectations, with an upward revision to the growth forecast and the prediction for underlying inflation revised downwards. However, there was some disappointment that the downward revision to the projected public sector borrowing requirement, to Pounds 36bn from the Pounds 38bn initially predicted in the November budget, was not larger. The focus today for the gilts market will be the Bank of England's auction of a further Pounds 2bn of floating-rate gilts, due 1999. Analysts expect the sale to go well, with the issue being of particular appeal to the financial sector and, since its coupon is tied to money market rates, less subject to bond market volatility. The auction will raise the total volume of outstanding gilt FRNs to Pounds 4.5bn. March's auction of FRNs was covered a high 2.28 times. The September long gilt future on Liffe was down  17/32 points in late trading at 100 3/4 . The Italian September BTP futures contract on Liffe was up 0.35 points at 104.35 in late trading. However, 'worries about the Italian government's commitment to fiscal rectitude continues to weigh on Italian bonds,' said Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe. The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at 116.30, up 0.02 points on the day.</p>

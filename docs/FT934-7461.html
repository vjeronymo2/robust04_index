			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Serif calls for Pounds 4.9m and applies for full listing SERIF, the USM-quoted specialist printing and packaging group, is raising about Pounds 4.9m via a 2-for-1 rights issue of 49.5m shares at 11p. The company said that without the rights its ability to trade would depend on the support of its bankers, which might not be forthcoming. The shares fell 2p to close at 16p. Serif also announced yesterday that it had applied to join the Official List. The rights, which will triple the issued share capital, is fully underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing. To improve the liquidity and marketability of the shares the directors intend to apply for just 300,000 shares. Serif, which reduced its pre-tax loss to Pounds 494,000 (Pounds 571,000) for the half year to June 30, has undergone a reorganisation and rationalisation programme during the last two years. Non-core activities have been disposed of and there are now two operating divisions, Cowells based in Ipswich, and Spottiswoode Ballantyne, based in Colchester. Although the second half was likely to produce a further loss, directors said that efforts to control costs and improve margins were continuing. The current investment programme was largely completed and they felt the outlook for the company was improving.</p>

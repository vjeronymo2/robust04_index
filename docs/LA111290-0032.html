			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPONDING TO AUTHOR'S DEFENSE OF CENSORSHIP  </P> <P> In response to the Counterpunch article by Bradley Steffens ("A Once-Banned  Author Believes in Censorship for the Good of Society," Oct. 29), I would like  to say that I am fed up with the notion that every American must live in a  society that allows no artistic expression beyond that suitable for a  12-year-old.  </P> <P> Excuse me, all you well-meaning but sadly misguided parents, but I never asked  you to have children.  </P> <P> You chose to, and it's your responsibility to raise them with whatever morals  you see fit; but please stop expecting other adults to sacrifice their  intelligence on the altar of your children.  </P> <P> I happen to enjoy "adult themes." I enjoy them in the literature I read, in the  movies I watch, in the art I view and in the music I listen to. Thematically,  my life is of an adult nature, and to keep out of "Disneyland" I will do  everything in my power to sustain whatever rights I have.  </P> <P> I resent the paternalistic attitude that does nothing more than socially retard  the entire culture and promote yet another generation of the ignorant who  giggle and leer at the human body and consider words commonly used by our  Anglo-Saxon ancestors as "dirty."  </P> <P> Forgive me, Mom and Dad of America, but I think if you spent half the effort  teaching your children kindness and selflessness that you spent keeping them  away from sex, you might raise a generation of truly decent human beings.  </P> <P> LAURIE L. PRATT BECK  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Ground laid for Kashmir talks TALKS between India and Pakistan ended on an optimistic note yesterday. Both sides agreed to discuss Kashmir and signed two agreements on the prohibition of chemical weapons and a code of conduct for diplomats in the two countries. Mr Shaharyar Khan, Pakistan's foreign secretary, described the sixth round of secretary-level talks as the 'most productive' so far, saying that agreement 'on the need to address the Jammu and Kashmir issue' was 'in itself a step forward.' Mr R L Bhatia, Indian minister of state for external affairs, yesterday told parliament that the Indian government believed dialogue with Pakistan was essential to 'lower temperatures' between the two neighbours. However, he pointed out that while India was willing to discuss all matters with Pakistan, 'meaningful discussions on bilateral issues, specially on more complex questions' could only be held once Pakistan 'stopped its support to terrorism and subversion in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab'. Categorically denying that Pakistan was fuelling terrorism in Kashmir, Mr Khan said that his country also faced a problem of terrorism in Sindh because of the free availability of arms. He suggested a joint approach to the problem. Mr Khan said that the wishes of the Kashmiri people would also be taken into consideration. When asked if Pakistan would agree to the option of an independent Kashmir, the foreign secretary said that a framework of the UN resolution already existed, implying that this was not an option. Although the confidence-building measures between the two countries have been more successful this time than before, foreign affairs experts in India are sceptical the sides will be able to hold meaningful talks on Kashmir, which has been the main obstacle to peace in the sub-continent for 47 years.</p>

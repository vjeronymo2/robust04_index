			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] yesterday [2  May] formally replied to the mainland's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] saying that the SEF  will send personnel and crime experts to Hangzhou to study the  Chientao [Qiandao] Lake incident [in which 24 Taiwanese tourists  were killed during a pleasure boat cruise]    The SEF has decided that a delegation will leave for  Hangzhou  on 8 May with a scheduled return to Taiwan on 15 May.    The SEF delegation will be headed by SEF Deputy Secretary  General Hsu Hui-you; and its members will consist of SEF  officials, crime experts, and representatives of families of the  victims, totally about 20 people.    The SEF indicated that the date of departure for Hangzhou  was  determined on the basis of the views of relevant experts and  families of the victims and after assessing the situation. It  hoped that ARATS would provide the delegation with the relevant  information and make arrangements for personnel who handled the  case and those who performed the autopsies on the victims to  explain the incident to the delegation. The SEF added that the  delegation will also visit Chunan County to (?inspect) the boat,  the Haijui [Hairui], and will interview relevant personnel to  have a thorough understanding of the case.    Meanwhile, according to Hong Kong's pro-Chinese communist  paper, WEN WEI PO, Chinese communist Vice Premier Chu Jung-chi  [Zhu Rongji], who is now visiting Chekiang [Zhejiang] on an  inspection tour, has visited Chientao Lake to study the case as  well as the measures the local authorities have taken to deal  with problems arising from the case. The paper said that Chu  has also instructed the local authorities to do a good job in  receiving the SEF personnel and the victims' families.    The report also indicated that Chu Jung-chi's inquiry about  the case shows that the CPC Central Committee attaches great  importance to the SEF personnel's arrival in Hangzhou, and that  it also shows that the CPC Central Committee is unwilling to see  the boat incident undermine the developing cross-strait  relations.    News reports from Peking [Beijing] also indicated that  high-ranking Chinese communist authorities hoped that a lesson  could be learned from the Chientao Lake incident, and that they  have decided to set up a group to handle Taiwan-related  contingencies. It is reported that the group members will  include principal ARATS officials, and that the Chinese  communist authorities hoped this new organ will be able to  handle Taiwan-related contingencies efficiently and openly.    Commenting on the Hong Kong report that the CPC Central  Committee has decided to set up a group to handle cross-strait  contingencies, SEF Deputy Secretary General Shih Chi-ping  indicated yesterday that the report, if confirmed, shows that  Chinese communist authorities concerned have made a thorough  self-examination after the boat incident.    Shih added that, in principle, the SEF agreed that a group  should be set up to handle Taiwan-related contingencies as  reported by the Hong Kong paper.</p>

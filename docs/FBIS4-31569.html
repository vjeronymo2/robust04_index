			<p>BFN     [Text] Relations between Romania and Hungary do not need  mediators to be settled, Romanian Presidency Spokesman Traian  Chebeleu said today at his weekly news conference, referring to  certain commentaries that have appeared following the telegram  that Gyula Horn, president of the Hungarian Socialist Party,  sent to the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania.    Chebeleu said that numerous terms without precise content  are  being circulated, such as the term autonomy for minorities, and  if this term refers to ethnic autonomy, this means quote,  dynamite for the state unity of Romania, unquote, and is against  European principles.    Referring to certain statements by Ioan Alexandru, PNTCD  [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] senator,  Ambassador Chebeleu said that one cannot talk about a  discriminatory attitude adopted by Germany in connection with  Romania joining European institutions.</p>

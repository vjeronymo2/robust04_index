			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Talks with loyalists start next Thursday The government is to start talks with loyalist representatives next Thursday  -a year after the signing of the Downing Street declaration. The announcement by Mr John Major came on the eve of historic talks in Belfast between a government team led by Mr Quentin Thomas, number two in the Northern Ireland Office, and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The government is keeping open the option of upgrading the talks to ministerial level at a later date. It is hoped the dialogue will pave the way for both Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives to join talks involving Northern Ireland's main constitutional parties. Yesterday's developments came amid mounting signs of a rapprochement between the government and the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party. A meeting on Tuesday between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and a DUP delegation led by Mr Paisley is understood to have been viewed as helpful by both sides. Separately, Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, yesterday spoke out in favour of the decision to invite some members of Sinn Fein to next week's Belfast investment conference which is to be hosted by Mr Major. Mr Brown, who is leading a US delegation to the conference, said he could not conceive of 'a scenario that would bring peace and tranquility to Northern Ireland that does not include Sinn Fein'. Sinn Fein has not yet said whether it will attend the conference. It is pushing for a more elevated representation in the form of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Mr Brown, dismissing the notion that there had been a poor response from US business leaders, said there were no plans for the US to make a public-sector contribution to infrastructure projects in the province. Top of the government's agenda in talks with both Sinn Fein and loyalists will be the decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals, which is seen as the key to the two sides' participation in future political talks. The prospects of making progress on this issue may have been complicated by the power vacuum in Dublin, however. It is understood that before the political crisis IRA leaders indicated to the Irish government that they would be willing to identify some arms caches in the south in return for British concessions on troop levels and IRA prisoners.</p>

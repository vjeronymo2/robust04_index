			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Georgiy Salandiya in Moscow; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The situation at enterprises of the  military-industrial complex was discussed at a news conference  at the State Committee for Defense in Moscow. Only yesterday  the defense industry was the state's favorite, but today -- and  this a highy intellectual industry as regards technology and  specialists -- it is on the verge of collapse. Collapse is the  very word, because in civilized countries a level of conversion  of over 5-7 percent is already regarded as destructive. But in  our country, in 1992 alone, it was almost 70 percent.    This is despite the fact that 80 percent of the output of  the  military-industrial complex consists of civilian output and  consumer goods. The workers in the defense sectors are on the  brink of poverty and the enterprises themselves are on the brink  of shutdown. The state owes the enterprises of the  military-industrial complex some 2 trillion rubles. In the  event of them shutting down the enterprises of many sectors will  not receive unique materials. The defense industry will cease  servicing military equipment in the forces and will stop the  delivery of spare parts for military equipment abroad.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Revenue rapped over false tax assessments Half a million taxpayers received incorrect assessments because of Inland Revenue errors last year, says a highly critical National Audit Office report released today. Ten per cent of the self-employed and 7 per cent of those who pay tax using the PAYE system were the victims of Inland Revenue miscalculations, the findings show. The report from the audit office, the Whitehall watchdog, also highlights the fact that the Revenue was failing to meet its own published targets to reply to taxpayers' queries within 28 days. The findings will embarrass the Inland Revenue, which conducted a survey two years ago showing that taxpayers chiefly wanted the department to get their tax right first time and respond quickly to queries. The report will form the basis of questions for Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, when he appears before the Commons public accounts committee at the end of this month. It shows that about 3.2m of the 5m taxpayers who receive assessments have the demand revised downwards at least once each year. Most miscalculations are the result of failures on the part of taxpayers, but the NAO says 10 per cent of these 5m have their assessments revised because of Inland Revenue errors. In three-fifths of those cases, the cause is a failure by inspectors to allow the correct allowances and reliefs. The report notes that the errors are as likely to be discovered by taxpayers or their advisers as by Revenue staff. The NAO is critical of the Revenue's definition of 'substantive replies', which it has pledged to provide to taxpayers within 28 days. About half of the most complex tax queries took longer than a month to resolve. The delays were caused partly by communications between Revenue offices. Of the 140m items of post received by Revenue offices each year, only 55m come from taxpayers. The remaining 85m are correspondence passing between the offices. The Revenue admitted that the number of incorrect assessments identified in the report was 'unacceptable' and said it was planning to publish new quality targets. However, it emphasised that the faulty assessments related only to 'the top 20 per cent of taxpayers who have the most complicated affairs', and not the vast majority who are taxed on the PAYE system. It said criticism of the time taken to reply to letters was based on an analysis of the most difficult 5 per cent of queries. 'We are hoping to improve all the time,' said the Revenue.

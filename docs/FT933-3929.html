			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower as Manila soars to record SELLING by investment trusts and European investors pushed share prices lower and the Nikkei average lost ground for the fourth consecutive trading day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index lost 92.61 at 20,825.58 as many investors remained on the sidelines ahead of today's settlement of September futures and options contracts, and release of the tankan, or quarterly report on business sentiment. The Nikkei moved up to a day's high of 20,943.79 in the morning session, but fell to the day's low of 20,756.28 just before the close. Steel and oil shares were sold after the announcements of gloomy corporate news from leading companies in the sectors earlier in the week. However, some traders blamed the popularity of the second section and over-the-counter market, which was attracting funds away from the first section. Volume contracted to 250m shares from 297m, staying below 300m shares for the fourth day in a row. Declines outscored advances by 592 to 362, with 202 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 6.48 to 1,676.34, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.82 to 1,286.91. The increase in new listings on the second section and OTC market has been supporting activity in the smaller markets. On Wednesday, turnover on the OTC market came to Y55.5bn, rising above Y50bn for the first time since June 1991. Traders said that Promise, the consumer finance company which became listed on the OTC on Tuesday, attracted investors. Steel issues weakened on earnings fears, following Nippon Steel's downward profits revision on Tuesday. Four leading steel makers are scheduled to announce similar revisions today. Nippon Steel fell Y18 to Y342, NKK lost Y5 to Y294 and Kobe Steel retreated Y8 to Y300. Oil companies continued to lose ground following reports of Nikko Kyodo's liquidation of its US subsidiary. Nikko Kyodo dropped Y13 to Y497 and Tonen Y40 to Y1,590. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y15,000 to Y915,000 after its decision to cut long distance rates, while KDD, the international telecom company, surrendered Y100 to Y12,700. After the market closed KDD announced a cut in its overseas call rates. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 122.04 to 22,749.04 in volume of 38.5m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical shed Y90 to Y5,620 on profit-taking. Roundup PACIFIC RIM markets were mixed. MANILA soared to a record high, the composite index rising 25.49 to 1,911.77, with the outlook for PLDT providing the spur. PLDT climbed 65 pesos to 1,410 pesos. SEOUL was spurred sharply higher by aggressive buying by individual investors. The composite index rose 12.54 to 696.14 in turnover that picked up to Won428.9bn. Renewed rumours of a currency reform, which the government has strongly denied, and anticipation of economic boosting measures contributed to the day's gain. HONG KONG saw moderate losses at the close, after a plunge in index futures helped to erase solid early gains. The Hang Seng index shed 20.37 to 7,586.76, after hitting an intraday record of 7,663.63. AUSTRALIA continued its downward slide, undermined by weaker gold and resource stocks, a lack of overseas interest and the sharp overnight fall on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index finished 8.1 lower at 1,931.4 in light turnover of ADollars 398.4m. NEW ZEALAND was hit by profit-taking, which left the NZSE-40 capital index 8.06 easier at 1,992.29. BOMBAY picked up as the government sought to end the uncertainty that has beset the market in recent days. The BSE index rose 82.30 to 2,662.54 in a session shortened to one hour from the normal two.</p>

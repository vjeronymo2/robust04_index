			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Medeva's Pounds 13m meets forecasts - Chairman moves to allay fears over FDA warning to US offshoot MR BERNARD Taylor, chairman of Medeva, the pharmaceuticals company which saw its share price halve after a profits warning a month ago, yesterday sought to convince investors that its problems had been contained. However, Mr Taylor was unable to say when or if the US Food and Drug Administration would declare that Medeva's MD Pharmaceuticals subsidiary in California had adequately dealt with manufacturing shortcomings. The FDA's warning letter to Medeva, more than the news of inflated sales at another Californian subsidiary, IMS, caused shareholders to sell their holdings. Announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m (Pounds 14.1m) for the half year to June 30 - in line with the amended forecasts - Mr Taylor said Medeva was unlikely to get a clear statement from the FDA. 'The work we have done (at MD) is as much as we could humanly have done,' he said. He said the FDA never gave a 'stamp of approval' after checking whether a company had rectified shortcomings in manufacturing practice. 'At a point in time they will advise us or government purchasers that MD is now cleared for new contracts,' he said. In Medeva's last full year MD contributed nearly 40 per cent of group profits. Medeva's first half profits came on sales of Pounds 80.1m, up 39 per cent. Earnings fell 18 per cent to 3.76p but the interim dividend is lifted 20 per cent to 0.9p. The company said it was still comfortable with a revised full year profits forecast of between Pounds 42m and Pounds 47m. Analysts said Medeva's presentation yesterday appeared to allay some of their fears. A number said, however, that the share price could take some time to recover. It would not come before confidence was restored in management's ability to deliver the forecast full-year profit. The shadow of the FDA would also be likely to hang over the share price. Other analysts said Medeva had been oversold. Mr Taylor confirmed that his chairman and chief executive roles would be split. Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the founder and managing director who has never had a line management function, would continue to lead the team executing Medeva's acquisitions. 'There will have to be a different ratio of major to minor acquisitions,' Mr Taylor said. Large purchases would not be possible with the share price at its current level but the group would still make bolt-on and product portfolio acquisitions. See Lex</p>

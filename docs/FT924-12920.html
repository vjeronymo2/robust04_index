			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Domestic gales ruffle Major's EC outing THE European summit was nearly hijacked by British domestic political problems as the embattled Mr John Major, the British Prime Minister, was caught up in a storm of journalists' questions on the government's mine closure programme and the cut in interest rates. The overriding interest shown by the press in the political crisis facing Mr Major forced Downing Street officials to take the unprecedented step of holding two consecutive press conferences - the first on the summit discussions and the second on British problems. That neat division was not respected by Mr Major himself, however, as he fought to establish a clear link between Britain's economic and financial problems and the 'body blow' to confidence delivered to the whole Community by events such as the Danish electorate's rejection of the Maastricht treaty and the bare majority in favour of the treaty in the French referendum. 'It was, above all, confidence that we needed to restore,' Mr Major said. The implication was that Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism could be attributed to much wider causes than any policy mistakes the government might have made. But if Mr Major was not averse to invoking the political and economic 'turbulence' of the past few months as the reason for Britain's woes, he was equally anxious to show that the UK's future prosperity was dependent on the Community and the controversial Maastricht treaty. 'The European Community is vital for our prosperity, our economy and our jobs,' he said. Some 60 per cent of Britain's trade was with the EC, half the visible investment in Britain came from the Community and eight of Britain's top trade partners were members of the EC. Moreover, the European Single Market, due to be completed by the end of this year, would boost the Community's GDP by 5 per cent and a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations would add an extra Dollars 200bn in EC member states' wealth every 10 years. The fact that French ministers made it clear yesterday that an agreement was still far off was ignored by Mr Major, who said that much more progress had been made during the last round of negotiations than had been reported. The Prime Minister also did his best to scotch reports that a hard core of EC countries led by Germany, and including the Benelux countries, were starting to talk of a 'two-speed' Europe, in which they would go ahead with a monetary union according to the timetable laid down in the Maastricht treaty, while weaker economies such as Britain and Italy would take a much slower lane. 'A common theme in all the interventions at the conference was that we should all move together and that there should be no fast or slow track,' the prime minister said. Meanwhile German and other officials said privately that yesterday's British interest rate cut could only increase the prospect of a two-speed EC. No one could deny that the Birmingham Declaration on making the Community more open, respecting the national identities of the member countries and involving national parliaments more closely in the Community's activities, was a success for Mr Majorin his quest for public and parliamentary support for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. But it was no more than a consolation prize for the buffeting he has received throughout the day on his domestic policies.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 3: Cross-border pooled funds arrive - Investment flows CROSS-BORDER property investment in Europe has undoubtedly been slowed by the simultaneous economic recession and property slump. From Spain to Austria, European property groups are still busy with schemes and deals outside their own regional origins, but most would have been planned more than 12 months ago. Swedish groups, whose 1990 European property investments topped even those of the Japanese, are widely known to have been forced back home by the economic squeeze. But past deals have still to be worked through. SPP, for example, having acquired London &amp; Edinburgh Trust in April 90, is busy moving LET's management to Brussels, completing a retail development in Vienna and continuing with the redevelopment in London's East India Dock. Another Swedish property group, Hufvustaden, is completing a city centre redevelopment in Zaragoza in Spain with backing from Banco de Bilbao. Whether they, or many of the other still-active developers, could obtain investment backing today for new schemes is another matter. The latest formal figures for cross-border investment flows - produced by Hillier Parker - only take us to the end of 1990, the peak year in this trend so far. The figures for 1991, when they are available in the summer, will show a marked downturn, according to Mr Alan Patterson, the Hillier Parker researcher. And the early part of this year will show a further weakening. Hillier Parker's figures are supported by market information from Weatherall Green &amp; Smith's continental Europe-watcher in Amsterdam, Mr Dick Grillo. He sums up investors' attitudes in one word: caution. That said, there are pockets of attraction and investors with cheque-books at the ready. The UK, for example, despite entering the recession earlier than its European competitors, and with a much sharper decline in property values on the back of historically high voids and falling rents, continues to attract German, French and Dutch funds. Mr Peter Evans, head of research at Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, identifies three factors in London's current attractiveness to continental European investors: London property is cheap; it is a continuously large and deep market; and Britain's membership of the ERM provides comfort in terms of reduced currency risk. The Brussels office market, usually solid but unexciting, is showing rental growth of 10 per cent pa as the European Commission's evacuation of its Berlaymont headquarters has put pressure on space throughout the city. Mr Grillo singles out Brussels and a clutch of German cities (Berlin, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Stuttgart and Frankfurt) as those showing solid investor demand in an otherwise patchy to weak pan-European market. Most investors, therefore, in most areas, are holding fire but could be tempted out either by a bargain or the sight of other investors possibly stealing a march on them. And this may prove the real short-term fillip to the market. For a new breed of investor is making an appearance in the pan-European property arena: the cross-border pooled fund. Deregulation has been later in coming to continental Europe than to Britain. But it has now arrived. Almost everywhere local investment vehicles are now free to invest abroad. The approach of 1993 will free the remainder at least within the boundaries of Europe. And some of these funds, mainly open-ended investment companies (OICs), are very large indeed. Most internationally-minded of the German OICs - the Dresdner Bank offshoot, DEGI - is a DM5.2bn fund of which property accounts for two-thirds. Even the modest DM350m which is earmarked for property investment outside Germany would create a significant platform and DEGI has already begun to build it. Last year, for instance, DEGI acquired Lloyd's Bank Chambers in London's EC3 banking district, and MEPC's new development at 122/6 Chancery Lane. The French are also enthusiastically creating pooled funds. Banque Pallas, together with various French institutions, GAM, Cassis du Depot and Swiss Life, wants to see its Pallas European Investment Fund reach Ff1bn. Credit Nationale, at the head of 14 institutions, has the same figure in mind for its Europolis Invest. Not to be outdone, UK fund managers are also launching new European-focused institutional unit trusts; most recently Mercury European Real Estate Fund - from the House of Warburg, but registered in the Dutch Antilles and listed in Dublin. Although these funds, by themselves, do not amount to the mythical 'wall of money' which would immediately turn slump into boom, they may be enough to put a floor under the European market this year, until the longer-term attraction - even necessity - of pan-European property investment reasserts itself. There can be no residual doubt that pan-Europeanism is on its way and that 1992 represents only the taste of the unification still to come. In a recent paper, Hillier Parker's international partner, Mr David Gore, spelled out the role of the property industry within this trend. 'The true cost of locating in one country versus another will be easier to assess and carry less risk' once monetary union is reached, he said. Meanwhile, in the lead up to it 'corporate activity - mergers and takeovers, relocations and rationalisations to establish market share - will be funded by real estate.'</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Saddam's unseen victims - Television VIEWPOINT 93; Saddam's Killing Fields (Tuesday, ITV) was a poignant reminder that what the lens does not see the heart does not grieve over. It showed how different have been the experiences of two groups of Saddam Hussein's opponents, the Kurds and the Shia of southern Iraq. The luck of the Kurds began to turn when the cameras focused on the poison gas victims in the streets of Halabja. The cameras were back in force to film the Kurds' exodus to the mountains, stumbling through the mud and snow. Those pictures struck a chord in the outside world; emotion was translated into action and the Kurds - at least in the short term - are safe. The documentary, filmed in Free Kurdistan and Iran but not Iraq, pieced together evidence of the scale and viciousness of the Iraqi army's reprisals, said by the Kurds to have claimed 300,000 Shi-ite victims in the intifida 1991 alone. The colossal bad luck of the Shias is that since the crushing of their intifada, they have been hidden from the world's sight. The programme examined the genocidal Iraqi policy towards the Marsh Arabs and argued that the idea of a safe haven in the south must be resurrected. The Marsh Arabs, said to number 70,000, face the extinction of their unique way of life as their villages are rocketed, the waterways are poisoned, and the buffaloes, fish and reed-beds die. The chief external witness to the Marsh Arabs' destruction have been satellite photographs of land which is now brown and lifeless, the effect of Iraq's notorious drainage project. It was presented to the UN as an agricultural improvement scheme, but human rights observers are convinced it is an instrument of genocide. An amateur video made six months ago showed Marsh Arabs appealing to the UN and US for help, above all for the canals to be bombed so that the water returns. The hopelessness of these people was eloquently expressed by the bitter words of one refugee: 'They come to film us and set us to music like the TV comedy they think we are.' The UK's foreign Office minister Douglas Hogg explained with wondrous suavity that there was no possibility of external intervention although ''the process' will probably take some time. It is at least possible that within the time-frame Saddam may fall.' To hear genocide described as 'a process' gave a small chill. My mind jumped back to last Wednesday and the first part of Thatcher: The Downing Street Years (BBC2), in which that lady lambasted the Foreign Office and its 'whole culture' based on negotiation. The Thatcher documentary is guinea-a-minute stuff. With the second instalment screened tonight and such reams of comment already written, I will not dwell on episode one except to say that the gender aspect was particularly interesting. During her time in office Lady Thatcher showed little interest in women's causes. Accepting membership of the single-sex Carlton Club was just one example of her lack of solidarity. Even so, I thought Lady Thatcher's observations about the prejudice she encountered for being 'that woman' was telling. Mrs Thatcher used sex as a weapon in her rise, but it also helped others to belittle her and it played a part in her downfall. There is meat there for every woman who operates in a male environment, however hostile she is to Thatcher's political values, to ponder. The Foreign Office came in for a pounding in Dispatches (Wednesday, C4), a gripping dramatisation of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms for Iraq scandal. The programme had actors impersonating figures such as David Gore-Booth and William Waldegrave at the most uncomfortable moments of their grilling by Scott and Presilly Baxendale. It made compulsive watching and whetted the appetite for what is to come when Lady Thatcher and the Prime Minister appear. At some time I have been asked (possibly by my credit card company) for my mother's maiden name as a way of ascertaining my credentials over the telephone. Panorama; Secrets for Sale (BBC1, Monday) showed that no question, however arcane (dog's name, favourite pudding), could protect personal data. Panorama filmed a ferrety character called Robert Hemphill using a lens concealed in a rolled umbrella. His company is one of many which offer to obtain details of bank accounts, credit cards, police records, National Insurance and National Health records. Panorama set Hemphill to penetrate the private details of four people, among them trade union secretary Rodney Bickerstaff and Lord Parkinson's former lover, Sarah Keays. The four were amazed to discover the speed with which secret information could be produced. Hemphill, unaware of the umbrella lens, explained that he could gain access to the police computer at Hendon which holds criminal records. He told his Panorama contact: 'It's literally bribing a police contact; it is that simple' The scam revealed, Hemphill high-tailed out of the office pursued by his Panorama interviewer. Some aspects of this kind of intelligence gathering come close to criminality, but many are beyond the reach of the Data Protection Act or any other legislation. Is the open society in one respect effectively already here? What a relief to turn to more rarified matters: the fate of vanished civilisations, examined on Equinox; Out of the Past (C4, Sunday). Who could envy the modern archaeologists after a programme in which we saw them spending years counting pine seeds and measuring microscopic variations in the cutting edge of obsidian knives? The end result, however, is an important jolt to the old chronology of the collapse of Mayan civilisation in Central America. It now seems that the Mayans did not suddenly vanish. Their kings departed but the ordinary folk carried on, planting their maize for two centuries. But when the end came, in the 12th century AD, it was over-population, salination, and soil exhaustion which put paid to a brilliant, cruel civilisation. The moral is one that archaeology is increasingly coming to realise. Pace New Age romantics, many an ancient peasant civilisation did not live in joyous harmony with its environment. This was a brilliant documentary, untricksy, even old-fashioned, and there was no presenter but only bearded archaeologists with a far away look in their eyes. Yet for sheer cerebral excitement, it was quite the best thing I have seen in a long month supine in front of the TV.</p>

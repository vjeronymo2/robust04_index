			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 8 (MTI) -- The condition of Gyula Horn  is satisfactory, or even good in the circumstances, Dr. Jozsef  Dobai, senior physician in Miskolc Hospital, told the  correspondent of MAI NAP late on Saturday [7 May]. The chairman  of the Hungarian Socialist Party damaged a neck vertebra and  broke his wrist in a car crash late on Thursday.    "Although Horn can already walk with help, he cannot yet  leave the hospital as he would like to. The more rest he gets,  the more likely his medical treatment will be successful. What  is certain: He needs no surgery in his present condition. In my  opinion, he cannot be released from hospital before Wednesday,"  Dobai said. According to VASARNAPI HIREK (SUNDAY NEWS), doctors  will decide on Wednesday whether the politician can leave the  hospital on Thursday or Friday.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STONES QUIET THINGS DOWN; FANS ARE ON BEST BEHAVIOR  </P> <P> If you went back to see the Rolling Stones a second time after opening night at  the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, you might have thought your hearing was  failing. Don't worry -- it was louder Wednesday than on Thursday, Saturday and  Sunday. The Stones turned down the volume by 15 decibels after the Los Angeles  Police Department South Bureau received more than 300 complaints from area  residents.  </P> <P> Sgt. Chris Berglund, special events coordinator for the bureau, said Monday  that his office asked City Attorney James Hahn to approach the Stones about the  noise after Wednesday's opening-night show. The band and its production company  agreed to turn the sound down, and only four more complaints were received  during the three remaining concerts.  </P> <P> "We got a lot of calls thanking us for our actions," Berglund said, adding that  atmospheric conditions on Wednesday contributed to the excessive noise in the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Berglund reported that the Stones fans were well-behaved too. An average of  fewer than 80 arrests were made at each concert, which drew approximately  72,000 fans each. Sunday, with 122 arrests, was the busiest day for the police  department, which for the first time at a Coliseum concert used its mobile jail  unit.  </P> <P> Berglund said that about 90% of the arrests were for narcotics, mostly  marijuana possession. Given the six-hour length of the concerts, which also  featured Guns N' Roses and Living Colour, Berglund said the crowds were less  trouble than those at Raiders football games. "For the amount of people it was  a very orderly crowd," he said. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

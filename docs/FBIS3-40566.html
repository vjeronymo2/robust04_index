			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chinese Defense Loans for Pakistan"] </F>   [Text] A defense agreement was signed between China and  Pakistan. According to this agreement China will provide  Pakistan loans for purchasing defense equipment. There is no  doubt that China is Pakistan's brother and friend. No agreement  with such a great friend should surprise us. In the present  situation, no two countries can be friendly or get angry at each  other without the prior approval of world powers. Therefore,  Pakistan's agreement with China is a good omen for us.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has been in office for about  one and a half months. This is a major and significant  achievement during this brief period and shows that the foreign  office of the present government is active. China is an  important country for supplying weapons to third world countries  at reduced rates. The United States and other international  powers are putting pressure on China to supply weapons only to  the countries that are on the U.S. approved list, and not to the  countries that the United States does not like. Still, China  follows its own foreign policy despite suffering problems and  losses in this context. He is trying to improve friendship with  other counties, especially Pakistan, by offering them new  defense agreements. No doubt this is a brave step on China's  part and we cannot praise it enough.    The United States accused China recently of supplying  missiles and related technology to Pakistan, although both China  and Pakistan have denied this accusation by saying that they had  not violated any Missile Technology Contract (MTC). Similarly,  the United States forced a Chinese commercial ship to stop in  the Gulf while it was on its way to Iran loaded with commercial  goods. The United States accused China of carrying defense  equipment on this ship that came under international agreements.  China agreed to let them inspect the ship to prevent the  situation from becoming dangerous. This inspection proved that  there was nothing objectionable in the Chinese ship; it carried  general commercial goods. The United States also imposed  restrictions on Chinese purchase of computers and other defense  equipment.    To ensure the success of their policies, the international  powers not only put pressure on countries that supply defense  equipment, but also put pressure on countries that purchase  them. All agreements are successful or unsuccessful only after  international powers have checked them using their dichotomous  policies. Against this international background, this defense  agreement will prove to be a glorious chapter in China-Pakistan  friendship. The importance of this defense pact can be  understood by the fact that General Ziang, commander-in-chief of  Chinese armed forces, was present there. This agreement  strengthens cooperation and friendship between the armed forces  of two countries. We hope that during Benazir Bhutto's rule this  great brotherly and friendly relationship between Pakistan and  China at the levels of government and the people will continue  to get stronger and stronger.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 3 May (EFE) -- Planning and Coordination  Minister Luis Maira announced today that the Chilean Government  will establish a cooperation program with Cuba and other  Caribbean countries.    Participating in a seminar on strategic planning in  international cooperation, Maira labeled such a program an  "urgent need" despite the fact that from the political viewpoint  the Chilean Government does not have among its short-term  priorities the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the  Fidel Castro regime.    Bilateral links were broken in 1973 after the military coup  headed by General Augusto Pinochet, who overthrew the socialist  government of Salvador Allende.    Relations were resumed at the consular level in 1990, after  the installation of the Patricio Aylwin administration.    Maira said that Chile, after surpassing the $3,000 per  capita  income level, has been excluded from the industrialized  countries' financial cooperation aid list, and has entered a  stage of transition from receptor to provider of this type of  aid.    He said that within this context, Chile is beginning to be  seen, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, as "a  rich country." This has created a growing demand from that  region for cooperation aid, which should somehow be arranged  "despite the budget limits and restrictions" affecting the  country.    "It is difficult to avoid these demands," said Maira, who  added that the demands come mainly from Cuban and the Dominican  Republic.    Maira said that in the case of Cuba it is necessary to have  a  growing degree of cooperation "on the basis of the progress and  internal situation of Cuba and the presence on the island of  several private Chilean companies."    Maira added that Chile is one of the Latin American  countries  with the largest investment programs abroad, especially in the  region, and this should be taken into consideration in the  government's action.</p>

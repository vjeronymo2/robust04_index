At the same time, they also decided to announce measures to  deal with the non-performing loans of financial institutions.  These measures will be included in the comprehensive economic  measures the government will prepare in mid-January. The  ministries and agencies say the measures will be announced on  the premise that income tax reductions as well as increases in  the consumption tax to about 7 percent in April 1995 should be  made simultaneously. However, they also say a plan to delay  consumption tax increases -- in case it disrupts the economic  recovery -- should be clearly spelled out in relevant bills for  tax reform. A special feature of the measures is that  considerations are given to the economic situation. Financial  authorities plan to persuade the ruling coalition parties and  economic circles about these measures. However, it seems Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will face difficulty in coordinating  the ruling coalition parties because some of them, including the  Social Democratic Party of Japan, are strongly against the idea  of increasing the consumption tax rate.    Other stimulus measures the ministries and agencies are  planing to incorporate in the bills are "increases in the amount  the Housing Loan Corporation will allow consumers to borrow for  home purchases as well as tax decreases for house renovation  expenses"; "purchases of land on which mortgages have been set  by banks prior to drawing actual plans for large scale public  land utilization and to relaxing land taxes"; "abolishing the  special corporate tax as early as 1994, which was introduced  during the Gulf war"; and "lifting the ban on corporate  purchases of their own company stocks." The ministries and  agencies are also trying to work out specific measures regarding  the nonperforming loans of financial institutions.    At the same time, they will launch medium- and long-term  measures designed to speed up the timing of public works; they  will also spend large portions of the 430 trillion yen earmarked  in the current fundamental plan for public investments for the  ten-year period ending in 2000. Moreover, they are planning to  show a blueprint of the economic situation for the beginning of  the 21st century -- including the easing of government  regulations as well as the reform of the industrial structure  and the employment situation -- pending coordination among  government agencies and ministries.    As a result of an expansion in income tax reductions and  public investments which are part of the current economic  measures, the government will boost the actual economic growth  rate by 2 percent or more over the next 15 months. Because of  this, the government will aim at making the growth rate, which  is expected to be almost 0 percent in fiscal 1993, recover to 2  percent in fiscal 1994 and to 3 percent after fiscal 1995, a  steady growth route. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is  scheduled to announce such fundamental ideas at a news  conference on New Year's day.    These economic measures are being worked out on the premise  that the general consumption tax will be raised starting April  1995. The consumption rate for cars, for instance, will be  temporarily dropped from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in April 1994,  but that is to induce people to buy new cars before the tax rate  is raised. The consumption tax increase is a precondition to  abolition of the special 2.5 percent corporate tax introduced to  raise revenues for the Gulf war. As a source of revenue to make  up for the shortfalls which will be created by income tax  reductions, the government plans to issue "emergency bonds"  until it can raise the consumption tax.    Moreover, the government stresses that if it fails to  achieve  its plan to increase the consumption tax, the plan to expand  public investment will be linked to the issuance of more  construction bonds, which will worsen financial situation and  will hamper activation of the Japanese economy in terms of the  medium- and long-term perspective. Because of this, economic  ministries and agencies, including the Finance Ministry, are  assuming the stance that they cannot help but change the  economic measures if they are not be able to increase the  consumption tax after 15 months.</p>

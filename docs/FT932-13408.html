			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: City's latest tourist attraction Sir, There are hardly any modern attractions for tourists in the City of London, so the new Attali Tower should be welcomed as such. With an entrance fee of Pounds 5, it could recover a bit of its cost. D K Patel, 12/F Borrett Mansion, 9A Bowen Road, Hong Kong</p>

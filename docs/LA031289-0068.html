			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Three Japanese men who set out to climb Mt. McKinley are presumed to have died  about 3,000 feet below the summit, National Park Service rangers in Alaska  said. "I'm afraid I see no hope for their survival," ranger Bob Seibert said as  he called off the rescue effort. Searchers who flew over part of the  20,320-foot peak reported seeing three objects, perhaps the bodies, at the  17,400-foot level above the party's camp, but weather conditions prevented  identification. Noboru Yamada, 39, Teruo Saegusa, 31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all  of Tokyo, began their expedition Feb. 16. Rangers said they feared the men were  blown off an 800-foot drop in Denali Pass, an area known for ferocious winds.  </P></p>

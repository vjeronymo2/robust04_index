Weizman's trip, which can be considered the first official  trip by the head of the usurping Jerusalem regime to Turkey,  follows trips by the Turkish foreign minister and the tourism  minister to occupied Palestine.    The desire for such frequent visits at this level was not  confined to Turkish echelons; Tel Aviv officials also insist on  such meetings and exchanges. But both sides seem to have their  own reasons and justifications for such visits.    Most political experts believe that in view of the trend of  current events and efforts by most Arab governments to forge  relations with the Zionist regime, Ankara seeks to accelerate  the improvement of its relations with that regime and to exploit  the trend of regional developments for its own good.    Ever since rounds of talks have paved the way for a  compromise between the regional governments and the Zionist  regime, Turkey has sought to become a link. This is what  Ankara's officials hope for and the more their relations with  the Zionists improve, the more this hope is boosted.    So, acquiring a false sense of popularity among the Arab  governments involved in these talks has always been a reason for  broadening its political relations with Tel Aviv's officials.    Among the other reasons Turkish officials insist on  expanding  relations with the occupying Zionist regime is to elicit greater  economic and political support from the West. This economic  support is needed to solve Turkey's problems such as its rising  budget deficit, the daily depreciation of its currency, and the  proliferating losses by Turkish economic institutions.    Lobbying for such support in the political arena is  necessary  to pander to the European government to end opposition to  Ankara's wish to enter the EC's common market. Long have the  Turks been groveling before various governments on the continent  to enter the EC's common market. But because the entire Turkish  population is Muslim, there has been opposition to this Turkish  aspiration each time. So, Turkish officials now sense that  broadening relations with Israel might be a major step toward  creating change in the stances of European governments in this  regard.    Strengthening and broadening Turkey's relations with the  Zionist regime--as was stated earlier--is also a Zionist wish.  For quite some time, the wave of Islamism has proliferated in  the region and perturbed the Zionists. Their officials have  expressed their apprehension at this mounting trend of Islamism  in the region and have initiated efforts to combat it. The  intelligentsia believe that because of the presence of strong  anti-Zionist sentiment among the Muslim nations in the region,  especially among the Turkish Muslims, the despots of Jerusalem  have, for quite some time, taken steps to mitigate such  sensitivity. They feel that every development in expanding  relations with Turkey or with any government in the Middle East  will be construed as a step on the path toward achieving this  objective.    According to experts in regional affairs, using Turkey as a  bridge for an effective presence in these strategic and  geopolitical [preceding word in English] regions of Central Asia  and the Caucasus is another reason for Tel Aviv's objective of  expanding ties with Ankara. The Zionists are pursuing this  particular strategy unilaterally with regard to Turkey.  Informed observers say that there are 4,000 experts from the  Zionist regime in the Central Asian republics engaged in  economic, political, security, and propaganda activity.  Naturally, expanding their activities demands that the Zionists  have more extensive relations with the region's governments.    Most experts in regional affairs believe that broadening  Ankara-Tel Aviv relations will benefit the usurping Zionist  regime more. They believe that by broadening relations, greater  benefits will accrue more quickly to the Zionist regime and that  what is being given to Ankara are empty promises in the form of  probable economic assistance or the creation of an atmosphere  conducive to gaining some eventual benefits from regional  circumstances.    All the Arab governments involved in talks with the  occupying  Jerusalem regime have constantly received similar promises from  the Western countries to motivate them to expand relations with  Tel Aviv.    But at least the experience of the past few months of the  PLO-Israel compromise and the way in which 'Arafat and his  associates have been deceived by this accord should prove an  instructive experience for those who, in the Islamic region of  the Middle East, are being drawn to soar on their wing toward  the despots of holy Jerusalem.</p>

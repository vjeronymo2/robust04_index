			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding double tax WHEN I last bought government stock the broker sent me a statement splitting the acquisition cost into the capital value purchased and the accrued interest in the price. The end result was that, for the accrued interest element, I had converted my capital into income and therefore had to include that as income in my tax return and on it, pay 40 per cent tax. Does it mean that I should only buy and sell gilts during the ex-dividend period if I want to avoid the double taxation I have described? It is a pity that you did not give us the precise figures and dates, because it looks as though you have paid too much tax - but we cannot be sure on the bare facts outlined. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet 1R68 'Accrued income scheme: taxing securities on transfer.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns.  All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

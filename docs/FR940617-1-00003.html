			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employees (and family members who are eligible to enroll in FEHB) make changes in their life insurance coverage and health benefits enrollment through the employee's personnel office. These administrative actions are normally conducted entirely between the agency and the individual, based on FEGLI and FEHB law and regulations. However, occasions arise when individuals challenge the agency's denial of their request for coverage, to change their FEHB enrollment or FEGLI coverage, or to change their FEGB enrollment or FEGLI optional coverage retroactively. (Because Basic Life insurance coverage is mandatory under FEGLI law unless the employee waives it, an agency that erroneously denies Basic Life to an employee must restore it retroactively when the error is discovered.) Under OPM's regulations, elections of optional life insurance coverage and FEHB enrollment or enrollment changes are generally effective prospectively unless a specific statutory or regulatory provision requires or allows the agency to make a retroactive change. Errors that consist of allowing an employee to elect life insurance coverage under circumstances not prescribed by law or regulation are corrected retroactively, including errors that are not discovered until after the death of an insured employee.) The current process used to resolve disputes between individuals and agencies over coverage or enrollment determinations is described in 5 CFR &sect;&sect;870.205, 871.206, 872.206, 873.206, 874.305, and 890.104.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these current procedures, employees, children, or former spouses who are denied coverage or enrollment, the opportunity to change coverage or enrollment, or, in most cases, to have a change made retroactively by a Federal agency must write to the Office of Personnel Management within 30 days after the agency's written denial if they believe the agency's decision was incorrect and want to have it reviewed. OPM reviews the agency's denial to determine if it complies with the applicable law and regulations. Since agencies currently do not have the regulatory authority to make retroactive changes in most cases, they must deny most such requests. Therefore, most requests for a retroactive change must come to OPM for review before the retroactive change can be made. (Basic life insurance is an exception. Under the FEGLI law, employees are automatically covered for Basic Life insurance; therefore, agencies must correct failures to withhold retroactively.) In addition, OPM has the authority, by regulation, to order corrections of errors, mistakes, or omissions based on its determination that it would be against equity and good conscience not to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, OPM received 283 requests for reconsideration and upheld the agency's decision in 39 percent of the cases. OPM overturned 38 percent of agency decisions and returned 23 percent to the agency because the individual failed to follow proper administrative procedures. As of August 30, 1993, there has been a 50 percent increase in requests for reconsideration over the 1992 figures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In many of these cases, the issue was (or included) a request that the coverage or change in coverage be made retroactive to some earlier date. Out of 94 requests from employees involving retroactive coverage, we allowed 70 and denied 24. Although an agency has all the necessary information at its disposal and knows whether a retroactive correction is appropriate, it lacks the authority under current regulations to make corrections retroactively. It can accept the employee's request to enroll or change enrollment, but only on a prospective basis. The agency must deny the employee's request for a retroactive change. Therefore, the employees write to OPM to have the decision reviewed. If appropriate, OPM can then order the agency to make the retroactive correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of OPM's ongoing efforts to improve efficiency, and in keeping with the Administration's initiative to streamline Government operations, OPM is issuing proposed regulations that would delegate to Federal agencies the authority to correct coverage and enrollment errors retroactively. In addition, the proposed regulations would transfer the reconsideration (review) process for the FEGLI and FEHB programs from OPM to the agencies. Under the proposed regulations, Federal agencies (or retirement systems, if applicable) would make the initial decisions at the employing office level and would provide for reconsideration at a higher, or otherwise independent, level of review. The reconsideration could, at each agency's discretion, be made at a higher level within the employing office or at the same level elsewhere in the agency. The proposed regulations set forth only the most basic elements necessary to meet due process requirements. For the most part, agencies would be free to use existing administrative review procedures that include these basic elements or to create administrative procedures specific to this purpose. The agency's decision based on its reconsideration of the initial decision would be final. (FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations regarding employee withholdings and Government contributions would continue to apply. That is, when agencies make retroactive changes, the agency must pay into the respective trust fund an amount equal to any withholdings and contributions due from the effective date of the change. The agency may collect the amount of the withholdings due from the employee or may waive collection under existing law and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the authority to make retroactive changes conferred by the proposed regulations, the agencies could correct errors promptly, review initial decisions on request, and give the individual a thorough, written explanation of the final decision. Thus, we believe that the Government would operate more efficiently and employees, their children, and their former spouses would be better served under these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely amends administrative procedures currently performed by OPM and Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 870  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Hostages, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Life insurance, Retirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Parts 871, 872, and 873  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Life insurance, Retirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

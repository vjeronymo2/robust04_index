			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Olives Property seeks Pounds 10.3m Olives Property is continuing the restructuring which began last June with a further acquisition and the raising of Pounds 10.3m through a rights issue. The company also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 576,000 for 1993, against losses last time of Pounds 3.06m. The company is buying Huby Estates, property investment concern with a Pounds 6m portfolio mainly of offices in the north of England. An initial payment of Pounds 3.1m will be satisfied by Pounds 2.95m cash and the balance in shares. The payment is adjustable in cash to reflect changes in net current assets between November 1993 and completion. A total of 25.8m shares are being issued on a 4-for-3 basis at 40p. The issue is underwritten. Yesterday Olives' shares were unchanged at 61p. The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital and further acquisitions. Olives' turnover for 1993 was Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 2.14m). Earnings per share were 3.79p, against losses of 33.04p. Dividends cannot be paid as there is a deficit on the profit and loss account. The company is proposing to eliminate this by cancelling the capital redemption reserve and reducing the share premium account.</p>

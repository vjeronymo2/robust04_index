			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Employment in utilities down 0.4m in decade Britain's gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries employed between them about 900,000 people in 1983, according to Department of Employment figures. A decade of privatisation and competition later the figure had fallen to less than 500,000. This is the job-shedding context in which the announcement from British Gas must be seen. The combination of competition, altered management culture, and, at least in the case of telecommunications, changed technology, has seen a substantial increase in productivity and a jobs shake-out over the past decade in these industries. Much of the job-shedding occurred in the run up to privatisation, but the trend has continued since. British Gas employed about 90,000 people just before privatisation in 1986 and is now down to 76,000. The electricity industry in England and Wales employed 131,400 in 1990 and now employs about 110,00. Employment in the water industry has only fallen slightly from 47,000 to about 45,000. British Telecommunications has dropped most dramatically of all, from 240,000 to 155,000. Job losses have in the main been among lower skilled workers, those that remain are the better paid and higher skilled. Pay analysts say that those who remain have been receiving pay rises well above the average, often supplemented by bonuses to reform old working practices. At Southern Electric last year, such bonuses ranged between Pounds 250 and Pounds 600. Senior managers in most utilities have usually done a great deal better than that. These new costs, combined with large redundancy payments - BT paid out Pounds 1bn last financial year - means that real paybill costs for the utilities have not been falling as fast as the number of employees. But in most cases the job cuts are so large that the total paybill has still fallen significantly. The introduction of competition, deregulation and contracting out of non-core services can also help to create jobs, although not enough to match the losses. In telecommunications, for example, Mercury, the main competitor to BT, now employs 10,000 people; the two big radio telephone companies, Vodafone and Cellnet, employ, 2,500 and 1,100 respectively. Also, big price reductions have saved large users of telecommunications a lot of money which may have helped to create jobs in other parts of the business. Whatever the benefits of privatisation the effect has certainly been to reduce overall employment and to increase the gap between well paid 'core' workers and the periphery of insecure, low-paid, employees. As privatisation spreads from Britain to the rest of Europe this effect is likely to be repeated, although less dramatically. The European Commission is forcing the pace by requiring competition in telecommunications and electricity supply and this is prompting several countries to opt for privatisation. The German government is also considering introducing more competition into electricity supply. Over the past decade continental utilities have been an important source of employment stability, and even new jobs, as the manufacturing sector has shed jobs rapidly. As yesterday's announcement underlines, that has not been the case in Britain.</p>

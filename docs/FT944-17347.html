			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: A job for the Fed Having spent most of the week convulsed with jitters, financial markets took yesterday's US employment data with remarkable calm. September's rise in non-farm payrolls may have been slightly below market expectations but there is no mistaking the strong underlying economic trend. Headline unemployment is below 6 per cent which brings it close to the level at which inflation threatens by almost any definition. The size of the workforce in July and August was also revised upwards, which will doubtless be reflected in capacity use figures when they are published on Friday. In short, there is still every reason to expect a further interest rate rise soon. Perhaps the markets' calm yesterday simply reflected the fact that they were oversold before the announcement. But the truth remains that there can be no lasting recovery, at least, in the bond markets until investors are convinced the Federal Reserve has done enough to cool the economy and keep inflation under control. It would help if the next rate rise was aggressive, but the upward revision to the third-quarter payrolls suggests several more rate rises may be needed after that. Amid the confusion engendered by the renewed tension in Kuwait, it is difficult what to make of the slight recovery of the dollar against the yen. It is just possible, though, that the dollar's rise above Y100 reflects the beginning of capital outflows out of Japan. Traditionally yield conscious Japanese investors must find US bond yields of 8 per cent attractive. If so, the market may be able to cope with rising short term rates more easily than hitherto.</p>

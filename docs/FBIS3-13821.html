			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at  1130 and at 1600 GMT on 20 March report on today's morning and  afternoon sessions of the commission of inquiry into the Hebron  massacre.    In the morning, the commission heard testimony from  settlers.  One settler, who was praying in the Cave of the Patriarchs at  the time of the massacre, "ruled out the chance that Barukh  Goldstein had an accomplice."    Dani Gur-Arye reports: "The settlers who came in contact  with Barukh Goldstein the morning of the massacre described  nothing out of the ordinary in his behavior. Moti Ungar, the  security guard at Qiryat Arba' who drove Goldstein to the cave  that Friday morning, said he was calm and lucid like on any  other day. Ungar said the two men discussed trivial things,  such as the medical equipment on the ambulance at Qiryat Arba'.  He said Goldstein was carrying an Israeli-made Glilon rifle and  several cartridges. Just before leaving the jeep, Goldstein  handed Ungar his car keys, asking that they be delivered to his  wife.    "Another settler, Ilan Tur, ran into Goldstein inside the  Cave of the Patriarchs. Tur said: Goldstein asked me why the  door separating the two halls in the cave were closed. I  explained that Muslims were praying in one hall to mark Ramadan,  while Jews were praying in another hall. He, obviously annoyed,  said the Jews are entitled to pray on Purim. Tur said Goldstein  had a gun and an automatic weapon, probably a Glilon. He said  he later heard shots fired from what sounded like one weapon.  He concludes from this that only one gunman was involved in the  massacre."    In the afternoon session, the commission heard border  policemen who were supposed to be guarding at the Cave of the  Patriarchs at the time of the event, and "all said there were  clear orders not to fire at Jewish settlers under any  circumstances."    Mark Weiss reports: "All the border policemen testifying  before the commission of inquiry said they had received the same  orders concerning open-fire regulations against settlers. Army  orders were clear-cut: Not to shoot at a settler under any  circumstances. They were to wait until the settler had stopped  shooting before approaching him. The judges challenged the  border policemen repeatedly over the logic of such an order, but  the answers were always the same: These were the orders, and we  didn't question them.    "Three border policemen who were supposed to be guarding at  the Cave of the Patriarchs failed to arrive on time. The border  policemen admitted there were arguments over who should guard  and problems with the names written on the guard list. It took  at least 20 critical minutes to locate three people to guard.  Most of those testifying claimed that some of the border  policemen on the list were not even on the base at the time.    "By the time the guards eventually reached the cave, the  massacre had already taken place. Barukh Azaza, the Ethiopian  driver who drove the border policemen to the cave, denied under  questioning that he had fired any shots despite testimony from  colleagues that he had fired into the air."</p>

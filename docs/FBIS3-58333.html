			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andreas Foerster and Peter Kosfeld: "Girke </F> Disappeared to Moscow?"]    [Text] Berlin -- Werner Girke, the owner of the former  Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] company, T.V.O.  [Fiduciary Management and Organization Company], has gone  obviously into hiding abroad. As one investigator has confirmed  for BERLINER ZEITUNG, there is information that Girke is in  Moscow together with his wife. However, an arrest warrant has  not yet been issued against the manager, who is said to have  transferred illegally 4 million German marks [DM] to private  accounts.    Meanwhile it is becoming more and more certain that Girke  shifted major amounts of money abroad until late last year. The  last such transfer was said to have been carried out on 30  December 1993 to an account in Russia.    If that were to turn out to be correct, it virtually  happened  under the eyes of the German criminal authorities. As early as  on 20 December 1993, the Independent Party Assets Commission  filed a complaint against Girke with the office of the state  prosecutor in Moabit on embezzlement of former SED funds. The  complaint included extensive and conclusive documents the  Commission encountered in the course of its research.  Nevertheless, the state prosecutor did not even decide to take  action even when BERLINER ZEITUNG drew attention to Girke's  activities on Thursday [6 January] for the first time. The  search of Girke's company and private premises took place on the  instructions of the Independent Commission.    As the Trust Agency found out, Girke secretly transferred at  least DM4 million from accounts of the SED holding companies,  ORVAG and Corefina, to accounts of his own company. This was  found out by the Berlin police of criminal investigations when  they searched the T.V.O. premises.    "We had to work with Girke" -- this is how, on Friday, Josef  Dierdorf, head of the Trust Agency Directorate for Special  Assets, justified cooperation between the Breuel agency and the  dubious entrepreneur Werner Girke. Without the T.V.O. head and  former trustee of SED foreign assets, who has meanwhile been  fired, bringing back the estimated DM50-60 million in SED  foreign assets from abroad would have been hopeless from the  very beginning. A Trust Agency spokesman vehemently rejected  accusations that the agency started too late to take a closer  look at the shady dealings of the import-export enterprise.  Cooperation with Girke was intended initially "to secure as  many assets as possible." Besides, it was not until  mid-December that the Independent Commission began to realize  that SED funds might have disappeared through T.V.O.</p>

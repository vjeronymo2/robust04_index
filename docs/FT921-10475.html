			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: A Night in Tunisia - Stratford East On one side of the stage is a bargain-basement sax player who thinks he can fly like the Bird; on the other, a burnt-out jazzman hallucinates about his glory days, in a council-sponsored guesthouse where his saxophone rusts away under the bed. Just how the younger Morgan could have turned into the older one is the gist of Paul Sirett's surprisingly touching new play. I say surprisingly because, on several counts, Sirett sets himself pretty tough odds. The jazz club setting, centred around Morgan's quartet, creates basic practical problems, only partially answered, of finding actors who can play and players who can act. Then there is the plotline, which unfolds like a medley of trad cliches: a musician coming to terms with mediocrity; ill-starred romance between sober black saxophonist and drunken white vocalist; artistic paralysis following some sort of life crisis. They are all familiar themes, which Sirett gleefully pushes into genuinely unexpected variations, forcing us - as does all good theatre  - to re-examine our preconceptions and question our ability to judge on a given body of evidence. We are, for instance, given three valuations of the young Morgan. His own fear is that his playing is second-rate, his girlfriend Gillian thinks it is dated, while the club owner believes he is the best thing since bebop. The torment of the older Morgan is fired by his compulsion to order this cacophony of voices from the past into a cogent account of what went wrong and, even more difficult to face, what might have gone right had he not, literally and metaphorically, gone into a skid. One minute he takes refuge in fantasy, informing his concerned Pakistani neighbour in the most excitable terms, that he once played with Miles Davis; the next minute, he dismisses the story as lies. You realise how well Sirett and the older Morgan, Doyle Richmond, have been playing together when the thoughtless confiscation of his saxophone by a social worker becomes a genuinely tragic moment, observed only by the Pakistani (Shobu McAuley), who no-one listens to, and Morgan, who cannot speak. Richmond creates a character who combines frailty and confusion with a commanding dignity. Alan Cooke, as his younger self, deals attractively and ably with the high of the early scenes but is less convincing on the low notes, and I found it hard to believe in the self-destructiveness of Ruth McKenzie's pole-straight and ever-elegant Gillian. Through all, under Jeff Teare's moody direction, the band plays on - a lugubrious lot whose down-beat presence tides this moving play over the occasional musical anachronism.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philips to end PC sales in UK PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to stop selling personal computers (PCs) to consumers in Britain, Scandinavia, Ireland and Greece, marking a further retreat from the highly competitive sector. The company, scheduled to release third-quarter results today, said the decision to end PC sales in these countries would lead to the closure of its European PC distribution centre in the Dutch town of Tilburg, with the loss of 40 jobs. A Philips spokesman denied that Philips was pulling out of PCs, but the group has taken a significant step in retreating from PCs as a strategic product by merging its PC division in the UK with its interactive media systems business. 'We increasingly see ourselves not as a mainstream PC seller but as selling applications to users which involves hardware and software,' said Mr Simon Turner, head of the UK PC operations. Philips's PCs are sold mainly as part of an overall systems package rather than on their own. The Eindhoven spokesman said that the group was continuing to watch developments closely. Fierce competition among PC manufacturers has led to price wars and eroded margins. In April, Philips announced that it was cutting 600 of the 1,800 jobs in its loss-making PC operations and halting the direct sale of PCs in the US. Its new strategy in the US is to seek to produce PCs for US companies which will then market the equipment under their own brand names.</p>

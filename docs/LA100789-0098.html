			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE SEEKS DEAL TO DELAY VOTE ON CAPITAL GAINS;  </P> <P> WOULD STRIP TAX CUT FROM DEFICIT-REDUCTION BILL; ACTION COULD AID PASSAGE  </P> <P> Senate leaders, apparently boosting chances that Congress will ultimately enact  a capital gains tax cut, neared agreement Friday night on a plan to delay a  vote on President Bush's capital gains proposal for several weeks.  </P> <P> After a day of negotiations, Senate Republicans expressed support for a  Democratic offer to strip the tax issue from urgent legislation designed to  trim the budget deficit. Instead, taxes would be considered separately in  several weeks.  </P> <P> "We are moving toward an agreement," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell  (D-Me.) said Friday evening.  </P> <P> Because of the special rules that apply to debate of the deficit reduction  bill, 60 senators would have been required to approve a capital gains tax cut  as a part of that legislation. But, as part of a separate bill, a capital gains  tax cut would need only a majority of senators voting -- a maximum of 51 if all  100 were present.  </P> <P> </P> <P> House OK Needed  </P> <P> The chief remaining obstacle to cinching the deal was the support of House  leaders for a plan for a separate vote on the capital gains measure. Senate and  House leaders scheduled a meeting for this morning to try to complete a deal.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, Bush had expressed opposition to any arrangement that would put  off a showdown on his capital gains proposal.  </P> <P> "Capital gains is vital," Bush said before meeting to discuss the situation  with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill. "It's not an extraneous matter with  me."  </P> <P> Earlier this week, in a session that stretched into the early morning hours of  Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee rejected Bush's capital gains tax cut  -- already approved by the House -- in favor of a Democratic plan that would  make individual retirement accounts more appealing for millions of taxpayers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dozens of Tax Breaks  </P> <P> At the same time, the committee loaded its bill with dozens of extra tax breaks  worth billions of dollars to wealthy individuals and specific business  interests.  </P> <P> Senate Democrats, apparently embarrassed by the widespread publicity given to  the panel's late-night largess and uncertain whether they have the votes to  defeat Bush's capital gains proposal, argued that the only way to approve a  deficit-reduction bill quickly was to strip it of its controversial tax  measures.  </P> <P> Democrats charged that Bush's initial insistence on pressing the capital gains  cut guaranteed that Congress would not complete the deficit reduction bill  before Oct. 16. That is when automatic spending cuts are supposed to take  effect if Congress has not pushed the projected deficit below the $110-billion  target of the Gramm-Rudman budget law.  </P> <P> "The choice is up to the White House," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman  Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.). He said that those who will suffer from the automatic  cuts include Medicare recipients, farmers and students with college loans.  </P> <P> Technically, the government has been operating under the specter of the  Gramm-Rudman ax since the 1990 fiscal year began last Sunday. But most  government agencies, expecting Congress to restore funds to compensate for any  automatic spending cuts, are planning no significant cutbacks.  </P> <P> The capital gains tax cut became part of the deficit reduction bill because, by  most estimates, it would actually add to government revenues in its first two  years. This is because it would encourage the sale of assets that would  otherwise be held, thus producing tax revenue now.  </P> <P> Under the impending agreement, Republicans apparently will support the  Democratic plan to rush through a simplified deficit-reduction measure in  return for a Democratic promise to guarantee a separate vote on cutting the  capital gains rate, one of Bush's key campaign pledges.  </P> <P> Although the capital gains tax cut lost in the Finance Committee on a 10-10 tie  vote, Bush appears to have the support of a majority of the full Senate.  </P> <P> Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets. Under current law, they are  fully taxed at the same rates as other income, up to a maximum of 33%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bill Slashes Tax Rate  </P> <P> Under a bill passed by the House Thursday, the top rate on most capital gains  would be cut to 19.6% through the end of 1991. Then the rate would rise to 28%,  but only gains beyond the inflation rate would be taxed.  </P> <P> In the Finance Committee, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) offered a permanent  capital gains cut. With the support of the White House, he proposed that the  capital gains tax rate vary with the length of time the investment was held.  </P> <P> Investors who sold after Oct. 1 would be allowed to exclude 5% of the profit on  assets owned at least one year, even if the assets were acquired before the new  law took effect. The exclusion would increase by 5 percentage points for each  additional year of ownership, up to a maximum savings of 30% on assets held at  least six years.  </P> <P> Packwood's plan, which was defeated by the 10-10 vote, is expected to be the  starting point for whatever capital gains plan the Senate considers.  </P> <P> Whether or not the Senate accepts a capital gains tax cut, its tax and spending  measures will have to go to a conference committee to settle significant  differences between the House and Senate versions of the deficit reduction  legislation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zenaida Ferrer] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Vilma Espin, president of the  Cuban Women's Federation [FMC], stated, in an exclusive  interview by PRENSA LATINA, that by meeting in Havana, the Cuban  emigrants in [words indistinct] countries are seeking harmonious  relations with the fatherland.    The ones who are coming want positive ties with Cuba. They  have started by feeling the need to defend their land, families,  and fellow citizens and by expressing their opposition to the  U.S. economic, commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba,  Espin stated. She added that interesting and constructive  proposals could result from this meeting.    The head of the FMC, which comprises approximately 3.81  million women over the age of 14, referred to the unequal  characteristics of Cuban emigrants, not only since the  revolutionary victory in 1959, but also during the past century,  and even during the bloodiest phase of Fulgencio Batista's  dictatorship.    She said that during the 1950's, a large number of Cuban  emigrants in several countries in this continent and even in  other parts of the world, received our then-young  revolutionaries, Fidel Castro among them, and expressed their  solidarity and support as fellow citizens.    Espin added, among the current emigrants, there are those  who  left because they felt cheated by the measures adopted at the  initiation of the current system (nationalization of factories,  organizations, properties); others who left the country totally  confused; and those who left for economic reasons, the reasons  for most of those who have left in the past decade.    Espina observed, however, that even if other categories can  be included in the exodus of the past four decades, not all are  against Cuba and some even agree with the revolution and its  leaders.    According to the FMC president, the meeting also has special  importance because it addresses issues basic to the FMC, such as  the need to give priority attention to children and the family.    Cuban women currently represent 40 percent of the active  labor force, 61 percent of mid- and upper-level technicians, 40  percent of investigators, and more than half of family  physicians (health program that gives personalized family  attention in each territory).</p>

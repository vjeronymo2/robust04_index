			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: European Leisure Pounds 45.8m in the red DISCO AND snooker hall owner European Leisure, under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office concerning its acquisition of Midsummer Leisure in 1990, yesterday announced losses after exceptional items of Pounds 45.8m and said it planned to sell up to 30 units to reduce bank borrowings. The exceptional charges included provisions of Pounds 34.6m for losses expected on disposals and a Pounds 12.3m transfer of goodwill from reserves, in line with new accounting standards. Mr Ian Rock, who took over as group managing director following the resignation of Mr Michael Ward last July, said the company aimed to raise between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m from disposals over the next 12 months. This would be used to reduce bank borrowings of Pounds 76m, equal to gearing of 217 per cent. European Leisure ran into trouble following the takeover of Midsummer. The recession has hit leisure companies hard and combined with high interest costs almost brought the company to collapse. Mr Rock said that Barclays, the company's banker, remained 'fully supportive' and has agreed in principle to provide additional borrowing facilities through to April 1993. Trading profits almost halved to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 8.77m) in the six months to end-December as discos and venue bars were hit by recession. Interest costs fell to Pounds 3.76m (Pounds 4.35m). Snooker operations were more resilient and an amusement machine manufacturing division increased profits sharply to Pounds 1.75m, following the success of its Screenplay machine. The retained loss totalled Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 1.76 profit). COMMENT The market was not expecting exceptional charges of this magnitude. The hope must be that after making them public now, there are no more to come. The planned sell-off covers loss-making and non-core units and, given that European Leisure is effectively a forced seller, drastic provisions for losses seem sensible. The question is whether the company can find any buyers in time. Even if it does, it will be left with debt of more than Pounds 64m, and the first half performance would have been even more ghastly without a possible one-off from amusement machines. European Leisure has a very long way to go before it is safe. Even without the SFO cloud, the shares cannot be worth the risk.</p>

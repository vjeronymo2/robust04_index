			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> S. AFRICA'S LIBERALS UNITE  </P> <P> Three white anti-apartheid parties merged in South Africa in hopes of boosting  their collectively sagging fortunes with national elections looming. The  formation of the new Democratic Party is an attempt to broaden the political  base of white liberals, who have suffered repeated setbacks in recent years.  The new party -- "which rejects race as its basis," according to a leading  member -- is to have three leaders, those who served as heads of the merging  parties. They are Zac de Beer of the Progressive Federal Party, Wynand Malan of  the National Democratic Movement and Denis Worrall of the Independent Party.  The first major test for the Democratic Party will come in this year's  parliamentary elections, expected between late July and early September.  </P></p>

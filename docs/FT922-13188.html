			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / 'Informer' allegations hit Stolpe MR Manfred Stolpe, east Germany's most prominent politician, fought to survive as the Social Democratic (SPD) prime minister of Brandenburg state in the face of fresh evidence claiming he was a key informer for the former Stasi state security police. A 61-page report by the official German commission administering the Stasi files concluded that Mr Stolpe was for nearly 20 years an important Stasi informer on the Protestant church, of which he was a senior lay official. The report was based on accounts by three Stasi officers of conversations Mr Stolpe allegedly had with them. He was known to the Stasi by the code-name of 'Secretary'. The Christian Democratic (CDU) coalition partner of Mr Stolpe called on him to relinquish office until the 'severe' charges against him were clarified. The SPD in Bonn said the report contained nothing substantially new, but Alliance 90, Mr Stolpe's smallest coalition member, said it was a 'strong case' against him. Mr Stolpe, however, said he saw no reason to step down. He emphasised that he was never an informer. An all-party committee in Potsdam has been examining the media accusations against Mr Stolpe which surfaced this year and was given the report last Friday. Mr Stolpe himself volunteered the information about his previous Stasi contacts several months ago. As superintendent of the Berlin-Brandenburg church, he helped gain the release of countless east Germans from prison. He also aided in the reuniting of thousands of east Germans with their families in the west.</p>

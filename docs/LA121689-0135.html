			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SANTA VISITS CHILDREN AT TOGETHER CENTER  </P> <P> His cotton-candy beard was an obvious fake. But the delighted children who  attended Thursday's Christmas party at the Orange Children and Parents Together  center didn't care a whit about the quality of Santa's whiskers as they  clambered, one by one, into his overstuffed lap to whisper Christmas wishes in  his ear.  </P> <P> Visits from Santa have become an annual affair for the 3- to 5-year old  children in the center's Head Start Program, thanks to the year-round efforts  of the members of the Itty Bitty Doll Club, a group of 16 or so Orange County  doll collectors who stockpile donations of toys and gifts to give to the  children at a Christmas party they organize for the government-funded agency.  </P> <P> Dr. Dann Reas, an Anaheim chiropractor and an amateur magician who performs at  various charity events, provided the entertainment for this year's party.  </P> <P> Manny Torrez, a vice president in charge of loan administration at El Dorado  Bank in Orange, volunteered to play Santa after hearing about the party from  Jody Cooper, doll club treasurer.  </P> <P> Torrez, who speaks English and Spanish, found his command of the language  useful in view of the fact that 84% of the nearly 250 children enrolled in the  center's day-care, preschool and Head Start programs are Latino.  </P> <P> The average family income for the children who attend the Head Start Program is  $8,000 a year, officials said. Many of the families get by on incomes in the  $3,000 to $4,000 range, however, and most have anywhere from four to nine  children.  </P> <P> Darleen Cordova, president of the Itty Bitty Doll Club and city clerk for the  city of Stanton, said Stanton city employees have adopted one of the center's  needy families.  </P> <P> The employees of El Dorado Bank set up a "money tree" at the bank to help  another family fulfill its Christmas wish list of food, blankets and a home  heater.  </P> <P> So far, more that $1,000 has been collected, according to Cooper, who organized  the "adoption."

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Green log book for land use histories  -Legal Briefs The UK government's decision in March to abandon plans to set up registers of contaminated land has left property owners, occupiers, investors and financial institutions with a problem. When they come to sell, let or mortgage their land, increasingly these days they will be asked, or will be asking, detailed questions about past uses and possible or actual contamination. The registers would have provided a source for some of this information. Now it will have to be sought elsewhere. Physical surveys of the land can be carried out to establish if it is contaminated, but without a history of a site it will be all too easy for even the most comprehensive survey to choose the wrong location from which to take samples and to test for the wrong contaminants. To counteract these problems, City solicitors Norton Rose have devised and developed a 'green log book' (akin to a service history of a second-hand car), which will allow land owners and occupiers to create land use histories and to keep an up-to-date record of present use. The log book would not only cover contamination of the ground but also uses of the land which pollute air or water and which as a result could have polluted adjoining land. With more environmental legislation in the pipeline and the costs to industry of clean-up soaring, Norton Rose predict a green log book will become an essential record for owners and occupiers, whether or not their uses of the land involve contaminative processes. The firm says responsible businesses could make the log book available to regulatory bodies as evidence of compliance with environmental legislation and monitoring procedures. It would also demonstrate a commitment to best practice.</p>

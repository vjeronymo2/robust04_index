If the test procedure cannot be revised during the rulemaking, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommended development of methods to estimate the benefits of design options which tend to improve efficiency under cycling conditions. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2). On the other hand, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation stated room air conditioners are not normally turned on for extended periods of time, and when they are turned on the (room and ambient) temperature is more likely to be high, reducing the amount of cycling. The current one-temperature test procedure adequately matches consumer usage patterns for room air conditioners. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that any change in the procedure will drive up the product cost and provide no benefit. It was the contention of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation that design options such as variable speed compressors, electronic expansion valves, thermostatic cycling controls, and possibly use of alternative refrigerants that improve efficiency under cycling conditions will not result in any measurable efficiency improvements. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that the addition of a cycling test must be justified by in-depth studies and field experiments to determine if the efficiency improvements such a revision would predict are cost-effective. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 6&hyph;8; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 12&hyph;14). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department believes that some design options may improve efficiency under cycling conditions. The Department also agrees that before such design options are translated into test procedure credits, field tests would need to be conducted to provide evidence to support such credits. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking, cycling designs for room air conditioners will not be given test procedure credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Though no test procedure credit will be given to cycling designs, the Department believes that energy savings can be realized through the use of variable speed compressors. Energy savings for variable speed compressors have been estimated by extrapolating from results based on tests performed on central air conditioners. The extrapolated estimate is significantly lower than what test results indicate for central systems. A low estimate is used because room air conditioners probably cycle less than central systems. Cycling data for room air conditioners are not available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are some design options listed in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which are theoretically possible, but for which experimental data or prototypes are not available. The impact of electronic expansion valves and thermostatic cycling controls on the efficiency of room air conditioners has not been analyzed because the Department was not able to obtain any data for these designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation made comments regarding replacement refrigerants for R&hyph;22. They commented that though research has identified refrigerant blends (non-azeotropic mixtures) that could improve the efficiency of room air conditioners, no prototypes have been developed that demonstrate this potential. In addition, changes would be required in room air conditioner systems, e.g., heat exchangers, in order for the unit to operate efficiently with the replacement refrigerant. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 8; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 15). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

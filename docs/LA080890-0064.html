			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> HEEEEEERES JOHNNY, THE 'MAYOR OF HOLLYWOOD'  </P> <P> This man strikes you as something like Leonard Zelig (see Woody Allen's  docucomedy "Zelig"), who is always seen hanging with the near great and plenty  great, standing about with Joe Stalin's entourage or hitting line drives with  Lou Gehrig in spring training.  </P> <P> Johnny Grant is always seen hanging around Hollywood stars, wherever they  gather, a circular little man with an ingratiating nature, a human Smiley Face.  </P> <P> Now 67, the effervescing  announcer-intreviewer-producer-host-star-gazer-hanger-on is feted in a two-hour  special on KTLA Channel 5 tonight at 8: "The Mayor of Hollywood: Johnny Grant's  50th Anniversary in Show Business," commencing from his kid days in Goldsboro,  N.C., when he walked around town with a sandwich advertising board.  </P> <P> Grant is vice president of public affairs for KTLA (for which he produces the  Hollywood Christmas Parade), the "mayor of Hollywood" -- a goodwill assignment  that sometimes takes him to distant lands -- and chairman of the Walk of Fame  Committee, hosting the laying of new sidewalk stars around Hollywood Boulevard.  </P> <P> There's a lot of cornball here but it's a kick to stroll a little down Memory  Lane in the golden-glamour days. Although the Walk of Fame often reflects  Hollywood at its silliest, Johnny Grant represents the glitziest of the image,  without any of the warts. IRV LETOFSKY  </P></p>

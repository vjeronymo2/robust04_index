			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Kaczmarek, head of the Ministry for </F> Ownership Transformations, by correspondent Jerzy Kocowski;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Kocowski] The process of implementing the  ownership transformations program generates much excitement  among the public. Above all, many questions are raised about  the pace at which it is being realized. In your opinion, are  the charges of incorrect choice of the chosen privatization  paths justified? Or the accusation that they are not effective  from the economic viewpoint?    [Kaczmarek] It seems that the all-too-frequent debates on  whether we could privatize faster and better are not to be taken  seriously. This is because, in my opinion, we have reached the  level of effectiveness and efficiency expected of the  privatization process at the present stage of its  implementation. Our financial results to date are illustrated  by the budget revenue of 13.5 trillion zlotys [Z]. However, we  must remember that it is estimated that, between the years 1994  and 1998, the countries of the former Eastern bloc will put up  for sale assets to the value of $190-200 billion. Consequently,  it is hard to compare these two figures today and analyze on  this basis whether much or little has been done in Poland so  far. As regards the concepts on which the ownership  transformation programs are based, I believe that the programs  implemented so far were perfectly correct.    [Kocowski] Would you give a similar rating to the West  Pomeranian firms that have already been privatized?    [Kaczmarek] Privatization progresses at very different rates  in different regions of the country. In your voivodship, there  are no strikingly exceptional projects of ownership  transformations with, say, the involvement of foreign capital.  But there are other excellent ideas. One of these is the  pioneering solution adopted by the Szczecin Shipyard. This  concept should be imitated throughout the country as an example  of a wise contract entered into by managers and employees of an  enterprise. Such solutions are exactly in line with my  philosophy of viewing the ownership-transformation process.    [Kocowski] Nevertheless, not all firms were able to follow  the road to privatization as easily as that. That road has  proved far more tortuous for the Szczecin Brewery, which is  still trying to change its ownership status.    [Kaczmarek] Indeed, that case has taken many months and we  are only at the stage of the preliminary agreement. This is  because the investor who wants to buy shares in the enterprise  must first pay an agreed-upon sum in a down payment, within a  specified time. If he fails to do so, we will be forced to begin  new negotiations, which will naturally delay the completion of  the process.    [Kocowski] Recent opinion polls by the Public Opinion Survey  Center [CBOS] investigating the population's attitude toward the  Universal Privatization Program [PPP] show that 33 percent of  our citizens are in favor of the program. The rest are not  interested in it. Do these results bode well for the future of  the privatization process?    [Kaczmarek] Of course they do because they indicate that 9  million adult Poles accept the idea of privatization. This is,  in any case, a very high index of popular support for the  government program. I do not recall a country in which this  index is higher. Of course, we need to educate the public  further in order to explain to the people the economic and  financial intricacies of the program. Anything thatch is new  and hard to understand at first glance is bound to have a  difficult time winning the public's acceptance.    [Kocowski] Surely, the present situation, with a budget that  has not yet been approved and a vacant office of the head of the  national economy sector, cannot make it easy for you to convince  anyone that privatization is a system superior to the present  model of economic management.    [Kaczmarek] It certainly makes it much more difficult. The  economy must have a leader--someone who will realize the program  course mapped out by the budget policy. After all,  privatization is not a short-term proposal. It is a concept for  long-term economic development.</p>

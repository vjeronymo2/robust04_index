			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>   [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [20 April] he  had joined South Africa's electoral process to save the country  from disaster and to contribute to peace. Interviewed before he  addressed more than 10,000 jubilant IFP supporters in the  kwaZulu capital Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi said although he did not  think the IFP's participation in national elections would lead  to an immediate reduction in violence "the proportion of  violence will be less".    He said it would be naive to believe Inkatha's participation  in elections would mean an end to violence "but it should  decrease because tensions are less". "It will be difficult to  imagine that all tension can vanish in a few days...we would  hope tension will somehow be decreased."    He said he had asked State President F W de Klerk to lift  the  state of emergency only to be told that his advisers had  suggested he impose the emergency in other volatile parts of the  country.    Asked whether he expected to fare well in next week's  elections he said he did not want to "prophesy...that will be  tested." "Some of our offices can't cope with the number of  people joining," he added.    Mr Buthelezi said his late entry into the election race  would  hamper the IFP's performance. He said voter education had not  reached all of his supporters and "this indicates it could well  affect the percentage (of support)".    Asked why he had entered elections at this late stage, the  chief minister replied: "I did so to save the country from  disaster and to contribute to peace."    The IFP president was later received by cheering crowds  outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building.</p>

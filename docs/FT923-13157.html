			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Glut squeezes margins at Alcan EXCESS aluminium supplies squeezed Alcan's margins in the second quarter this year, contributing to a deeper loss for the period. The Montreal-based aluminium producer also painted a sombre picture of its near-term prospects. 'With considerable new capacity being added to the industry this year, it is difficult to see much relief for prices,' Mr David Morton, chairman, said. The net second-quarter loss was USDollars 27m, or 14 cents a share, up from Dollars 5m, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. The six-month loss also widened to Dollars 40m, or 22 cents, from Dollars 6m, or 7 cents. The second-quarter figure includes a Dollars 9m after-tax charge, equal to 4 cents a share, for cost-reduction programmes. Similar charges of Dollars 17m, or 8 cents, were taken a year earlier. Revenues slipped fractionally to just under Dollars 2bn. Mr Morton said an improvement in North America, Germany and France compared with the previous three months was offset by poor results from Japan, partly due to the weak performance of Nippon Light Metal Company. Alcan shipped 191,000 tonnes of ingots in the second quarter, down from 219,000 a year earlier. Deliveries of fabricated products rose to 380,000 tonnes from 368,000 tonnes. The average ingot price dropped by Dollars 38 per tonne to Dollars 1,431, but Alcan said its average production costs had fallen by more than Dollars 100 per tonne in the past year. During 1991, Alcan laid off about 4,000 employees worldwide.</p>

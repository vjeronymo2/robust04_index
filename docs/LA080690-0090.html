			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> OCC TO INDUCT 3 INTO HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Orange Coast College will induct three people into its Alumni Hall of Fame next  month.  </P> <P> The Hall of Fame was established in 1983 "to recognize outstanding alumni and  bring the public's attention to the quality of education at Orange Coast  College," said Doug Bennett, executive director of the Orange Coast College  Foundation.  </P> <P> This year's inductees are Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson, Ernie Vitucci,  general manager of the Orange County Edition of the Times, and Dr. E. Aubrey  Woodroof, vice president of Wound Care Research and Development at Winthrop  Pharmaceuticals.  </P> <P> Anderson, who has also been inducted into the Western State College of Law Hall  of Fame, was an Orange Coast College student from 1973 to 1975. She was  admitted to the California Bar and to federal court practice in 1978 and  elected judge in Fullerton in 1985.  </P> <P> Vitucci attended Orange Coast College from 1965 to 1967. He worked at the  Orange County Register for six months and then at the Orange Coast Daily Pilot  for seven years. He joined The Times in 1973 in the display advertising  department. In 1987, he became general manager.  </P> <P> Woodroof graduated from Orange Coast College in 1962 and then received a  biology degree from San Diego State University. He earned a doctorate in  biochemistry.  </P> <P> Woodroof developed BioBrane, a biosynthetic wound dressing designed to protect  wound surfaces while healing occurs. It also protects large burn wounds until a  skin graft can be performed. Almost transparent, the skin substitute is made of  proteins derived from pig hide and cartilage, which are bound to a nylon and  silicone fabric.  </P> <P> The free ceremony, open to the public, will be Sept. 14 at 5 p.m. in the  college's Fine Arts Hall. The Hall of Fame is in the college's Norman E. Watson  Library. A reception will follow.  </P></p>

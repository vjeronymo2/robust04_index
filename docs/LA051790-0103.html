			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW CLEARS JUSTICE DEPT. IN REP. GRAY CASE  </P> <P> Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr concluded Wednesday that an internal Justice  Department inquiry into the circumstances that led to public disclosure of an  investigation involving House Democratic Whip William H. Gray III was thorough  and that no disciplinary action is warranted.  </P> <P> The Gray investigation was revealed in a CBS-TV broadcast as the Pennsylvania  congressman was running for his House leadership post last year, sparking  accusations that the leak was politically motivated. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh  subsequently ordered the internal inquiry by the department's criminal  division.  </P> <P> Thornburgh asked for Starr's review after rejecting advice by the department's  internal watchdog, who had called for further investigation and possible  discipline, according to sources.  </P> <P> The Justice Department investigation of Gray's office focused on alleged  financial irregularities involving a former accountant for the congressman and  prompted an unusual statement by Thornburgh that Gray himself was not a target.  </P> <P> Thornburgh and Starr met Wednesday with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman  Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks  (D-Tex.) and the ranking Republican members of both panels to report Starr's  findings.  </P> <P> Biden had expressed concern because Thornburgh did not place the investigation  in the hands of Michael E. Shaheen Jr., counsel of the office for professional  responsibility. Shaheen, the Justice Department's chief internal watchdog, is  the official who normally would conduct an investigation of a departmental  leak.  </P> <P> Starr's inquiry found that "several individuals" experienced difficulties with  polygraph examinations during the internal inquiry. It has been reported  previously that Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's former executive assistant,  and David Runkel, his chief spokesman, showed deception during lie detector  tests administered by the FBI.  </P> <P> Both men, who served under Thornburgh when he was governor of Pennsylvania,  were reassigned to other duties Monday. But senior department officials have  said that their reassignments were not related to the Gray incident.  </P> <P> In his announcement, Starr cited "certain concerns of an administrative  nature," and noted that Thornburgh has taken corrective actions. Those  administrative problems appeared to be related to the press office's policy of  handling inquiries about criminal investigations.  </P> <P> Starr agreed with the criminal division's finding that there was no evidence  that any individual at the "main" Justice Department -- a term that excludes  the FBI -- or at any U.S. attorney's office was the source of the original  unauthorized disclosure.  </P> <P> He noted that Runkel played a secondary confirming role when CBS reporter Rita  Braver asked him about the story she had uncovered. Although it was not  mentioned by Starr, the agency's criminal division also found that an FBI  official, no longer with the bureau, served as a secondary confirming source on  the Gray story.  </P> <P> Starr did not recommend that any disciplinary action be taken against Justice  Department officials and concluded that Thornburgh was acting appropriately  when he came to a similar conclusion.  </P></p>

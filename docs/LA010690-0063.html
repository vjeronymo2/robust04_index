			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GLASNOST TAKES CONTROLS OF A MIG;  </P> <P> FOREIGN RELATIONS: A RAND CORP. EXPERT, AT MOSCOW'S INVITATION, BECOMES THE  FIRST AMERICAN TO FLY THE SOVIET JET.  </P> <P> Not so long ago, it would have seemed the stuff of a spy thriller. Here was  Benjamin S. Lambeth, a Cold Warrior by profession, climbing into the cockpit of  the erstwhile Evil Empire's most sophisticated jet fighter.  </P> <P> The 46-year-old Lambeth -- ex-CIA, Harvard Ph.D. and veteran RAND Corp. expert  on Soviet military affairs -- would be the first American to fly the MIG-29, a  ride the folks at the Pentagon want to hear all about.  </P> <P> But that's glasnost for you. Lambeth was the Soviets' special guest on his Dec.  15 flight out of the Kubinka Air Base east of Moscow. His experience, he says,  was "a minor footnote -- but still a milestone in the Soviet-American  relationship."  </P> <P> "This was much more important as a political event than as a technical event,"  Lambeth said, now back in RAND's Santa Monica headquarters and preparing a  briefing for the Defense Department. "The fact that it happened is more  important than anything technical I learned."  </P> <P> Willis Hawkins, a consultant to Lockheed Corp., said the significance of  Lambeth's flight is "reasonably large" in showing Soviet leader Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's willingness to open military secrets.  </P> <P> The MIG-29, a Mach-2.3 interceptor, is a major advance in Soviet technology. It  is roughly comparable to the Americans' front-line F-15 and F-16 fighters,  authorities say, although still a generation behind the most-advanced U.S.  fighters.  </P> <P> Fluent in Russian, Lambeth has made a career translating and analyzing the  Soviet press and military papers, first with the CIA in early 1970s and for 15  years with RAND's National Defense Resarch Institute, an agency sponsored by  the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He is director of RAND's International  Security and Defense Policy Program.  </P> <P> His duties at the think tank have helped Lambeth, a civilian pilot, gain  training and more than 400 hours flying a wide variety of American and foreign  warplanes. Lambeth described his jet fighter experience as "a mile wide and  about a half-inch deep."  </P> <P> The Playa del Rey resident believes the Soviets let him fly the MIG-29 in part  because the U.S. military is not ready to return the favor. The Soviets have  proposed a reciprocal program to allow pilots from each country to fly the  other's warplanes, but the U.S. military has thus far declined.  </P> <P> The Soviets' motives in letting Lambeth fly also reflect their desire to market  the MIG-29 to nations beyond such allied states as Cuba and Syria. A Soviet  leadership that once viewed MIGs as instruments of political leverage now "see  them as sources of hard currency," Lambeth said. Finland, for example, is now  debating whether to buy Soviet- or American-made warplanes.  </P> <P> "It remains to be seen how successful that strategy will be . . . The fact  they're marketing the airplane internationally doesn't mean there's a market  for it," Lambeth added.  </P> <P> But in another sense, the flight happened simply because Lambeth asked.  </P> <P> While attending the Farnborough Air Show in London in September, 1988, Lambeth  met Soviet test pilot Valery Menitskii of the Mikoyan Design Bureau, developer  of the MIG series. "Almost in passing, I said I'd love to be the first American  analyst to fly the MIG-29," Lambeth recalled.  </P> <P> To his surprise, Menitskii said that it might be possible because of  extraordinary changes under Gorbachev. "We decided to extend hands across the  chasm and see what came of it."  </P> <P> Lambeth and Menitskii met again at an air show in Vancouver in August and a  November aviation symposium at the University of Michigan. Menitskii and other  members of the Mikoyan Design Team accepted Lambeth's invitation to visit RAND  last November. (Lambeth also took his guests to Venice's Ocean Front Walk. They  were amused, Lambeth said, by the scenery.)  </P> <P> Lambeth got his chance to fly during a five-day trip to Moscow with two other  Russian-speaking RAND Soviet experts, John Hines and Eugene Rumer. The trip was  devoted primarily to researching evolving U.S.-Soviet relations, arms control  and European security.  </P> <P> The Russian winter seemed to conspire against Lambeth's flight plans. Blowing  snow and restricted visibility almost forced cancellation of the flight. "It  was a day the birds would be walking," Lambeth said.  </P> <P> Late in the afternoon, Lambeth was finally able to take the MIG up. Taking  turns at the controls with Menitskii in a two-seat trainer model, the MIG  performed a series of maneuvers that included loops, stall turns, maximum-rate  rolls and zero-gravity rolls. There was no attempt, however, to explore the  outer reaches of the "performance envelope," Lambeth said.  </P> <P> Lambeth said he was impressed by the MIG's handling, agility and stability at  slow speeds -- that it felt very much like an American F-15 or F-18, and a long  step ahead of the French-made Mirage 2000.  </P> <P> Lambeth said he came away convinced that combat between the MIG-29 and the  American front-line fighters would ultimately be decided by essentially by the  skill of the pilots, not by a technological advantage.  </P> <P> Lambeth, Hines and Rumer were given a close look at a future generation MIG  undergoing stress testing, escorted inside a supersonic wind tunnel and shown  major subsections of a Soviet space shuttle.  </P> <P> A self-decribed "conservative" in his views of U.S.-Soviet relations, Lambeth  said the experience has helped make him more "neutral" in his regard of the  Soviet threat.  </P> <P> But just because the Cold War may be over, there's plenty of work for  Sovietologists -- more now than ever, Lambeth said.  </P> <P> In the Brezhnev era, he explained, the Soviets were predictable. Not so any  more.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to take the long view," Lambeth said, "when the challenge is  just to understand the short run."  </P></p>

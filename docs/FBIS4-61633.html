			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin went  to Warsaw on a one-day visit Friday to attend an East-West  Conference on economic reform in East European countries and the  former USSR.    As he reported in an interview with INTERFAX before his  departure, at that meeting in Warsaw he intended to focus on the  slow progress with lifting "glaring discriminatory restrictions  against Russian commodities" on Western markets. In his words,  damage from these restrictions totals three billion dollars a  year. He intends to suggest that a group of experts specially  meet at the economic forum to tackle this problem.    He emphasized that Russia had been adopting effective  measures to improve the investment climate for foreign  businessmen. By some Western estimates, he continued, Russia  "could annually absorb 40-50 billion dollars in foreign  investment."    There were 13,500 joint ventures involving foreign assets in  Russia by the end of the first quarter of this year. This  year's direct investment in the Russian economy amounted to 2.6  billion dollars.</p>

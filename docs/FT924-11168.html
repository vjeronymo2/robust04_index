			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Milan to trade most shares on new system by next year MOST shares listed on the Milan stock exchange will be traded on its controversial new screen-based system by the middle of next year, according to Mr Lucio Rondelli, chairman of Generale Telematico di Borsa (GTB), the company setting up and managing the system. However, he gave no precise date for the shift to full screen-based trading. The system, introduced last November, currently covers 35 shares which together account for about 25 per cent of the capitalisation of the stock market's equity index. Mr Rondelli defended the system, which has been subject to a series of embarrassing break-downs. Many of the problems for the network, which now serves 224 screens, 68 of them in smaller regional exchanges, stemmed from problems outside GTB's control such as faulty phone lines he said. The unreliability of the system, which has been at its most erratic at moments of heaviest turnover, such as at the opening of the bourse, have led to criticisms from brokers and calls for suspension pending remedial work. The system has recently been subject to an 'audit' by a specialised software house to see whether the bugs are based in the software or require further heavy investment in new computer hardware. While some problems have arisen from software factors, such as the compulsory pauses which occur during heavy trading periods, several recent breakdowns are believed to have stemmed from human error. Mr Rondelli admitted problems had arisen, but these did not affect the 'substantial validity' of the system, which might eventually need 'some corrections'. He added that shares in a few companies which had a very limited float of stock might not be covered by the screen-based system, but that 'solutions will also be found for these cases'.</p>

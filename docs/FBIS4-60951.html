			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 30/4/1994 -- Yesterday, Nina  Ilascu, the wife of the political prisoner Ilie Ilascu, visited  with her husband for two hours at the Hlinaia Jail in  Grigoriopol district. She took with her holy water, wafer,  Easter cake, and red eggs, hallowed by father Vasile Petrache,  vicar of the Chisinau St. Nicholas Church of the Bessarabian  Metropolitan See (old style.) Ilie Ilascu thanked father Vasile  Petrache for the holy gifts and recalled the confession he made  last year behind bars on the stage of the Tiraspol house  Kirovet, where a judicial and political farce was occurring.  Nina Ilascu told BASAPRESS that Ilie Ilascu's health is  deteriorating: He has pains in his liver and stomach. Ilascu  is isolated from information sources. He reconfirmed his  decision not to petition to the Tiraspol leaders for pardon and  awaits decisive actions to be made by the Moldovan Parliament  and president.</p>

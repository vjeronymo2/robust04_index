			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INDIA REJECTS COCA-COLA -- AGAIN  </P> <P> India today rejected Coca-Cola Co.'s bid to re-enter its growing market, from  which the soft-drink maker was effectively ejected in 1977.  </P> <P> Commerce Minister Arun Nehru announced to Parliament that he has turned down  Coca-Cola's proposal to set up a plant near New Delhi to make its soft-drink  concentrate.  </P> <P> A ministry spokeswoman declined to explain the decision.  </P> <P> The government's move leaves PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's main rival, as the only  foreign soft-drink firm with a presence in the growing Indian market, now worth  $200 million.  </P> <P> The rejection was the second setback for Coca-Cola in India at the hands of a  non-Congress Party government. In 1977, when the first non-Congress government  took power, it asked the company to give up 60% of its fully owned Indian  subsidiary. The company refused and pulled out of the country. Its bid to  return centered on a proposal made months before India's second non-Congress  government since independence took power in December.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Ortega] </F>   [Text] International gunrunning is inundating Mexico. As  if we were a nation at war, 20,000 AK-47 rifles -- the lethal  goat's horn -- $12 million worth of them, are being shipped to  our country from the United States.    In February, U.S. military intelligence alerted its Mexican  counterpart about a shipment of 2,000 AK-47 assault rifles which  are part of a larger shipment of more than 20,000 rifles. These  weapons could already be in Mexico.    One expert who was consulted said the shipment "could supply  the largest irregular army ever seen in contemporary Latin  American history." Military authorities, however, ruled out the  possibility that they are linked to a new insurgent movement.    EL FINANCIERO gained access to a report the Defense  Secretariat sent to Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor,  noting that "a reliable source" alerted the Mexican military  attache in Washington about an "upcoming shipment of 2,000 AK-47  assault rifles which was to be sent from the United States to  Mexico."    Classified as urgent and secret, dated 8 February, and  received at the Government Secretariat at 1559 on the following  day, the military report stated: "The arms shipment is  presumably part of a larger shipment of as many as 20,000  similar weapons. The weapons' destination is Guerrero State,  but it is unknown whether part of this contraband has already  entered Mexico or whether it is in the process of entering."    The report noted that in Guerrero State, "mainly in the area  of La Montana and Costa Chica, certain events have occurred to  raise suspicions that drug trafficking and criminal activity in  general might be confused with a subversive movement that is  blossoming."    A copy of the Defense Secretariat communique, which was  assigned the number 6454 and addressed to the government  secretary, was also sent to the former Attorney General Diego  Valdes; Jorge Tello, the current director of the Center of  Investigation and National Security; Francisco Gil Diaz,  assistant secretary of the treasury and public credit; and to  Mario Ruiz Massieu, the current assistant attorney general. The  report added that the arms might be shipped inside containers.    According to a military expert consulted by EL FINANCIERO,  comparable rifles wholesale for $600 apiece in the United  States. This means the first shipment's value is estimated at  $1.2 million, and the entire shipment would be worth at least  $12 million.    The communique also stated that the Guerrero State  government  "has already taken appropriate steps to increase vigilance among  the public security forces."    In conclusion, the Defense Secretariat asked the government  secretary to gather information "to try to detect, in advance,  the entry of this contraband, which could be introduced into the  nation by land or sea and by any means of transportation,  including the use of containers."</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Anti-social Tory ire at the EC 48-hour working week would make the modern party's forebears blush. Last century, it was the conservatives, galvanised by the likes of Disraeli and Lord Shaftesbury, who were keen to introduce legislation protecting the labour force from potentially exploitative factory owners. Even the arch-Tory Lord Salisbury, as prime minister, introduced a fair wages resolution - now repealed - to prevent local authorities contracting out work at miserly levels. It was left to the laisser-faire Liberals to fret over how such laws would eat away at the country's industrial competitiveness.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report: "Roca Rejects Early Election </F> Because It Would Halt Economic Recovery"]    [Text] Madrid -- Convergence and Union [CiU] spokesman  Miquel Roca yesterday [in the Congress of Deputies] rejected  bringing forward the election, since it would halt economic  recovery and the struggle against corruption, and asserted the  need for the anticorruption measures to be effected without  calling into question the rule-of-law state's rules or the  possibility of consolidating the economic improvement. Roca's  speech was a plea for the government and its prime minister to  accept their responsibilities in the struggle against  corruption, but accompanied by greater arguments than on other  occasions in defense of CiU's stance, with repeated criticisms  of those condemning it.    "In some people's opinion," he said, "our conduct deserves  to be described as blackmail, and this is also extended to  Catalonia's citizens as a whole. This assertion is false,  unfair, and offensive, but also -- and this is the worst thing  -- irresponsible. Stirring up territorial apprehensions and  resentments may be advantageous, but history disqualifies those  raising these flags."    "I will not enter into the controversy," he added, "because  that would be for us to enter slippery ground, very far from the  calm that befits the country right now, but I wish to point out  that it would be valid to maintain, with the same legitimacy  that that accusation is leveled against us, that there are  strategies that are based on the idea of the worse the better;  that is, if the economic recovery were cut short, it would not  be bad news for some people's election prospects."    Roca maintained the dual aim of explaining his own stance  and  criticizing that of those who condemn it in asserting that many  of the criticisms that CiU is now receiving are being put in a  bitter and offensive way. He added that the nationalist  coalition does not disregard the criticisms it receives; it  reflects on them, but "I must admit that they would make a  greater impression on our spirit if those leveling them were not  those who have always criticized us." "They are not doing so  just now," he asserted: "They have always done so; their  criticisms have old reminiscences of historical continuity."  These passages provoked shouting and booing from the People's  Party seats, which also broke out when Roca stated that CiU  facilitates stability through its support, and that the economic  situation is not deteriorating, as was recently acknowledged by  one of the news media -- and he showed a page from EL MUNDO --  which "is characterized by a strongly critical stance on our  group's policy."    "So you will not be surprised," he continued, "if I say that  we are more pleased by the opinion of those who demand of our  group a demanding stance that will at the same time bring calm,  which requires of us very particularly that we try to serve the  immediate aims of an economic recovery, without on that account  forgoing demanding of the government a determined struggle  against each and every cause of corruption."    Roca also stated that "nobody will dictate our policy to us  from outside our coalition," and that "we accept the  responsibility that we undertook." "We accept it as long as we  believe that our effort serves some purpose, as long as the  struggle against corruption is not called off, and as long as  the the guidelines of economic and social policy that have made  possible the current change of trend are not altered. If  through this we achieve positive results for society as a whole,  we will be satisfied to have done so, and if this were not so,  we would accept our responsibility, but we would find ourselves  obliged to renew our stance, because our commitment to this  country's governability and stability has those aims."</p>

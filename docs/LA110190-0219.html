			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISHEARTENED DOWNING WANTS TO TALK TO RADER;  </P> <P> ANGELS: DESIGNATED HITTER SAYS HE WON'T FILE FOR FREE AGENCY UNTIL HE AND THE  MANAGER DISCUSS THE SITUATION.  </P> <P> Brian Downing said Wednesday he will postpone filing for free agency until he  speaks to Angel Manager Doug Rader, but added that he will file before the  Sunday deadline if he hears "the same garbage" he heard last week from club  executives.  </P> <P> Downing, who hit .273 in his club-record 13th season after playing sparingly  until July, was told last week the Angels won't go to arbitration with him. He  called a return in 1991 "possible but remote" and wants to be sure all  possibilities have been exhausted before he severs ties with a team for which  he holds career records in nine offensive categories.  </P> <P> Rader has been on a Latin American scouting trip and is expected back at his  Florida home this weekend. Downing said he plans to talk to him by phone  Saturday.  </P> <P> "Through my years of seeing guys disappear, I've heard the theme, 'If they'd  just talked to (the manager), he wouldn't have had to leave,' " said Downing,  who hit .371 (49 for 132) from June 24 to Aug. 17, when he peaked at .303.  "Before I run off and sign somewhere else, I want to talk to Doug so he doesn't  end up saying, 'He should have talked to me.'  </P> <P> "I'm looked upon by them as a last resort, and that's not right. It's their  loss. Somebody's going to get a hell of a big league player. I know I've said I  never could play for somebody else, but they dumped me. It hurts like heck.  This is my home and always has been. I'm going to have to move away and leave  my family behind. But I've always been a fighter. That's what's kept me in the  big leagues 18 years."  </P> <P> Downing, who earned $1.25 million last season, has been plagued by a back  muscle problem the past three seasons and considered retirement when he was  unable to find a remedy. But since beginning a thrice-weekly treatment program  supervised by physical therapist Valerie Sinkus of Whittier, Downing says he  has experienced remarkable improvement and is optimistic about regaining his  old form at age 40.  </P> <P> "I have very little doubt that I'm not going to be 100%. That alone has taken  10 years off my life and puts me back at 30," said Downing, who visited Sinkus  after being referred by a friend of his wife, Cheryl. "It's going to be rough  because it's been three years of constant tearing and damage. I did have  (Sinkus) write me a letter -- I figure I'd need one when I go begging in the  streets -- that states that I will be 100% in time. Tomorrow might be my last  treatment, or it might take a month."  </P> <P> Sinkus said Downing has a muscle imbalance and a restriction of motion in the  fascia, the thick, fibrous layer of tissue that separates muscle tissue, in his  right lower back. She said Downing has responded "real well" to micro-current  therapy designed to stimulate his muscles and restore muscle balance.  </P> <P> Moving on will be difficult for Downing, but his agent, Tom Reich, expects no  difficulty in attracting interest from other clubs if Downing files for free  agency.  </P> <P> "As Brian has demonstrated when he's healthy, he's still one of the toughest  outs with the chips on the line in a game," Reich said. "He's going to play  next season. He feels better than he has in three years. Brian wants to play,  and he's feeling very upbeat about that."  </P> <P> Downing was optimistic about returning to the Angels until last Thursday.  Although he expected to hear them say they would decline to go to arbitration,  he said he was hurt to hear them say he was merely a part-time player, and he  contends that they limited him to that role.  </P> <P> "I always knew this is a business, but you never think it's going to happen to  you," said Downing, a .266 career hitter, .272 for the Angels. "I have no  second thoughts about anything that's happened here. Hopefully I'll get a  chance to win somewhere else. . . . At this point, I don't have any choice any  more (except to file for free agency). They dumped me. I would never have left  of my own free will."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Richard M. Brown assumes the roles of president and chief executive officer of  the Angels today. Brown, the club's legal counsel since 1981, was given those  titles Oct. 4 in a restructuring of the Angels' front office. . . . The Angels  released their spring training schedule and will play their first exhibition  game against the San Diego Padres in Yuma, Ariz., on March 8.  </P></p>

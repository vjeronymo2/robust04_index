			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C. ;  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE BACKS BILL FOR DISABLED  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the Bush Administration has unqualified support  for Senate-passed civil rights legislation to protect the disabled. The  Americans With Disabilities Act passed Sept. 7 after negotiations between  senators and the White House to soften some of the impact on business.  Thornburgh had expressed reservations about the bill, but told the House  Judiciary Committee those concerns had been resolved. The bill guarantees the  disabled equal access to public accommodations and employment opportunities.  </P></p>

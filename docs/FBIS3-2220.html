The friend told AFP that Wei had telephoned at 12:20 p.m  (0800 GMT) [time as received] to say his interrogation had  finished and he would be returning to Beijing later Saturday  evening.    Wei was picked up by police Friday morning and taken to a  state guesthouse in the northern outskirts of the city, the  friend said by telephone. Wei, who was released from prison on  September 14, just six months short of a 15-year term, was taken  into detention four days after meeting US Assistant Secretary of  State for Human Rights John Shattuck in Beijing. During the  meeting, Wei had urged Washington "to be as tough as the  Chinese" over the question of human rights in China.    Wei had played a leading role in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall  movement when he called for full democracy in China and  denounced paramount leader Deng Xiaoping as a despot. His  detention this week came amid a crackdown on political  dissidents that saw at least seven activists picked up in a  police sweep in Beijing and Shanghai.    Veteran Shanghai dissident Bao Ge, who was taken into police  custody in the eastern city on Thursday evening, said he had  been detained for 22 hours in an apparent attempt to prevent him  meeting with Shattuck.    Bao, contacted by telephone, said that prior to his  detention  he had been approached through an intermediary about a possible  meeting with Shattuck, who had a brief stopover in Shanghai  Thursday after his Beijing visit. Although his interrogators  had not mentioned Shattuck by name, the 30-year-old Bao said  they had warned him against meeting foreign officials. He also  received a strong warning to refrain from any protest activity  during the visit to China of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa from March 19-21.    Bao was a leading spokesman for a grassroots pressure group  that pushed the Chinese government to reopen the issue of  Japanese war reparations. He had been detained by the  authorities ahead of the state visit to China by Japanese  Emperor Akihito in October 1992.    Friends of another prominent dissident, labour activist Zhou  Guoqiang, who was picked up Thursday in Beijing for questioning  about alleged anti-government activities, said they had had no  news of his whereabouts or if he was still being detained.</p>

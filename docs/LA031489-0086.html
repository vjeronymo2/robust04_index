			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC AGREES TO PAY $7 MILLION TO SETTLE SHAREHOLDERS'  CLASS-ACTION SUIT  </P> <P> Pacific Scientific Co. said Monday it has agreed to pay $7 million in cash and  stock to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by shareholders who accused the  Newport Beach electronics company of making false and misleading sales  estimates in 1983.  </P> <P> The immediate effect of the settlement, half in cash and half in a new series  of preferred stock, will be a drastic increase in the company's loss last year.  The settlement will drive the firm's annual loss to $4.1 million from its  previously reported loss of $793,000.  </P> <P> The settlement came Friday morning after a federal court jury in Los Angeles  had been selected to hear the suit brought by the A&amp;J Deutscher Family Fund  of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which bought 1,000 shares of Pacific Scientific stock  on March 16, 1983.  </P> <P> The settlement is the biggest pay-out from litigation that the 70-year-old  company has ever made, said Richard V. Plat, the company's senior vice  president for finance. He said the company did not admit any liability in  settling the case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Few Details Left  </P> <P> A few details in the settlement still must be ironed out, he said. The  preferred stock, for instance, will carry a 10% interest rate, but the amount  of time the company has to pay the principal has not been determined, he said.  </P> <P> Because the lawsuit was a class action that affects all investors who bought  stock from March 7, 1983, through Sept. 29, 1983, the final settlement must be  approved by U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, who has presided over the  litigation. The company estimated that 1,000 to 2,000 shareholders could  collect under the settlement.  </P> <P> "This was a good thing for the company to settle," Plat said. "Prolonged  litigation is a very expensive item, and you are never sure what the outcome  will be."  </P> <P> Pacific Scientific spent nearly $2 million on defense fees and costs, he said.  The company's insurance carrier has paid half the legal fees, Plat said, and  will pay a "substantial portion" of the settlement.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the Deutscher fund could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawsuit's Allegations  </P> <P> In its 1985 lawsuit, the Deutscher fund claimed that Pacific Scientific  violated various federal and state securities laws. It alleged that corporate  officers knew or should have known in 1983 that orders for the company's  mechanical shock arresters would decline significantly. It also alleged that  certain insiders sold shares of Pacific Scientific stock with non-public  information.  </P> <P> Mechanical shock arresters are used primarily in nuclear power plants to  support the piping systems and protect them from possible rupture in the event  of an earthquake or other events.  </P> <P> In its 1983 annual report, issued in 1984, the company said the decline in  sales "had been anticipated, but not at the scale at which it occurred." By the  end of 1983, the backlog of orders for shock arresters had fallen to $6 million  from $27 million a year earlier.  </P></p>

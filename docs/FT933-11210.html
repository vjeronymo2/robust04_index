			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Allied to acquire Augustus Barnett BASS, the UK's biggest brewer, yesterday confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of its Augustus Barnett off-licence chain to Allied-Lyons, the food, drinks and retailing group. The long-rumoured deal, worth about Pounds 40m according to industry estimates, would consolidate Allied's position as the country's second-largest specialist drinks retailer, combining its 970 Victoria Wine outlets with Augustus Barnett's 540 shops. Whitbread's Thresher chain, boosted by the Pounds 49.5m acquisition of 667 Peter Dominic outlets from Grand Metropolitan two years ago, is the leading retailer with 1,600 shops and a 10 per cent share of the take-home drinks market. The merger of Victoria Wine and Augustus Barnett would give Allied an 8.6 per cent market share, well ahead of other specialists such as Oddbins and Cellar 5 with shares of under 2 per cent. It would increase sales opportunities for its spirits and beer brands, improve its purchasing power and enable it to compete more effectively against the grocery multiples. The merged chain would be particularly strong in Scotland, where it would have 330 shops. Bass is expected to secure a supply agreement for its beers as part of the deal. The take-home trade is now one of the fastest-growing sectors of the beer market, accelerated by the focus on value for money during the recession and the decline in numbers of younger pub-goers. It is expected to increase its 20 per cent share of total beer sales to 30 per cent by the end of the decade. Specialist off-licences have encountered aggressive competition in recent years from supermarkets, led by J Sainsbury and Tesco, each of which has raised market share above 9 per cent. According to Verdict, the market researcher, food retailers - helped by Sunday opening and evening trading - have captured about half the Pounds 6bn market for take-home drinks. The specialist off-licences have been hitting back, however. Victoria Wine recorded sales growth of 6 per cent last year by providing a greater range of drinks brands, and by focusing on customer research and service. Augustus Barnett has been relocating to larger premises.</p>

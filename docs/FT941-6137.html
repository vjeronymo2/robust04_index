			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / PIA warns over non-membership Firms which refused to join the personal investment authority, the new regulator for retail financial services, could find themselves effectively under its regime anyway, Mr Joe Palmer, the authority's chairman, said yesterday. The statutory right to choose to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, would survive but, he said, SIB would be effective in deterring those who wanted to take that route. SIB was 'quite likely' to tell those who wanted to come directly under its control that it would apply the PIA rulebook and the PIA compensation scheme arrangements. Mr Palmer told the inquiry by the cross-party treasury committee of MPs into financial regulation that such firms would then find themselves 'under our framework of regulation without any say at all in how it was to be handled'. In the 10 days since the PIA prospectus was published there have been a few indications of support from within the life insurance industry. Many large firms have continued to voice concern, however, while stopping short of declaring that they would not sign up to the new regulator. It is essential for the PIA's credibility as a regulator that it attracts enough backing from life companies, banks, independent financial advisers and others in the financial services sector. Mr Palmer said: 'We need the willing support of at least the majority of the industry we seek to regulate.' But he and Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, faced scepticism from the MPs about how effective the authority could be in checking standards across its potential membership of 6,000 firms and individuals particularly since in the case of the large life insurers and banks it would be dependent on senior management for the control of individual sales agents.</p>

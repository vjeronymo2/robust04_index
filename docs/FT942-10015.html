			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: SA Breweries lifts earnings to R943m South African Breweries, the country's largest consumer industries company, increased attributable earnings by 14 per cent to R943m (Dollars 190.5m) from R825m in the year to March. A solid performance from the group's beer interests, which together make SAB the seventh largest brewing company in the world, provided most of the profit. Net earnings were R707m, an improvement of 14 per cent over last year's figure of R541m. The group's other large industries, including retail group Edgars and industrial interests Lion Match and Plate Glass Shatterprufe Industries, contributed R236m to attributable earnings, a rise of 15 per cent on last year. Turnover increased to R25.45bn, a rise of 12 per cent from last year's R21.78bn. A final dividend of 116 cents was announced, bringing the full year dividend to 155 cents, a rise of 13 per cent. Cash utilised in expanding operations and net acquisitions rose to R921m from R574m, reflecting the company's growing operations in Hungary and Tanzania. Mr Malcolm Wyman, group corporate finance director, said SAB would continue to investigate offshore expansion in 'mass market developing countries' particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Europe. A decline in net working capital of R230m compared with last year's increase of R17m, but Mr Wyman said this was largely a result of last year's very favourable year end position and was unlikely to be repeated. Mr Wyman said that continued weak consumer spending, combined with widespread pre-election violence, had dampened growth over the past year, but that SAB was confident, given the success of the elections and the new economic upturn, further real growth in earnings and dividends would be achieved over the next year. He pointed to a record R1.9bn in investment spending as a good indication of the company's commitment to local development and said that a further R2bn had already been allocated for the next financial year.</p>

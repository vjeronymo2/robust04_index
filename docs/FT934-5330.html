			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Magna expands auto parts side in Europe Canada's Magna International is expanding its European automotive parts interests with an agreement to buy a 74 per cent stake in Zipperle, a German-based maker of mirrors, from Porsche Austria. The Zipperle acquisition is part of a strategy by Magna to forge closer links with European carmakers, partly with an eye to supplying new North American assembly plants being built by BMW and Mercedes Benz. Magna, which declined to provide details of the deal, said it would work with Porsche to expand Zipperle's business. Zipperle has annual sales of about CDollars 150m (USDollars 115.4m). The Canadian company already has interests in several European parts factories. It recently bought a 12.5 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt of Germany, as well as a controlling stake in a Kolbenschmidt unit which makes airbags and steering wheels. The company is also keen to expand exchanges of know-how between its North American and European operations. Several of its senior managers have European roots. Air Canada and rival Canadian Airlines have called in Mr Stanley Hartt, a lawyer, to mediate in their dispute over ownership of the Gemini computer reservations system. Air Canada has been blocking Canadian Air's departure from the system through the courts.</p>

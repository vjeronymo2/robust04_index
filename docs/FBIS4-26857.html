			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wan Chengcai] </F>   [Text] Moscow, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Compared with the  upheavals Russia has seen in the past two years, the political  situation of the country can be said stable, which could help  propel Russia's economic reconstruction and reforms it vitally  needs.    The stability is shown in the following fields:    -- The relations between the republics-regions and the  federal authorities have improved.    -- The inflation rate has been lowered and contained, and  market's role has increased, although the economic situation  remains bleak.    -- The former relationship of confrontation between the  parliament and the government has been turned into one of  dialogue. The parliament and President Boris Yeltsin are  settling their differences by cooperation and coordination.    -- The Civic Accord signed in late April has restricted any  political party from resorting to actions that might violate the  constitution and other laws concerned.    In February, tension between the lower house of parliament,  or State Duma, and Yeltsin was defused after the leaders of the  1991 "August 19 incident" and former lawmakers involved in the  October uprising were freed. Yeltsin first opposed the amnesty  resolution of the State Duma.    Yeltsin now has regular meetings with parliament speakers  and  the prime minister. He also has frequent meetings with leaders  of the major political parties of the country.    After the State Duma and Yeltsin called for national  reconciliation and concentration on economic recovery and  development, the Civic Accord was signed last April.    The accord calls for dialogue, consultation, negotiation to  seek a common ground and a reasonable compromise in the  settlement of the country's problems.    The accord also voices strong opposition to political  confrontation and violence.    Thanks to the accord, there are no more large-scale street  protest rallies and demonstrations that could trigger violence,  and Yeltsin said earlier this month that the opposition is now  resorting to peaceful political activities.    Meanwhile, the federal authorities signed a treaty with the  once secessionist Republic of Tatarstan in February. Last month  Yeltsin visited the republic and worked out a mechanism to  implement the treaty with local leaders.    Yeltsin is going to sign similar treaties with other  republics and regions.    Recently Yeltsin made a sharp departure from his refusal to  have direct dialogue with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev,  whose republic has declared independence.    Except Chechen all the republics and regions have been  represented in the Federation Council (the upper house), making  the chances of division of Russia remote.    In the economic sphere, the Russian Government has managed  to  contain the monthly inflation rate to below 10 percent from a  level of 20 to 25 percent of two years ago.    Yeltsin recently signed 20 decrees to encourage investments  and promote production, much to the welcome of the population.    At the end of last year Russia adopted a new constitution  under which a presidential government was formed and a new  broad-based parliament elected.    The new government and parliament reshaped the home and  foreign policies to some extent.    Gradual reforms, appropriate state control and social  security have replaced radical "shock therapies" in reforms.    In its foreign policy, the government attaches importance to  protecting national interests and restoring Russia's status as a  big power.    Analysts also said that although Russia now enjoys a  relative  stability, uncertainties are still around.    Industrial production in the first six months of this year  has dropped by 28 percent compared with the same period of last  year, a lot of factories are out of operation, unemployment and  crime are increasing, and one half of the population are living  near or below the poverty line.</p>

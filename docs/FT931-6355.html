			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: Horizontal slice of European art / A look back to the works of 1893 at the Musee d'Orsay The chronological study of a movement's development, or the retrospective account of a particular artist and his work, is the staple of art-historical museum practice. But there are other ways to slice it for the microscope than up and down. The Musee d'Orsay has been looking sideways more and more in recent years, and now, after the success of its contextual studies of Van Gogh and then of Munch in their Paris periods, it has made the horizontal slice much thinner and chosen to see what artists of all kinds throughout Europe were up to in a single year. The single-year idea is not new - I can remember a modest but excellent show at the Tate in the mid 1970s, of works in the collections made in 1935 - but this is the first I can think of to attempt so ambitious, pan-European a view. As such it can hardly fail to be interesting and enjoyable to anyone of open mind and catholic tastes. Here, cheek by jowl, sit great works alongside manifest oddities, the familiar with the unfamiliar or unjustly forgotten, different views and approaches to the same subject, the different results to be had from similar practice. A full century ago, 1893, is as good a year as any to settle on, with Europe, fin de siecle, at its most cosmopolitan. And if Paris remained at the heart of things, we have for once a French exhibition that does admit of a significant world beyond. The sectional titles set out the possibilities - inspiring places; daylight; primitivisms; science and poetry; intimism and modernity; myths, religions, allegories; muses, nymphs and shepherdesses; crowds, processions, solitudes; artists, writers, musicians. Every section springs its surprises and pleasures. Here are Prince Eugen (Sweden), with a barn-like castle beneath a wide northern sky, and DeGouve de Nuncques (Belgium), whose strangely lit pink house is a clear anticipation of Magritte, with a row of Monet's Rouen facades across the room. Here are towering cliffs by Mednyanszky (Hungary); a mystical sunset by Sohlberg (Norway); trees on breezy hill-top by Thoma (Germany). Tea, for Casas (Spain), is taken in pregnant silence on the verandah; for Guthrie (Scotland), with gossip in the garden; Kroyer's young lady (Denmark) sits quietly reading beneath the rose bush. We are given two magnificent Gauguins, a self-portrait and 'Otahi', a small but monumental image of a crouching Tahitian girl. And alongside are a Breton girl lying in the sun, by Amiet (Switzerland); a seated Breton girl in blue-striped shawl by the excellent Roderic O'Connor (Ireland); and a quite extraordinary, abstracted painting of Van Gogh's funeral, three broad bands of colour, yellow, purple-black and pink, and a row of orange heads above the pew, by Emile Bernard. So it goes on, the influence accepted and remodelled, the intuitive sympathy, the unlooked-for correspondence - Burne-Jones's strange grey painting (England) of Perseus stealing, while they slept, the single eye of the Graiae, sisters of the Gorgons; Malczewski's spirit of the whirlwind in the cornfield; Masek's prophetess Libusa (Austria); Moreau's apocalyptic Moses saved from the water. The point of the strength and continuing importance of symbolism throughout the period, too often over-looked in the modernist preoccupation with post-impressionism, is well made. The academic tradition, vivified by current impressionist example, is also well represented, most especially in the portraits and conversation pieces - Breitner's tall girl before the mirror (Hollland); Rusinol's piano lesson (Spain) with Renoir's two young girls at the piano; Corinth's vigorous, cool portrait of the painter Leistikow (Germany); Rothenstein's of the painter Conder, turning to leave the room (England); Serov's of the painter Levitan (Russia); the artist's wife splendid in her scarlet dress by Anders Zorn (Sweden). But most remarkable, perhaps, is the Italian contribution with its technical debt to Pissarro and pointilism, its conscious social realism and over-lay of symbolism and its clear fore-shadowing of the Italian avant-garde, Balla and Boccioni some ten years on. Here are Morbelli's old men in the bleak hospice, and his rice-pickers bent double in the fields; Nomellini's workers at a factory gate; and Pollizza da Volpeda's religious procession in the summer sunshine, at once poignant, memorable and technically advanced. The show ends with the proto-expressionism of Munch (Norway) and Ensor (Belgium) and a genuflection to Cezanne. There is also the mandatory audio-visual display, usually so resistible but this the most charming I have ever seen: an anthology of rare cinematic vignettes of the period, made by the Lumiere brothers in the streets of all the capitals of Europe. But interesting as it is, the show is not an unqualified success. With barely 90 exhibits, it is small enough, which is no bad thing; the Orsay space for special shows is constrictive and ill-designed in any case. But such portmanteau shows do hold out the promise of a generous and comprehensive presentation, and here the promise is not truly delivered. The omissions are all too clear, where comparatively few additions, 20 or so, would have more than done the trick. Perhaps the loans were asked for and denied. Yet surely there could have been a Whistler and a Sargent, not say a Degas. And, from a British point of view, why so poor and trivial a Sickert, why no Steer, no Nicholson, no Clausen, no Stanhope Forbes . . .

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Iran's MPs block cuts in food and drug subsidies Iran's parliament yesterday ordered the government not to cut subsidies on food and medicine, weakening a key element of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's economic liberalisation programme, Reuter reports from Tehran. The MPs, during a debate broadcast on state radio, agreed however with the government on the need for cuts in generous domestic energy subsidies, despite earlier this year having vetoed an increase in petrol prices. As it opened its debate on a new five-year plan, already watered down in committee by members uneasy with Mr Rafsanjani's free-market reforms, parliament also ordered a 25 per cent cut in Iran's foreign debt by the end of the plan. The government had proposed a 15 per cent cut in foreign borrowing during the five-year plan, which was originally due to come into force at the end of March, but has been delayed by parliament for one year to allow closer study. The debt was put at Dollars 30bn by Mr Ali Movahedi Savoji, a Tehran deputy, during the debate. Mr Rafsanjani said in April that Iran's foreign debt was Dollars 18bn, of which Dollars 10bn had been refinanced in agreements with foreign creditors. Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said special Majlis (parliament) committees had 'hammered out and modified' government proposals for the five-year development plan, Iran's second since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The full parliament approved the plan's broad objectives, of deregulation, currency and subsidy reforms that have stirred popular discontent. 'The government does not feel there are great differences (to the plan) after the approval of the (Majlis) special committee,' said Mr Masood Rowghani Zanjani, head of the budget and planning body and representing the government in the debate. 'We were able to minimise our differences.' But the committee told the government not to make cuts during the plan in subsidies on medicine and certain foodstuffs - worth Dollars 1.67bn a year compared to a total budget for 1994-95 of just under Dollars 40bn.</p>

Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid told MENA that the United Nations should  treat the Arab region as a geographical unit entitled to a  permanent seat in the UNSC in the event that the latter's  membership is expanded in accordance with the proposal made by  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that granting a permanent seat at the  UNSC to the Arab group would help boost relations between the  Arab World, Europe, and the rest of the World. [passage omitted]</p>

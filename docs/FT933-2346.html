			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / In praise of the sages: Truth of the Matter INTERGENERATIONAL tension. It is an unpleasant prospect, and not at all suitable for contemplation in what has been deemed the European Year of Older People. But the arguments raised in Britain about the extent to which pensioners should be protected from rises in value added tax might be regarded as harbingers of more serious disputes to come. Years ago, in his Private Eye column, Auberon Waugh used to fantasise about relieving state pensioners of the weight of their wallets as they staggered out of the Post Office. Now, one need only consider the growing number of juveniles apparently reduced to beggary on the streets to imagine how Waugh's impertinence could be translated into a genuine terror of anti-geriatric resentment. Other phenomena attest to a shift in the balance of the generations. Some are banal: the bumper stickers which proclaim 'I'm Spending My Children's Inheritance', and the celebrity of TV retirement sit-coms (One Foot in the Grave, Waiting For God, etc). More serious indices include the establishment of the 'University of the Third Age' up and down the country and the success of Richard Ingrams' The Oldie magazine ('Buy it before you snuff it'). The statistic which underpins these phenomena is that 15 per cent of the British population is now over 65. The proportion is unlikely to grow much in the future, but it is a significant departure from the past. All this makes the campaign of Age Concern ('How Long Before People Call You Names? Fight Ageism Now') timely, but confusing. To create a class of 'Third Age' citizens, with its own behavioural attributes and almost tribal cohesion, is not equivalent to putting a civic premium upon longevity. Recognising the rights of the old is not the same as honouring their duties, and to stress the 'normality' of the old is misguided. And for the old to create hermetic spaces of their own, in which they proceed to ape the young  -it happens, most notoriously, in Florida - is asking for marginalisation and ridicule. The stereotypes on which an entertainment like One Foot in the Grave relies are, if one thinks about it, spurious. Peevishness is a fault of character, not of age. But the tendency to sideline the over-60s is enough to turn any of them into misanthropic ranters. As Cicero argued in his Essay on Old Age, mental agility has always been more highly valued than physical prowess. So why should anyone assume that muscular weakness implies failing powers? What we need is to recover a collective acceptance of the ageing process which properly salutes those we already term senior citizens. That many old people in Britain resent that denomination is a mark of communal failure. Seniority has become conflated with senescence, or even with senility; we have somehow lost the ancient understanding that an infant is born 'mindless' and is only shaped into a rational being by the passage of years. A busload of pensioners may not add up to a coterie of philosophers, but the association of age with wisdom is not dismissable as some outmoded sentiment. It is the logical consequence of the tradition of empirical knowledge. 'Ageism', if it implies the perceived redundance of anyone beyond 60 (or 50, or even 40, as some women are finding), simply runs against the grain of scientific method. The latitudes of age are a measure of good sense. This was something that our ancestors understood, with their essentially presbyterial societies; and it just survives in our present constitution with that stronghold of sages, the House of Lords. Ageism is irrational. To the defeat of irrationality, let us raise our glasses of chronologically challenged claret.</p>

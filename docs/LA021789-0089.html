			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Central Valley Regional Center, which serves as the major referral  placement agency for thousands of developmentally disabled people in the San  Joaquin Valley, could be forced to close its doors in April. Warren McEwen,  director of the center, said he expects the agency and 20 others like it  throughout the state to shut down in April because of a lack of operating  funds. He said most of the Central Valley Center's 164 employees, who work in  Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Tulare and Kings counties, will be laid off  if the center is forced to close. McEwen said a glitch in state funding will  apparently force the centers to close in April, leaving about 90,000  developmentally disabled people in the state without services.  </P></p>

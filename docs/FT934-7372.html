			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading EARLY fireworks in London derivatives turned out to be no more than a few damp squibs as the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 faded away ahead of Footsie options expiry today, writes Peter John. The Footsie future for December opened at 3,138, some 10 points above Wednesday's official close. Following economic data which suggested that employment prospects were recovering but wage growth was remaining low - the dream ticket of recovery without inflation - the contract shot forward to 3,153. At that level it was some 15 points above the day's high point in the underlying cash market. That compares to a fair value premium to cash of only 6 points and consequently presented an opportunity to arbitrage by selling the highly priced futures market and buying the comparatively cheap cash market. As a result, the futures fell back to 3,133.5 by the official close when more than 11,600 contracts were traded. It continued to trickle off in after hours trading. Options dealings were overshadowed by the expiry of the November series on the Footsie today although there was a large trade in the European-style Footsie options with one house buying 1,250 puts expiring in June at a strike price of 3,125. Total options turnover was 36,750 lots, slightly down from 38,900 on Wednesday. The most active stock option was BT with 2,496 lots dealt.</p>

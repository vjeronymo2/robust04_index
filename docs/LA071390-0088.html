			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: GODZILLA HAD TO RISE FROM THIS SLIME  </P> <P> Stan Lesniak of Littlerock, Calif., will compete in Sunday's Ironman Triathlon  at Hakone, Japan. The 33-year-old developer has been training three to four  hours each day, sometimes beginning with a 50-mile bike ride at 4 a.m.  </P> <P> Lesniak expects to benefit from training in the high desert heat. However, he  told Bob Schaller of the Antelope Valley Press that Japan's Lake Biwa will be  nothing like the Eastside Pool in Lancaster.  </P> <P> "It's all green and slimy," Lesniak said of Lake Biwa. "You come out of it  looking like the Hulk. You're all green. Bill Bixby (star of 'The Incredible  Hulk' television series) would really like it."  </P> <P> Old money: This will come as no solace to San Francisco Giant owner Bob Lurie,  nor will it interest Raider owner Al Davis. But for what it's worth, Yankee  Stadium cost co-owners Col. Jacob Ruppert and Col. Tillinghast Huston $2.5  million in 1921. For the 11.6 acres of Bronx farmland where the stadium was  built, they paid $600,000.  </P> <P> So, as "The Yankee Encyclopedia" suggests, Babe Ruth's popularity, plus the  legalization of Sunday baseball in New York, may have pointed the way, but  America's most famous stadium was the house that private funding built.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who hit the most home runs at Yankee Stadium?  </P> <P> Amendment to excellence: From the Associated Press: "(Coach Art) Shell  succeeded Mike Shanahan after the Raiders got off to a 1-3 start and led them  to an 8-8 record in 1989. But that was marred by the fact the Raiders finished  the year with losses at Seattle and New Jersey, when one win would have gotten  them into the playoffs."  </P> <P> The Raiders never did match up well with the Nets.  </P> <P> Start your engines: When Mike Harris of the Associated Press asked  actor-entrepreneur-race driver Paul Newman his opinion of "Days of Thunder,"  Newman shifted gears and began praising his own racing film, "Winning," made in  1968.  </P> <P> "Not because the racing footage was the best or anything," Newman said, "but  because the people integrated into the racing. And usually you find that people  are inserted, or transplanted on top of, or glued to the story . . . If they  could do a great story about racing, it would be really exciting, I think.  </P> <P> "I think the temptation to make a picture about the car ultimately overwhelms  the human aspect of it because it would appear, on the surface, to be a much  more cinematic impact.  </P> <P> "Great movies ultimately have to be about people."  </P> <P> The shirt off his back: As a high school football player in New York, Rob Moore  would visit Jet practices to watch his favorite player, Wesley Walker.  </P> <P> The Jets, who chose the former Syracuse wide receiver in Tuesday's NFL  supplemental draft, announced that Moore will wear Walker's old jersey number,  85.  </P> <P> No coincidence. It was Walker's idea.  </P> <P> Speech therapy: These trades, from "The Baseball Encyclopedia," may or may not  have pleased the teams involved, but they left more than one announcer  tongue-tied: George Burns for Bill Wambsganss (1924); Bob Smith for Wes  Schulmerich (1930); Eddie Miller for Johnny Wyrostek (1948); Jimmie Hall for  Terry Bongiovanni (1969); Ed Herrmann for Fred Anyzeski (1975).  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Mickey Mantle, 266.  </P> <P> Quotebook: General Manager John McVay of the San Francisco 49ers, on why Lyle  Alzado, Bert Jones and Mark Gastineau are making, or considering, comebacks:  "Nolan Ryan."

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / France forces retreat on fish prices A late-night French threat to block Norway's entry into the European Union produced a rapid pay-off for Paris early yesterday with Brussels announcing a two-month extension of minimum prices for fish imported into the EU. France's strong-arm tactics forced a U-turn by the European Commission which 24 hours earlier had refused to extend crisis measures to prop up fish prices. The Commission's retreat will upset fish exporters in the US and eastern Europe, but offers a breathing space to the French government, which has struggled to contain violent protests by its fishermen against cheap imports. Mr Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European affairs, said he had intervened with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, during a marathon negotiating session on Norwegian accession to the EU which ended early yesterday. 'I made it quite clear this was a condition for our agreement to Norwegian membership, and especially on the fish arrangements with Norway,' he said. The French threat succeeded, and shortly before midnight Norway and the EU reached agreement on fishing rights. A final accord on the terms of entry for Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway remains elusive, however, because of Anglo-Spanish objections to power-sharing arrangements in an expanded union. Minimum import prices will apply to imports of cod, haddock, hake, angler, coley, Alaskan pollack and salmon. The decision to extend minimum import prices will come into effect this week and apply until May 17. It will be reviewed at a meeting of European Union fisheries ministers in Luxembourg on April 12.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Italian leader acts over state security PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro took the unprecedented step last night of calling a special meeting of ministers and senior officials responsible for Italian state security to clarify the role of the intelligence services in a series of ill-explained incidents dating back to the 1970s. His initiative highlights his concern about a spate of recent reports linking the intelligence services with attempts to destabilise Italian democracy. Some of these reports, if true, would confirm the long-held suspicion that some security services members have been linked to organised crime. Other reports appear designed to mislead and contain a whiff of farce. The self-proclaimed former mistress of General Franco Monticone, head of Italy's rapid intervention force, has talked of dissident members of the military preparing a coup for next spring. She also claims to have met three months ago Mr Gianni Nardi, a well-known neo-fascist killed in a car crash in Majorca 17 years ago. Apart from the prime minister, those called to the meeting included the defence, interior and finance ministers, the head of the joint chiefs of staff, leaders of the three services, plus the heads of the police, the carabinieri, and of domestic and military intelligence. Mr Scalfaro was expected to issue a strong call to order and for a speedy clean-up of the intelligence services. He was also likely to warn the military to stay out of politics following the controversy caused by a senior general this month attacking those who backed the populist Lombard League. The government promised a shake-up of domestic intelligence in May following car bombings in Rome and Florence. Then, the Interior Ministry suspected organised crime and some members of the intelligence services were responsible. This suspicion was repeated after car bombs in Rome and Milan on July 28 and when the telephones failed mysteriously in the prime minister's office for three hours. But the shake-up has been slow in the face of the evidence. Last December, Mr Bruno Contrada, the number three in domestic intelligence, was arrested and charged with colluding with the Mafia. Allegations of links with organised crime were made against General Francesco Delfino, a key figure in the carabinieri. Within the past six months at least 14 senior members of the domestic intelligence service have been arrested on charges of diverting L14bn (Pounds 5.8m) to their private use. Then last week, Mr Augusto Maria Cittani, the agency's head, was arrested for allegedly ordering the planting of explosives on a train. Earlier this month the Defence Ministry announced the retirement of some 300 of the 1,500 officials in military intelligence.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Irish SFr150m issue enlivens a quiet day New issuance in the eurobond market virtually ground to a halt yesterday with the US closed for holidays. Only the Swiss franc market saw any degree of activity with two deals prompted by the rally in the Swiss government bond market this week. 'There is a flight of hot money out of equities and into bonds, which is boosting most bond markets, including the Swiss market,' said one trader. 'Lower Swiss short-term money rates are also forcing investors in Swiss francs farther out along the yield curve.' Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency launched a SFr150m issue of four-year bonds offering a coupon of 5.375 per cent. Lead manager UBS said the bonds were placed with Swiss retail investors. Sources said a funding level of 10 basis points below Libor had been achieved. Mr Adrian Kearns, head of foreign borrowing at the NTMA, said the offering was part of Ireland's borrowing programme for 1995, when it planned to raise about IPounds 1.4bn to replace maturing debt. He said the proceeds from the offering were not swapped. He added that Ireland was still considering coming to the euroyen market within the next few weeks with an offering of around Y30bn, 'preferably in the 10-year area'. Postsparkasse, the Austrian state postal authority, launched a SFr250m issue of eight-year bonds offering a coupon of 5.625 per cent and fungible with a SFr200m issue launched in September. In the Dutch guilder sector, BNG launched a Fl 500m offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 31 basis points over Dutch government bonds. Joint lead manager Rabobank said the bonds were placed with domestic institutions. The proceeds from the offering were not swapped out of Dutch guilders, market sources said. Dealers reported some buying of eurobonds in the dollar sector by investors keen to exploit the recent widening of spreads. 'They think that now is the time to buy while spreads are wide and before they close back in when the Treasury market falls again,' said one dealer. There are rumours that Spain is considering a euroyen offering around the 10-year area over the next week. Exim is rumoured to be coming to the eurodollar market with a long-dated offering. Traders said that the EIB was also considering a eurodollar offering around the 10-year area, although EIB officials were unable to confirm this yesterday. IBCA, the European credit rating agency, is reviewing the AA credit status of Sweden. 'Sweden has a very high and rising debt to GDP ratio and it is important to assess the new government's plans to stabilise and reduce it,' IBCA said yesterday. Sweden's rating is also under review by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, from which it has an Aa2 rating.</p>

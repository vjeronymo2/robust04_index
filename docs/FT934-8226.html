			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Output sparks Russia debate THE fall in Russia's gross national product is slowing, according to government figures published yesterday. But industrial output, which is a key issue in the Russian election campaign, will continue to decline at around last year's rate. The figures, published by the Interfax news agency, forecast a fall of 10.1 per cent in GNP this year, after a 19 per cent drop last year. Industrial output is expected to fall by 16.4 per cent, compared with an 18.8 per cent drop in 1992. Prompted by the country's poor industrial performance, candidates from at least three major parties yesterday promised more support for Russian industry, and protection against foreign competition, at the annual conference of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. The union is headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, who also heads the electoral list of the separate Civic Union electoral alliance. Many of the industrialist union's members will vote for Civic Union, and tell their employees to do the same, but some remain undecided. Mr Volsky criticised the radical ministers of Russia's Choice, the electoral alliance headed by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who see financial stabilisation as the necessary foundation for economic growth. A former Gaidar ally, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for foreign economic relations, addressed the industrialists on behalf of the rival Russian Party for Unity and Accord, saying that it was essential to deny foreign companies equal treatment to Russian companies for a few years. This would give time to Russian companies to cope with market economics while completing the legislation necessary to give adequate protection to foreign investors. Mr Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a millionaire eye-surgeon who owns several businesses and is a candidate for another group, the Russian Democratic Reform Movement, stressed the need to improve incentives for workers. 'At the moment it is only profitable for them to rest.' Promises of protection are also to be found in Russia's Choice.</p>

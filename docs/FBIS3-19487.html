			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [16 March] the Federal  Government regretted the new delay in the membership  negotiations. The agreement with Norway on the fishery issue,  which was achieved over last night, is to be "emphatically  welcomed," in particular since FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  played a "decisive part" in it, Deputy Government Spokesman  Norbert Schaefer said.    Without mentioning Spain and Britain by name, the Federal  Government expressly regretted "the attitude of two partners,"  who have once again prevented a restructured blocking minority  for votes in the larger Union. However, Bonn confidently hopes  that a final agreement can be achieved at a special meeting next  Tuesday.</p>

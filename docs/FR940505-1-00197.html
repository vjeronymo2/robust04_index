			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Specific EPA requirements for modeling procedures, data, and input parameters appear in Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model (EPA, 7/91) and Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model for Areawide Carbon Monoxide (EPA, 6/92). The UAM model uses an inventory of pollutant emissions, together with air quality and meteorological data, as input to a system of algorithms incorporating chemistry and dispersion, in order to simulate an observed pollution episode. Once a ``base case'' is developed that meets the minimum Guideline performance criteria, projected future emissions are used as input to simulate air quality in the attainment deadline year. Attainment is demonstrated when the modeled air quality with emission controls in effect is below the NAAQS throughout the geographical modeling domain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For carbon monoxide, a local or ``hot-spot'' component is added to the UAM areawide component. UAM can simulate the accumulation of pollutants over several hours, from sources over a large area. By contrast, the CAL3QHC model is used to reflect the localized effect of idling motor vehicles at key congested intersections, which is not otherwise accounted for in UAM's typical one-mile resolution. For the attainment demonstration, the sum of the areawide and hot-spot component must be less than the NAAQS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A modeling attainment demonstration is subject to several uncertainties. The meteorological and air quality inputs have their own associated uncertainties, both in measurement and in representativeness. In addition, not all variables can be measured for all hours, so default and interpolated values must be used. Processes such as chemical reaction and advection necessarily appear in the model in simplified form. The selected episodes may not represent all conditions conducive to high pollutant levels. Finally, the projection of the emissions is uncertain. In spite of these sources of uncertainty, photochemical grid modeling is the best tool that is available for determining the emission reductions that are needed for NAAQS attainment. However, refinements in model inputs that will occur over the next year are likely to change the combination and stringency of controls deemed necessary for attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the EPA Guideline, control measures are to be used to adjust the emission inventory, which is then used as input to UAM. This captures the effect of the changes in spatial and temporal distribution of emissions. However, as of this writing the final modeling base cases are not ready for simulating the controls with UAM itself, since model inputs are undergoing revision to improve performance. Instead, for this FIP proposal, percent emission reduction targets were established using simulations of geographically and temporally uniform (``across-the-board'') reductions. A series of these simulations are performed with various combinations of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions. By interpolation, percent reductions of emissions of both pollutants that result in ozone concentrations less than the NAAQS are determined. Similarly, for carbon monoxide various across-the-board reductions of CO are simulated, and then interpolated to find a target reduction that meets the CO NAAQS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Though derived from simulation of the rectangular modeling domain, the targets are applied to the emission totals for just the nonattainment area, resulting in a maximum allowable level of emissions for the area. Attainment is demonstrated when the emissions from all sources after control measures are applied is less than this maximum. This method does not reflect the spatial and temporal variability in the effect of control measures, and so give a rougher estimate of controls needed than full UAM modeling would. Because of the limitations of this methodology, further analysis by the State and EPA may result in some changes in the control measures required between today's proposal and the final notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sacramento ozone.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Sacramento area was classified as a ``Serious'' ozone nonattainment area based on a design value of .16 ppm recorded at the Folsom station. This was based on 1987&hyph;1989 data; the 1990&hyph;1992 value was also .16 ppm. Exceedances of the ozone NAAQS occur in the Sacramento area about 15 times per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to simulate air quality for the SIP and other planning needs, CARB and the Sacramento local agencies started planning the Sacramento Area Ozone Study (SAOS) early in 1989, with intensive data collection performed during the summer of 1990. This involved an extended network of air quality and meteorological instruments, including on airplanes, to measure ozone and its precursors and also many meteorological inputs needed for UAM. The Sacramento Modeling Advisory Committee (SMAC) was established for technical oversight of the modeling effort, and includes regulatory, industry, and environmental group participants. CARB and its contractor, Systems Applications International, Inc., prepared a modeling protocol which was accepted by EPA as meeting EPA Guideline modeling requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Federation of Korean  Industries (FKI) board held a closed meeting Wednesday night at  which Kim Sok-won, chairman of the Ssangyong Business Group,  reported on his meetings with Chong Myong-sik and Yi Tong-chan,  respective chairmen of Pohang Iron and Steel Co. [POSCO] and  Kolon Group, which are vying to take the majority stake in the  consortium for the second mobile telephone project, FKI Vice  Chairman Cho Kyu- ha said Thursday.    Kim reportedly met with the two chairmen to hammer out an  agreement between the uncompromising business groups in their  fight for control of the lucrative business.    FKI was authorized by the Communications Ministry late last  year to form a single consortium for the second cellular phone  network by this month.    The cut-throat competition was narrowed down to consortiums  led by POSCO and Kolon after FKI Chairman Choe Chong-hyon's  Sunkyong Group dropped out of the race, aiming instead to become  the major stockholder of Korea Mobile Telecom, a state-run  monopoly that is to be privatized.    FKI will conduct a final screening and comparative study  before announcing the majority stockholder and participating  local and foreign companies on Feb. 28, Cho said.</p>

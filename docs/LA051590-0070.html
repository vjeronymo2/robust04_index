"But unfortunately, we have not seen or heard the  least interest in our . . . sons held hostage in Zionist prisons."  </P> <P> At least 15 Westerners, including six Americans, are held hostage by extremist  groups in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Two U.S. hostages were released last month.  </P> <P> Also on Monday, senior Irish diplomat Antoine Mac Unfraidh arrived in Beirut to  pursue efforts to secure the release of Brian Keenan, a Northern Irishman with  dual Irish-British citizenship kidnaped in 1986.  </P></p>

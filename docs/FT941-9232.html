			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Small traders dominate insolvencies Small businesses account for more than four-fifths of personal insolvencies, says a survey by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading trade body. The self-employed, partners and sole traders comprised 81 per cent of insolvencies against individuals, while the propor-tion who are unemployed has fallen in recent years to less than 6 per cent of the total. The figures are based on a survey of 1,217 insolvency cases handled by 120 members of the society during the period January to June last year. They highlight the trends in bankruptcies and individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) reached between people and their creditors, which were introduced under the 1986 insolvency act and are becoming increasingly popular. These accounted for one-third of personal insolvencies, showing the procedure was gradually replacing the more stigmatised process of bankruptcy. More than three-quarters of insolvencies were attributed primarily to business factors and 23 per cent to domestic reasons. In domestic insolvencies, consumer credit has declined as the principal reason from 80 per cent in 1991 to 54 per cent last year. The single largest cause, at nearly 30 per cent, was guarantee liabilities - the outstanding obligations normally imposed by banks on people who run businesses.

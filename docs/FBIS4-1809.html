			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- China is stepping up its  efforts to develop applied satellite technology and satellite  application technology, striving to satisfy needs of the  national economy, science and technology, culture, and defense.    The new generation of applied satellites currently under  research and development includes large-capacity longevity  communication and broadcasting satellites, meteorology  satellites, navigation position satellites, disaster-minimized  satellites, and multipurpose earth resource satellites. Of  these, the Dongfanghong [East Is Red] No. 3 communication  satellite and Fengyun [Wind and Cloud] No. 2 meteorology  satellite will soon be put into use, and will be the important  indicators of China's applied satellites catching up with the  advanced level in the world. With 24 transmitters and an  eight-year designed longevity, the Dongfanghong No. 3 satellite  is capable of meeting China's satellite communication  requirements till the year 2000 or even a longer period of time  beyond. The Fengyun No. 2, the first earth-synchronous  remote-sensing meteorology satellite developed by China, will  play an active role in developing meteorological science and  technology in China and the world.    Meanwhile, China is improving and perfecting the Changzheng  [Long March] series of carrier rockets, and has successfully  developed a batch of more advanced and larger-capacity carrier  rockets to satisfy domestic and international demands for  launching different applied satellites. The Changzheng No. 3B  cluster rocket's loading capacity on the earth-synchronous orbit  can reach 4.8 tonnes, while its low-orbit loading capacity is  about 12 tonnes. The Changzheng No. 1D rocket's loading capacity  on the near-earth orbit has been greatly enhanced. The  Changzheng No. 3A rocket, which was successfully launched  recently, has increased Chinese rockets' loading capacity on the  earth-synchronous orbit to 2.5 tonnes, and has upgraded a number  of China's new technologies to the world's advanced level.    To provide advanced technical means for telecommunications,  broadcasting, education, meteorology, resource prospecting,  ocean exploitation, cartography, navigation position, traffic  control, maritime accident rescue, environment monitoring, and  other national economic departments, China has also established  selected nationwide ground satellite application systems, such  as satellite travelling communication system, rapid satellite  position system, special satellite data information system,  satellite financial and taxation system, and satellite wage  issuance system.</p>

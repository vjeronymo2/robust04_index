			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / The new Lords of Lotto Britain's new national lottery, which could be in operation late next year, is expected by its supporters to become a gigantic new business, benefiting many dozens of suppliers, with a turnover that could top Pounds 6bn. The devil on my shoulder tells me it could be as exciting, and intellectually satisfying, as direct mail, on which I am an expert. Bidders for the principal contract, says one consultants' report, are offered the opportunity to create a new FT 100 company. That is only half of it. The lottery will extrude a regular supply of instant millionaires, not to mention excited winners of lesser amounts, the more innocent of whom will doubtless be seen as ripe pickings for vultures from the financial services industry. It will pay taxes, initially a come-on 12 per cent, to the Treasury. The remaining crumbs - at worst under a fifth of turnover and at best close to a third - will be divided among five 'good' causes, one of which is the 'millenium fund' over whose celebrations the prime minister hopes to preside. He should be so lucky. Knowing all this wealth and power to be at stake, you will not be surprised to learn that there has been a certain amount of lobbying on behalf of the three principal interest groups involved: the football pools promoters, the charities and potential players in the new market. Their efforts are currently focused on the Lords, where the bill will be debated on Thursday. Governed, as ever, by the angel on my other shoulder, my sympathies are with the charities. It has to be said at once that if we soft-hearts have our way the potential revenue from the lottery business will be cut by 30 to 40 per cent, or more, the start-up will be slower, and the whole enterprise might crumble. What a calamity] Let me explain. The establishment of lotteries is a rapidly expanding global business. It should be categorised under electronics, telecommunications and computer services. There are two main types of game. The big, expensive one, entailing huge set-up costs, is lotto. You buy a ticket regularly and in advance. The prize is drawn on evening TV shows once or twice a week. The relatively cheap and cheerful alternative is the instant ersatz crapshoot. You buy a card on impulse - while shopping, say - and the number revealed by scratching the card or running it across an electronic reader tells you at once whether you have won. Charities, whose tombola prizes are immediate, fear the competition. A report on the national lottery prepared for the government makes it plain that the instant gratification business is a key element in the cash flow projections for the entire enterprise. I hope their lordships are not put off by this argument. A second threat to Mr John Major's dream comes from the pools promoters. The government line is that football gambling is largely undertaken by men of a certain earnings group. Lotto on TV, or scratch-cards bought at the check-out counter, will attract women, the young, and, if the games are sold by branch post offices, pensioners and social security beneficiaries. This has not reassured the pools companies. During the passage of the bill through the Commons they asked for five concessions. First, a reduction in taxation to the same level as that proposed for the national lottery. Nice try. Second, removal of the requirement that 'skill and judgement' be required of punters. Another failed attempt. The pools promoters did better on the next three. They won the right to sell their tickets through any outlets, as opposed to their existing practice of using door-to-door agents or direct mail. The lottery, on the other hand, is to be excluded from betting shops and direct sales to households. The pools asked for the right to advertise on TV, a key to monopoly power at present available to the lottery alone. So far all they have been offered is a provision allowing them to sponsor TV programmes, excluding the football results. Finally, the 'rollover' of jackpots, which in the US has resulted in prizes as high as Dollars 100m, but which in the UK is likely to be at lower levels, will be permitted for the pools and the lottery on similar terms. These two concessions have been offered as amendments to be tabled in the Lords; we have yet to see the colour of the government's money. What the third group, those whose snouts are in sniffing distance of this bountiful new trough, is saying is that if the charities and the pools both have their way there will not be enough left for the putative Lords of Lotto. Then sports, the arts, the national heritage and the other potential beneficiaries of this new business would be that much the poorer. Even worse, Sainsburys, WH Smith, Granada, Forte, Texas Home Stores and the like would be deprived of the chance to earn a 5 to 7 per cent rake-off plus additional walk-through trade expected by the chosen retail outlets. It all depends. As to the size of the trough, foreign experience is mixed. Francaise de Jeux sold Pounds 3.7bn worth of tickets last year, following the introduction of a multiple instant games strategy; CONI in Italy competes with regional lotteries and brought in only Pounds 1.4bn. Residents of Massachusetts spend an average of Pounds 200 each a year on lottery tickets; the New Zealand equivalent is Pounds 56. Australians spend 8.4 per cent of their discretionary income on their Tattersalls; Westdeutsche Lotterie brings in only 5.1 per cent from the mad money available to each inhabitant of its area. These figures are from GAH Consultants, 4-6 Arne Street, WC2E, from whom you can buy the whole book for Pounds 695. GAH, which advised the government, believes that the UK national lottery has the potential to become the largest in the world, with annual sales of 'anywhere between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 6bn', albeit under Pounds 2bn without instant games. We come at last to the beneficiaries. Let us be generous. Assume Pounds 4bn to be the lottery income in a good year, with half going to prizes, 15 per cent to the operating company, and 12 per cent in tax. That leaves Pounds 920m for the five causes. Dream a little. Call it a billion. Now ask yourself the following two questions: will the Treasury maintain government funding for those who get shares of this billion, or will it be cut? Will the 12 per cent tax take be kept at that low level or will it be increased? You know the answers. So do I. There is no need to send them in on a postcard.</p>

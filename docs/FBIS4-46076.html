			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 25 (AFP) -- Inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have completed their  inspection of a controversial experimental laboratory in North  Korea and took samples from spent fuel rods, IAEA officials said  in Vienna Wednesday.    The samples should allow the IAEA to determine how long the  fuel rods were in the reactor and thereby calculate whether  plutonium could have been diverted, possibly for use in making  nuclear bombs.</p>

ITA's ability to fulfill its mission is enhanced through building partnerships with the private sector. To encourage such partnerships, ITA has created the Market Development Cooperator Program to develop, maintain, and expand foreign markets for nonagricultural goods and services produced in the United States. For purposes of this program, ``nonagricultural goods and services'' means goods and services other than agricultural products as defined in 7 U.S.C. 451. ``Produced in the United States'' means having substantial inputs of materials and labor originating in the United States, such inputs constituting at least 50 percent of the value of the good or service to be exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The advantage of a joint effort is that it permits the Government to pool expertise and funds with non-federal sources so that each maximizes its market development resources. Partnerships of this sort also may provide a sharper focus on long-term export market development than do traditional trade promotion activities and serve as a mechanism for improving Government-industry relations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Market Development Cooperator Program is sponsored, guided and funded by the Department of Commerce with a matching requirement by the recipient, applicants are expected to develop, initiate and carry out market development project activities. As an active partner, ITA will provide assistance identified by the applicant as being essential to the achievement of project goals and objectives. U.S. industry is best able to assess its problems and needs in the foreign marketplace and to recommend innovative solutions and programs that can be the formula to success in international trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of activities that might be included in an applicant's project are described below. Not one of these activities or any combination of these activities must be included for a proposal to receive favorable consideration. Applicants are encouraged to propose activities that (1) would be most appropriate to market development needs of their industry or industries; and (2) display the imagination and innovation of the applicant working in partnership with the Government to obtain the maximum market development impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A public meeting for parties considering applying for funding under the MDCP will be held on May 10, 1994. Attendance at this public meeting is not required of potential proposers. The purpose of the meeting is to provide general information regarding the MDCP procedures, selection process, and proposal preparation to potential applicants unfamiliar with the MDCP. No discussion of specific proposals will occur at this meeting.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The public meeting will be held May 10, 1994.

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / This Week: Television Martin Chuzzlewit (Monday, 9.00-10.30pm, BBC2) is ready to roll over us in a wave of carriages and corsets. Paul Schofield plays Chuzzlewit Pere with aplomb; as if this wasn't enough, he also takes on the part of Anthony Chuzzlewit. In the opening episode, Chuzzlewit Fils, as played by Ben Walden (son of Brian), is somewhat leaden but this is compensated for by a splendid supporting cast, and there is John Mills still to come. Two endings have been shot. The one preferred by David Lodge, who adapted the novel, is an upbeat one with three weddings; that favoured by director Pedr James is a downbeat monologue delivered by Tom Pinch. Despite this mild controversy, the drama delivers exactly what you expect, making it a bit of an old chestnut, pleasing though it is when served roasted over a crackling fire by extras in wigs and false moustaches. Dominick Dunne became the leading American crime reporter with his coverage of the Claus Von Bulow case and the Menendez brothers' trial. 'Dominick did a better job than the prosecutor in the Menendez case', says the editor of Vanity Fair, as well he might since Dunne is one of his star writers. Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.20-11.10pm, BBC1) profiles the novelist and writer who was born into a wealthy East Coast family, hit hard times and then rebuilt his career and life. The result is a fascinating piece, not least because of the comments made by the Menendez defence lawyer with whom Dunne has carried on a public feud. Richard Curtis, who wrote Four Weddings And A Funeral, has come up with another altar-obsessed comedy, The Vicar Of Dibbley (Thursday, 8.30-9.00pm, BBC1). Dawn French is the new vicar of the eponymous village which is expecting atestosterone-driven prelate and has to adjust. This has the same essentially English approach to comedy as Curtis's hit film, but on a smaller scale - more like Two Christenings And A Small Sherry. Terence Rattigan is enjoying a success he hasn't had since John Osborne looked back in anger. After a London revival last year, The Deep Blue Sea is getting a BBC production (Saturday, 9.30-11.10pm, BBC2), directed by Karel Reisz. This is a gritty play, far removed from the polite pieces Rattigan is associated with. It begins with an attempted suicide. Penelope Wilton has perfected her Hester Collyer and gets splendid support from Ian Holm and Colin Firth as the two men in her life. Ever since Hilda Ogden hung up her pinny, the mantle of loveable TV shrew has settled round Thora Hird's shoulders, and this week Melvynn Bragg pays tribute in The South Bank Show (Sunday, 10.45-11.45pm, ITV). Dame Thora is now 83 and well into her anecdotage. But it hardly matters since the anecdotes are of vintage quality ,supplemented by clips from her 60-year career.</p>

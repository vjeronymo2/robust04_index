			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Fujitsu has adopted a multichip module CPU in its  K-6900 office computers which appeared on the market in October,  1993. Units can be upgraded by replacing the former type CPU  with the new modular CPU. Compared to the conventional mounting  method in which package-sealed LSI chips are lined up on a  printed circuit board, instruction execution is four times  faster, and only 1/5 of the former mounting space is required.    The new multichip module consists of six CMOS LSI chips--a  processor, 32k byte data cache, 32k byte instruction cache, and  memories (3 chips) to store processor microcodes. The source  voltage for each chip is +3.3V. A design rule of 0.5&mgr;m has  been used for all chips.    The processor consists of a CISC section (which does not  contain microcodes) and a RISC section. Each section will handle  32-bit and 64 bit architecture. The CISC and RISC sections have  register files in common. The CISC section is directly  interchangeable with the already existing K series. The  instruction set of the RISC section is unique. A super scalar  design has been adopted, and three instructions can be executed  at the same time.    Instructions are executed at 30MHz. When using the  conventional mounting method in which package-sealed LSI chips  are lined up on a printed circuit board, instructions are  executed at about 15MHz. At this time, the critical path of the  processor limits the instruction execution speed of the  multichip module. However, it is estimated that the module will  be capable of 60MHz operation in the future.  <H5>  Flip Chip Mounting Technology Adopted </H5>   The module is 44.6 x 67.4mm in size. This is reportedly 1/5  the size of the conventional printed circuit board mounted  version.    AIN is used as the modules substrate material. Wiring layers  formed of Cu thin film, and insulating layers formed of  polyimide create a 5-layered construction, and the LSI chip  (bare chip) is connected using the flip chip design. Cu wiring  is 12&mgr;m thick, and spaced at a pitch of about 30&mgr;m.    The number of flip-chip connections is 5000-6000 for the  entire module. Most of these--about 3000--are for the CMOS  processor chip. Connection spacing (pitch) is an extremely  narrow 0.21mm, and a solder-to-solder connection is used. The  size of solder bumps formed on the LSI chip is about 100&mgr;m.  The electrodes on the substrate side are first gold plated and  then covered with solder. After the module has passed testing,  the gap between chip and substrate is filled with resin by  [potting].    Power consumption by the entire module is 18W. The module  has  a heat sink, and sufficient heat dissipation is achieved by  forced air cooling (at the rate of about 1 meter wind per  second). This design allows the heat to leave the LSI chip  through the solder connection and AIN substrate, toward the heat  sink. For this reason, many solder connections also serve as  heat dissipation paths.</p>

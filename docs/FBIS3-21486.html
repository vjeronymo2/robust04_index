Yusef Azadmanesh added: This increased production resulted  in  a savings of $50 million in foreign exchange for tea imports.    Yusef Azadmanesh gave an interview to IRNA on Sunday. He  added: Last year 56,000 tons of dried tea was produced, while  another 30,000 tons was purchased from India, Sri Lanka, Kenya,  Bangladesh, and Indonesia.    Concerning tea imports, the executive director of the  National Tea Organization said: Excessive imports of tea in  recent years by peddlers and people living near the borders and  the failure to control it have brought disruption and disorder  to the market, and this damages production.    He also said: Pricing limitations imposed by the Consumer  and  Producer Protection Organization and also the packaging of tea  has enabled domestic tea to compete in terms of quality and  packaging with foreign products. It is hoped that with  comprehensive government support for farmers, this product will  find its rightful place.    Azadmanesh said the main reasons for the low quality of  domestic tea in previous years were the failure to make proper  use of modern machinery and harvesting substandard leaves from  the tea bushes, and he said this trend has recently been  improved.    The executive director of the National Tea Organization  discussed the payment of government subsidies. He said:  Currently the finished price of a kilogram of dry tea is about  3,000 rials[R], while each kilogram of tea is marketed at R1,500  to R2,700.    According to this official, in the Second Five-Year Economic  Plan, the harvesting of more crops per surface unit will  continue, with the creation of rainfall irrigation networks, and  the area under cultivation will be expanded.</p>

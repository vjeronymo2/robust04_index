			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PRUDENCE CERTAINLY PAYING OFF FOR HOUSEBUSTER  </P> <P> "You have perhaps the fastest racehorse in America," ABC commentator Jim McKay  said to owner Bob Levy before his colt, Housebuster, ran in the Derby Trial  Saturday. "Why will you not consider the Kentucky Derby for him?"  </P> <P> Levy explained to a national television audience that he and trainer Jimmy  Croll thought that Housebuster was basically a sprinter, but McKay wouldn't  take no for an answer. "Well, what about the Preakness?" he demanded. And after  Housebuster won the Derby Trial with an effortless 5 1/4-length victory, McKay  was immediately back on the air to ask, "Well, Bob, what do you say now?"  </P> <P> McKay's incredulity was understandable, because prudence and caution are  qualities rarely seen at Churchill Downs in the springtime. The owners and  trainers of decent 3-year-olds will rationalize, will deceive themselves, will  ask horses to do the impossible to get to the Kentucky Derby. Many will go into  next Saturday's Derby with horses who aren't remotely in Housebuster's class.  Many would love to run a horse who would be in front as the field turned into  the stretch. From that point, anything could happen. What trainer could resist  such a chance to win America's most famous horse race?  </P> <P> Jimmy Croll could, because he's still haunted by memories of the last time he  pursued the Derby with a horse who shouldn't have been here. The year was 1973,  and the horse was Mr. Prospector, who might have been one of the most brilliant  thoroughbreds of all time. We'll never know.  </P> <P> In the spring of his 3-year-old season, in only the third start of his career,  Mr. Prospector ran six furlongs in an unbelievable 1:07 4/5. "Right away the  owners were talking about the Derby," Croll said. "I tried to tell them he  didn't have enough seasoning. I kept saying, 'We can't run in the Derby! We  can't do it! We can't do it!' I wasn't successful in dissuading them."  </P> <P> So Mr. Prospector came to Kentucky, where Croll tried to transform the  speedster into the classic distance runner he wasn't cut out to be. The colt  lost an allowance race in his first attempt to go a distance. Then he ran in  the Derby Trial, where he was bumped around as if it were the roller derby, and  he broke a cannon bone. He never ran for the roses; he never ran again at all.  </P> <P> But after he went to stud and became one of the most influential sires in the  world, Mr. Prospector proved what a special animal he was -- something that  Croll had known all along. "He could have been one of the great ones; I truly  believe that," the trainer said. "I never got over it."  </P> <P> In a sense, Housebuster has given Croll a chance to relive the past, and to  correct it. Like Mr. Prospector, the colt has displayed brilliant speed ever  since he first set foot on the track. He won a seven-furlong stakes at  Gulfstream Park this winter, defeating Summer Squall, the favorite for the  Kentucky Derby, and Thirty Six Red, the winner of the $500,000 Wood Memorial at  Aqueduct.  </P> <P> Yet Housebuster doesn't have the pedigree to win the Kentucky Derby. This may  sound unfair and elitist, especially in a country that reveres the concept of  equal opportunity for all, but the truth is inescapable. While horses with  humble pedigrees may win the Derby, horses with pure sprint pedigrees don't.  Croll knows this. The trainer believes that Housebuster can be effective up to  distances of a mile or thereabouts, but said that "our ultimate goal is to be  the champion sprinter."  </P> <P> With this goal in mind, Croll has assiduously avoided temptations that might  divert him. When Housebuster was in Florida this winter, the 3-year-olds in the  big-money stakes races were a rather weak group, and Housebuster probably could  have beaten them even though he isn't a distance runner. But Croll passed the 1  1/16-mile Fountain of Youth Stakes, explaining, "I think he could have won, but  if he had we'd have had to go to the Florida Derby, and then if he'd run half  decently he'd have to go somewhere else (the Kentucky Derby, for instance). I  think it would have been the wrong thing to do."  </P> <P> So Croll plans to spend most of the year finding appropriate spots at one mile  or shorter for Housebuster. The Derby Trial, with a weak field and a $75,000  purse, looked like an ideal place to test the colt at a mile for the first  time. It was.  </P> <P> Housebuster battled head and head down the backstretch with another speedster,  Falling Sky, but while his rival was under a drive, Housebuster was cruising.  He sped the first half-mile on this dull racing strip in 45 3-5 seconds and  jockey Craig Perret had him under wraps as he cruised to victory over Private  School. Falling Sky was third.  </P> <P> "He was a powerhouse," marveled Keith Allen, who rode the runner-up.  Housebuster covered the mile in 1:37 3/5, a good time on this track,  considering that cheap horses in the last race of the day required 1:43 3/5 to  go that distance.  </P> <P> But the difference between running this distance and one-quarter mile farther  constitutes a whole new game, and requires a whole different type of horse.  Casual fans may not understand this, and optimistic horsemen at the Derby might  not either, but Levy and Croll do. When they put Housebuster on a van and ship  him out of Churchill Downs, they won't have any doubts about the wisdom of  their decision.  </P></p>

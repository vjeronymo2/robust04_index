			<p>BFN     [Text] Army spokeswoman Edith Vargas de Marroquin has  blamed the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) for  last night's bomb attacks against a shopping mall and the  residence of Fernando Quezada Toruno.    The Army spokeswoman has said the guerrillas are the only  ones capable of placing such bombs, which endanger the lives of  the people, as what happened the night of 31 May when they  exploded in the urban sector.    The explosions caused damage to Climat, a boutique located  at  No. 13-70 7th Avenue, Zone 9, and the residence of lawyer  Fernando Quezada Toruno, the brother of Monsignor Rodolfo  Quezada Toruno, president of the Civil Sectors Assembly.    The URNG could be responsible for the two bombs at the two  locations, Government Minister Danilo Parrinello Blanco said  yesterday.    We knew of a terrorist escalation, but we cannot ascertain  the guerrillas are responsible for the bomb explosions,  although, by logic, we can surmise they did it, the minister  said.    There is no other reason to think this was an action by  another group, but the investigations under way will confirm it,  Parrinello Blanco concluded.</p>

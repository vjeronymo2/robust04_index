			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> NEW COMMISSIONER PLANS REORGANIZATION OF NFL FRONT OFFICE  </P> <P> The NFL changed so much in Pete Rozelle's 30 years as commissioner that it no  longer resembles the league of 1960, said Paul Tagliabue, the new commissioner.  </P> <P> "In 1959, the last year before Rozelle, the 12 NFL teams generated $50 million  in revenues," Tagliabue said from his law office. "This year, with 28 teams,  revenues are over $1 billion. That's a different ballpark."  </P> <P> Tagliabue predicted that the NFL is about to undergo a major reorganization.  </P> <P> "Despite the (NFL's) growth, there hasn't been that much change in the (league)  staff in Pete's time," Tagliabue said. "As the league grew, he grew with it.  But now, I think, some reorganizing is essential."  </P> <P> Tagliabue says he will recommend installing two or three assistant  commissioners, whose specific titles have yet to be determined. They will  oversee the department heads.  </P> <P> The restructuring plans follow some nervous moments during a long struggle to  find a new commissioner.  </P> <P> When Rozelle resigned in March, everyone in the league office was given a  year's notice. The thought behind that unusual course of action -- which was  suggested by some of the club owners -- was that the new leader should have a  free hand in recruiting.  </P> <P> Tagliabue is a long-time Rozelle associate who isn't planning wholesale  changes, but some big ones nonetheless.  </P> <P> "We need at least two senior management people (between the commissioner and  the department heads)," Tagliabue said. "The NFL, as a venture, has two sides  -- football and business. We should probably have a (deputy commissioner) for  each -- and possibly another for marketing. We'll get the thinking of the  (owners) and have it done by (next summer)."  </P> <P> Willie Davis, a Hall of Fame football player who lives in Marina del Rey and  works in Los Angeles, has been singled out by Tagliabue every time the new  commissioner has spoken of the league's future.  </P> <P> Tagliabue said he wants Davis in his administration and mentions his name first  when discussing deputy commissioners. Davis, a former Green Bay Packer all-pro,  is a successful businessman with a master's degree from the University of  Chicago.  </P> <P> Davis, a defensive end, is also one of the favorites of the owners on the two  search panels that endorsed Tagliabue for commissioner. A second committee made  Davis one of four finalists for the commissioners' job along with Jim Finks of  New Orleans and Pat Barrett of Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> Some of the other owners have been bothered by Davis' candor. He has a respect  for the truth that surfaces when questioned in public.  </P> <P> From his background as a former player and an enterprising businessman who owns  a string of radio stations, Davis has indicated that some form of free agency  is workable in pro football.  </P> <P> But he doesn't insist on that. Over the years, he has proved to be an  open-minded team player who would do his best in labor relations and in all  other areas within the ground rules laid down by Tagliabue and the owners.  </P> <P> Reorganization won't happen tomorrow, but Tagliabue is clearly on the right  track in mentioning Davis as a potential deputy commissioner.  </P> <P> Finks, who was almost named commissioner, is reportedly under consideration for  commissioner of the Canadian Football League, the organization with which he  got his front-office start in pro football 30 years ago.  </P> <P> But Finks, the president and general manager of the New Orleans Saints, said  from Chicago this week that he wasn't interested.  </P> <P> "I'm not going back to Canada," he said.  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Bengals plan on trying a few tricks when they play the Raiders  in the Coliseum Sunday.  </P> <P> Coach Sam Wyche told reporters that the Bengals plan to use a quick-snap on  offense, and get away with it if they can.  </P> <P> "You're not violating anything until the official says, 'You didn't give (the  defense) enough time," said Wyche, whose no-huddle offense has troubled  opponents for two seasons.  </P> <P> The quick snap takes the no-huddle to another dimension.  </P> <P> If the defensive coaches try to send in substitutes while Cincinnati  quarterback Boomer Esiason is calling signals at the line of scrimmage, the  center snaps the ball, and the defense often is penalized for having 12 men on  the field.  </P> <P> Cleveland Coach Bud Carson said, "It's just another way of taking advantage of  the rules, in my opinion, and they do the best job in the world of that."  </P> <P> In no-huddle situations, a new NFL rule gives the defense "a reasonable amount  of time" to match the offense in specialists substituted.  </P> <P> What's reasonable?  </P> <P> "It's a judgment call," Wyche said. "We're going to leave it up to the  officials to make the decision.  </P> <P> "The only way we'll know (how far the Bengals can go) is to go ahead and snap  the ball (and) see at what point they're going to call it back."  </P> <P> Accordingly, the officials may be as closely watched Sunday as Bo Jackson.  </P> <P> Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson, whose team is 0-8 in his first NFL season, says  he's sorry that his backup quarterback, Steve Walsh, didn't stay at the  University of Miami this year.  </P> <P> "(Walsh) would be making a strong run for the (Heisman Trophy)," Johnson said.  "(As a pro), he has struggled at times because of all the new players we've  been using on offense.  </P> <P> "He is pressing a little, (but) he is still talented and has a great future in  the NFL."  </P> <P> Johnson said he sees a brighter future for his other rookie quarterback, Troy  Aikman. But Aikman, who will be ready to play at Washington Sunday, has been  out for a month with a broken left finger.  </P> <P> "We need to see if (Aikman) is 100% healthy," Johnson said. "And we want to see  if he is 100% into the offense performance-wise."  </P> <P> Johnson doesn't blame either quarterback for the 0-8 record.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of different receivers who've broken routes and dropped  passes," he said.  </P> <P> Boz update: Brian Bosworth, Seattle's $11-million flop at linebacker, also will  be eligible to play Sunday when the Seahawks are at Kansas City. Bosworth has  been out for a month with an injured shoulder.  </P> <P> Seahawk Coach Chuck Knox, who didn't sound too interested in discussing  Bosworth, said he will talk with the former Oklahoma player one of these days.  </P> <P> The Seahawks' defense has been holding steady without Bosworth. But their  offense has been in trouble -- for a reason different from why the Rams'  offense has sputtered. The Rams (5-3) haven't been able to establish the run to  set up the pass. The Seahawks (4-4) can't run because their pass offense has  been inconsistent with quarterback Dave Krieg.  </P> <P> To keep the defense from ganging up against one or the other, a team has to be  able to both run well and pass well, Knox said.  </P> <P> "(On running downs), teams are playing different types of defenses this year  (against Seattle) with eight- and nine-man fronts," the Seahawk coach said.  "You just can't go and run the ball against fixed bayonets. So you've got to  put it up."  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Bonn stands firm against rate cuts: Pohl will resist pressure from US at G7's Washington meeting GERMANY will resist calls from the US to cut interest rates at Sunday's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Washington, according to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president. In an interview with the Financial Times at the central bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, Mr Pohl said: 'A cut in interest rates in Germany is not on the agenda. Calls for Germany to cut interest rates are, from our point of view, difficult to understand. Other countries, for instance in the European Monetary System, are making use of the relative weakness of the D-Mark to cut their own interest rates without our having to do so.' Mr Pohl, a pivotal figure in negotiations on European monetary integration, welcomed Tuesday's proposal from Luxembourg to set up a European central bank during the transition to monetary union, but to delay its creation until 1996. 'This suggestion goes in the right direction, but we will have to study it carefully before coming to a final judgment.' Adding an important refinement to the Bundesbank's thinking on a European central bank, he said: 'It is important that a decision on setting up a European central bank is not taken until it is clear which countries are willing to transfer their monetary policy powers to this institution.' Once this had become clear, Mr Pohl said, 'a European central bank could be set up two years before it would actually become fully operational, to allow the necessary time for preparation'. Commenting on the interest rate controversy, where Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, has urged Germany to ease policies in recent informal meetings, Mr Pohl declared: 'German monetary policy has to remain tight'. The issue is expected to surface during the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the US, UK, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Germany. The US calls have been part of Washington's effort to damp the risk of worldwide recession. However, Mr Pohl pointed out that parts of the west German economy were experiencing overheating. Recalling west Germany's strong growth of 4.5 per cent last year and still-low inflation of 2.5 per cent, he said: 'The position of the German economy as seen abroad has been made worse than we deserve. East Germany is an enormous problem, but the situation in west Germany is basically very satisfactory'. Easing monetary reins could prove counter-productive as it might weaken confidence in the D-Mark, he said. 'If we followed an easier policy, and this had an effect on the D-Mark, the result would be that German interest rates would not be lower, but higher.' Mr Pohl, who in unguarded comments last month called the aftermath of German monetary union a 'disaster', said: 'The situation in east Germany was portrayed by the government (in Bonn) rather too favourably last year. Now comes the moment of truth.' He suggested the Bonn government, through tax increases announced two months ago, had reacted to the challenges somewhat late. 'Now, the best time to ask people to make sacrifices is past. In calling for a greater national effort the politicians could have been a bit more Churchillian.' 'Public sector transfers to east Germany this year will come to around DM140bn (Pounds 48.2bn). Two-thirds of the gross national product in the east effectively comes from the west. A lot of the transfers are financing consumption - unemployment benefits, pensions etc - but there is an increasing amount of investment too.' Over the timing of eventual recovery east of the Elbe he said: 'There is not much sense in trying to predict an end to the period of slump - it will certainly last some time. But in east Germany they are now drawing the right consequences from the fact that 80 per cent of the economy there is uncompetitive. This means of course that a large number of lay-offs are inevitable.' INTERVENTION BY CENTRAL BANKS FAILS TO HELP D-MARK Intervention by European central banks failed to reduce the value of the dollar and support a sagging D-Mark, writes Peter Marsh. Eleven banks, led by the German Bundesbank, sold dollars for the second day in an effort to lift the D-Mark, which has been hit in recent weeks by worries about the German economy. However, the effort was hampered by the lack of any sign that the US Federal Reserve was joining the operation. The Fed is thought to be disinclined to support the campaign, on the grounds that a strong dollar may make it easier to cut US interest rates. In London, the dollar gained more than 1 pfennig at DM1.7535 and its strength depressed sterling, which closed at Dollars 1.6945, down by just under 1 cent. Against the D-Mark, sterling lost 1 pfennig to DM2.9725. Later in New York, the D-Mark regained some lost ground against the dollar to close at DM1.7465. Sterling also strengthened to close at Dollars 1.7015. East German jobs to go, Page 2 Currencies, Page 39 World stocks, Pages 44 and 45 London stocks, Page 48</p>

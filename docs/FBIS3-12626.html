"What is the motive of the Saudis in taking the lead and  offering compensation on behalf of Israel?" JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI,  close to the Islamic hardliners, asked.    "Has Riyadh volunteered in such a disgusting act under  pressure from Israel and the United States, or because it feels  responsibility for the tragedy?"    The paper warned that the offer could "risk tempting the  Zionists to repeat such crime" and portray an image of Saudi  Arabia as a defender of Israel.    A Saudi spokesman said Monday that the king had decided to  make the gesture "to ease the suffering of relatives of those  martyred in the vile massacre ... [ellipsis as received] and  those shot dead afterwards by the Israeli army."    The money would be paid to relatives of those who died in  the  mosque massacre and demonstrators who were shot and killed later  the same day.    The king also offered to fly the seriously wounded  Palestinians to Saudi hospitals.    Iran has strongly condemned the slaughter and several  demonstrations have been held in protest at the incident in  Iranian cities.    The Israeli army says 30 Palestinians died in the mosque,  and  Palestinian doctors said the toll was 52.</p>

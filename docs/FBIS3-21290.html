Nazim: "Ulemas and Duate Conference; Creation </F> of the Republican Islamic Rally (RIR)"--first paragraph is  LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] "To end `itna' and bloodshed among Algerians."    The participants who took turns speaking at the ulemas  conference focused their speeches on this slogan.    Called last Thursday at the Harcha auditorium by seven  Islamic personalities, including Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, the ulemas  conference brought together several hundreds of people, in  particular Algerian and foreign Islamic leaders. The  participants took this opportunity to express their outrage at  "the fratricidal fight among Algerians, assassination and  threats against intellectuals, the worsening of the political  situation, economic failure, and the rise of political and  religious violence."    This situation prompted the ulemas to denounce "in righteous  words, whatever is counter to divine order, with no fear of  either the governing or the governed."    In this respect, the meeting gave the organizers an  opportunity to announce the forthcoming creation of a Republican  Islamic Rally, the TADJ [RIR].    It would be a nonpartisan movement including all the ulemas  and all the Algerians who might feel concerned by the appeal,  even armed groups "provided they put down their weapons," Mr.  Nahnah indicated.    "We want the TADJ to bring together all the ulemas, the  preachers, the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], whether dissolved  or not, En-Nahda [Awakening], the El Oumma (editor's note:  league headed by Benyoucef Benkhedda), etc.    "All upright nationalists and all the Algerians who want to  bar the way to those who cause trouble and divisions," he added.    At the close of the conference, Sheik Abou-Djara Soltani,  professor at the Constantine Islamic University and conference  spokesman, made it a point to clarify some issues raised by the  organization of such a meeting.    Answering a question concerning the similarity [of the RIR]  with Mr. Said Sadi's MPR [Movement for the Republic], Mr.  Soltani bluntly stated that the RIR does not aspire "to any  complementarity or normalization between Islamism and  secularism"; the speaker even went so far as to state that the  movement he is calling for "would oppose the MPR."    To those who wonder whether the time was well chosen to hold  such a conference and create the RIR, Mr. Soltani said that the  RIR does not claim to be a political formation and "has no  ambition to take a direct part in the National Conference,"  although he did not rule out the possibility that the RIR might  act as a mediator between the FIS and the government, should it  be asked to do so.    In answering all these questions, Mr. Soltani insisted on  the  nonpartisan nature of his movement which, he said, will strive  to fulfill the function which was initially assigned to the  Dawla Islamiya [Islamic State] league but which the league could  not fulfill "for reasons beyond its control or reasons of its  own." At the end of his conference, Mr. Soltani announced a  forthcoming RIR conference designed to examine questions  concerning its organization and operation, and the eventual  creation of a forum for reconciliation and the settlement of  conflicts.</p>

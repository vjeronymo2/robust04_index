			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Post Office competitors set sights on niche markets Government plans to limit the Post Office's letters monopoly are set to lead to a growth in small business-to-business mail operators but are unlikely to make a significant dent in Royal Mail revenues, companies competing against Royal Mail said yesterday. They said that unless the Post Office's monopoly was abolished entirely they would continue to concentrate on niche sectors, particularly services to City institutions. The green paper on the future of the Post Office, published this week, raised the prospect of shrinking Royal Mail's monopoly, which covers all mail costing less than Pounds 1 to deliver. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, refused to specify a new figure, but analysts do not expect it to be below 50p - twice the price of a first-class stamp. Mr John Ellis, chief executive of Deltec, a London-based company competing in the public mail market, said: 'If it comes down to 50p, we might grow about fourfold - but that still makes us a drop of water in the Royal Mail's ocean.' Deltec specialises in international mail, over which the Post Office has no monopoly. It focuses on customers requiring collection after the last Royal Mail collection times and offers overnight delivery from the City to 18 London postal codes. Mr Ellis said: 'At 50p we would think seriously about offering a similar overnight service in other UK business centres  - but there is no chance of our going into the residential market.' Deltec is one of about 15 companies believed to be offering a public business mail service. Their combined turnover was a tiny fraction of the Pounds 4.2bn earned by Royal Mail last year. Mr Edward Davey, a postal analyst at Omega Partners, a London consultancy, said: 'Further competition is likely in niche markets, particularly in business-to-business flows.' Parcelforce, the Royal Mail's lossmaking parcels delivery subsidiary, is estimated to have only 30 per cent of the UK parcels market. But the Post Office is more efficient in the letters market and not open to being undercut on price. Mr Mark Haynes, chief executive of City and Financial Express, another carrier targeting the City market, said: 'The Royal Mail does a marvellous job. Anyone talking about providing a parallel service is talking rubbish. We are interested in serving needs that the Royal Mail does not meet.'</p>

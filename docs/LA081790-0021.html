			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VIDEO STORE FILES LABOR COMPLAINT OVER PICKETS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles audio-video store chain has filed a federal unfair labor charge  against the union that Wednesday picketed a major San Fernando Valley investor,  as well as the home of the nephew of the late Walt Disney.  </P> <P> Show Industries Inc., owner of the Music Plus chain, has charged in a complaint  to the National Labor Relations Board that about 25 Music Plus warehouse  workers violated federal labor law when they directed their picketing at the  Burbank office of Shamrock Holdings Inc., a major investor in Show, said  Michael Sitrick, a Show spokesman.  </P> <P> Members of Teamsters Local 598 also picketed the North Hollywood house of Roy  E. Disney, Shamrock's chairman of the board.  </P> <P> Show argued in its NLRB complaint that the workers, by picketing Shamrock  instead of Show, violated national labor law, Sitrick said. Show, not Shamrock,  determines the terms of the workers' employment, Sitrick said.  </P> <P> The picketers said they were protesting an earlier move by the company to  challenge their vote to form a union. The warehouse workers voted in November  to form a bargaining unit under Local 598, but Show has complained to the NLRB  that the election was faulty.  </P></p>

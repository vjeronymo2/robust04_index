			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Marc Rich ferrous team goes it alone A team of ferrous metals traders this morning resigned from Marc Rich, the Zug-based international commodities trading group. The team of 18 has set up its own trading company, to be known as Profer, which will start operations this week from seven offices around the world. It will also have agents in a further 11 locations. Mr Omar Shah, who will be managing director, said the new company had conservatively estimated that it would turn over 1m tonnes of ferrous raw material, or about Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) in its first year. The company is aiming at least to double its trading in the second year. Turnover at Marc Rich in 1992 was Dollars 24bn, making it the 29th biggest company in the FT's European Top 200. Mr Willi Strothotte, who returned to Marc Rich as chief executive last year, said the defections would have an insignificant effect on the group's business. 'It's something that happens in a large organisation when people seek greener pastures,' he said, adding that senior traders had remained at Marc Rich, which would continue in the ferrous markets. He dismissed as an 'insult' any comparison with the well-publicised departure in 1992 of Mr Claud Dauphin, head of the oil trading operations, and Mr Manny Weiss, head of sugar trading. Their resignations, along with Mr Strothotte himself, prompted speculation of a power struggle at the top of the organisation. Last December Mr Marc Rich resigned as chairman of the company and restructured it to give 72.5 per cent of its capital to management and key employees. Mr Shah said dissatisfaction with 'the much heralded equity restructuring' was a key reason behind the decision to set up Profer, which would be 'sufficiently well capitalised'. It had not ruled out diversifying into non-ferrous metals. Mr Bruno Furrer will be the chief executive. He has spent 18 years with March Rich and will remain in Zug where Profer is to have its head office.</p>

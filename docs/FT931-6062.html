			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Smith squares up MR JOHN Smith's speech on constitutional reform, delivered with little fanfare on Monday night, will do him good. The UK Labour leader observed that too much government power is held at the centre and exercised in secret. Since the Conservatives first took office in 1979 local government has increasingly been hamstrung. A new tribe of unelected, boards, executives and committees has sprung up to run schools, hospitals and hived-off agencies spawned by Whitehall. Actions of the state have become more difficult to hold to account. Few of the items in Mr Smith's list of proposed remedies are revolutionary. He would give local authorities 'clear statutory powers, a reasonable and stable financial structure, and enough autonomy to find practical local solutions . . . ' A 'new tier' of government would be installed in Scotland, which makes some sense, and in Wales and the regions of England, for which the case has yet to be proved. Mr Smith's opinion that the 'all-powerful nation state' is 'outdated' is not shared by everyone. His classification of the ideal European model of decision-making as four-layered (municipal, regional, national and European) would not be controversial in most of the European Community. The Labour leader's suggestion that the European Convention on Human Rights be incorporated into British law lays to rest his predecessor's messy compromise of a set of bills of rights tailor-made to suit Labour policies. It is also in accord with the views of senior judges. Mr Smith over-eggs the pudding with his proposed Human Rights Commission and Ministry of Justice, but the intention, to protect individuals, is honourable. He quotes the Financial Times in support of a Freedom of Information Act. No comment. Economic policy is best made with as much openness as possible. The Labour leader muses about a 'Green Budget', confirms his party's plan for an annual 'state of the nation' report, promises to end the ritual of pre-Budget purdah and, temptingly, argues that the Central Statistical Office should be made statutorily independent, accountable to Parliament, and supervised by a special panel. He reflects his party's obsession with high earnings in his call for 'the cobwebs of unnecessary secrecy' around boardrooms to be blown away, but seems to limit his proposals to those in last year's Cadbury report. In sum, Mr Smith's modest slate of reforms would move his party further towards the centre. He says nothing about proportional representation for elections to the House of Commons, although he will have to come clean before Labour's conference in the autumn. His wider strategy therefore remains obscure. If he wanted a pact with the Liberal Democrats, he would test the water by persuading the Labour party to stand aside from the forthcoming by-election in Newbury. Meanwhile he has made a canny bid for Liberal Democrat votes.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> JUDGES;  </P> <P> ORDER IN THE RACES: JUDICIAL CAMPAIGNERS PROCEEDING IN COURTLY MANNER;  </P> <P> CANDIDATES FOR OPENINGS IN SUPERIOR COURT AND WESTMINSTER MUNICIPAL COURT RUN  IN DELIBERATELY LOW-KEY WAY.  </P> <P> It's unusual, to say the least: Two campaigns are being quietly waged with  virtually no accusations or political arguments, hardly any fund raising or  campaign literature and only a few speeches.  </P> <P> Yet, these races will put two new judges on the bench in Orange County for  six-year terms.  </P> <P> Welcome to the ever-so-polite world of judicial campaigning, where the  candidates are so full of praise for one another that they hardly seem like  competitors.  </P> <P> The races are permeated by an unspoken code that makes super-aggressive  campaigning too, well, unseemly. And for the three candidates who are sitting  judges, that feeling is enhanced by very real rules: the canons of judicial  ethics forbid them from soliciting money themselves.  </P> <P> All this has combined to produce two races that are so low-key as to be nearly  invisible.  </P> <P> There are two vacancies, and three candidates vying for each one. The spots  were created by the retirement of Superior Court Judge Frank Domenichini and  Westminster Municipal Judge William L. Mock. Since it might be tough for any  one contender in a three-way race to garner more than 50% of the vote, a  November runoff election is viewed as likely.  </P> <P> Thirty-five other Superior and Municipal Court judges came up for reelection  this year, but none was challenged.  </P> <P> In the race for Domenichini's Superior Court seat, the candidates are: Robert  E. Thomas, Glenn Mahler and Daniel Charles Dutcher.  </P> <P> Dutcher, 59, of Santa Ana, a Municipal Court judge in Westminster, has run the  ultimate low-profile campaign: He has sought no endorsements, solicited no  contributions and made only one speech. Dutcher says he believes that seeking  support from special interest groups would compromise his judicial impartiality  and independence.  </P> <P> Dutcher, who was elected to the bench in 1982 after winning a much-publicized  court battle challenging his opponent's residency, considers himself "middle of  the road" in his approach to the law and says he prides himself on treating  those before him in a "humane" manner.  </P> <P> Mahler, 42, of Irvine, a Municipal Court judge in Newport Beach, has relied on  friends and colleagues to spread the word about his reputation after 13 years  on the bench as a traffic referee, commissioner and judge. Mahler says he wants  voters to know that he is a hard worker who is usually the first judge in the  courthouse in the morning and the last one out at night.  </P> <P> Mahler also has refused all campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Mahler is concerned that the much-touted "fast-track" program of expediting  civil cases in Superior Court has imposed longer delays on the civil cases that  are not part of that program. Some of the burden could be eased by doubling the  Municipal Court's limit of $25,000 in damages to allow more cases to be filed  there, Mahler said. Another courthouse and more judges are also required, he  said.  </P> <P> Thomas, 48, of Newport Beach, has been a Municipal Court judge in Santa Ana for  9 1/2 years. A proponent of the death penalty, Thomas depicts himself as tough  on crime. He says he is dedicated to protecting neighborhoods from criminals  and pledges to deal sternly with drunk drivers, drug dealers, "gang thugs" and  hard-core criminals.  </P> <P> Thomas' stance has garnered endorsements from many law enforcement groups,  including the Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, Deputy District Attorneys and  Deputy Marshals associations and the police chiefs of Santa Ana and Laguna  Beach, in addition to dozens of Orange County judges and the California  Republican Assembly.  </P> <P> In Thomas' view, the Superior Court's biggest problem is the delays it poses to  litigants. He hopes that the court will keep up its aggressive stand on trying  new programs to expedite trials, such as transferring bulky paper case files  into the computer system so they can be quickly circulated around the  courthouse.  </P> <P> In the race for Mock's Municipal Court seat, the candidates are: Donald S.  Macintyre, Ross I. Gallen and Ralph Hansen.  </P> <P> Gallen, 49, an attorney, has launched perhaps the most vigorous judicial  campaign of the election. The Irvine resident walks precincts, pressing  literature into people's hands. He appears in a commercial on local cable TV.  He bills himself as a law-and-order candidate who will be tough on criminals  and has won the endorsement of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> Yet, Gallen says he believes that Municipal Court is a place where young  offenders can still be turned around. If elected, Gallen hopes to tailor  sentences to enhance a defendant's chance of rehabilitation, whether through a  stiff jail term or a community service project.  </P> <P> Hansen, 57, also an attorney, says he, too, believes in the rehabilitative  value of work for those convicted of crimes. He would like to see a stronger  judicial crackdown on crimes involving alcohol, such as drunk driving, and he  says he believes that sentencing offenders to pick up trash or rake leaves  makes a greater impact on them than simply imposing fines.  </P> <P> Hansen, a Costa Mesa resident, also believes that the courts must expand their  hours to accommodate the growing caseload and the schedules of working people  who are litigating cases. But he opposes building a new courthouse, saying that  money could be better spent on health care for the poor or shelter for the  homeless.  </P> <P> Macintyre, 47, a commissioner in Municipal Court in Westminster, has taken  several weeks of vacation time to walk precincts all over the county. In  talking to voters, the San Clemente resident has capitalized on his extensive  judicial experience, something his rivals cannot claim.  </P> <P> Since he was elected to Justice Court in Lassen County in 1976, Macintyre has  sat by assignment as a judge in 10 counties in California. A former prosecutor,  Macintyre also paints himself as tough on crime.  </P> <P> "I have a track record which law enforcement endorses," he says. "You violate  the law, you go to jail. That's what judges are supposed to do. Just look at  the crime. That's why citizens are sitting in their houses with bars on the  windows and big dogs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUPERIOR COURT, MUNICIPAL COURT  </P> <P> Superior Court, Office No. 7Daniel C.

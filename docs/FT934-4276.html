			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dares Ests agrees refinancing Dares Estates, the property investment and development group, has reached agreement with its principal lenders for a restructuring of its banking arrangements. The deal, which is subject to shareholders' approval, also involves a reorganisation of the company's share capital. Under the terms of the agreement, the main creditors will convert a proportion of the debt into preference shares and extend the maturity date of the balance. At a later date the new preference shares will be convertible into ordinary equity, which if fully taken up, would give lenders some 39 per cent of the enlarged share capital.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Smart money backs South Americans Over the next month, I plan to drub Britain's bookmakers until they weep, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. Betting-wise, an event like the World Cup requires a well-laid strategy, adroit money-management, a close watch on the odds - and luck. I am making title-winning bets only, and ignoring dangerous exotica such as match, group and each-way betting, or who scores first in US vs Switzerland. Current strategy: South America. Bets struck: Pounds 70 on Colombia to win the tournament, at 9-1; Pounds 60 Brazil, 3-1; and Pounds 20 Argentina, 10-1. Colombia would be a big winner, with a net overall profit of more than 300 per cent. For now, the other two bets are savers. First crunch date: start of the second round, on July 2.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / French approve use of Imigran GLAXO, Europe's biggest drugs group, yesterday received authorisation for Imigran, its new migraine treatment, to be used in France. The authorisation follows tense negotiations between Glaxo and French ministries about the safety, effectiveness and cost of the drug. Analysts believe the medicine, which had worldwide sales of Pounds 43m last year, could become a 'block-buster' with sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 578m) a year. The French ministry of social affairs had previously proved unwilling to agree the prices for Imigran required by Glaxo. The company has been anxious to secure a common price for Imigran throughout Europe, to avoid parallel importing by wholesalers from low-price countries to high-price markets. The price agreed is understood to be FFr390 (Pounds 44.72) for a box of two injections. That compares with Pounds 41 for the same product in the UK. Glaxo refused to confirm the price, but said it was very pleased with the progress during price discussions. The French government has traditionally set low pharmaceuticals prices to compensate for the large number of prescriptions issued there. The ministry of social affairs has agreed an accord with Glaxo to control state expenditure on Imigran. Patients' bills for the drug are to be reimbursed by the state at 70 per cent. The aim of the accord is to ensure those who need the drug receive it, but that there is no explosion in the drug's use that might worsen the social security deficit. Some analysts have predicted the potential French market at more than FFr1bn. France is the world's fifth largest market for pharmaceuticals. The licence is for the injectable rather than oral version of Imigran. The product, said the ministry of health, was not a miracle drug, but was superior to existing therapies. It was to be used when other treatments had failed. The drug will be launched in January, when Glaxo will conduct a study of the first 10,000 French patients using Imigran. Earlier discussions between Glaxo and the government over Imigran had been difficult. In April, Glaxo's president of French operations left the company after negotiations collapsed.

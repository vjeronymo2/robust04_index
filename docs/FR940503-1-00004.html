			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, the federal banking agencies recently conducted a comprehensive review of their CRA regulations in order to provide clearer guidance to financial institutions on the nature and extent of their CRA obligations, the methods by which their performance will be assessed, and the manner in which the CRA will be enforced. This review was undertaken in response to the President's July 1993 request that the federal financial institution supervisory agencies reform the CRA examination and enforcement system. The President asked, among other things, that in undertaking this effort, the regulators seek to promote consistency and even-handedness, to improve CRA performance evaluations and to institute more effective sanctions against institutions with consistently poor CRA performance. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The addition of a convenience and needs factor to the mutual to stock conversion standards and the standards for MHC stock offerings is wholly consistent with the larger Presidential and regulatory initiatives on the CRA. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The OTS's assessment of the CRA performance record of each association that is subject to the regulations promulgated under sections 5(i) and 10(o) of the HOLA furthers its responsibility under section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA to encourage thrifts to provide housing credit safely and soundly. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To implement the President's initiative, the four agencies held a series of seven public hearings across the country, and amendments to the agencies' CRA regulations were proposed on December 21, 1993. See 58 FR 67466 (December 21, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with its review of the CRA and its implementing regulations, the OTS also concluded that the CRA, by its terms, requires the OTS to consider the CRA record of an association proposing to convert from mutual to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> federal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  stock form because the association must receive a new federal stock charter to replace its previous mutual charter. See 12 U.S.C. 2902(3)(A) and 2903 and 12 CFR 563e.8(a) (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See also section 5(a) of the HOLA, 12 U.S.C. 1464(a). Section 5(a) of the HOLA provides that the lending and other powers conferred on federal savings associations under section 5 are intended to encourage provision of credit for housing safely and soundly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed convenience and needs standard, like the convenience and needs standards governing transactions subject to the Bank Merger Act, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  certain holding company applications, <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  and certain non-routine corporate transactions under current OTS regulations, <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  is intended to encourage savings associations to devote their resources to lending programs and related customer services that are designed to address the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income communities, consistent with safety and soundness. Such programs and services are an integral part of a mutual association's traditional role of providing ``credit for housing,'' as envisioned by section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA. Thus, the OTS believes the proposed regulations will enhance the OTS's ability to ensure that savings associations undertaking these transactions recognize their responsibility to consider their community's credit needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 12 U.S.C. 1828(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 12 U.S.C. 1467a(e)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 12 CFR 563.22(c) and 571.5(b)(4) (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would add a new &sect;563b.11 to the OTS conversion regulations that would require the OTS, in reviewing a conversion application, to examine the extent to which the proposed conversion will affect the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the converted savings association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of this examination, the OTS will review the applicant's record under the CRA regulations at 12 CFR part 563e and related CRA policies. Under the proposal, the OTS would give substantial weight to an applicant's previous CRA record, consistent with the long-standing policy of the OTS. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  For example, if an applicant in its most recent CRA examination received a rating of ``substantial noncompliance,'' <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  the OTS likely would not approve the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 54 FR 13742 (April 5, 1989) (joint CRA policy statement of the federal financial supervisory agencies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 55 FR 18163 (May 1, 1990) (adopting revised CRA guidelines and assessment rating system).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

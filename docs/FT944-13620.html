			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Zeiss workers fight job cuts Thousands of German workers chanting 'out with the management' yesterday protested against job-cutting plans by optical equipment maker Carl Zeiss and demanded that the company's board quit. Mr Edwin Michler, head of the loss-making company's works council, told 4,500 jeering demonstrators at the Zeiss Oberkochen plant in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg the board was not providing enough information about its plans. Zeiss, once renowned for its paternalistic management, wants to shed 3,000 out of 15,900 jobs in plants in east and west Germany by withdrawing from unprofitable business areas to save about DM250m (Pounds 102m) by 1996. Mr Michler accused the board of making contradictory statements about the future of various factories. Zeiss management board chairman Mr Jobst Herrmann announced last week he planned to resign. The group lost DM180m in 1993/94 mainly in east Germany's Jena branch. Carl Zeiss Jena, once a showpiece industry of communist East Germany, was mostly taken over by Carl Zeiss Oberkochen in a deal hailed at the time as rescuing the company from bankruptcy. The original Zeiss company was split by the division of Germany after the second world war.</p>

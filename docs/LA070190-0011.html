			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY SHEARER  </P> <P> Harry Shearer's article on the information age ("Eyewitness Moods," May 6) was  such a delight. I don't always agree with his findings (rare), I don't always  understand his musings (rare), but he's a master storyteller (well done) -- we  adore him.  </P> <P> RON LAMANTIA  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

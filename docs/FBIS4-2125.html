			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 5 (XINHUA) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur said here today that his upcoming visit to  China is aimed at promoting the traditional bilateral relations  to a new level in keeping with the aspirations of the two  peoples.    In an interview with XINHUA reporters on the eve of his trip  to China, Balladur said that although the French-Chinese  relations encountered some difficulties in the past few years,  30 years of fruitful exchanges have laid a sound foundation for  such relations.    He said the two countries should now try their best to boost  the positive atmosphere that has reappeared between them.    He said he will discuss with Chinese leaders major  international issues, especially the situation in Asia and  Europe.    He stressed that the two countries should build a more  trusting relationship on a new basis.    It is important for France and China, both of them permanent  members of the UN Security council, to exchange views on major  international issues and to closely cooperate in international  affairs such as the settlement of regional crisis, the prime  minister added.    He believed that the development of bilateral relations also  conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries.    Balladur hoped that his visit, though a political one, could  help strengthen economic ties.    He also said that France supports in principle China's  efforts to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade  (GATT).</p>

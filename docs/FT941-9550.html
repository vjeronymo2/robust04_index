			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: CBOE revives the idea of options on OTC shares - Risk and Reward The outstanding performance of over-the-counter stocks last year has prompted the Chicago Board Options Exchange to attempt a brave revival of an idea that has twice failed - derivatives, in this case options, on an index of the 100 most heavily capitalised companies traded on the Nasdaq stock market. Nasdaq, the OTC rival of the New York Stock Exchange, has grown steadily over the past 10 years, with share volume rising to 66.5bn last year from just 20bn in 1985. Once regarded as a mere upstart compared with organised exchanges in the US, Nasdaq carved a niche by listing the shares of small growth companies and trading them by wire and telephone. Many of those companies, like Intel and Microsoft, are no longer small, but retain their exclusive Nasdaq listings. Last year, Nasdaq matched the NYSE's share volume, although dollar volume, at some Dollars 1,350bn, lagged the big board's Dollars 2,830bn. In the early 1980s, when portfolio managers first discovered that they could use stock index futures and options to enhance investment returns, leverage portfolios, or gain flexibility when allocating assets, Chicago's futures and options exchanges launched a range of successful contracts based on indices of NYSE-listed stocks. However, when they extended the concept to derivatives on OTC stocks, they failed miserably. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade spent millions of dollars launching competing OTC index futures in 1985 in a battle that ended only when it became clear they had misjudged their market and no one was interested in trading either product. They beat an embarrassed retreat, leaving the idea to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, whose options on an index of 100 OTC stocks rarely trade. Now, the Chicago Board Options Exchange is trying again. Mr William Floersch, the exchange's vice chairman, says times have changed, and growth companies are in vogue. Last year, he notes, Nasdaq 100 stocks outperformed more heavily capitalised indices like the S&amp;P 500. 'The Nasdaq market is six time bigger than it was in 1985. We've seen an institutionalisation of Nasdaq stocks,' he says. 'The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange had a good idea, but they were a little ahead of themselves.' While there is no doubt the Nasdaq 100 stocks, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 269bn, are popular with retail and institutional investors, equities traders say the CBOE's Nasdaq 100 index option is like a one-legged stool. It needs a complementary futures contract and a mechanism for executing basket or 'programme' trades in the underlying shares. Institutional money managers need all three to carry out balanced hedging and arbitrage programmes. The CBOE's S&amp;P 100 index options are arguably the most successful equity index product in the world because they are used in conjunction with the CME's S&amp;P 500 index futures and the NYSE's automated order routing system, known as the DOT. A trader can buy an S&amp;P index option contract, lay off the risk by selling a futures contract, and also purchase or sell a basket of the underlying stocks, all in the same instant. In the Nasdaq market this capability is lacking, but may develop in time to boost the CBOE's new product. As for a Nasdaq 100 futures contract, CME spokesman Andy Yemma says his exchange is considering giving the product another shot. 'The CBOE is doing the options, and we co-operate with them on a lot of other equity products,' he says.</p>

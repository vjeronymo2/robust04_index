			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Germans Move to Kaliningrad"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is receiving  letters from Germany, whose authors describe themselves as the  heirs and descendants of Germans living pre-1945 on the  territory of Eastern Prussia, now Kaliningrad Oblast. They want  to know if lost property can be reclaimed, and if so, then on  what terms.    Smolensk Square is leaving the messages unanswered, but the  Germans' interest in the given theme is becoming increasingly  ardent as a treaty between Kaliningrad and Moscow is under  preparation in the depths of the Russian Parliament. It is  expected that it will be a treaty like the one recently  concluded by the center with Kazan.    On this score, parliamentarians hold two points of view:  Some are in favor of bolstering the enclave's independence;  others fear that it will drift too far into the ocean of  autonomy. Under Boris Yeltsin's edict, the oblast has existed  under the regime of a free economic zone for over a year  already, attracting attention not only from the children and  grandchildren of Prussian barons.    In February, at a session of the European Parliament in  Strasbourg, a resolution was adopted within the context of which  Kaliningrad was accorded a special place in relations between  Russia and the European Community. Magdalene Hoff, chairman of  the Commission for Relations with the CIS, having visited  Kaliningrad recently, put forward the idea of transforming it  into an autonomous territorial unit and, ultimately, into a  fourth independent Baltic state. The question of international  monitoring of the oblast and the creation of a kind of  condominium is being examined by way of one option.    The resolution's authors are insisting on the question's  inclusion on the agenda of the talks on Russia's membership in  the Council of Europe. In a conversation with European  Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch, a German, Andrey Kozyrev  expressed displeasure in connection with the document's  appearance and indicated that he views it as an attempt to  intervene in domestic affairs.    Germany vows fidelity to the treaties with Russia, and says  that it is not thinking about recovering property. However, the  specter of "Germanization" haunts the imaginations of those  Russians in Kaliningrad who are prey to feeling "cut off from  the family." The national patriots are exploiting the vague  sense of uncertainty to their own political ends.    In terms of volume of investments in the oblast's economy,  the FRG has far outstripped all foreign investors, taking second  place behind Poland in respect of the number of joint ventures.  The government in Bonn allocates finance, equipment, and  construction materials to Germans moving to Kaliningrad in far  greater quantities than to Germans in the Volga Region or  Siberia. Incidentally, in a Russian Government decree on aid to  refugees and persons forcibly resettled from the CIS, there is  no mention at all of Kaliningrad among other Russian cities, as  if the road there has already been closed to them. To these  ends, the oblast does not receive any subsidies from the center.  But Germans go there willingly. There are already around  15,000 of them there. Sponsors from Germany are helping them to  buy land and put down roots.    A German-language newspaper entitled KOENIGSBURG EXPRESS is  available in the city. The firm "Rossbahn" is bulding a highway  to Berlin. By the end of this year, the 40-kilometer section to  the Polish Border will be complete. And there is also a boom in  "nostalgia" tourism for Germans who lived in Koenigsburg before  1945. From the border, tourists are conveyed by an old steam  locomotive. The cars and compartments are done out in "retro"  style. The current spring-summer season promises to be busy.</p>

Ryndyuk, Institute of Modeling Problems in </F> Power Engineering, Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev; UDC  68.103]    [Abstract] Systems of differential equations are commonly  used to mathematically model objects. Nonlinear systems can be  described using the theory of differential Taylor transforms.  Models based on these transforms can be solved quickly. The  simplicity of representing Taylor models and organization of the  computing process is the basis for the synthesis of functional  transform structures. Here the mathematical model is converted  into a spectral model by replacing functions and actions on  functions with T-spectra and operations on functions with  operations on differential spectra. The spectral model is a  system of recurrent equations. The desired functions are found  in the form of segments of Taylor power series. Linear and  nonlinear systems of equations can be studied with Taylor  notation. The example of finding the T-spectrum of trignometric  and hyperbolic functions is presented. The parallel computing  structure synthesized here can reproduce T-models of  trigonometric functions in real time. The advantages of a  parallel specialized computer over a personal computer are  shown, specifically, the scheme presented in this article is a  factor of 80 faster than a YeS-1840 personal computer.

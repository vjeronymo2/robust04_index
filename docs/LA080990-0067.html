			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLET REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BOLSHOI BRINGS 'IVAN' THE TAWDRY  </P> <P> The Bolshoi is back. The mighty, exotic Bolshoi. Gosh. Whoopee. Jeer. Sigh.  Sob.  </P> <P> No other ballet company inspires such mixed or such passionate reactions. No  other ballet company has endured such grandiose vicissitudes.  </P> <P> The general public here was conditioned long ago to equate this ensemble from  mysterious Moscow with athletic bravura in aesthetic excelsis. Told by press  agents that the Bolshoi is "immortal," audiences that normally avoid tutus and  toe shoes respond to these visitors with push-button ecstasy.  </P> <P> The masses obviously respond to the extravagant ads. Never mind that the  lay-outs feature a flying matinee idol who no longer happens to be with the  company, or that the texts carefully avoid the dirty word ballet. The Russians,  we are assured, still "soar above the rest!"  </P> <P> The American press has responded with a certain skepticism. The only champion  turned out to be Anna (a wag might call her Pollyanna) Kisselgoff of the New  York Times. Mustering a brave semblance of enthusiasm, she wrote that "The  Bolshoi was much better than expected, not quite as excellent as hoped."  </P> <P> Tobi Tobias of New York Magazine, on the other hand, found the company "in a  pitiable state." Dale Harris of the Wall Street Journal lamented "a level of  mediocrity that even undiscriminating audiences are bound to notice before too  long."  </P> <P> "The company has got weaker," observed Arlene Croce of the New Yorker "American  audiences," she added, "don't seem to have noticed the drop in quality -- they  go on celebrating the mystique."  </P> <P> Reviewing the recent opening at Lincoln Center for the Village Voice, Deborah  Jowitt complained of being "gradually numbed" by Yuri Grigorovich's "Ivan the  Terrible." It was the selfsame "Ivan" that inaugurated the 14-performance  season at Shrine Auditorium on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Despite some apparent papering, the 6,300-seat cavern wasn't quite full. Still,  a healthy crowd came to cheer, and did.  </P> <P> For at least one minority reporter, however, this seemed a case of better never  than late. "Ivan the Terrible" was new, and controversial, back in 1975. Sol  Hurok did not deem it worth exporting to Los Angeles at the time.  </P> <P> In those distant days, Ivan IV served as a grateful vehicle for two virtuoso  danseurs: Yuri Vladimirov played the barbaric czar with almost unbearable  muscular frenzy, while Vladimir Vasiliev stressed the protagonist's complex  moods, shifting subtly and gradually from pathetic insecurity to crazed power.  </P> <P> With such compelling artists in the central role, it was possible -- from time  to time -- to overlook the abiding kitsch and the tawdry excesses. Vladimirov  and Vasiliev somehow obscured the vapidity of Grigorovich's fussy and  repetitive choreographic routines, inspired to a degree by the celebrated  Eisenstein film.  </P> <P> A genuinely magnetic czar could draw attention away from the simplistic, nearly  comic military maneuvers imposed on the strutting men, the limp cliches visited  upon the slinking women, the primitive symbolism sporadically employed to  embellish the scenario. Given the right distractions, a friendly observer could  try to ignore the political ambiguities that popped out of the quasi-historic  libretto, not to mention the passing infelicities of the Prokofiev pastiche  drafted as a supportive score.  </P> <P> It wasn't so easy to look the other way on Tuesday. Given Irek Mukhamedov's  post-perestroika defection to the Royal Ballet, the Bolshoi's premier Ivan now  seems to be Alexander Vetrov.  </P> <P> He is a solid technician and a conscientious, hard-working actor. He stalks the  throne with spidery authority, partners his beloved Anastasia attentively in  the acrobatic love duets, scowls continuously and ferociously, hoists himself  picturesquely in the ubiquitous bell ropes for the ambiguous crucifixion pose  that heralds the final curtain. Ultimately, alas, he settles for a  one-dimensional, lightweight performance that conveys much agony, little  ecstasy and only the vaguest compulsion.  </P> <P> Gedeminas Taranda missed the last Bolshoi tour because he seemed a defection  risk, or because he had been injured, or because he was being punished for some  odd amorous indiscretion at home. We have heard all three explanations. In any  case, he made his belated local debut on this occasion as Ivan's  friend-turned-enemy, Prince Turbsky. Although his chunky physique proved  somewhat disadvantageous, he exuded a nice aura of crafty ardor and mastered  Grigorovich's nasty kicks and heroic leaps with ease.  </P> <P> Maria Bilova replaced the reportedly indisposed Alla Mikhalchenko as Anastasia  (a role created by and for Grigorovich's wife, Natalia Bessmertnova). Bilova  stressed the same stoic, willowy lyricism as rapturous bride, willing martyr  and grieving ghost.  </P> <P> The busy corps strutted, pranced, crouched and/or gesticulated with disciplined  gusto, whether impersonating Boyars, Oprichnina (a.k.a. members of the KGB),  death figures bearing scythes, clowns or warriors. Although the ads promised a  company of 160, that would seem to be a matter of wishful hyperbole.  </P> <P> Simon Virsaladze's simple decors, a clever network of circular playing areas  defined by flexible curtains of gauze, reinforced cinematic fluidity, as did  Boris Lelyukhin's shadowy lighting scheme. The only glitch: an odd procedural  mishap that constantly allowed the audience to view the dancers preparing for  their entrances while stationed behind the central platform.  </P> <P> In the locally staffed pit, Alexander Kopylov tended efficiently -- no more, no  less -- to the Prokofiev mish-mash accommodatingly arranged by Mikhail Chulaki.  It comprised obvious portions of the Eisenstein sound track plus excerpts from  the Third Symphony, the "Russian Overture" and "Alexander Nevsky." The crucial  ringing of bells, a Greek-chorus device much favored by Grigorovich on the  stage, was more seen than heard.  </P></p>

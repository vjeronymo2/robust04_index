If the Commission approves the Substitution, Policy holders will receive notice of the intended substitution and will have the opportunity to vote on the matter. The Account I Policies and the INA/Putnam Policies provide that a substitution of the shares of one registered investment company for those of another registered investment company may be implemented with respect to a particular division of the applicable separate account only if it (i.e., the substitution) has been previously approved by a majority of the votes to be cast be persons having a voting interest in the fund shares allocated to the applicable separate account division. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the INA/Putnam Policies, Investors will request that the SEC staff confirm that the Substitution will not affect adversely the no-action positions previously issued to Investors and the INA/Putnam Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. The historical expense ratios for the CIGNA Funds generally have been higher than the historical expense ratios for the PCM Funds. The difference is attributable, in part, to the larger asset size of the PCM Funds, as compared to the asset size of the CIGNA Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Request for Order Pursuant to Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act provides: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants represent that the Commission has interpreted Section 26(b) to apply to a ``substitution of securities in any sub-account of a registered separate account.'' See Investment Company Act Rel. No. 12678 (Sept. 21, 1982) at 13. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The purpose of Section 26(b) is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment trust will accumulate the shares of a particular issuer, and to prevent unscrutinized substitutions which might, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares, thereby incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial proceeds, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption proceeds, or both. Section 26(b) affords this protection to investors by preventing a depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust holding the shares of one issuer from substituting the shares of another issuer for those shares, unless the Commission approves the substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Applicants represent that, for the following reasons, the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitution will not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(b) is designed to prevent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Substitution is being proposed because the investment adviser to CIGNA Funds has indicated that it would be unwilling to serve as investment adviser to any of the CIGNA Funds on a long-term basis. This decision, which is beyond the control of Investors, has necessitated the proposal of an alternative funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts offered by Investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Substitution is for shares of PCM Funds with investment objectives which are sufficiently similar to the objectives of the corresponding portfolios of the CIGNA Funds to provide a means for Policy holders to continue their current investment goals and risk expectations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The transactions effecting the Substitution, including the redemption of the shares of the CIGNA Funds and the purchase of shares of PCM Funds, will be effected at net asset value of the respective shares, in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Utilization of ``in kind'' redemptions by the CIGNA Funds, to the extent appropriate, followed by the use by Investors of the shares received to purchase shares of PCM Funds, would reduce the expenses and transaction costs involved in the Substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Substitution will not alter or affect the insurance benefits provided by Investors to Policy holders under the terms of the contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Substitution will not affect adversely the tax benefits available to Policy holders. The Substitution will not give rise to any current federal income tax to Policy holders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Substitution provides Policy holders with an underlying investment vehicle with enhanced asset size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Account I Policies and the INA/Putnam Policies reserve to Investors the right_subject to prior approval of affected Policy holders, as well as approval by the SEC_to substitute shares of another management investment company for shares of an investment company held by a division of Account I or the INA/Putnam Account, or to add or eliminate one or more such divisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Investors reserved this right of substitution in order to protect itself and its Policy holders in several adverse situations. This includes the present situation where the investment adviser to the underlying investment vehicles has stated that it intends to withdraw from the equity advisory business, with the related implication that a dissolution of the CIGNA Funds would result in a forced liquidation of Account I and that portion of the INA/Putnam Account for which the CIGNA Funds serves as the underlying investment vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Applicants submit that, under the circumstances, it is in the best interests of Account I and INA/Putnam Policy owners to proceed with the Substitution. The Applicants represent that the overall investment objectives of the portfolio of PCM Funds which would be substituted for the corresponding portfolio of the CIGNA Funds are sufficiently similar for the Substitution to be appropriate. The Applicants believe that the investment objectives are compatible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Applicants further represent that total fees and expenses, as a percentage of net assets, for the portfolios of PCM Funds which would be so substituted are not expected to increase as a result of the Substitution. The Applicants acknowledge that, with the exception of the PCM Money Market Fund, the advisory fee for each of the PCM Funds is higher than the advisory fee for the corresponding CIGNA Fund. However, the Applicants submit that since the PCM Funds are substantially larger in asset size than the CIGNA Funds, the operating expenses are spread over a larger base, thereby producing total expense ratios for the PCM Funds which, on a historical basis, have been lower than the ratios for the CIGNA Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Request for Order Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the 1940 Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Under certain circumstances, Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits any of the persons described above from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Applicants submit that because the Substitution may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities between and among affiliated persons as a result of the purchase by Account I and the INA/Putnam Account of shares of PCM Funds with proceeds (including ``in kind'' distributions of securities in lieu of cash) from the redemption of shares of the CIGNA Funds, the Substitution may involve transactions prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act. The Applicants further submit that the Substitution would not be exempt from Section 17 of the 1940 Act pursuant to Rule 17a&hyph;7 thereunder, since the affiliations among the parties do not arise solely by reason of having common investment advisers, common directors and/or common officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding subsection (a), any person may file with the Commission an application for an order exempting a proposed transaction of the applicant from one or more provisions of that subsection. The Commission shall grant such application and issue such order of exemption if evidence establishes that_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under this title; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of this title. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Applicants seek an exemption from Section 17(a) under both Sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the 1940 Act, because Section 17(b) refers to a single ``proposed transaction'' while, under Section 6(c), the Commission may exempt a series of transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Applicants represent that the terms of the Substitution meet all of the requirements of Section 17(b). The Applicants submit that, for the reasons set forth in their request for exemptive relief under Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act_particularly those set forth below, the terms of the Substitution are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> REPORT DUE SOON ON FOUNDATION FLAWS  </P> <P> Engineering scientists at Cal State Long Beach are expected to issue a report  soon detailing what has caused the concrete foundations in at least a dozen  homes to deteriorate and crack, city officials announced.  </P> <P> Since May, 1986, 12 homeowners have had to repair their foundations as a result  of the mysterious cracks, said Tony Elmo of the city's Building Department.  </P> <P> The most recent repair was needed in January.  </P> <P> Initial investigations revealed a high level of sulfates in the soil. Officials  speculate that the sulfates could cause an adverse reaction when they come in  contact with the concrete. This would explain why the affected areas have  mostly been garages, which are usually not protected by plastic moisture  barriers, officials said.  </P> <P> "The most problems we've seen are in garage areas because the concrete is  poured on unprotected soil," Elmo said. Because Cypress was once populated by  dairy farmers, a concern about peat from pastures also was raised. However,  Elmo said, they believe that peat is only a small part of the problem.  </P> <P> The affected homes are concentrated in a few neighborhoods north of Orange  Avenue, south of Lincoln Avenue and between Denni and Bloomfield streets. Most  of the homes were built between 1966 and 1971. Depending on the extent of the  damage, costs for replacing the concrete slabs has run anywhere from $5,000 to  $20,000, Elmo said.  </P> <P> The report is scheduled to be made public in late April or May.

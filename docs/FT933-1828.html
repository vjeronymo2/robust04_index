			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Labour ducks education funding row AN ELEVENTH-hour decision by Labour to delay publication of a discussion document on higher education overshadowed its launch yesterday of a paper on A-levels. The consultative document suggested that graduates might be asked to meet part of the cost of university education, although it was made clear that this was not official party policy. The decision not to publish the document will raise fresh doubts about the Labour leadership's willingness to confront difficult issues, before the party's annual conference in Brighton next week. Officials said the decision - taken late on Monday by senior party figures including Mr John Smith, Labour leader - was intended to avoid distracting attention from other aspects of its education green paper. They said the document would be published after the party's conference. Copies of the document had already been distributed to university vice-chancellors, who are meeting in Leicester. It says that higher education is 'not a pure collective good', and that the system is constrained by supply rather than demand. It says: 'Inequity has to be removed, and the system has to be paid for at some time by someone.' The move was understood to have dismayed some frontbench speakers. One Labour MP said he now doubted whether the party would formally publish the document. It is now thought likely that Mr Jeff Rooker, the education spokesman who wrote the paper, will submit a lightly redrafted version to Labour's Commission on Social Justice in a personal capacity. University vice-chancellors will announce which extra source of funds they favour tomorrow. Mr John Patten, education secretary, will address them on the topic today. Mr Patten yesterday said: 'I do think there's a very strong moral argument for saying that those who benefit from higher education through a lifetime should make a contribution.'</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EARNINGS  </P> <P> PS Group: The San Diego-based firm reported a $4.8-million net loss for the  fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, contrasted with a $1.7-million net loss during  the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 27% to $64.6 million, up from  $50.5 million.  </P> <P> PS Group reported a $2.9-million net profit for the year ended Dec. 31,  contrasted with $44.1 million in net income for the previous year. The 1988 net  income figure included a gain from the termination of PS Group's pension plan.  Revenue fell to $264 million for the year ended Dec. 31, down from $331 million  a year ago.  </P> <P> PS Group's revenue was hurt during the fourth quarter by lower airline ticket  prices that produced lower average commissions. PS Group also reported a pretax  charge to earnings of $5 million "for the writedown of the carrying value of  certain high-yield securities held in the company's investment portfolio,"  according to a spokesman.  </P> <P> The writedown was linked to a January bankruptcy filing by Allied and Federated  department stores, which issued securities held by PS Group. The writedown was  required because of the "substantial decline" in the high-yield, or junk bond,  securities.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A March 10 article on the dismissal of charges against two brothers arrested in  connection with an alleged money laundering operation in the Los Angeles  jewelry district incorrectly reported that evidence linking them had been based  on FBI wiretaps. The wiretaps cited by the government against Hagop Etmekjian  and his brother, Garbis, actually were conducted by the federal Drug  Enforcement Administration.  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Brussels says EU recovery getting stronger Economic recovery in the European Union is growing in strength, particularly in manufacturing industry. This is the principal conclusion of the European Commission's business and consumer surveys for July. Confidence among consumers and industrial managers has risen. New orders are up. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing is at 80.4 per cent, up from 77.2 per cent in the trough during the third quarter of 1993. The overall indicator of economic sentiment - which aggregates confidence within industry and construction, consumer confidence and movements in share prices - rose between June and July in all member states for which the index was calculated, with the exception of Italy, where it remained unchanged. All member states, including Italy, have shown marked improvements in economic sentiment since the end of 1993. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing has also been rising this year in virtually all member states. In the EU's leading economy, Germany, the increase has been from 78.5 per cent in the third quarter of 1993 to 81.9 in the third quarter of this year. Over the same period the rise in France was from 78.9 to 84 per cent; in Spain, from 71.1 to 74 per cent; in Italy, from 74.3 to 75.4 per cent; and in the UK, from 80.4 to 84.3 per cent. Despite this tightening, the balance of the respondents to the Commission's inquiries who expect capacity in manufacturing to be sufficient over the next 12 months was still plus 24 per cent in the third quarter of 1994, although this marked a fall from plus 39 per cent a year before. Strong improvements have also been registered during 1994 in new orders in manufacturing and in expectations of future export volume. For the EU as a whole, the balance of managers reporting a rise in new orders was plus 17 per cent up in the third quarter, a big swing from the minus 13 per cent fall in the third quarter of 1993. Similarly, the balance reporting improvements in export volume expectations was plus 17 per cent in the third quarter, up from a decline of minus 9 per cent in the third quarter of last year. In both of these cases, improvements have also been reported in all member states. The news, in fact, is good in almost all the areas covered by the survey of manufacturing industry. In the EU as a whole, the balance of those reporting an improving trend of activity compared with the preceding month, for example, was plus 12 per cent in July, compared with minus 3 per cent in the last quarter of 1993. Also important, however, was the positive balance of those expecting an improvement in selling-prices, at 15 per cent in July, up from 13 per cent in June and zero in the last quarter of 1993.</p>

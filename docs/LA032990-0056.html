			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> San Diego will conduct a six-month test in residential areas to determine  whether speed bumps control speeders.  </P> <P> The City Council's Transportation and Land Use Committee on Monday approved  spending $12,000 to install the bumps on two streets in Skyline and Paradise  Hills.  </P> <P> The bumps are typically 3 inches high, 4 feet wide and 12 feet long. Thousand  Oaks, Pasadena and Sacramento have undertaken similar projects.  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt expects the bumps to be an inexpensive alternative to  using police to chase speeders.  </P></p>

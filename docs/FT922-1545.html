			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (5): A poor return on their metal - The Central Banks THE jury has been out on gold's monetary role since Lord Keynes described it nearly 50 years ago as 'a barbarous relic'. Until 1968 the verdict seemed to be going against the indestructible yellow metal as the successful defence of an official valuation of Dollars 35 a troy ounce condemned it to a wasting role as a reserve asset. But then the freeing of the price and the accelerating rise in the 1970s threw new light on the case. By 1980 Mr Irwin Shisko, a leading New York bullion analyst was telling a conference of the American Mining Conference: 'Gold is now the world's single most important reserve asset'. That was gold's glory year, when the London price ranged between Dollars 474 and a record Dollars 850 an ounce. At the year's average of Dollars 614 an ounce the 35,000 tonnes in official hands were worth nearly Pounds 700bn, close to 70 per cent of the western world's reserves. The price is now not much more than half that level and the central banks' attitude seems to have been adjusted accordingly. The central banks and other official financial institutions remained buyers of gold until the late 1980s, according to the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy group, which estimated at the beginning of last year that their net purchases in the four years from 1985 amounted to more than 650 tonnes. But it put their net sales at 155 tonnes in 1989 and 62 tonnes in 1990. Moreover, it suggested that the 1990 figure should properly be put at about 120 tonnes because Japanese reserves had temporarily been inflated by the purchase of 60 tonnes for commemorative coins to be minted in 1991. Some of this gold was bought from central banks in Canada, Belgium and possibly France, APMA said. By the middle of last year the value of central banks' gold reserves was down to Dollars 368bn, said Mr Ricky Hall, assistant general manager of the Bank of International Settlements. That represented a fall of 47 per cent from the 1980 level. The banks were getting a poor return on this metal, he said. Even at a modest compound interest rate of 6 per cent gold bought 10 years earlier at Dollars 459.25 an ounce should have been worth Dollars 823 an ounce, instead of the Dollars 361.20 ruling at the time. He suggested that central bankers who were worried that they could not put their gold holdings to work for fear of causing shame or a political loss of face, should consider setting up a form of mutual fund which would hold some of their gold reserves in good delivery form only in physical locations of its own choice. 'The fund would need to have access to the currencies it needed by borrowing or doing swaps in its own name,' he said. 'By going through the fund any embarrassment which a central bank might feel about mobilising its gold directly in the market place could be overcome.' According to Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland, many central banks have found ways of mobilising their gold holdings without embarrassment. 'Up to 800 tonnes of official gold may be in circulation in the interbank gold market on any given day, equivalent to half the western world's mine supply . . . unsurprisingly this 'easy gold' policy has kept the cost of borrowing gold very low,' he said. Mr Smith foresaw the central banks becoming an increasingly bearish influence on the gold market. 'It is reasonable to expect the banks to become net sellers of about 700 tonnes a year from the mid-1990s.' Gold's monetary role was 'now history for private investors and central banks. Selling gold would be just part of a day's work for a central bank, not an admission that the financial world as investors know it was about to end'. Mr Smith calculated that if the eight countries that between them accounted for more than 85 per cent of central bank gold were to sell all their gold and reinvest the proceeds in interest-bearing paper, the combined annual return, in perpetuity, would be Dollars 21bn. 'On a per capita basis,' he added, 'the annual dividend would be impressive enough to catch the eye of the most well-to-do tax payer.' Mr Smith made that calculation about six month's ago. At the time of writing nearly Dollars 1bn has been knocked off the potential combined yield. Although such an extreme course was not to be expected Mr Smith said that central bankers were certainly under pressure to include gold sales in their gold mobilisation policies. For example, as part of a recent revised treatment of US net international indebtedness the US Commerce Department had revalued US gold reserves at market prices rather than the still official Dollars 42 an ounce. 'Clearly, an unrealised asset value of over Dollars 80bn has not completely escaped US official attention.' Mr Smith noted that a single European central bank would control 40 per cent of the world's official gold reserves, while 'a single European currency reduces the principal need for reserves of any kind - intervention in currency markets'. So the rescue of the Maastricht agreement could be bad news for holders of gold. This is especially so if, as Mr Smith suggested was possible, EC member states, seeing that a Eurobank could economise on all reserves made 'pre-emptive strikes, liquidating gold and currency reserves to the benefit of tax-payers before the ink is dry on Eurobank statutes'.</p>

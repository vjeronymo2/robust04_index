			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Matra awarded missile contract The French Defence Ministry yesterday awarded Matra a FFr2bn (Pounds 230m) contract to develop a long-range cruise missile, eventually giving France the equivalent of the Tomahawk, which the US used against Baghdad in the 1991 Gulf war. Matra Defense-Espace, part of the Lagardere group, plans to develop the subsonic 'stealth' cruise missile, with a range of 400-600km, using some of the technology from its shorter-range Apache missile already being producing with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany. Matra, which is negotiating to merge its missile business with that of British Aerospace, also hopes to interest the UK Ministry of Defence in a derivative of the cruise missile. The UK has invited offers for its programme for the Conventional Armament Stand Off Missile, an air-to-surface missile with a range of nearly 400km, and Mr Noel Forgeard, head of Matra Defense, said yesterday that his company would propose a scaled-down version of the French cruise missile to the UK. The French cruise missile, which could cost a total of FFr5bn-FFr10bn, was the only big new programme written into the 1995-2000 military spending framework programme approved earlier this year. Matra beat Aerospatiale for the development, but the latter company will be a subcontractor on the cruise missile's development and was yesterday awarded another FFr2bn contract to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile.</p>

Nevertheless, something very important  remained: No weariness could prevent a few of us from traveling  to the city of Santiago de Cuba to commemorate this anniversary.  Today we celebrate a most memorable day of our history.    First of all, the meeting of the triumphant troops with the  people -- those the Yankees would not allow in 1898. In a very  unfair move they prohibited the Mambisas troops from entering  the city of Santiago de Cuba. That 1 January was not only  memorable for that event, which took place in the city of  Santiago de Cuba, a day that served to define whether or not a  revolution was to take place. That day defined whether our  country would be absolutely and truly independent.    Crucial events took place on that day: In the pre-dawn hours  a coup d'etat was staged to scuttle the revolution's triumph.  On that day again, the current Santiago de Cuba Province played  a decisive role. That same morning, from the city of Palma  Soriano, the order was issued to all rebel troops to continue  advancing. Instructions were given to the Camilo [Cienfuegos]  and the Che [Guevara] columns to advance rapidly on the capital.    Instructions were sent to the city of Santiago de Cuba for  the people to be prepared to support the forces that were coming  to liberate this city. A call was made for a revolutionary  general strike, which paralyzed the whole country. Such was the  revolution's overwhelming popular force that the troops  stationed at the garrison in Santiago de Cuba placed themselves  under the unconditional orders of the rebel forces that very  night.... [pauses] or that very afternoon. That day we achieved  what we were unable to achieve on 26 July 1953. In the evening,  the whole city joined the thousands of rebel soldiers and the  soldiers who had defended the tyrant up until the previous day.  They came together to form an impressive force capable of  crushing any form of resistance that could arise anywhere else  in the country. There was, however, no such resistance anywhere  in the country. The forces of the enemy joined the rebels  everywhere and the people rose in arms. Meanwhile, the invading  forces completed their missions, reaching La Cabana and Columbia  fortresses.    For the first time in our history, the people held the  weapons in their hands, as so seldom has happened before in this  hemisphere. We were able to speak of revolution for the first  time. That night, from this same balcony, we spoke of true  revolution. [applause]    Many of the principles we have followed during these 35  years  were proclaimed that night. It was said then that for the first  time there would be a revolution of the people, by the people,  for the people.    Injustices would be ended. There would be true equality,  brotherhood, and freedom for the people for the first time in  the history of our country.    I remember some of things we said back then, and I will try  to recall them. We said that men of the revolution could also  make mistakes, but these men would never betray their  principles. We said the men of the revolution would be honest;  that the men of the revolution would never abandon the ideas our  generation and the generation that preceded us had fought for so  much.    That date and that night, because of their importance, will  constitute a page in our history that will never be erased.    The wars of 1868 and 1895 began precisely here in Santiago  de  Cuba, a town that had fought so much, had sacrificed so much,  and had shed so much blood for the dignity and independence of  the fatherland. It was here in Santiago de Cuba and in the  eastern provinces where the heroic history of Santiago was  written. It was here in these eastern provinces where there  were so many deeds by brilliant combatants and heroes. It was  here in this city where Maceo, Moncada, Crombet, and so many  other patriots were born. It was here in this city where Jose  Marti came to shed his precious blood. It was here in this city  where the Moncada fighters began their struggle. It was here in  this city where the decisive events I mentioned on that 1  January occurred. It was here in this city where throughout our  generation's struggle for liberation so many pages of courage  and patriotism were written, including the 30 November uprising  and the battles waged by the people of Santiago de Cuba during  the 25 months of war waged in the eastern mountains and in the  fields of other provinces.    We had no doubt whatsoever what would happen on that 1  January. We had no doubts that we would take this city. A few  days earlier, we were forced to cease operations because after a  clash with opposing forces, they recognized their defeat and  proposed an end to the war and the beginning of the  revolutionary stage. They did not keep those agreements, and  that delayed the attack on the city a few days. On 1 January we  were forced to advance full speed on the city. The city was  well organized. There were hundreds of weapons inside the city  itself. We had no doubts whatsoever that the people of Santiago  de Cuba were to cast the final blow to tyranny. Fortunately  those battles were never fought because the sweeping force of  the revolution took over. The coup failed and optimum  conditions were created for the revolutionary victory. Thus the  city won not only enormous prestige but received the deserved  honor of being declared a hero city and decorated with the  Antonio Maceo Order. That happened 10 years ago, and we  commemorate it today. [applause] Just as we did five years ago  from this same podium, we proclaim the brave watchwords:  Socialism or Death! [applause]    Three historic anniversaries! In round figures, today we are  commemorating the 35th anniversary of the 1 January victory, the  10th anniversary of the awarding of the hero city decoration,  and the 5th anniversary of the proclamation of the slogan  Socialism or Death. I ask the people of Santiago de Cuba:  Could we have gotten by without appropriately -- albeit  austerely -- celebrating these three anniversaries today?  [crowd responds: "No"] Would the people of Santiago, the  elderly and the young alike, have gone without this very  deserved honor? [crowd responds: "No"] Could there be a  better time than this to express our deepest conviction and our  most unbending revolutionary spirit? [crowd responds: "No"]    What a beautiful poem was recited here today! For a moment  I thought someone had written it for this occasion. I asked our  comrade here for the author's name, and she said Navarro Luna  wrote it in 1970. [applause] What intuition, what foresight to  have written these concepts in such beautiful words, so adequate  and so appropriate for moments such as this, 23 years later.    People of Santiago de Cuba, we have fought hard and we have  fought for a long time. Our forefathers fought for over 100  years in a long, bloody battle. There were difficult setbacks  such as the events of the war of 1868, which never ended in  glory. After ten years of excruciating battles that almost  drained the patriots of their strength, there came something  that honors us and makes us proud: the Baragua protest, an  expression of our will to continue the struggle.    It was a hard, a very hard blow to the country because,  when we had practically defeated the Spanish forces, the  imperialists' intervention deprived us of our victory and again  made us a colony. It was hard, very hard to accept the results  and frustrations of the struggle of our workers, students, and  Cuban revolutionaries in the 1930's as they ended up returning  to neo- colonialism and the worst forms of political chicanery.  However, one day we did achieve victory. This is the day we  are commemorating here in Cespedes Park in Santiago de Cuba.  Our reason for doing so is amply justified and righteous  because this is a park that honors the patriot who started to  fight on 10 October 1888. See how history blends and adjusts  itself. You can even see this in history's symbols.    Yes, the struggle has been a long one. However, the struggle  is not over yet. We mention 35 years, but what have those 35  years meant? They have been 35 years of struggle and  enthusiastic work by the people. They have been 35 years of  building classrooms and graduating teachers and professors,  ultimately helping us become the country with the largest number  of teachers and professors per capita in the world. They have  been 35 years of building medical centers, hospitals, general  hospitals, and specialized hospitals, as well as regular  schools; schools for the handicapped; and art, music, dancing,  painting schools. I was saying that these have been 35 years of  preparing medical doctors. In fact, we were left with only  3,000 doctors 35 years ago, and now have more than 50,000. We  are probably also one of the countries and, perhaps, the sole  country with the largest number of medical doctors per capita in  the world.    It has been 35 years working to encourage education and  culture -- education which was able to multiply several times  the number of universities in the country, as well as multiply  the number of technical schools several hundred times. We have  been able to turn out thousands of university professionals. We  have been able to reach educational levels unsurpassed by very  few countries in the world. In addition, we have been able to  establish health standards unsurpassed by very few countries  worldwide. It is enough to say that during 1993, even while we  going through the harshest moment of the special period, we were  able to lower the infant mortality rate to below 10 [for every  1,000 live births]. What will the world say about this? What  will the world say about a country which, despite being  ruthlessly blockaded, and at the same time undergoing very  special conditions, has been able to lower infant mortality  below 10? An infant mortality rate which just a few days ago  was 9.4. The infant mortality rate in the city of Santiago de  Cuba was at a level of 8 for every 1,000 live births. This was  just a few days ago! What will the world say when not one  single woman died during delivery in the municipality of  Santiago de Cuba? [applause].    It has been 35 years of building dams, canals, highways,  roads, all sorts of agricultural installations, diary farms,  chicken farms, and livestock fattening farms. It has been 35  years of establishing farms, agricultural cooperatives, and  credit and service cooperatives. It has been 35 years of  mechanizing the country to allow sugar cane, which at one time  was cut by thousands of starving workers, to now be cut with  machines. It has been 35 years of mechanizing agriculture to  carry out field work in a more humane manner. It has been 35  years of mechanizing construction activity, expanding ports, and  building wharfs and terminals to handle sugar in bulk. We have  also built piers with modern derricks that allow us to use  modern loading and unloading systems at our ports.    It has been 35 years of mechanizing crops such as rice,  which in the past was done by hand. It has been 35 years of  building all kinds of factories and industries, 35 years of  installing electrical plants and electrifying the country until  we were able to provide electricity for 95 percent of the  population. It has been 35 years of developing our people's  culture and artistic talent, 35 years of building sports  installations and developing our country's sports talent, making  it accessible to the workers' children. It has been 35 years of  building multi-family housing projects and houses, 35 years of  building aqueducts and sewers according to our means, and 35  years of developing transportation. It has been 35 years of  developing the material part of our country's economy.    We were not working for the privileged or the rich. Those  who graduated from our universities were generally the children  of peasants and workers -- those who became teachers,  professors, engineers or doctors; those who went to live in the  houses built by the revolution; those who assumed  responsibilities and posts were these children.    The revolution did not only work for material things,  however. The revolution also worked hard for spiritual things.  First of all, it eliminated loathsome racial discrimination.  It tirelessly fought to eliminate discrimination against women.  It tirelessly fought to create equal opportunities and rights  for everyone. It fought to guarantee a retirement or pension  for every elderly person. Even those who had not been workers  always received the state's support. The exploitation of man by  man has truly ended in our country. [applause].    Political chicanery, in all of its expressions, also ended.  The revolution fought to dignify man and the fatherland. The  revolution fought for justice -- not only in domestic policy but  also in foreign policy. Noble and generous, Cuba dispatched the  aid of its teachers and doctors to so many corners of the world.  Noble and generous, Cuba found it in itself to offer its blood  in support of the just causes of other nations around the world.  I believe and am absolutely convinced that there has never been  a more noble and generous revolutionary political process than  our revolutionary political process. We played our part as  patriots, we played our part as internationalists, and we joined  our forces with the most progressive forces of the world. We  have defended our sovereign rights and our independence with  extraordinary dignity. We have been willing to give our blood  and our lives -- without the slightest doubt -- to defend our  ideas, to defend our cause, and to defend our fatherland.  [applause]    Who has accomplished more in less time? Who has accomplished  more and with such consistency and determination than we have?  What revolutionary political process has stayed more loyal to  its principles that ours? However, we have been witnesses to  tragic events: the truly embarrassing manner in which the  socialist bloc crumbled and the truly embarrassing way in which  the USSR disintegrated along with those processes that were the  result of colossal sacrifices by the people. They were the  result of colossal efforts and colossal acts of heroism. It  would seem that history was envious of the glories of our people  and wanted to submit us to even more severe trials. What are we  doing now but defending 35 years of revolution?    What can we do today other than defend the fruits of more  than 100 years of struggle? What can we do today other than  defend not only the rights of the past and current generations,  but also the rights of the future generations? When we say that  we defend the country, the revolution, and the principles of  socialism, we are not only talking about ourselves, but also  about the future generations who will recount our struggles and  our proficiency in surmounting the enormous obstacles we face  today. What can we do other than try to be consistent with our  history?    In 1993, we have undoubtably gone through the most difficult  year of the revolution, but we have done so with dignity and  courage. [applause] Navarro Luna [author of poem read earlier  in the ceremony] has already mentioned the weak [flojos] and  told them to get out of the way. As we have said on other  occasions, it is easy to be a revolutionary during good times.  It is not easy, however, to be a revolutionary during difficult  times. [applause] Those of us who are meeting here are  revolutionaries of difficult times. The champions of 1868 and  1895 -- Moncada and Granma. [applause] They were champions who  were able to make our fatherland what it is today. They were  champions who had confidence in their country and their people.  They were champions who had confidence in man and in man's  courage and heroism. Once again, when I say man, I am referring  to mankind, which of course includes -- and, rightfully so --  women. [applause]    Throughout its history, our country has confronted many  difficult times. Nevertheless, our country never had such a  large contingent of men and women with such an elevated  revolutionary culture or such a large contingent of men and  women with such a profound and solid revolutionary culture.  [applause] For this reason, the weak will never be able to  discourage us. For this reason, the weak will never be able to  demoralize us. We will pull through, just as we have done  during other difficult times. We are capable of pulling through  this, which is the most difficult moment of our history.  [applause] Instead of becoming discouraged, we must feel proud  of being witnesses and participants of these pages in the  history of our fatherland.    What are we up against? We are up against the most powerful  empire on earth! When the socialist camp and the Soviet Union  fell, the imperialist bloc, in a display of repugnant  opportunism, decided to become more tyrannical and ruthless  toward us. They simply want to make us surrender at any cost.  They cannot stand the thought of a country in the world with  our people's honor, dignity, and courage. [applause] They  cannot tolerate that a country such as ours can resist in the  face of the mandates of the hegemonic power to which so many bow  today. They cannot tolerate that we are the standard bearers of  the most just, noble, and human ideals. Yes, we must say  categorically: There has not been a more noble or humanitarian  revolution than the Cuban Revolution. [applause] It is a  revolution whose behavior -- from the moment we respected the  first Moncada prisoners up until today, 35 years later -- has  not had a single blemish. Our behavior has been irreproachable  in every respect. There is no other political process as clean  as ours.    It is truly incredible that those who were the allies; those  who in this hemisphere made thousands of people disappear; those  who, in Central America, were the allies and supporters of those  who killed thousands of people, most of whom turned up missing;  those who were the allies of the South Africans; those who  destroyed the revolution in Nicaragua with their dirty war;  those who invaded small countries to impose their interests and  their laws; and those who loot the world -- these are the same  people who are trying to blemish the clean and honorable history  of the purest of revolutions, and we can shout it out loud: It  is the Cuban Revolution! [applause]    We know we are defending those values and all the other  values we mentioned tonight, because we know that we are doing  the most noble and just thing in the world. For this reason, we  have strength and energy to resist and to fight.    We have just ended our toughest year, and if we do  everything we should -- our duty -- with the utmost efficiency,  we shall start reversing the situation bit by bit. Only a  demagogue or a charlatan could tell his people that these  difficulties are slight and the enormous obstacles that lie  ahead will be easily won. We say yes, they will be won, but  with much sacrifice, work, and struggle. Right now we are  already involved in a new stage: Sugar production will not be  much greater than last year's, but it must be greater  nonetheless. That would be proof that we have reversed the  situation. We are already in full harvest time; we cannot lose  a week, a day, an hour, or a minute. We cannot allow the  harvest to be delayed. Any delays in the harvest would bring  forth a new set of problems and difficulties.    We cannot allow delays in sugarcane planting and harvesting  and other crops in general. We should not fail in a single  activity that we need to face up to. It has been very difficult  to produce sugarcane and harvest it in a country where  everything has been mechanized and yet suffers from a great fuel  shortage, with a nearly total shortage of fertilizers,  pesticides, spares, tires, and so on, and so on. We are  nevertheless doing it. We are managing to do it with the  people's creativity and imagination and with a great effort to  conserve.    It is our duty not only to reverse the situation but to  develop despite the very difficult conditions of today's world  -- conditions I will not speak about at this event; despite the  tragic destiny that is in store for Third World countries; and  despite the increasing plundering and exploitation that is  foreseen. We must be sufficiently strong, determined, and  capable not only to overcome the specific obstacles that befell  us when the socialist bloc collapsed and the blockade became  more severe but to overcome the objective obstacles of today's  world.    Comrades, I trust we will be able to do this. Comrades of  Santiago and revolutionaries throughout Cuba -- you, too, will  be able to do this. [applause] This is the moment, Comrades,  when we must transform ourselves into a nation of giants.  Everyone of us must become a giant, and all of us together must  turn out more giants such as Jose Marti. We must turn out  giants such as Antonio and Jose Maceo, giants such as Carlos  Manuel de Cespedes, giants such as Maximo Gomez, giants such as  Ignacio Agramonte, giants such as Mella, giants such as Frank  Paiz, giants such as Camilo and Che. [applause]    We must be capable of repeating what we did on 1 January  1959  and once again confront all of the challenges we face ahead.  Without any doubt, the greatest obstacle has been that there  has been a world dominated by an empire. If not the entire  world, then there has been a continent completely dominated by  an empire. That same empire has attempted to counter the  revolution but has been unable to destroy it. It has been  unable to make our people grovel. It has been unable and will  never be able to conquer us. [applause]    If there is one thing we can say today, it is that the  greatest accomplishment the Cuban people have been able to  achieve above all other nations in the history of the world is  that we have been able challenge the empire. We have been able  to resist that empire for 35 years. The empire already knows we  are defending values that are very sacred, and we are defending  hopes we will never renounce -- hopes for which we  revolutionaries are willing to go our graves. Maceo already  expressed it quite well once: Very well, if they do not die  while attempting to take over Cuba. [applause]    Viva the Hero City of Santiago de Cuba! Viva the purest of  all revolutions! Socialism or death! Free fatherland or death!  [applause]</p>

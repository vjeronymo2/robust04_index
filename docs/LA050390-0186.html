			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE COPTER ROLLS OVER; OFFICERS UNHURT  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles police officers escaped injury Wednesday when their helicopter  rolled over during takeoff from a La Verne airfield, police said.  </P> <P> The Bell 206 JetRanger, one of the older helicopters in the department's fleet,  was taking off from Brackett Field when the accident occurred, Sgt. Brent Carey  said.  </P> <P> Officers Bob Kercy and Bud Nowell, who were on board the aircraft, were not  hurt, but "there was extensive damage to the airframe," Carey said.  </P> <P> No financial estimate of the damage was available.  </P> <P> Department officials have been trying to update the helicopter fleet, saying  that many of the crafts are too old for use. The helicopter involved in  Wednesday's accident will be rebuilt, Carey added.  </P></p>

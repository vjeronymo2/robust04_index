			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Personal View: Private sector key to Africa's future The Financial Times's recent supplement on sub-Saharan Africa ('Africa; A continent at stake', September 1) performed a service for everyone concerned with development. At a time when the world's attention is diverted to the dramatic changes taking place in other areas, it is vital that the magnitude of the development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa is not forgotten. Half the region's 600m people live in absolute poverty. It is the only region where the number of poor people would - if current trends are not reversed - increase by the year 2000, where population is doubling every 20 years, and external debt exceeds gross domestic product. Indeed, the future of the continent is 'at stake'. However, Africa is also changing. We are all familiar with the evolving political transformation in South Africa. Not so well known is the fundamental change in economic policies which has been taking place across much of sub-Saharan Africa. This has been a 'quiet revolution', with more than 30 countries undertaking adjustment programmes aimed at increasing productivity and growth. The intensity and success of their reforms have varied, and more time will be required before definitive results emerge. However, there are signs of progress. Benin, Burundi, the Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda are among a group of countries - supported under a special programme of assistance co-ordinated by the World Bank - that has achieved growth rates double the region's average, tripled output in the critical agricultural sector, and reversed the decline in exports. There remains a long way to go. But these results indicate that in Africa - as in East Asia or Latin America - adjustment to economic realities produces economic results. Now is not the time for Africa to slow down its reform efforts. On the contrary, they must be accelerated. Many countries have taken the first macroeconomic steps. Africa now needs to underpin them with a 'second generation' of reforms - to encourage the private sector, and to build its human and institutional capacities. About 350m new jobs will be needed in sub-Saharan Africa within a generation. Only the private sector - free to allocate resources and respond to market signals - can create employment and incomes on this scale. And only the private sector can provide Africa with the access it needs to investment, know-how and technology. The message is clear: the movement toward a 'market-friendly' approach must be broadened and deepened. It is Africa's only hope of competing in the global economy of the 21st century. Educated and healthy people - and competent institutions - are also essential. In this regard providers of aid to Africa have a major responsibility. The international community needs to re-examine the quality of its assistance effort - and its overall development effectiveness. Donors cannot be satisfied that external technical assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has increased over the last decade and now stands at about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) a year. Nor can they be satisfied that an estimated 100,000 expatriate 'advisers' are at work in Africa today, a larger number than at independence. At the same time - and as the FT pointed out - Africa knows that the 'rules of the aid game' have changed in the post-cold war era. The competition for resources has never been greater. Aid budgets are being scrutinised and, in some cases, cut. Countries that cannot show they are using aid effectively - and that means good governance as well as good economic policy - will lose it. The World Bank is one of Africa's strongest supporters in its development efforts. Evidence of this is the wide range of initiatives we have undertaken as well as the volume of our lending. But we don't have all the resources required. And we don't have all the answers. Our partners in the donor community have a crucial role to play. Non-government organisations are vital at the grass roots. And the private sector holds the key to providing the bulk of future investment. However, the principal responsibility for Africa's development rests with Africa and its leaders. They must adopt the right policies, inspire confidence in investors, and motivate their peoples. Many African nations have started to change in the right direction. The international community must support them. The author is president of the World Bank</p>

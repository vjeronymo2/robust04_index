			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by Diplomatic </F> Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry is not inclined to  attach too much importance to Ukrainian officials' statements  advocating a revision of the Massandra agreements on the Black  Sea Fleet, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax.    He said that these statements must not be taken seriously  because they were made "in the heat" of the election campaign in  Crimea.    To quote the diplomat, in Massandra the Russian and  Ukrainian  presidents agreed that the Black Sea Fleet would be Russian.  "The talk about changes in Ukraine's official position and about  a roll- back to the Yalta agreements, according to which the  Black Sea Fleet was equally divided between Russian and Ukraine,  might be resumed only if President Kravchuk made a corresponding  statement," he said.    Russia will not depart from the Massandra agreements, a  high-  ranking Defense Ministry official told Interfax.    He said that the Defense Ministry continued work on new  agreements that would supplement the Massandra accord.    He noted in particular that some of the actions by the  Ukrainian side contradict with these agreements. "Thus, on  Wednesday, February 2, the Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev sent a response to his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaly  Radetsky in which he opposed Kiev's initiative to institute the  post of commander of the Sevastopol military district," he said.  "Why should we institute a separate post if it is already  occupied by the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard  Baltin, nominated by the presidents of the two countries?"    "Suppose we resumed the discussion of the fleet division.  What then? Even in better times Kiev financed only 16 percent  of the Black Sea Fleet's needs. Ukraine cannot afford the Black  Sea Fleet and will auction it off. It is also clear that this  will not benefit either Russia's or Ukraine's defense  capability," he said.</p>

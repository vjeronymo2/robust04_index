			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on arbitrage buying Tokyo ARBITRAGE buying pushed share prices higher for the first time in four days in trading dominated by the expiration of May options, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 128.71 ahead at 26,438.50 after a day's low of 26,290.36 and a high of 26,470.36. Volume expanded to 330m shares from 270m, but most of it was arbitrage-related. Advances led declines by 522 to 392, with 201 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 2.81 to 1,989.85, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.47 to 1,503.03. Investors again focused on second-liners for quick profits, while rumours of new regulations on over-the-counter trading aroused interest in medium-sized and small stocks listed on regional stock exchanges. Mr Hiroyuki Maki at County NatWest Securities said this new interest could grow. 'Speculative interest has shifted away from the first section following the 5 per cent disclosure rule on shareholdings,' he said. The overnight gain on Wall Street and the strong US book-to-bill ratio sparked buying in electricals and precision machinery makers. Nikon added Y40 at Y1,430. Dainippon Screen, a semiconductor maker, advanced Y40 to Y1,740. Nihon Nohyaku, the agrochemical group which has risen recently on rumours of speculative buying, receded Y120 to Y2,420. The Tokyo Stock Exchange raised the margin requirement on the stock from 30 per cent to 50 per cent to counter its volatility. Issues expected to benefit from Japan Railway's capital investment were recommended by Japanese brokerages. Nippon Densetsu, a track and signals installation company, moved ahead Y70 to Y2,010 and Totetsu Kogyo, a track maker, added Y120 at Y1,380. Nissan Motor fell Y17 to Y768 on reports that its pre-tax profits for the current year would decline 38 per cent. Other automobile issues also lost ground. Shibusawa Warehouse gained Y100 to Y1,180 on favourable profit projections thanks to rising real estate earnings. Takuma, a boiler maker, rose initially on reports that it had developed a system which reduces poisonous dioxine from garbage incinerators, but ended a net Y20 down at Y1,240 after late profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 58.40 to 29,126.92 on volume of 23.5m shares. Investors sought small-capital issues with good earnings forecasts. Tachibana Shokai, a retailer for Mitsubishi Electric, rose Y110 to Y3,560 on expectations that strong growth in the electronic information equipment business would boost profits. Issues listed in Nagoya were sought. U. Store, a supermarket chain, climbed Y160 to Y2,770 and Eidensha, an electric appliance retailer, firmed Y50 to Y1,500. Roundup MANY Pacific Rim markets failed to hold on to early gains yesterday. AUSTRALIA was knocked off the day's high by disappointing April unemployment data. The All Ordinaries index lost an early gain of nine points to close up just 0.6 at 1,546.3. Turnover increased to ADollars 307m from ADollars 294m. Bundaberg Sugar gained 6 cents to ADollars 3.84. After the close, Tate &amp; Lyle said it was extending its offer for the company by three weeks. Leighton lost 4 cents to ADollars 1.30 on news of a one-for-four rights issue and a placement of new shares. MANILA ended mixed as profit-taking curtailed a strong performance. Philippine Long Distance Telephone led the market higher, closing up 20 pesos at 517.50 pesos after gaining Dollars 1.13 to Dollars 19.36 on the American Stock Exchange. The composite index advanced 5.07 to 1,118.50 in turnover of 239.3m pesos, up from 108.6m. TAIWAN was boosted by reports of Japanese institutional buying, targeted at banks and property shares. The weighted index climbed 132.57 or 2.2 per cent to 6,305.22 in turnover of TDollars 76.9bn, against TDollars 95.9bn. Plastic issues rose on reports that China had agreed to Formosa Plastics Group's proposal to set up a petrochemical complex in the Chinese province of Fujian. NEW ZEALAND resumed its rally on renewed foreign demand after Wednesday's profit-taking. The Barclays index moved up 11.95 to 1,568.49 as block sales raised turnover to NZDollars 38m from NZDollars 20m. A block of 13.6m Asian Properties shares - 18 per cent of the investment company's capital - was traded at 97 cents apiece. SEOUL rebounded after its recent weakness, though anti-government protests kept investors on the sidelines. The composite stock index closed at 634.72, up 3.60 on steady turnover of Won81.5bn. BANGKOK rose on speculative buying of stocks similar to four new issues due to be floated today. The SET index gained 5.32 to 853.99 in thin trading worth 3.53bn baht. SINGAPORE fell back from an early climb. The Straits Times Industrial index closed up 2.59 at 1,525.74 after volume of 46.15m shares (41.57m). KUALA LUMPUR surrendered part of an early rise, the composite index ending 3.02 up at 584.96 after 32.7m shares traded (29.6m). HONG KONG's Hang Seng index eased 3.34 to 3,744.46 in turnover down to HKDollars 948m from HKDollars 1.15bn.</p>

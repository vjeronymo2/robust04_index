			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: PUTTING SKIDS ON SLIPPERY TRANSMISSION  </P> <P> Question: My wife's 1984 Buick developed a bothersome problem at 43,000 miles.  Its automatic transmission slips. Under a heavy load, it seems to be  free-wheeling or unable to downshift. For example, when she attempts to drive  up our steep entrance drive, the car is left in a state of suspension. It  finally catches hold and she moves up. It happens at stoplights as well.  </P> <P> The Buick dealer speaks glibly about the need for a new transmission. I wonder  if their diagnosis is accurate or whether there is something else that a  less-than-wealthy motorist could do. -- A.B.  </P> <P> Answer: Welcome to the wonderful world of GM transmissions from the mid-1980s.  Your transmission is designated a 125c, and you can take consolation in the  fact that it is a lot more reliable than a GM 440 transmission, but not quite  as reliable as a hot-water heater.  </P> <P> A brief delay between the time you step on the accelerator and the time the car  begins to move may be normal for this transmission. It seems that when the  transmission is cold, fluid can drain out of the torque converter and  momentarily disconnect the engine from the transmission. It takes a few moments  for the transmission pump to refill the torque converter, which is the clutch  an automatic transmission uses.  </P> <P> But it is unlikely that this is the problem, because this chiefly occurs when  you first start the car. Nonetheless, you should check the transmission fluid  level, because a low fluid level can exacerbate this condition. If the fluid is  low, you should examine to see whether it is oxidized. It will look burned and  have a burnt smell. If this is the case, you have more serious problems.  </P> <P> It is possible that the forward clutches on the transmission are shot. If you  suspect the clutches, the transmission needs to be torn down and inspected. But  it may not need a full rebuild. In fact, replacing the clutches can be done in  about 10 standard hours of labor, which is a whole lot less than a total  overhaul would require.  </P> <P> On a final note, you might want to look into GM's Service Replace Transmission  Assembly or SRTA. These are fully rebuilt transmissions that you buy off the  shelf and have installed by the dealer. The GM 125c transmission is just now  being offered under the SRTA program. I don't have a price for the 125c, but  the 440s were being offered for $1,200.  </P> <P> Q: I have a 1984 Dodge Aries with a four-cylinder engine that refuses to start  when it is hot unless I push the accelerator to the floor. What can I do? --  B.C.  </P> <P> A: Pushing the accelerator to the floor is one correct way to start a hot  engine. By pushing the accelerator to the floor, you will open the choke fully.  Otherwise, a hot engine can flood.  </P> <P>  Vartabedian cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  automotive questions of general interest. Do not telephone.

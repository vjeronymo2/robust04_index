			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CLEVELAND GETS ON-AIR APOLOGY  </P> <P> Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther Van Dam from "Coach,"  apologized on the air for having knocked Cleveland two weeks ago in a  promotional spot for the ABC comedy, and the mayor accepted.  </P> <P> The apology came in a promo as well.  </P> <P> It was aired during the "Monday Night Football" game between the Cleveland  Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals.  </P> <P> "I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love Cleveland and I love  the people in it," Van Dyke said.  </P> <P> Mayor Michael R. White replied: "The Cleveland of today and the Cleveland of 15  years ago are vastly different places. I think the apology frankly recognizes  that there has been a major improvement."  </P> <P> The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a Monday night  game between Cleveland and Denver.  </P> <P> Van Dyke, a football coach in "Coach," said in the promo, "I think the problem  with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You still got to go home to  Cleveland."  </P> <P> Earlier in the football season, a "Coach" promo made the same joke about  Buffalo, incensing residents of that city.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 30 (AFP) -- International mediators  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, briefing colleagues  Wednesday [30 March] on developments in peace talks for former  Yugoslavia, said they were pleased with progress but serious  problems still lay ahead.    The main issues remain the scope of reconstruction needed to  put the devastated region back on its feet and the maps that  must still be drawn for peace accords reached this month under  combined U.S.- Russian diplomatic pressure.    "The pattern is encouraging, but now the crucial thing is  the  map," European Union negotiator Owen told journalists after a  meeting of the steering committee of the Geneva Peace Conference  on former Yugoslavia, which groups around 30 countries and  organisations.    Owen, just back from weekend talks in Belgrade, said Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic was showing flexibility.    Serbia wanted to reach agreement on an effective ceasefire,  restoration of economic relations with neighbouring countries  and the lifting of the international blockade against its rump  state of Yugoslavia, he said.    The consultations came as the peace process received a boost  after Bosnian Croats and Moslems signed a federation agreement  in Washington on March 18 and Croatia and Serb separatists from  the breakaway Krajina enclave signed a ceasefire accord early  Wednesday.    "One of the most fundamental things is not to get much  delay.  This momentum is very, very important," Owen said at a press  conference, praising the involvement of the two superpowers in  the peace process.    The Bosnian Serbs are now considering whether they should  join the Croat-Moslem entente, which they feared "could be an  anti-Serb alliance," explained Owen.    U.S. special Envoy Charles Redman, who helped conclude that  agreement, should visit the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale  Wednesday or Thursday, said Owen, who thought the problem should  be resolved jointly by the United Nations, the European Union,  the United States and Russia.    Members of the Geneva steering committee, speaking about the  mammoth task of rebuilding the war-ravaged region, said it was  important that international aid efforts did not substitute for  the efforts of the countries concerned, leaving them free to arm  themselves once more.    The United States has made some aid promises but there is  little doubt that the European Union will have to shoulder the  main burden, members said.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges up despite further tension in Gulf Wall Street US SHARE prices posted modest gains across the board yesterday as investors traded cautiously against a backdrop of increased tension in the Middle East, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.08 at 3,262.75, its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 1.90 at 430.95, while the Amex composite finished 1.40 higher at 397.24. Secondary stocks outperformed the rest of the market, with the Nasdaq composite climbing 5.19 to 682.40. Trading volume on the New York SE was 218m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,097 to 707. News that Iraqi officials had called for an 'honourable holy war' against the UN allies, and that Iraqi troops had crossed the border into Kuwait for the second time in a day set the tone for an uneasy opening to trading yesterday. Investors have been unsettled by the tension in the Gulf because they fear that a renewal of hostilities between the US and its allies, and Iraq could shatter the fragile confidence consumers have regained since the presidential election and cast a cloud over the first few days and weeks of the Clinton presidency. Bargain buying in the wake of the Dow's 1.1 per cent decline last week, and a continued influx of new investor funds into equities, however, ensured that stock prices rebounded from an early decline, and stayed in positive territory for the rest of the session. Among individual stocks, IBM rallied from the previous week's losses, rising Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 in volume of 2.7m shares. Other big technology stocks were also firmer, with Motorola up Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 112 3/4 , Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 2 at Dollars 72 3/4 , Digital Equipment Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 35 1/4 and Compaq Dollars 2 1/4 higher at Dollars 50 1/2 . Sunbeam-Oster fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 on the news that Mr Paul Kazarian, chairman of the consumer products company, had been unexpectedly sacked by the board of directors over the weekend. At least one broking house, PaineWebber, immediately downgraded the stock on the news, citing the short-term uncertain outlook for the company following Mr Kazarian's departure. EXEL fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 44 in response to a disappointing set of fourth quarter profits, slightly below the Dollars 76.7m the Bermuda-based insurance company earned a year ago. Nantucket Industries dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 12 on the American Stock Exchange after the company reported fiscal third quarter earnings of 18 cents a share, only slightly higher than a year ago and below market expectations. Canada TORONTO SHARE prices ended steady in active trading. The 300 composite index was down 1.57 points, or 0.05%, to 3,310.2, as advances led declines by 323 to 290. The volume of 44m shares was below Friday's 52m shares. Trading value was CDollars 371m compared with CDollars 386m. BioChem Pharma, which rose CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 20 3/4 , was one of the top picks for 1993 by a Hambrecht &amp; Quist biotechnology analyst. The analyst also believes that 1993 will be a banner year for the industry in terms of product development.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated September 29, 1992, Mr. Jim B. Wyant of Vincennes, Indiana, presented a petition for rulemaking to OSM. A ``Notice of availability of a petition to initiate rulemaking and request for comment'' was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , November 12, 1992, (57 FR 53670). After consideration of the petitioner's requests and public comments received on the petition, the Director of OSM published his ``Notice of decision on petition for rulemaking'' and stated that ``OSM will initiate Federal rulemaking proposing to revise the permit application provisions of 30 CFR 773.15 to require notification of all parties to an informal conference of any decision to require modification of the permit application. OSM will also initiate a rulemaking to revise the provisions of 30 CFR 778.15 to address the degree to which lands may be included in the permit area where the permittee does not have the right-to-enter.'' (August 24, 1993, 58 FR 44630) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Notification Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM proposes to modify 30 CFR 773.15, Review of Permit Applications at 773.15(a)(1). The sentences of this subparagraph would be redesignated as (1), (i) and (ii) with an additional sentence added as subsection (iii). The added sentence would require that the regulatory authority ``(p)rovide a copy of the written decision granting, requiring modification of, or denying the permit, and stating the specific reasons for the decision to the permit applicant and to each person who was a party to the conference.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM is proposing to revise &sect;773.15(a) because its current regulations 30 CFR 773.19(b)(1) only require the regulatory authority to provide written notification of its final decision on the permit application to all parties to an informal conference. Its regulations at &sect;773.15(a) do not, however, require the regulatory authority to provide the same notification to the same parties when that authority requires a modification of the permit application. Section 773.15(a) would, therefore, be revised to require the regulatory authority to provide parties to an informal conference the same notification of decisions modifying the permit application as for decisions approving or denying the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1979 final permanent regulations at 30 CFR 786.23(c) originally required the regulatory authority to notify all parties to an informal conference of any decision granting, modifying or denying the permit application, and stating the specific reasons therefor in the decision. (March 13, 44 FR 15381) This required notice provision was dropped without explanation in the 1983 revision of OSM's permitting regulations. (September 28, 48 FR 44371, 44395) Thus, under the current 30 part 773 regulations, and as noted by the petitioner, concerned parties who have taken an active role in the permitting process through participation in informal conferences may find that regulatory authority decisions requiring modification of the permit application are conveyed solely to the applicant. These concerned parties would receive no feedback on important permit application issues until the regulatory authority's final decision on the application is conveyed to all parties pursuant to &sect;773.19(b)(1). The proposed revisions to &sect;773.15(a) would address this inequity by reinstating the 1979 requirement that all parties to an informal conference be provided the regulatory authority's written decision granting, modifying, or denying the permit application and stating the specific reasons therefore in the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Permit Processing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In OSM's notice of decision on the petition for rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  August 24, 1993, the agency stated that it would ``initiate a rulemaking to revise the provisions of 30 CFR 778.15 to address the degree to which lands may be included in the permit area where the permittee does not have the right-to-enter.'' Later, in considering this commitment, OSM concluded that it could be more appropriately implemented by proposing revisions to &sect;773.15, Review of permit applications, and 30 CFR 773.17, Permit conditions, rather than to &sect;778.15, Right-of-entry information. Existing section 773.15 would therefore be revised to add paragraph (c)(13) requiring both that the approved permit contain only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations and that compliance with the operation and reclamation plans be based upon activities conducted solely upon such lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A new but different subparagraph &sect;773.15(c)(13) has also been proposed under the remining rulemaking. (June 2, 1994, 59 FR 28744) If both this and the remining rulemaking are finalized as proposed, the (c)(13) subparagraph of the second effective rule will be redesignated as (c)(14). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing &sect;773.17 would also be revised to be consistent with proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) and would, as a permit condition, impose a similar requirement that the permit area of an approved permit contain only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(b)(9) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1201  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , states, ``the applicant shall file with the regulatory authority on an accurate map or plan, to an appropriate scale, clearly showing the land to be affected as of the date of the application, the area of land within the permit area upon which the applicant has the legal right-to-enter and commence surface mining operations on that area affected, and whether that right is the subject of pending court litigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That nothing in this Act shall be construed as vesting in the regulatory authority the jurisdiction to adjudicate property title disputes.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and its implementing regulations are silent on the specific question of whether the approved permit can include land for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry (``uncontrolled land'') and which will not be disturbed under the permit until such right-of-entry is obtained. It has, however, been OSM's practice under its Federal and Indian lands programs to allow inclusion in the permit application of land for which the applicant can not establish right-of-entry but to prohibit inclusion of such land in the permit at the time of issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Promulgation of this Federal practice as a national rule would end the practice in a minority of approved program States of allowing inclusion in the approved permit of land for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry. The owners of such lands often complain that this inclusion clouds their title, depresses their property values, and interferes with their ability to enjoy their property rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

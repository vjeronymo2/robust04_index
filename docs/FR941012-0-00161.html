			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA safety rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these parameters, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> D. The Logging Operations Standard Complies With the Statutory Criteria Described Above and Is Not Subject to the Additional Constraints Applicable to Section 6(b)(5) Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards. (See National Grain &amp; Feed Ass'n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OSHA (NGFA II), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards subject to section 6(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational safety.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards.

Hist. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1003), and Representative Udall contrasted insidious hazards like carcinogens with ``the more visible and well-known question of industrial accidents and on-the-job injury'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leg.

As Justice Stevens observed: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances *&blank;*&blank;* was because Congress recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case, the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Benzene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , at 649 n. 54.]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example, the Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> International Union, UAW <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OSHA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between `health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported the OSHA position ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> International Union, UAW <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> International Union, UAW <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1313, citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron U.S.A., Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

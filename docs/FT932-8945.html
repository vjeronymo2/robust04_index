			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: Bruggen conducts with period passion - New recordings of Bach and Haydn Bach: St John Passion. Soloists, Netherlands Chamber Choir, Orch. of 18th Century/Frans Bruggen. Philips 434 905-2 (two CDs) Haydn: Symphonies nos 100 and 104. Orchestra of the 18th Century/Bruggen. Philips 434 096-2 (one CD) Haydn: Symphonies, Vol. 2 - nos 3, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 25, 33, 36, 108. Academy of Ancient Music/Christopher Hogwood. L'Oiseau-Lyre 436 592-2 (three CDs) FRANS Bruggen's new St John Passion recording establishes a vital pulse almost with the first note, and maintains it unflagging to the last. In the sanctimonious, top-and-bottom-heavy oratorio-style performances of yore, there were features of Bach's ever-astonishing masterpiece particularly in danger of being obliterated: highly charged atmosphere, impassioned urgency of story-telling, subsuming of elaborate form and intricate device into rapidly-unfolding dramatic action, masterly placing of the oases of lyrical reflection. Here, all are cherished. Textures are briskly clarified, rhythms and verbal accents sharply pointed. Lightness is always the aim. And yet, in contrast to other recent Bach Passion recordings on 'period' instruments and with small choral forces, the danger of miniaturising the music, of rendering it precious, denatured, detached from communal-celebratory context, is completely avoided. The degree of reverberance in the Philips recording  - it was made in the Vredenburg at Utrecht - may come at first as a surprise: but, since this aids the Netherlands Chamber Choir in maintaining a presence at once thrustful and musically sentient, clean in contrapuntal divisions and firm in overall mass, the sound-picture counts as part of the performance's strong, distinctive character. Unfortunately, the quality of solo singing undermines it. Nico van der Meel, an unaffectedly intense Evangelist, and Kristin Sigmundsson, a robust, touchingly simple Jesus, both declaim the recitatives with an apt sense of Bruggen's larger dramatic purposes. In the arias, however, the modest apparatus and technical skills of almost all the chosen soloists apart from the tenor, Christoph Pregardien, seem rather more exposed than might have been the case in a less 'organic' interpretation - as the alto's is the first solo voice to be heard, and the one with the weightiest moments of lyrical expression, James Bowman's frayed countertenor tones and bumpy line are here exposed to the point of unkindness. This, then, may not be a 'complete' St John Passion - has there ever been one? - but it is nonetheless quite extraordinarily exciting, gripping, affecting. Bruggen's two previous Philips recordings of Haydn symphonies (nos 86 and 88; nos 101 and 103) have given me enormous pleasure. His third - a coupling of the 'Military' and the 'London', two of the most elating of all symphonic constructions - do no less. This is the work of an 'interventionist' Haydn conductor, one who brings a peculiar combination of robustness and vivacity to 'period' performance, most telling in matters of timing, attack and instrumental timbre. In the past I have occasionally found his enthusiasm for detail overdone (though always excusable); but of these works, with their tremendously grand, buoyant and above all surprising finales, Bruggen's command and control seem to me faultless, unarguable on its own terms. The merits of his Haydn conducting, clear enough, become doubly emphasised by the appearance of the second issue in the complete Haydn symphony series currently being undertaken by Christopher Hogwood and his Academy of Ancient Music. Volume 2 roughly covers the period 1760-3; as the Haydn scholar Robbins Landon has written, 'if these early symphonies were all that were known of Haydn, his name would be no more illustrious today than those of d'Ordonez or Hofmann or Michael Haydn' - predecessors in the great Austrian symphonic exploration of the middle 1700s from whom Haydn particularly learned. That said, there are bounteous delights to be sampled here, constant illuminations small and large of the inventiveness with material, the muscular confidence and individuality of personality which Haydn (unlike Mozart) manifested early in his dealings with symphonic form. A general criticism of the Hogwood/Academy readings is that they sound just that - readings, not fully-fledged performances. As such they are always neatly and musically made, tasteful and style-conscious in 'period'-instrumental balance and tempo variation; as a library-shelf item the set will undoubtedly justify its existence. But Haydn, even early Haydn, really wants, and would undoubtedly reward, a lot more in the way of commitment.</p>

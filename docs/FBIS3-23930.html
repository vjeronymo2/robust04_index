			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article in three installments by N.K. Kayumov, director of </F> the Economic Research Institute of the Republic of Tajikistan  Ministry of Economics: "Can the Ailment Be Alleviated?"]  <H5>  [11 Dec p 2] </H5>   [Text] The economy of Tajikistan is today experiencing a  profound and protracted crisis, which is a consequence of a  number of objective and subjective processes that have developed  in the republic in recent years. The severance of economic  relations and the winding down of turnover between the  Commonwealth of Independent States and the former socialist  countries have had a particularly devastating impact. The crisis  in which the republic's economy has found itself in connection  also with the civil war, political instability, and natural  disasters has proven far deeper and of greater proportions than  it appeared earlier. In addition, the economy of Tajikistan  inherited from the former Union a low efficiency of production  with its hypertrophied structure, which in far from all  instances had wide-ranging production relations with other  countries. The most striking evidence of this has been the  intensifying slump in production. In the past three years the  republic's economy has in terms of many general economic  indicators been thrown back almost 30 years. Whereas in 1991  generated national income in comparable prices declined 8.4  percent compared with 1990, in 1992 it had declined 31 percent.  Industrial output in 1990-1992 declined 24.3 percent, and in six  months of the present year, 30.5 percent. The agricultural  product in the period 1990-1992 declined 47 percent and  corresponds to the 1976 level.    From which it may be concluded that Tajikistan's economic  situation will continue to deteriorate since the factors  contributing to the extrication of the economy from the state of  crisis have not yet begun to operate.    Mutually non-concerted actions, particularly of former  republics of the Union which are large and better-off in terms  of mineral and raw material resources, on questions of pricing,  inconsistency in the implementation of economic reforms, and  flagrant mistakes in the methods of its [as published]  implementation under the conditions of the common ruble zone  have led to chaos and paralysis of the economic organism of many  states of the Commonwealth. The foundations of the credit and  monetary system have been thoroughly undermined. The  liberalization of prices without a restructuring of the  necessary accompanying levers of their regulation has not been  an effective stimulus of an increase in production, or the  increase in pay, a factor of highly productive labor. The loss  of the state's regulating function and the granting of the  enterprises broad rights in respect to formation of the  labor-remuneration fund have led to the use of profit for the  needs of consumption to the detriment of accumulation.    Social tension in society is intensifying. The price rises  have been on a considerably larger scale than anticipated. As a  result the quality of life and the living standard of almost all  strata of the populace, its socially unprotected part  particularly, are deteriorating sharply. A polarization of  society--the impoverishment of the bulk of it and the enrichment  of a small part of it--is taking place. The shadow economy is  assuming greater proportions.    Many branches of the economy, primarily its agrarian sector,  are lacking the necessary fuel and energy resources. The  shortage of food resources and Tajikistan's dependence on  supplies thereof from outside are creating a real danger for the  normal physical development of the populace.    The main task at present is restoration of the national  economy and a halt to the continued recession. The republic's  potential does not permit the rapid restoration of what has been  demolished. We need to determine the priority facilities and  begin the restoration with the priorities. Priority measures are  needed simultaneously to avert a further decline in production  in all sectors of the economy. These measures should be devised  on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the  republic's economy in recent years.    The decline in industrial production in the republic, which  began in 1990, was initially of a structural nature. It was  connected, in the main, with the reduction in production in the  fuel sector and construction materials industry. As of 1992 this  slump has become general. The greatest decline in production has  occurred in the base and processing sectors. The decline in  production in 1991 constituted 3.6 percent compared with 1990,  and in 1992, 24.3 percent. In three years the industrial product  in comparable prices declined 26.7 percent and corresponds to  the 1980 level. There was a deterioration in the level and  dynamics of the industrial efficiency indicators: productivity,  capital-output ratio, and materials consumption. A particularly  difficult situation has taken shape in the fuel sector. In the  period 1990-1992 production of oil declined by 83,000 tonnes  (57.6 percent), gas, by 39 million cubic meters (35.1 percent),  and coal, by 259,000 tonnes (54.5 percent). In terms of the  production of oil and gas the republic has been thrown back to  the level of 1940. Although the generation of electric power is  being held at the same level, in 1992 it declined by 1.3 billion  kilowatt-hours (7.2 percent). Under the conditions of the  ever-growing shortage of fuel and energy resources and the  uncontrolled increase in their price, this state of the sector  is having a ruinous effect on the republic's economy.    The machine-building sector is in the same position also.  Half as many transformers were manufactured in 1992 as in 1965,  and their production constituted 18.5 percent of the 1990 level.    Construction materials industry is in a state of profound  crisis. On account of the shortage of reinforcing steel, the  increase in the price of energy, and the increased cost of the  shipment of the finished product, many enterprises of the sector  are in a grim financial condition. Some 620,000 fewer tonnes of  cement (58.1), 92.7 million fewer standard tiles of  asbestos-cement sheet (76.3 percent), 802,000 fewer cubic meters  of precast ferroconcrete structures and products (75.1 percent),  and 179 million fewer standard building bricks (60.1 percent)  were manufactured in 1992 compared with 1990. Some 2.1 times  less cement and 1.5 times fewer ferroconcrete structures and  products were produced in 1992 than in 1960, and the production  of asbestos-cement sheet was at the 1960 level. This situation  is preventing the accomplishment of the task of restoration of  the economy and demands special consideration and the adoption  of specific measures for stabilization of the sector itself.    An extremely inauspicious situation is shaping up on the  consumer market. The volume of retail commodity turnover and  payable services, which has increased many times over in current  prices, does not reflect the actual picture of the level of  satisfaction of consumer requirements. According to official  data, the rate of the production of consumer goods in 1992  declined 28 percent compared with 1991, which was several points  more than for the republic's industry on average. The  manufacture of household refrigerators declined here by 105,600  (63.3 percent), cotton cloth, by 64 million square meters (52.5  percent), silk cloth, by 10 million square meters (13.2  percent), carpets and carpeting, by 2.5 million square meters  (22.9 percent), socks and hose, by 20.5 million pairs (34.3  percent), knitwear, by 7.8 million items (49.7 percent),  footwear, by 5.6 million pairs (51.4 percent), meat and meat  products, 41,900 tonnes (84.8 percent), sausage products, by  12,000 tonnes (77.9 percent), whole milk products, by 66,000  tonnes (34 percent), butter, by 2,700 tonnes (45 percent), and  confectionery, by 41,500 tonnes (77.9 percent) in 1990-1992. A  decline in the production of consumer goods in physical terms  occurred in other groups also.  <H5>  [18 Dec p 2] </H5>   [Text] In terms of the production of household  refrigerators the republic has been thrown back 26 years, of  cloth, 12-17 years, footwear and knitwear, 20-25 years, carpets  and carpeting, 13 years, and socks and hose, six years. The  production of cultural and welfare facilities and household  commodities has declined noticeably.    There has been a sharp deterioration in the situation in  trade. Retail commodity turnover in comparable prices in 1992  constituted only 27.8 percent of the 1991 level, although in  current prices it grew by a factor of 3.2. Because of the  increase in prices the overpayment by the public constituted  more than R16 billion, which made the position of the republic's  working people far worse. The increase in consumer prices  outpaced personal monetary income by a factor of 2.5.    There is not only the relative but also the absolute  impoverishment of the bulk of the population of the  republic.    The systematic reduction in the supplies to retail trade of  the basic foodstuffs is a cause of particular concern. The  supply of meat and meat products declined 65 percent, of dairy  products, 48 percent, sugar and confectionery, 92 percent,  cotton cloth, 44 percent, silk cloth, 56 percent, knitwear, 40  percent, footwear, 35 percent, and so forth in 1992 compared  with 1991. The consumption of meat and meat products declined  from 26 kg in 1990 to 20 kg in 1992, and of milk and dairy  products, from 161 kg to 72 kg.    The increase in prices is forcing people to spend a  large part of their family budget primarily on the purchase of  food. The structure of the population's diet has shifted toward  carbohydrate consumption models. Proportional spending on  nourishment is rising systematically and at the present time  constitutes 65 percent.    Consumption at the level of the physiological minimum  enables  a person to exist merely as a biological organism, but not to  restore his fitness for work. A diet at this caloric level leads  for quite a long period of time to mental and physical  degradation. The lack of protein and fats is reflected in  people's health and the quality of the work force, a reduction  in life expectancy, a change in its mentality and behavior, and  the destruction of the nation's gene pool. Unless there is  a change in the situation, a further increase in morbidity,  reduced immunity, and a decline in the ability to work may be  expected in the not-too-distant future in certain underdeveloped  regions.    The agrarian sector of the republic's economy has found  itself in an extremely difficult situation. The armed conflicts,  the complex social and political situation, the severance of  firmly established economic relations between countries of the  Commonwealth, the extremely unfavorable weather conditions,  natural disasters of unprecedented scale, the incredible price  rises, the difficulties in the purchase of equipment, fuel and  lubricants, mineral fertilizers, herbicides, and toxic chemicals  associated with this, and the appreciable gap between the level  of prices of industrial and agricultural products have been  reflected in the situation in the sector. No sector has suffered  as much as agriculture. A further decline in agricultural  production is occurring against the background of the shortfall  in the sowing of a number of crops and the reduction in the  numbers of livestock and the decline in its productiveness.    In 1992 the total gross product of the sector in comparable  prices constituted 53 percent of the 1990 level. In 1991 the  decline in production constituted only 4 percent, in 1992, 43  percent. In terms of the production of cereals the sector has  been thrown back to the level of 1980, of potatoes, 1981,  vegetables, 1986, edible pumpkins, 1978, grapes, somewhat before  1970 even, meat, 1963, milk, 1960, and eggs, 1975. Some 68,000  tonnes fewer of cereals, 45,000 tonnes fewer of potatoes, 78,000  tonnes fewer of fruits and berries, 108,000 tonnes fewer of  grapes, 340,000 tonnes less of seed cotton, 60,000 fewer tonnes  of meat, 388,000 fewer tonnes of milk, and 346 million fewer  eggs were gathered in in 1992 compared with 1990.    A particularly serious situation has come about in the  animal  husbandry sector. The sector's resources declined appreciably  mainly owing to the decline in the production and the  deterioration of the indicators of productiveness of the public  herd. Albeit small, a growth, nonetheless, in the numbers and  production of animal husbandry products was observed on the  private subsidiary plots. But this growth is not making up for  the decline in public animal husbandry.    The most negative result of the development of public animal  husbandry was the sharp decline in the herd. The numbers of  cattle in the republic as a whole had declined by 157,400 head  (30 percent), including 35,500 head of cows (25 percent), of  hogs, by 81,700 head (66 percent), sheep and goats, 472,500 head  (26 percent), and poultry, by 4,129,200 head (56 percent), as of  1 August 1993 compared with 1 August 1991.    This situation in animal husbandry is exerting a negative  influence on the long-term possibilities of the development of  the sector and reducing the republic's meat resources  appreciably. The restoration of the numbers of animals, of  cattle particularly, will take decades.    There has been a simultaneous decline in the productiveness  of livestock and poultry. The average milk yield per cow has  declined by 612 kg (42 percent), and the yield of a laying hen,  by 35 eggs (35 percent).  <H5>  [30 Dec p 3] </H5>   [Text] The shortage of feed, formula feed particularly,  has had a noticeable effect on the state of affairs in hog  raising and poultry breeding. The large-scale animal husbandry  complexes and poultry factories, which are almost wholly  dependent on supplies of formula feed, have found themselves in  a difficult situation with the introduction of free feed prices.    The scale of the decline in production in the processing  sectors of the republic's agro-industrial complex has grown  sharply also. In 1992 enterprises of the sector manufactured  products 25.2 percent below the 1991 level.    Against the background of the general decline in production  in all sectors of the economy there has been a marked reduction  in investment activity. The incredible growth of prices has led  to a devaluation of the savings and working assets of the  enterprises and organizations. As a result the scale of  construction has declined sharply. Investments from all sources  of financing were in 1992 one-third below the 1990 level.    The efficiency of the invested capital declined somewhat.  The  introduction of fixed capital in the first six months of 1993  constituted only 20 percent of total capital investments. For  this reason the amount of incomplete construction grew several  times over compared with 1990 and constituted R40 billion. The  above-norm increase in incomplete construction constituted  approximately R12 billion. According to the most modest  estimates, more than R3 billion of funds in the increase in  incomplete construction were spent on pay. The greatest decline  in investment activity is being observed in the sectors that  determine the direction of structural policy. This testifies  that the crisis has assumed not only an economic but also a  technological nature, and there has been a marked acceleration  in the aging and physical deterioration of fixed capital in many  sectors of the economy, primarily in the fuel industry and the  machine-building, iron and steel, and chemical and timber  complexes. Depreciation allowances are not providing even for  simple reproduction, let alone expanded reproduction.    The decline in production in industry, agriculture, and  construction and the shortage of fuel and spares and other  resources and also the significant increase in fares have led to  a sharp deterioration in the operation of transport. The  shipment of freight by general use transport declined by almost  30,000 tonnes (43.8 percent) compared with 1990.    The republic's financial condition has taken complex shape  also. Its budget system was formed under the impact of the  general economic and political crisis in society. The republic's  financial resources have essentially lost their link with real  material production and its efficiency indicators, as a result  of which financing has assumed a deficit nature even under the  conditions of the application of austerity measures. Expenditure  on wages, food, and other priority spending is being funded, in  the main. Nonetheless, the budget deficit is not declining but,  on the contrary, growing. The decline in production combined  with the intensive growth of wholesale prices and the reduction  in export receipts has led to a sharp reduction on the revenue  side of the budget.    It is perfectly obvious that a resolution of the problem of  a  recovery of state finances will take a long time, in the course  of which the prerequisites for this recovery have to be created.  In this connection, evidently, the government will be forced to  wind down the financing of the construction of production  facilities that do not promise rapid income or do not satisfy  the republic's most urgent requirements, end financial  assistance from the budget to financially autonomous  enterprises, and establish strict legal and tax control over the  activity of commercial structures.    The current situation is reason to anticipate with  sufficient  certainty that the economic decline will continue. Even if  measures pertaining to financial and economic stabilization are  stepped up, their consequences will be manifested at the end of  next year or beyond even.    The time has come today for a critical evaluation of the  entire path that has been trodden, for appreciable adjustments  to be made to the strategy and tactics of the economic reforms  that are being implemented, and for a number of priority  measures to halt the continued decline in production to be  realized. The following, in our opinion, pertain to the latter:    First, tasks of the surmounting of the crisis  situation in agriculture, of which support for the harvesting  and spring-field operations is the most important, are of the  most significance at this time. It is necessary to establish the  strictest accounting of the propellant and fuel and lubricants  entering the republic and to channel them first and foremost  into the needs of agriculture.    Similar measures need to be implemented also in animal  husbandry, where, owing to missed opportunities in the  procurement of fodder, a real threat of a further sharp  reduction in the numbers of livestock could be created.    It is important also that agricultural enterprises be  supplied with spares for the repair of tractors, other  agricultural machinery, and motor vehicles, receive some  new-equipment replenishment, and have the necessary quantity of  mineral fertilizers and toxic chemicals. Government support for  the agricultural enterprises and the allocation of soft loans  are needed for the solution of these questions.    It is essential also to work out the question of the  reprofiling of a number of shops and bays of the republic's  machine-building enterprises for the production of spares,  parts, and components of agricultural equipment and transport  facilities.    It is essential, before it is too late, to introduce  everywhere the family contract and to make it the main form of  production responsibility linking compensation with the end  result of work. World and, yes, our own experience shows that  only thus can the food problem be resolved.    Second. A rapid growth in offenses in the economic  sphere causing the economy of Tajikistan considerable harm has  been charted in recent years on account of the absence of strict  control and the not entirely justified liberalization of foreign  economic activity. A tremendous quantity of raw material and  food resources, of which the republic is today itself in need,  is being exported without hindrance, and there is little that is  coming in in exchange. This practice is leading to an increase  in prices and a decline in personal living standards. We are  confronted squarely in this connection with the question of  Tajikistan's economic security.    It would seem that for stabilization in the sphere of the  economy it is essential to devise an official program for  fighting crime, in which tough measures against the increasing  crime-conducing processes in the economy should be realized. It  might be considered necessary to this end to create an  independent state control committee, adopt a package of laws on  the fight against corruption and on the status of the public  servant, and to determine measures of severe punishment for  aiding and abetting the perpetration of economic crimes. It is  essential to create under the auspices of the Committee for  National Security a department for the fight for the republic's  economic security. A law banning officials from engaging in  commercial activity is needed. It is also time to wind down all  small enterprises, cooperatives, and other commercial formations  at state-owned enterprises.    Third. It is essential to devise an effective  mechanism of the stimulation of production, introduce a sparing  tax system, and to grant the enterprises medium-term and  long-term loans. It would be a mistake to think that high taxes  might reduce the budget deficit, on the contrary, they would  suppress incentives to production and could even, having reached  a particular level, lead to an absolute reduction in budget  revenue and to a slowing of the rate of turnover of capital.  This applies to value-added tax also. Throughout the world this  tax performs the role of stimulus contributing to a reduction in  prices, with us, however, the other way about--to an increase.  It should be differentiated by commodity group depending on  social significance. It is essential to stabilize the budget not  via an increase in taxes but by way of a reduction in government  spending and by means of the pursuit of a preferential tax  policy.    Fourth. A process of the aging of the fixed  capital of sectors of the national economy is intensifying at  the present time. The retirement factor in fuel industry, for  example, has today reached 55 percent, in the construction  materials industry, 40 percent, the processing sectors, 27  percent, the machine-building complex, 25 percent, and so forth.  Unless serious measures are adopted today even, the fixed  capital of many sectors will have become decrepit within five or  six years. It is necessary, therefore, for maintenance of the  technical level of production to revitalize enterprises'  investment activity. The government will, evidently, have to  reduce the funding of state capital investments to the minimum  necessary for maintaining the viability of the systems and the  construction of priority facilities. It is necessary to this end  to shift the center of gravity from budget financing to the  financially autonomous funds of the enterprises and switch from  the funding of capital construction free of charge to bank  loans. It is necessary to devise a mechanism of attraction of  the resources of the banks themselves and individuals.    Fifth. It may be said with confidence today that  flagrant miscalculations were made in the tactics and strategy  of implementation of the economic reforms. We began the reform  from the top echelons of management of the economy. The time has  come to shift the burden of the economic transformations to the  sphere of real production and the subjects of market  relations--the enterprises--and to afford them broader rights  and freedom of action so that they themselves, following the  example of the Baltic republics, might establish direct  relations with enterprises of the far and near abroad.    Sixth. There should be a strong bridge between the  past, the present, and the future. This bridge is lacking  currently. The directive-plan system having been demolished,  nothing has been proposed in exchange. The reform should be  implemented with a high degree of state regulation and the  strictest control of the sphere of production, circulation, and  foreign economic activity. The outstanding role of Roosevelt as  a statesman was that he was able to turn an uncontrolled market  economy into a controlled economy. There is no spontaneous  economy anywhere. It is essential, therefore, before more  follies are committed, to restore the system of state regulation  of national economic, intersectoral, and intra-sectoral  proportions. But this regulation should be exercised mainly on  the basis of economic methods of management.    The economy of Tajikistan will not be extricated from the  most severe and protracted economic crisis quickly. Gradual,  consistent, and thoughtful work is needed.</p>

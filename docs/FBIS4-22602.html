			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Grachev, editor of the social policy and </F> letters department: "Sociologists Maintain That Our Main Concern  Is Crime"]    [Text] Today, with the help of the Ecro Company, we will  tell what St. Petersburg residents think of the work of the  bodies of executive authority--the Russian Government and the  St. Petersburg mayoralty. The figures (all are given as  percents) tell us that we are becoming increasingly critical of  the institutes of authority in general and executive authority  in particular. In this respect, it would be instructive to  compare the results of previous sociological surveys published  in SANKT PETERSBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI with the results tabulated by  the Ecro Company. Well, while in February 1993 only 38 percent  of city residents did not believe that the authorities would be  able to pull the country out of the crisis, in August 1993 this  figure had already increased to 43 percent. Today, however, to  the question "Do you believe that the existing executive  authority in Russia is capable of pulling the country out of the  crisis?" only 17 percent answered affirmatively, while 63  percent answered unequivocally negatively.    Our compatriots are somewhat more charitable of the  mayoralty  actions. "Negative" was the reply of 35 percent and "somewhat  negative"--of 19 percent. There are, however, also fewer  unequivocally positive replies--6 percent.    What does it all tell us? First and foremost, that the  negative trends that manifest themselves sharply around the  country, most often are contained in our city, thereby ensuring  a relative social stability.    At the same time, another research recently commissioned by  the newspaper points at those spheres of the city life which  increasingly often cause our dissatisfaction today and by which  the people judge the mayoralty's work. The wording of the  question was: "What are the problems the city authorities should  pay the greatest attention to?" The response shows that the  problem of combating crime by far leads the list--78 percent.  The second is social security--43.5 percent, and the third,  health care--43.3 percent; they are followed by transportation  problems--31.7 percent, unemployment--26.5 percent, availability  of housing--26 percent, supply of goods--25.3 percent, and  education--18.4 percent. (Each respondent could select no more  than three problems that are most important for him. Therefore  the total exceeds 100 percent.)    It is quite obvious that confidence in local authorities is  determined to a great extent by how well it takes into account  concerns and wishes of ordinary city residents. And they name  first, let us repeat, suppression of crime and personal safety,  social security, and operation of health care facilities and  transportation.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |What Is Your Appraisal of the Mayoralty's Work?

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Consultancy and fool's gold For John Ryan, consultancy is a dirty word. Three years ago as the director of a small business making satellite television equipment, he had the chance to expand into the German market. Aware that he needed advice, Ryan (not his real name) contacted his local branch of the Department of Trade and Industry, hoping for the subsidised consultancy help advertised as part of the DTI's Enterprise Initiative. According to Ryan, he 'got nowhere' with his approaches to the DTI. He thought the help on offer was half the cost of one of the company directors going to Germany; instead, after 'many weeks of phone calls and discussions', it emerged that the DTI would provide a representative, and would pay half his costs. Ryan was disappointed: 'I didn't think anyone representing us could have done as good a job as we would ourselves. And I didn't want cost of the consultant's holiday.' He felt part of the problem was the size of his business - it only employed eight staff, but 'they were treating us like a big firm'. According to the Federation of Small Businesses, Ryan was not alone. Around the same period, the FSB's Birmingham office received many complaints about the quality of consultancy advice to small businesses under the Enterprise Initiative. The result was a meeting between the FSB and the local DTI office to reinforce small business needs. Both sides now agree things have improved: according to the local DTI office, in the last year they have had only a handful of complaints, yet have a total of 2,400 consultants on their books. FSB spokeswoman Fay Goodman cautiously agrees. 'We haven't had as many complaints in the last year, but more small businesses have been going bust, and they don't have the money to get consultancy advice. We still get the impression there are problems.' Under the Enterprise Initiative, companies with less than 500 employees can apply to the DTI for consultancy help. This can range from five to 15 days' work, and half the costs will be paid by the DTI. In some areas of the UK the department meets two-thirds of the cost. According to the DTI, the role of matching consultant to company is the responsibility of the organisations contracted to run the scheme. These each cover a separate area, from design (the Design Council) to marketing (the Chartered Institute of Marketing) and business planning (3i Industrial Support Ltd). At the Design Council, Helen Ives-Rose manages the Enterprise Initiative design consultancy scheme. She says the council has 576 consultancy practices on its books. 'To be considered for the scheme, they have to have been in business for at least two years and be able to show successfully completed work.' Ives-Rose admits that some small firms can be disappointed with the help they get. 'We do try to stress that they are unlikely to get a completed project with 15 days' work. She adds that companies have to understand that consultancy advice is expensive. 'There's no point in them getting advice really cheaply and then wanting to carry on on their own and finding out that they can't afford it.' The DTI is confident that any complaints about the scheme are picked up by its independent evaluations; according to a spokesman, studies carried out in June 1989 and February 1991 found that 'over 50 per cent of the 420 firms questioned were now more likely to use consultancy help in the future' and '84 per cent reported that the scheme represented value for money'. But at the FSB, Fay Goodman warns small businesses not to be over-impressed with the idea of consultancy. 'It can sound so wonderful, and people do think it's the answer to all their problems.' For John Ryan, going it alone is now the only answer. After the collapse of his satellite TV equipment business he is starting up again, but in a different field. 'I'm not asking for any help now - you've got to do it yourself.'</p>

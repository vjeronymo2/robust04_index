			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Scottish success paves the way to N-power privatisation: The atomic energy industry's balance sheets look healthier north of the border James Buxton discovers EXECUTIVES AT Scottish Nuclear have reason to be irritated by criticism of Britain's nuclear generating industry over the past few weeks. The words most commonly used are 'loss-making' and 'heavily subsidised'. It is true that Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company operating nuclear plants in England and Wales, received a Pounds 1.2bn subsidy last year from the 11 per cent levy on electricity bills in England and Wales. Without that, its operating profit of Pounds 482m in 1991-92 would have been a loss of nearly Pounds 800m. But Scottish Nuclear, which runs Scotland's nuclear power stations, is neither loss-making nor subsidised. There is no nuclear levy in Scotland. The government wrote off Pounds 1.3bn of Scottish Nuclear's debt in 1990, but Nuclear Electric was launched without debt. In 1991-92 Scottish Nuclear made a small profit and it aims to be sufficiently profitable to be saleable by about 1996. Scottish Nuclear started with several advantages. Nuclear Electric needs the levy to pay for the decommissioning of its Magnox stations, while Scottish Nuclear already has provisions to cover its one Magnox plant - Hunterston A in Ayrshire, which is closed. Thanks to government grants, the cost of decommissioning Hunterston A is excluded from Scottish Nuclear's profit-and-loss account. Furthermore, of Scottish Nuclear's two advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) plants, Hunterston B has long been the most productive AGR station in Britain, while Torness in East Lothian achieved its design output in record time after opening in 1989. They supply about 40 per cent of Scotland's electricity under 15-year contracts with ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric. Since Scottish Nuclear was formed from ScottishPower in 1989, with the businessman Mr James Hann becoming chairman, the company has played a leading part in rehabilitating the image of the nuclear industry. Television advertisements and posters proclaim the environmental friendliness of nuclear power. Last year the company took 20,000 visitors through its stations. Although Torness has had difficulty in commissioning its refuelling system and Hunterston B is undergoing mid-life maintenance, total output, which had reached 14m gigawatts an hour in 1989-90, is moving upwards again, reaching 12.7m GWH last year, with 14.2m GWH expected this year. according to Mr Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive who joined Scottish Nuclear from ScottishPower in March, the recovery in output helped the company to move from a net loss of Pounds 32.5m in 1990-91 to last year's profit of Pounds 13.7m on sales of Pounds 477m. This year's target is a profit of Pounds 20m. In the medium term, Scottish Nuclear's financial performance should gain substantially from one of Mr Hann's main initiatives. Last year he said the only instructions he received when appointed by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then Scottish secretary, were 'to give hell to those bloody Sassenachs (Englishmen) at BNFL' which supplies and reprocesses SNL's fuel. Mr Hann questioned the need for the expensive reprocessing of spent AGR fuel. Now, in a break with British nuclear industry practice agreed with BNFL his year, SNL will end reprocessing and store spent fuel at its stations for at least 50 years. SNL should save Pounds 40m a year when the stores, each costing about Pounds 15m, enter service in 1995 and 1996. A public inquiry into the Torness store began yesterday but most local opinion is favourable. SNL will also try to persuade the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to extend the theoretical life of its stations from 30 to 35 years, reducing the annual Pounds 65m depreciation charge. That should be achieved during or before the next financial year. To improve efficiency, the company has set up 30 employee groups to find better ways of doing things, and aims to lower its cost per unit of electricity (before accounting for historic liabilities) from last year's figure of 3.21p to 3p this year - comparable with coal - and to 2.5p by 1994-95. Mr Jeffrey says: 'This is a very aggressive target but it is realistic. We want consistently to achieve an 80 per cent load factor' - last year Hunterston was on 66 per cent and Torness on 55 per cent. SNL hopes to cut controllable production costs in 1992-93 from Pounds 133m last year to Pounds 123m. It expects between 200 and 300 of its 2,000 staff to take voluntary early retirement in the next year or so. If things go according to plan, and SNL does not encounter any costly technical snags, Mr Jeffrey believes the company would be fit to enter the private sector by about 1996, either through flotation or a trade sale. 'We could be the pathfinder for the privatisation of the nuclear industry,' he says. 'We are a much more straightforward company to float than NE. But to make it happen the government would probably have to retain ownership of Hunterston A, which we would then decommission under contract.' SNL hoped the review of the nuclear industry, which the government promised for 1994, would pave the way for privatisation. Now, with energy policy under review by the Department of Trade and Industry after the climb-down on pit closures, the nuclear industry's future is uncertain. SNL says the government needs an energy policy to meet the resource and environmental constraints the world will face next century.</p>

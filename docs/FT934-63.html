			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Leading Article: A time for courage Hopes for a brighter year ahead in the Middle East rest critically on substantial and rapid progress being made in the peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. With one deadline already missed, and this week's talks having failed to make progress, there is growing cause for concern. If they become deadlocked or collapse, the outlook for the region would appear uniformly grey. Last September's celebrations over the handshake between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, has quickly given way to a more sober assessment of what still has to be achieved, and the wide differences that separate the two sides. These differences are in turn exacerbated by the domestic political difficulties faced by both leaders. Mr Rabin must constantly balance negotiating concessions against the pressures threatening to undermine his coalition government, while the manoeuvrings of the mercurial Mr Arafat reflect, as ever, his paramount desire to maintain ultimate control of the PLO. For Mr Rabin, this appears to mean not conceding anything that might appear to threaten Israel's security, or lead to the eventual emergence of an independent Palestinian state. For Mr Arafat, it means winning symbols of statehood, however minor, at every stage of the negotiations. The two men continue to need each other, but only for as long as they are convinced that peace can be achieved on terms that bolster their political longevity. Low profile It is to their credit that they have progressed so far without more active US involvement, but it would be dangerous for the region if the Clinton administration decided to maintain its current low profile. The meeting next month between Mr Clinton and Syria's President Hafez al-Assad must be used to revive the moribund negotiations between Syria and Israel, which also hold the key to an eventual peace deal involving Lebanon and Jordan. A failure to draw Syria back into the process - by Israel acknowledging an eventual willingness to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights - will continue to be a check to progress in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. The stakes are higher than the negotiators care to admit. Governments throughout the Middle East, both sympathetic and hostile to the west, look increasingly under pressure, and the opposition to them ever more militant. The fall in the price of oil to its lowest point for five years may have just about sustainable consequences for Saudi Arabia, but it could push Algeria closer to political and economic chaos. And while it may be tempting for the US and others to applaud the additional damage that lower oil prices are inflicting on Iran's already ill-managed economy, there is little prospect of it producing a government more sympathetic to the west, a conclusion scarcely less applicable to Iraq. More generous The Egyptian government, which is trying harder than any other third party to bring about a wider Arab-Israeli agreement, looks able to contain its Islamic terrorist threat, but not without a serious loss of tourism revenue and yet deeper official reluctance to introduce necessary economic and political reforms. Neighbouring Libya has not been persuaded to change its ways by western sanctions, while Sudan has emerged as one of the main gathering points for the region's disaffected. Nothing that Mr Rabin or Mr Arafat can do will instantly change any of those fundamentals. But by offering more generous compromises and taking greater political risks in the twilight of their political careers, they can provide a powerful counterweight to the bleak appeal of the extremists. Nowhere can this be more important than in the impoverished Gaza Strip, where substantial sums of western aid are waiting to be used in the battle against economic hopelessness and its accompanying militancy. Of course it matters to both sides who controls the crossing points into the Gaza Strip. But it would be the most lamentable failure of statesmanship to allow negotiations to founder over such a relatively minor issue, and simultaneously provide the enemies of compromise with a triumph that would be trumpeted throughout the Middle East.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Airport aims for charter lead MANCHESTER airport yesterday said it expected to overhaul London's Gatwick this year as market leader in holiday charter traffic. The airport said that expanded summer programmes by more than 270 tour operators would push Manchester's share of the inclusive tour booking market to nearly 30 per cent, while Gatwick had an estimated 28 per cent. BAA, the airports operator, said its eight airports handled 4.8m passengers last month - a 33 per cent rise on February last year, when numbers were badly affected by the Gulf War, and 3.4 per cent above the February 1990 total.</p>

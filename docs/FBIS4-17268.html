			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Askar Akayev has decreed the removal of  Finance Minister Kamchibek Shakirov for abuse of his official  status and for issuing a loan from the state budget to a private  firm.    The head of the president's press service Azim Ibraimov told  INTERFAX that the finance minister's resignation was the first  instance of an uncompromising decision with regard to a cabinet  member. In his view, this was an example of the government's  resolution to tighten state discipline over fiscal matters in  use against officials who, regardless of their rank, had raised  their own level of responsibility beyond that permissible by law.    Ibraimov pointed out that when the new premier Apas  Dzhumagulov came to power, "the process of purging the state  personnel system began in earnest."    He also said that K. Shakirov used his authority among  government members "as a sufficiently well-versed and competent  professional financier, who knew his business." However,  "weakness of character led him to violate procedure and abuse  his authorities and, succumbing to family loyalties, the finance  minister issued a loan to his own son-in-law," Ibraimov said.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Australian mill strike Strike action yesterday hit three crushing mills operated by Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian sugar group which was acquired by Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The action is thought to involve 700-800 workers, and to be related to current enterprise-based pay talks. The employees are believed to have begun an overtime ban on Friday, and moved to full strike action yesterday, despite industrial relations commission hearings in Queensland.</p>

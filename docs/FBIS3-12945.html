Pakistan has also made it clear to the monetary organization  that the new dimensions of dangers posed to this region due to  the increase in the Indian defense budget cannot be ignored.  Financial organizations like the IMF have adopted a policy of  imposing tough conditions when providing aid and loans to needy,  developing countries. Generally, conditions like a cut in  defense expenditure and the number of armed forces personnel are  set in cases of Islamic countries. Pressure has also been  exerted on Pakistan to accept this condition. However, India  has been exempted from it. The Pakistan Government has been  severely criticized by the opposition and some other political  circles, and it is not possible for the government to easily  reject these criticisms.    By deciding to increase the defense budget, the government  has silenced its political opponents, and the people have  expressed their satisfaction. By informing responsible persons  in the IMF about the decision, the Government of Pakistan has  also made it clear that it is not willing to put its security  and existence at stake merely to secure loans from a financial  organization. The fact is that India's aggressive designs in  this region is no secret and Pakistan faces the gravest danger  from the Indian buildup. This is because it is with Pakistan  that India has the most serious dispute, in the form of Kashmir.  India considers Pakistan as the biggest hurdle in this region to  the fulfillment of its designs. Pakistan has already been the  target of Indian aggression thrice. Therefore, it cannot afford  to ignore Indian activities.    Under the circumstances, the Government of Pakistan's  decision is an appropriate and sensible one in the interest of  the country's security and a strong national defense. The  government should scrupulously adhere to the decision.  Pakistan's position is very strong and forceful and this is why  it is not possible for any country or organization to ever  counter Pakistan's arguments at any forum.</p>

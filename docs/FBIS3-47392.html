Dr Suphachai said he expects the next ministerial-level  meeting of the Growth Triangle -- Thailand, Malaysia and  Indonesia -- to formulate policies to enhance cooperation in  cost saving, trade, investment, industry, energy, tourism and  farming.    He said longer opening hours at border checkpoints and lower  tariffs would be a first step towards better Thai-Malaysia trade.    Malaysia wants to shift some of its electronic industry to  Chalung Industrial Estate in Thailand. But some Malaysian  businesses say the estate is too small and land prices are too  high, Dr Suphachai said.    Some Malaysian companies have been buying land in Sungai  Kolok to build a parts factory, he said.    Turning to Indonesia, Dr Suphachai said he expected joint  development in power plants, air services and joint fishing  ventures.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE-PAINTING HELPS THEM, NEIGHBORHOOD;  </P> <P> TEENS BRUSH UP ON IMPROVEMENTS  </P> <P> Residents in Inglewood's Centinela Heights neighborhood are no longer alarmed  when they see a gang of teen-agers applying paint to a house. In fact, they are  now signing up for the privilege of having it done to their homes.  </P> <P> Teen-agers are working to spruce up the residential neighborhood next to the  Hyde Park area of Los Angeles in the experimental program designed to steer  young people away from the lure of the streets. By painting the houses of  low-income residents and senior citizens, organizers say, the young  participants are learning a marketable craft, taking in some spending money and  even polishing the tarnished reputations that they carry among those a  generation or two older.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Right Direction'  </P> <P> Mixing, priming and painting techniques are just the beginning, said  coordinator Mercedes Tudy of Inglewood Neighborhood Housing Services Inc. "It's  more than just an employment program," she said. "We try to work with the whole  person. I think a lot of the kids have the right ingredients. We try to point  them in the right direction."  </P> <P> The job program concept originated in a neighborhood group in Salt Lake City,  where disadvantaged young people were organized several years ago to improve  their community. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., a national group that  funds community revitalization projects, chose Inglewood last year for a  similar job program that will serve as a model for tough urban environments.  </P> <P> "In Salt Lake City, the problem kids were involved in school truancy, joy  riding, drinking and maybe some petty theft," said Cris Mojica-Gomez, the  Southern California manager for Neighborhood Reinvestment. "In a place like  Inglewood you're dealing with crack dealing and gangs. The kids have a harder  edge to them."  </P> <P> In the Inglewood program, the dozen participants are required to attend  counseling sessions to plan their futures. They learn to speak in public and  maintain a neat appearance. They must master such job hunting basics as resumes  and applications, and such abstractions as responsibility and dedication.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Now I Have Goals'  </P> <P> "When I started, I was lost, just hanging around," said Jose Garcia, a shy  18-year-old who became the program's first graduate this week. "Now I have  goals. I just want to do enough so people will say, 'Jose is something.' "  </P> <P> Garcia, who also graduated from Inglewood High School last month, has accepted  a carpenter's apprentice position with an Anaheim construction firm. His goals  include attending trade school, learning more English, and earning enough money  to help out his mother and four sisters.  </P> <P> Once he makes it, Garcia envisions himself helping others to straighten out  their lives. "I want to teach other people that life is something, not just  hanging around."  </P> <P> Another painter, Jermaine Cooley, 18, said after a painting session this week  that he isn't the same person he was two months ago when he first signed up for  the program.  </P> <P> "My friends see a change in me," said Cooley, a graduate of the Inglewood  Community Day Center, an alternative high school. "It's making me see that I  can do more than just hang out on the streets. It's helping me to get my  responsibilities together. Right now I'd be at home doing nothing with the  buddies."  </P> <P> Participants acknowledge that painting a house is not for everyone. Arriving at  work on time is a requirement. Teamwork is key. Many of those who sign up later  drop out and drift away.  </P> <P> "I can tell people that this is a good program," Cooley said, "but some people  can't hang with it."  </P> <P> Victor Peres, the on-site coordinator, said he took a hefty pay cut from his  regular construction work to train the teen-agers. He considers the work a  repayment to those who helped him turn his life around when he was growing up.  </P> <P> "I was young once too," Peres said, showing the scar from a bullet wound he  received in the abdomen during his wilder days. "I can relate to them. . . .  I'm trying to change the world for them a little bit. That's all we can do."  </P> <P> Iola Reeser, a Wexham Way resident who says she hasn't always spoken in glowing  terms about today's young people, was beaming as she showed off her newly  painted bright yellow home last week.  </P> <P> She gave the teen-agers the ultimate compliment: "These kids did a better job  than the professional painters who did it the first time."  </P></p>

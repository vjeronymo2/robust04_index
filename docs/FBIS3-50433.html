			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EPS Commander in Chief General Humberto </F> Ortega by Manuel Espinoza at the Canal Cuatro studios in  Managua; from the "Extravision" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts] [Espinoza] Thank you, General, for being here  with us. I think this is a wonderful opportunity for us to chat  a little about what the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] has  achieved up until now, especially during 1993, and to hear your  opinions as a military and political leader in this country. I  would first like you to give us your view of the country's  current situation and what you see... [pauses] how you evaluate  1993 for the EPS?    [Ortega] First, Manuel, allow me to thank you for your  invitation here today -- just a few hours away from year's end  -- and I also want to thank the rest of the people who work on  "Extravision." I think this is a good opportunity to point out  a few things that I believe are very important to give the  Nicaraguans an awareness about what is going on in our country.    As I see it, this has been a crucial year, as far as the  achievements we have made toward the peace for which the  Nicaraguan people have been striving for so many years. Ever  since our struggle began -- and I remember a time in your life  when you were a student and a member of Patriotic Youths in the  1960's -- and even now, the Nicaraguan people have been so very  eager for peace. This peace has cost us blood, sacrifice, and  destruction. Today, I can say that this year we managed, in  many ways, to prevent several groups, who took up weapons for  different reasons, from taking control of political space, as  well as moral space. These were the recontras, the recompas,  and the revueltos that operated in various places around the  country.    [Espinoza] In terms of these groups, approximately how many  people are there still in arms?    [Ortega] The important thing is that there are no longer any  organized expressions or organized groups with any significant  degree of political support, either foreign or domestic. This  is over and done with. I think that if you were to carry out a  survey right now and interview the country's major political  figures, you would not find a single political or economic  spokesman or figure here willing to give even the least bit of  support for any such organized armed expression in any part of  the nation -- whether this expression comes in the form of  recompas, recontras, revueltos, or whatever else you may want to  call it. This is the most important thing: These groups have  been denied that space.    [Espinoza] Has war, as a form of struggle in Nicaragua,  ended?    [Ortega] What ended was the organized expression of illegal  armed groups. Now, what is left? We believe there are some  600-800 men dispersed in groups of no more than eight to 12  each; this is what is left of the larger groups that were  located at the seven designated enclaves. About 80 percent of  the forces that were organized as recontras and recompas have  entered into normal civilian life following the amnesty bill.  There is a minority left that we have been fighting for the  past few months. As you well know, we have met with the coffee  growers and dairy farmers associations. These farmers have  asked us for a more active presence of the authorities to  control extortionists, kidnappers, and highway robbers -- in a  word, all those you already know about.    [Espinoza] The farmers have asked for greater presence and  protection from the EPS in the fields to secure the harvest and  safeguard the workers. There are certain political sectors who  have criticized this presence. We recently heard accusations  from the director of LA PRENSA and all that followed, including  demands for the EPS to retreat. What would happen if the EPS  pulled out of the area completely?    [Ortega] We have retreated to our bases and are continuing  with our regular academic and combat training exercises --  things that any army needs -- and we are continuing our  protection operations in support of the production work, which  is directed at instilling order and stability in the fields.  This is vital for Nicaragua.    If there is no stability, there will be no production.  Without production there is no economic activity, and without  economic activity we cannot fight poverty. Poverty and  unemployment will only end when the economy truly begins to  move, which in turn will move production. To manage this,  however, it is crucial that we bring stability to the fields.    If we retreat, these small groups will become thousands.  This is why we cannot leave the fields. It is our  constitutional duty and it is our nature, as a military  institution, to go where there is instability to create  stability. We cannot retreat. As I have pointed out in the  past, to try and make the Army disappear is to tell the  Nicaraguans that we want more instability and more war.    It is important to realize that ours is a national army.  It is no longer an army submitted to a political party, as it  was in the past. In the past, we were a direct expression of  the Sandinist National Liberation Front, a party. It is no  longer that way. We know it is important to be an institution  of the Nicaraguan state that serves all Nicaraguans, regardless  of their political, ideological, or religious position.    [Espinoza] Has the Army's behavior in the countryside been  suitable, or will you take a look into that?    [Ortega] Mistakes and errors can occur in our actions, like  in the actions of anyone. There have been problems -- scores of  cases -- that the military authorities have been working on and  are duly examining to punish those who have committed abuses, as  I have pointed out. Errors have been committed, but this does  not mean that we are a genocidal army like Somoza's army, which  indiscriminately bombed towns. There is a big difference.    I have told Cardinal Obando y Bravo that if he had reported  in a more careful and constructive way that EPS operations had  endangered the people of the town of Juanito, we would have  listened to this call and would have told him that we would take  into account his observations and act more carefully in the  future. The problem is that a campaign was waged against  something that had not occurred -- namely, genocide. This kind  of campaign does not help make things better. Efforts aimed at  removing the EPS and replacing it with another is like telling  the Nicaraguan people that there will never be peace here.    The truth is that if the EPS were to disappear, which is  what  some people want, we would end up having not one but 10 or 20  armies, because each side will be full of distrust and people  with diverse ideological and political positions will have their  own armies. This would be a mess. We would have anarchy.    [Espinoza] Do EPS actions result from EPS initiatives, or  does the Army fulfill government orders?    [Ortega] We have immediate response mechanisms. If pirates  from the north or the south violate our waters, our seas, we do  not have to ask anyone for permission to take action, and the  Navy does not have to ask me for permission either. The Navy  has to stop pirates from stealing our shrimp and lobsters and  from working against our national wealth.    Likewise, in the countryside there may exist groups  kidnapping and killing others. We have coordination plans with  the Government Ministry and police to support our operations.  This means we already have guidelines. At a higher level, we  met with the Presidency in January of last year, and we agreed  on the general guidelines of plans to fight armed subversion.    [Espinoza] General, is it true that you do not want to leave  the Army, your post of Army commander?    [Ortega] That is completely false. In November, we presented  a draft bill to reform the current military law. The bill  covers everything related to the military career and my presence.    The problem is not whether or not I want to leave. The  fundamental problem is the precedent that will be set. We, and  I in particular, want for the Army to be supported, as soon as  possible and in the framework of its professionalization  process, by a new law in order that military processes are duly  respected by the various national governments that may exist in  the future. This institution should be seen as a permanent  institution of the Nicaraguan state, and it should not depend on  government changes that could take place every six years.  Otherwise, the institution will be weakened and suffer greatly.    I am prepared to leave my post. I think I have played a  specific role in the formation of a national army which had  never existed in Nicaragua's history. The EPS is being  consolidated in an irreversible fashion. All we need is the law  on the Army. The law needing approval duly establishes when I  am to leave. Most important is this: I will leave because of a  civilized and modern institutionalization process and not  because of foreign pressure or because of the whims of people  who not only want me to leave, but also want to put an end to  the Army and to humiliate us. This is what we cannot accept.    [Espinoza] If this law were approved in 1994, would you  leave  in 1994, as the president has said?    [Ortega] It is most important that my retirement be a true  consequence of the Army's institutionalization and modernization  process and not result from moments when polemics existed  because of pressure, or result from a lack of understanding, or  from situations we do not want to encourage. The date of my  retirement is not important but, rather, how I take this step  without going against the principles, the dignity, or,  especially, the pride of the Army, which cannot be subjected to  foreign pressure or to whims.    If an agreement were to be reached and my departure covered  by a legal framework, then this would prove to be a decision  made by the Nicaraguan people and not the product of foreign  pressure. My departure would then be an expression of maturity.  This is why the way in which this law is discussed is  important. It is also important that our character is evident  during an appropriate and honorable departure, which is what we  want.    [Espinoza] Let us suppose that these conditions are not met  in 1994 and that you, because of what you have explained, do not  retire. Would that not be the same as disregarding the  authority of the president, who has insisted on your retirement?    [Ortega] I think it is important to trust that we will reach  an agreement with the executive to contribute to the country's  stability. This is what is most important. In terms of a lack  of compliance with the executive, I think we are functioning  within the framework of current laws. According to the  Constitution and our current laws, we are acting legally and  appropriately. I believe it is important to follow the law.  The political aspect is also important, as is the image of  maturity that the Nicaraguan people -- and, in particular, their  leaders -- must display. I hope we may have a suitable dialogue  with President Chamorro to overcome the lack of understanding  and vexation that was created on 2 September and ultimately find  a way beneficial to all Nicaraguans. This should not be viewed  as injuring the nation's pride or honor but, rather, as a  contribution to modernity, institutionality, and the law.  [passage omitted]    [Espinoza] One final question: During the past decade, the  Army and various sectors of the population faced a war that was  publicly and officially sponsored by parts of the U.S.  Government. Our Army and people confronted the United States.  How would you describe now the relations between the EPS and  the U.S. Government and its agencies?    [Ortega] I think they have evolved favorably. We have  excellent relations with the U.S. Armed Forces within the  framework of the current U.S. Administration's policy of  limiting U.S. military cooperation with Latin American and  Central American armed forces. The United States has a policy  that supports the area's various military institutions, but this  support is almost trivial.    Within this framework we have an adequate relationship. We  have exchanges, and we have had no significant problem with the  U.S. Armed Forces. We participate in all the Latin American  military events that take place. We have been acknowledged.  Next year we want to have a representative on the  Inter-American Defense Board. Our representative is not there  yet, but not because of obstacles, but because we have not had  enough money to maintain an official there, because it costs  thousands of dollars to have an official representing the Army  there, and, so far, we have not had this chance.    We have students in France and students who have been in  Spain. We also have exchanges with the United States. In the  field of medicine we have had 15 exchanges. We have a U.S. Air  Force military attache and a U.S. Armed Forces general affairs  military attache. I think the United States has basically  realized that Nicaragua's Army is the Army we have. The United  States now clearly understands that any effort aimed at  overthrowing this Army by backing those who oppose the EPS means  immersing Nicaragua in a war that they do not want, because they  want stability in Central America to enable them to have more  significant trade relations in the region.    The United States views the EPS as a fait accompli. This  Army is a reality, and the United States has acknowledged this.    [Espinoza] We thank Army General Humberto Ortega for being  on  "Extravision" this evening. We have talked broadly. We hope  that this talk cleared doubts and answered the question that  viewers have probably had for months. Thank you and good night.</p>

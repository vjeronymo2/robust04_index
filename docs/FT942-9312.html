			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Plan for old power stations faces rejection Large electricity users are to tell the government that the idea that they might buy spare generating capacity to help keep their costs down is unlikely to be practicable. They say the costs of improving older power stations to meet new laws on sulphur dioxide emissions would be prohibitive. Their electricity would eventually cost more than they pay now from the 'pool' run by the generators. Even to buy a plant and run it unimproved until the new laws come into effect in the year 2001 would involve higher costs than the pool, as they would be liable for redundancy payments, decommissioning, demolition and environmental clean-ups, possibly costing more than Pounds 100m a plant. A delegation of big users, Tory and Labour MPs, and council leaders is arranging to see Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, in the next few weeks. The move will dash government hopes that selling power stations to big users could solve their pool-prices problem. Under the pool system, the price of electricity varies every half-hour and is fixed at the marginal cost of production of the last available plant brought on stream to fill national demand. Winter tea-times should be the costliest periods. In practice, prices have varied according to what plant is 'available'. Imperial Chemical Industries has warned it might pull out of energy-intensive chlorine production - threatening more than 7,000 jobs - if the issue was not resolved. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, last year persuaded the generators to peg pool prices to an annual average of 2.4p per kWh and obtained a commitment from them to offer spare generating capacity for sale. ICI, Pilkington and British Steel are among several companies that have formed a loose consortium to consider buying the 2,000MW Fiddlers Ferry power station at Widnes, only a few miles from ICI's chlorine plant at Runcorn, Cheshire, and Pilkington's glass factories at St Helens, Merseyside. The electricity generators paid the government Pounds 100,000 for each MW of generating capacity on privatisation, so Fiddlers Ferry would have cost PowerGen about Pounds 200m. The asking price is therefore likely to be in the Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m range. But the plant is an obsolete coal-fired station and operates only because the government's pollution inspectorate tolerates its emissions of sulphur dioxide. Some members of the consortium say there is a risk it could be shut down at any time. Power Generation Equipment, separate section</p>

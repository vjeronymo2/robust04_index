			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Patrick Sabatier report: "Paris-Tokyo, the Price of a </F> Difficult Dialogue"]    [Text] Tokyo -- A few minutes before his meeting with  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Alain Juppe was not entirely  sure that it would take place. The Japanese diplomats assembled  in the antechamber of the government chief's residence were  anxiously following the debate under way in the Diet  (Parliament), where the opposition was blocking the vote on a  budget without which the government could not have functioned.  Meetings were shortened or canceled for the same reason.    It is therefore a conflicting assessment which the foreign  minister drew from the visit he made to Tokyo from 31 March to 2  April. On the one hand, he had "the impression of a real desire  by Japan to do something with France." On the other, he was  able to assess the limits and difficulties of a "political  dialogue" which his visit ("the first bilateral visit for seven  years," he pointed out) was aimed at reopening after a period of  relative "negligence" following the tensions created in 1991 by  Edith Cresson's remarks about Japanese "ants."    The problems of the heterogeneous coalition which Mr.  Hosokawa heads and the realities of a severe economic recession  mean that Japan is still more focused on its internal problems  than usual. Alain Juppe was also able to observe that Japan's  foreign policy is limited almost entirely to relations with the  United States. "Sixty-five percent of our diplomacy is concerned  with Washington, 25 percent with our Asian neighbors, and 10  percent with the rest of the world, of which 5 percent is with  Europe in general. In that, France does not account for more  than 2 percent," a Japanese diplomat said, despite being a lover  of France.    Juppe twice heard Hosokawa stress the "special relationship"  which links Tokyo and Washington. The Japanese certainly  expected French support against the threats of American economic  sanctions. Juppe criticized "unilateralism" while "hammering  home" to his interlocutors that the Europeans would not smile on  Japanese-American agreements giving preference to American  interests alone. But, outside these tactics of the big  three-sided game of international trade, can there be a real  "political dialogue" between Paris and Tokyo when France has its  highest trade deficit with this country (23 billion francs in  1993) and when it continues to revolve around America?    "We are forced to have a dialogue with Tokyo," the Quai  d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] replied. First, because Japan has  become an economic and financial power (the second in the world)  which is strictly speaking impossible to ignore. For instance,  Alain Juppe approached his hosts asking them to participate in  support for the policy of devaluing the CFA franc in Africa, and  helping to try to save Algeria (of which they are the second  biggest creditor). And the most practical plans discussed  related to cooperation for development in Africa and Indochina.  In addition, Juppe said, "a country which has this economic  power will not remain a political dwarf." The Japanese are also  more present, not only in Asia but on theaters as diverse as  Africa, Latin America, and the Near East, and in the  international bodies. Tokyo is lobbying for a seat as a  permanent member of the UN Security Council and Paris is in  favor of that.    "This is no longer 1945," Alain Juppe pointed out. "The  world has changed..." However, it is necessary to find a way of  expanding the Council without reducing its efficacy and without  offending other candidates for a seat (India, Egypt, or Brazil).  Above all, Japan would have to be prepared to meet the  obligations of this status, starting with the dispatch of troops  to take part in peacekeeping operations. However, it, like  Germany, has not solved the constitutional and political  problems which hamper it. The complexity of the question means  that the French minister finds it "difficult to see how things  could be decided in 1995" (on the 50th anniversary of the United  Nations).    The menacing question of North Korea's nuclear ambitions is  more urgent. Japan preaches caution and moderation whereas  France advocates a firm stance. "Our main concern is  proliferation," Alain Juppe explained. France is campaigning  for a definitive renewal of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in  1995. The Japanese position is more ambiguous. They sometimes  link the question of the NPT and North Korea with that of the  ending of nuclear tests. This is an embarrassing link for  France which intends "to reserve the right to conduct a series  of additional tests," deemed vital to the modernization of the  deterrent force.    The French even go so far as to suspect the Japanese of not  being very enthusiastic about ratifying an NPT which would  prevent them from equipping themselves with nuclear weapons if  necessary. It may be here that the French desire for "dialogue"  finds its most convincing justification. In the long term, one  diplomat explained in fact, if Japan becomes a big power "like  the others," it is preferable to "bind the giant in every  possible way by urging it to participate in a responsible way in  the international community," to "channel the desire for power  in the right direction," as Juppe puts it.    The latter left Tokyo for a visit to India (2 through 5  April) then China (where he will join Edouard Balladur on 6  April) at a time when the cherry trees were producing their  first blossoms. Is this a promise of a new Franco-Japanese  spring? Mr. Hosokawa should be in Paris in early May, followed  by Emperor Akihito in the fall. But the Franco-Japanese hopes  and good intentions have hitherto been forgotten as regularly as  the blossoms falling from the cherry trees....</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S BEST: REAL BACON  </P> <P> Corralitos Sausage Co.  </P> <P> 569 Corralitos Road  </P> <P> Watsonville, Calif. 95076  </P> <P> (408) 722-2633  </P> <P> Brochure Available  </P> <P> Orders shipped C.O.D.  </P> <P> If bringing home the bacon isn't as easy as it used to be, maybe you are  bringing home the wrong bacon.  </P> <P> These days, most bacon that you buy seems to be all fat. When it's cooked, it  shrivels into almost nothing until you are left with a pan full of grease.  </P> <P> The bacon from the Corralitos Sausage Co. is different. For more than 30 years,  this small Central California company has been using Pajaro Valley apple wood  to slow-smoke beef and pork. Lean and lightly salted, their bacon is smoked  naturally, with no additives and none of that artificial maple flavor you so  often find.  </P> <P> Fry up a few slices, and the smoky scent of the apple wood will fill up your  kitchen. You'd swear you were sitting in front of a roaring fire in an alpine  log cabin. But at $3.29 a pound, the bacon is a lot less expensive than a trip  to the mountains. The bacon freezes beautifully, so it's best to save on  postage and order several pounds at once. Shipping charges on five pounds of  bacon run $5.60. KATHIE JENKINS  </P></p>

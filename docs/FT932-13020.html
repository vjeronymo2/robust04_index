			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Where the blast hit hardest NATWEST TOWER COMPLEX No. 15 Bishopsgate.  Sole occupier, National Westminister Bank. Structural damage to the tower is minor.  The complex at street level has been blown through, although the damage is mostly superficial. Work is in progress to replace an estimated 3,000-4,000 sq metres of glass, and fittings. No. 99 BISHOPSGATE Main occupier is Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, but many floors are sublet to other tenants.  The office block sustained serious damage. The blast blew through all the walls leaving just an outer shell.  Damage was also sustained by some of the supporting pillars. Engineers are attempting to make the building safe but are being hampered by falling glass.  No decision has yet been taken on whether to demolish the building. PALMERSTON HOUSE No. 55 Bishopsgate.  Sole occupier Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Serious blast damage has been sustained, but the structure remains intact.  The fascia has been largely destroyed, along withe internal fixtures and fittings.  Engineers are engaged in further safety checks before repair work can start. Nos. 38-68 BISHOPSGATE Other offices and shops.  Despite heavy superficial damage, the structures of the next few hundred yards of buildings remain sound. Glass and fittings have been blown out and some internal walls have collapsed.  Repair work is being hampered by hazardous conditions. Nos. 20-26 WORMWOOD STREET The Victorian parade of small retailing units bore the side impact of the blast, which ripped out frontages and inflicted serious damage.  Demolition is considered likely. No. 90 BISHOPSGATE Sole occupier is the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.  The building bore some of the brunt of the blast, sustaining structural damage.  All the interior walls have been blown through.  Demolition is under consideration. Engineers are being hampered by the poor state of the neighbouring building. KANSALLIS HOUSE Nos. 76-86 Bishopsgate.  Party sublet.  The building took the full impact of the explosion.  No internal walls or fittings have survived. The exterior has been extensively destroyed and reinforced concrete supporting pillars are dangerously exposed.  A buckled wall is said to be supporting the entire structure.  Demolition is a neccessity. However, the bomb crater is making building work difficult. ST ETHELBURGA CHURCH Smallest and one of the oldest churches in the City, it is now 'a pile of rubble', according to one visiting engineer.</p>

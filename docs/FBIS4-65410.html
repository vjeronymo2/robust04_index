			<p>BFN     [Text] During a one-day visit to Sweden, Polish Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski had talks in Stockholm with Foreign  Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. Minister Olechowski pointed out  that Sweden, in entering the European Union [EU], will open the  way to that organization for Poland and other Central and East  European states. In his opinion, if Swedish society votes in  the November referendum against Sweden's entry into the EU, this  will probably make it impossible to start negotiations for other  states to enter -- including Poland.    Margaretha af Ugglas stressed that her government was in  favor of an open Europe and supported the Central and East  European states' strivings to enter the EU.</p>

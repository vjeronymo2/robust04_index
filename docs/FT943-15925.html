			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / France deeper in Rwanda morass: Leslie Crawford reports that neutrality is becoming harder to maintain France's decision to create civilian safe havens in Rwanda has set the stage for another foreign military entanglement in Africa of unknown duration and unpredictable results. The plan, backed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, but not yet endorsed by an increasingly uneasy Security Council, lays France open to charges that its humanitarian intervention was a thinly veiled disguise to prop up the collapsing regime of a former military client. After the capture this week of the capital Kigali and Butare, Rwanda's second-largest town, by rebel forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), most government soldiers and hundreds of thousands of civilians have taken refuge behind French lines in south-western Rwanda. It is becoming increasingly difficult for France to maintain the pretence of neutrality. The French have drawn a 10km cordon sanitaire around Gikongoro, the next big town to the west of Butare, which the RPF will not be allowed to cross. Commandos have taken up position on hilltops around the town, picking out sites for heavy mortars, machine guns and anti-tank missiles. Some 300 Foreign Legionnaires are already dug in to halt a further advance of guerrillas less than 20km away. The French have not disarmed Rwandan government soldiers at Gikongoro; many can be seen at barricades set up by French marines and paratroops. France's 'humanitarian' mission has blurred two issues: the genocide against the Tutsi minority, which French forces arrived too late to prevent, and a civil war which began in 1990. From the start of Operation Turquoise a fortnight ago, French forces have tried to equate the suffering of the few thousand Tutsis who escaped mass slaughter with the plight of hundreds of thousands of Hutus who have fled the rebel advance. Central to their argument for setting up civilian protection zones is the belief that Hutus would also be slaughtered if the RPF were allowed to overrun government-held territory. The International Committee of the Red Cross says few incidents of revenge killings have occurred in the two-thirds of the country controlled by the RPF. But in the Hutu refugee camps sprouting around Gikongoro, most people believe reports of blood-curdling rebel atrocities broadcast on government radio stations, but when questioned, no one has witnessed such events. 'The Tutsi have dug wells 60 metres deep to hide the Hutus they have killed,' a young Hutu militiaman manning a road block near Gikongoro says. 'That is how they have concealed the evidence of their crimes.' Such propaganda played a big role in inciting Hutus to slaughter their Tutsi neighbours in the weeks after President Juvenal Habyarimana's death in an air crash in April. Government radio accused the Tutsi-led RPF of shooting down the president's aircraft. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, the RPF calls the French protection zones 'a safe haven for the authors and perpetrators of the genocide. We have always believed and still maintain that the real motive behind the unilateral French intervention in Rwanda is to prop up the discredited regime (and) preserve a role for these murderers in the future politics of Rwanda,' the letter says. While the Security Council awaits the report of a special UN rapporteur on the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda, human rights groups are urging France to arrest those individuals responsible for directing the attrocities. Not only are the French unlikely to do so, they will be hard-pressed to find Hutu leaders acceptable to the RPF to negotiate an end to the conflict. Most moderate Hutu community leaders have been murdered by Hutu extremists. But some of the most ardent supporters of a negotiated settlement are to be found among the Tutsi survivors, now herded in French-guarded refugee camps in government-held territory. 'If the RPF really wants to save Tutsi lives,' says a Tutsi priest, 'they should bring this war to an end.'</p>

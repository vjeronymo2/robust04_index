There is always great  hope that you and your brother workers will make your people  really feel that everyday you extend to them a higher level of  service than others in the same circumstances could offer them.    Among the things that we know is the fact that when one  supposes that he has done his best and cannot offer a higher  level of service he will stop both his intellectual development  and the introduction of new challenges or incentives for  himself. In this country, the state of Iraq--knowing that you  are its ministers--such a feeling should be unknown to us all.  We should feel satisfied--should anything we do actually call  for satisfaction--with what we have offered, along with the  strong feeling that we can offer something still better in  quality and taking into account the calculations of quantity or  numbers.    The circumstances of your people are difficult. They have  been imposed on us by the unjust despot. Leading those who are  taking the position of doing harm to and premeditated malice  against the Iraqi people are the United States and Zionism. The  blockade has been continuing for four years, that is since the  cease-fire went into effect after a decision made by the former  U.S. President on 28 February 1991. We have thus far dealt with  the Security Council resolutions as part of the diplomatic  efforts and what they suggest in terms of possibilities designed  to overcome any obstacle and deal with the unfair resolutions in  a way that achieves a better level of understanding by the  Security Council.    We hoped, and perhaps we expected or rather many people in  our country and the world expected that this level of dealings  on the part of Iraq, although the resolutions are unfair and  unjust and carry a measure of premeditated malice by known  people in the Security Council who have an effective role in  passing the resolutions, including the United States, would  realize a level of achievement--despite the unfair  resolutions--that would make some people, whose hearts have no  feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again to  the Iraqi people so they can live in freedom, as they should.    However, others were quite convinced that the criminal  level of the aggression and the way sanctions were implemented  on Iraq, including the embargo resolution, came from minds  without any conscience.    Therefore, despite Iraq's offers and responses, those  concerned will discover that there is nothing being given in  return. Besides, what was talked about in terms of Security  Council obligations is nothing more than a tactical cover to  make Iraq fulfill its obligations without the Security Council  having to fulfill its own obligations. This is because members  of the Security Council do not have enough freedom to say what  they want to say. Moreover, the Security Council does not have  standards based on fairness and justice because there are those  who oppose such standards and can influence them in the opposite  direction.    As I have repeatedly said, there is a daily instigator that  encourages America and Zionism to conspire against the Arab  nation. According to the treasonous and tendentious ones, Iraq  is among the first against whom they should conspire. This is  because of Iraq's stand toward the principles which make the  Arab nation gain more honor--after it further enhances its honor  based on our nation's inherited high standards and behavior.  Iraq is working in this direction and is known for its stand on  entrenching these values.    Everyday one commission comes and another one goes. They  have destroyed the weapons, the plants, and the factories they  wanted to destroy--apart from what had already been destroyed by  their warplanes and missiles. They got all the information they  asked for. They said they wanted future guarantees before  fulfilling their obligations toward Iraq. Despite this, Iraq  agreed on the so- called long-term monitoring.    All the resolutions that deal with Iraq's obligations were  implemented according to the sequence set by the Security  Council and in accordance with the priorities of these  resolutions. Despite all this, they still tell Iraqi diplomats  that if you did this then it will be possible to lift the  embargo or at least implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687.  We mean section C of Resolution 687.    After the initial resolutions, they issued a series of  resolutions, some of which do not represent the essence of the  initial resolutions. At times, the latter resolutions were even  in contradiction with some paragraphs of the initial  resolutions, on which the conditions for Iraq's withdrawal from  Kuwait and Iraq's compliance with the destruction of the  so-called weapons of mass destruction were built. This includes  Resolution 715. At last, we asked: What is left? They said:  Only this resolution, no. 715, is left. As soon as you approve  it, we will write a report to the UN Security Council. We said:  Iraq's obligations have been fulfilled, you should fulfill  yours, starting with the implementation of Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687. In short, this paragraph provides for allowing  Iraq to export its products, chiefly oil. Iraq said: We are  not convinced that this resolution should be discussed now. We  should work in accordance with the sequence of the clauses of  Resolution 687 and its mutual obligations. However, we approved  that resolution in order to end our people's suffering. They  responded: What? No. First, we will start monitoring and make  sure that Iraq is implementing it the way we want--the way Ekeus  wants--in order to make sure that Iraq is committed. Afterward,  we will consider submitting a report to the UN Security Council  so that it would look into Paragraph 22. Well, we asked, when  will you start? You have already started monitoring, have you  not? What is monitoring? Does it require anything more than  installing cameras? We asked: In your assessment, how long  would this process take? You have already started it. The  cameras are installed and recording. We said: Fine, when will  you start to count time? Ekeus said the operation may take six  months. After he departed, he said that some say six months,  some say one year. Who are those some? Well, when will we  start? What about those months that you have already spent  monitoring? Are not they counted? When will you tell us that  you have started, so that we can start counting? How long do  you need? Three months, four months, six months? When can we  say, for example, one or two months have passed, four months to  go? This is needed so that the Iraqi people will be able to  make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves  psychologically and economically for the required duration. He  kept coming and going, everyday emerging with statements without  a clear specification of the time after which the implementation  of Paragraph 22 can start.    Well, how long will the Iraqi people wait, and how can they  accept the diplomacy of the fox of the jungle? We and the Iraqi  people have spent much time hearing this and contacting and  seeing people. It is their right to choose alternatives if they  discover that this way will not lead to a positive result that  can save them from this injustice or put them in a better  position to be able to deal with life without this injustice;  namely, the blockade and the parallels imposed on northern and  southern Iraq.    On this occasion, the Security Council says in one of its  resolutions that it is obliged to do everything that will secure  Iraq's sovereignty. Isn't that true, specialists? Well, where  is Iraq's sovereignty? It is the Security Council's permanent  member states that imposed these parallels in violation of  Iraq's sovereignty. They issue resolutions but they do not  apply them when it comes to their obligations and they even  violate them in public.    Deputy Prime Minister comrade Tariq 'Aziz is scheduled to  leave for the UN Security Council. He will clearly explain to  them that we have fulfilled our obligations. According to logic  and fair and just treatment, they have to fulfill their  obligations. If they do not implement their obligations now,  they will not have the simplest excuse with which to cover their  delay. They should implement Provision 22 immediately and  without any conditions.    If comrade Tariq 'Aziz returns without obtaining the  Security  Council's agreement to meet its obligations and if there is no  hope that the injustice will be lifted from the Iraqi people,  then the Iraqi people and their leadership can do nothing else  but decide what they believe will give them hope, God willing,  in the direction they believe is sound. Therefore, the  ministers should take steps to prolong their people's patience  as much as much possible and to speed up efforts to achieve as  much public service as possible. Rely on God.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Kashmir guerrillas flourish under iron fist: India's brutal methods have helped a small insurgency spread THE handful of armed separatists Indian security forces faced in Kashmir three years ago have grown into groups of militants with a total strength running into thousands and spread across the region. They are now better armed, self-consciously revelling in the Kalashnikovs, rocket-launchers, revolvers, handgrenades and automatic weapons captured from Indian troops. Many are being trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Srinagar, the militants appear to have established 'no-go' areas in parts of the city that are surrounded by Indian paramilitary forces, but into which the Indians dare not go except in strength. The most important factor boosting the militants' cause has been the harsh, repressive measures used by Indian forces. Mr Girish Saxena, the governor of the state, concedes the damage atrocities have done. 'In our efforts to keep down the level of alienation and increase confidence,' he says, 'any excess sets us back.' Though security forces are showing more restraint in Srinagar and some other towns, the governor's orders seem largely ignored in search operations carried out in villages. India's paramilitary forces in the state are overstretched, ill-disciplined and in-creasingly hardened to the use of brutality. As with most insurgency movements that have spread rapidly, the expansion of the revolution has created its own disorders. There has been a mushrooming of guerrilla factions - somewhat reminiscent of Lebanon - competing and quarrelling among themselves. What is clear is that the best armed and trained are the fundamentalist groups like the Hezb-e-Mujahideen, which backs the Pakistani claim to the valley . Militant groups impose their own system of 'taxation', levying contributions at gunpoint from traders and businessmen. They intimidate officials to ensure that taxes, telephone and electricity bills remain unpaid. Increasingly they determine what new appointments are made and how funds (made available from New Delhi) are spent. They have destroyed whatever hopes there were of reviving tourism this year by kidnapping two Swedes. Other pillars of the economy - handicrafts and the marketing of fresh fruit  -have also been crippled. Wealthier Kashmiri Moslems are leaving the valley, announcing their departures as temporary. The governor, and some of his officials, see encouraging signs in growing public weariness of the tension and disruption. In Srinagar there has been a strong popular reaction against the recent wave of kidnappings. A large crowd turned out recently for the funeral of a senior police official shot in Srinagar. More people are seeking the administration's help in face of the difficulties of daily life. Intelligence reports apparently indicate that some of the militant groups are ready to respond to Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's offer of talks. Individual militants are said to be fed up with a struggle that they - no more than the Indian forces - can win militarily, and which will probably lead to their own death. 'People now believe - and this goes for 90 per cent of the population - that this course of armed violence cannot achieve any objective. It is bound to fail,' says Mr Saxena. In these circumstances he adds: 'The (government's) objective is to give a chance to anyone who is prepared to join the mainstream and take part in the political process.' But hopes of meaningful talks with the militants that could bring about a political solution still seem to be wishful thinking. There is no government in New Delhi with the authority to make concessions. The main political parties are deeply divided over how much autonomy India is willing to grant to a Moslem-dominated area on Pakistan's borders. There are equally deep divisions between the military and the civilian leadership in Kashmire over the balance to be struck between the use of the carrot and the stick. Mr Saxena, who became governor a year ago, clearly favours more carrot. But the ill-trained and often ill-educated paramilitary forces on which he depends are more familiar with the more blunt methods of torture and brutality. That way the insurgency continues to spread.</p>

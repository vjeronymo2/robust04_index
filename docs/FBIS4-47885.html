			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Possible Viljoen Ministerial Portfolio Viewed -- "Constand  Viljoen, Minister of Defence?" asks the Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 5 May in a page-12 editorial. "On one level that is  an outlandish notion, requiring both an other-worldly degree of  ANC magnanimity and a somersault from the Freedom Front. Almost  impossible. But now that South Africa is in the business of  pulling off the impossible, here's one to consider closely."  THE STAR urges that the ANC keep 2 points in mind: Viljoen's  "3 percent looks microscopic on the bar charts, but translated  into a proportion of the men in tank cockpits and airport  control towers it assumes a new magnitude altogether."  Secondly, the editorial questions whether "there are other  hands better able to carry through 'effective' affirmative  action". "Superficially a Viljoen appointment would fly in the  face of both parties policies. Deeply examined it might serve  both, and the nation," concludes the THE STAR.  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Need for Principled Finance Minister -- "The Finance  Ministry  will arguably be the most important department in the new  government," declares the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English  on 5 May in a page-12 editorial. "It is also likely to be the  most unpopular, as the principal function of Nelson Mandela's  first finance minister will be to say no. President Mandela  will rule a country of expectations which cannot be realised, of  promises which cannot all be met, certainly not in the short  term." As disappointed as the business community may be if  Derek Keys is not allowed to continue in his job, Keys may not  be the "right person to turn down" the "flood of requests for  money." "There is a strong argument to be made that keeping  Cabinet colleagues to their spending limits will take more than  Keys's determination and understanding of the economy; it will  require someone with deep ANC roots and party authority to have  those limitations accepted in the Cabinet and by an expectant  populace."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   IEC Running of Election Viewed -- "Let us start by  complimenting the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] for  accomplishing the impossible," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN  in English on 5 May in a page-8 editorial. "It is, however,  with some regret that we have to record some shocking mistakes  that could have sent us back to square one. The halt in the  counting of the results is just not good enough." The editorial  criticizes the postponement of the formal induction of Mandela,  the sitting of the regional legislatures, and celebrations.  "Having said all that we must be generous in our thanks that  things have come to this point without too much distress and  hardly any violence."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Local Skills Must Be Used -- Johannesburg RAPPORT in  Afrikaans on 1 May says in a page-14 editorial: "Events around  the past week's general election identified two important  guidelines for the future, which were indicated long before a  start was made at counting the votes: how the country could be  governed to prosperity in the future, and how it should not be  done. The IEC, no doubt with the best intentions in the world,  demonstrated how things should not be done. Despite the  greatest plans and funding, which ran into the better part of a  billion rands, members of the commission and their extended but  untested staff proved that theory and practice are far from  being the same thing." "The IEC, starry-eyed and mesmerized by  affirmative action, decided to keep the Department of Home  Affairs at arm's length, and did the same to the local printing  industry, and even the security forces, all of which had to be  eventually drawn into the printing and delivery of ballot  papers." "This country is blessed with a wealth of people who  are not only ready to help build a new dispensation, but are  also of inestimable value for the development of future skills.  After all, practical skills and their application are the real  capital of the new era, never mind how much money is or is not  available. The same applies to the government. There are many  businessmen who managed to keep the wheels of state turning  under difficult circumstances -- sanctions, boycotts, and a  shrinking world economy." The country will need them, says  RAPPORT, "because in the final analysis it is the people who  will make this country succeed, with a little bit of give and  take."    Need To Handle Far-Right With Sympathy -- In an article on  page 14 of RAPPORT, Z.B. du Toit notes: "The word  `reconciliation' is high on the list of the new government of  national unity which was elected this week. But there is a  significant group, generally referred to in the media as  `far-right', who show little inclination towards that. A group  of journalists experienced this at first hand on Thursday when  they faced the hatred and venom of about 250 AWB [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] supporters at a rally at  Boekenhoutfontein," where the journalists became "the target of  an eruption of bitterness by people who reject the new order  with astonishing intensity. From statements it was clear that  it was not only the coming to power of a new government that was  unacceptable, but also that such an event was seen as a triumph  of evil over good." "The AWB rally was only a small sample of  the deep feeling of rejection and estrangement by the  far-right." Du Toit continues: "Yet even at the root of the  far-right's estrangement there must be a deep awareness that  their leaders could not stem the new South Africa; that  right-wing resistance politics has failed for the past two  decades. For understandable reasons the blame is placed not on  their own leaders who tried during this time to entrench a white  minority government... No, the principles of the democratic wave  with the vote for all is simply ignored." "If reconciliation  between white and black is a real challenge in the new  dispensation, it will be a much greater task to bind the  far-right back into society. At this point such a possibility  looks remote," but "a new government, in addition to all its  other tasks, will have to try to understand the roots of the  far-right estrangement and handle it with sympathy. In this,  the Afrikaners in the new government and Parliament will have to  actively assist. Otherwise the nice young boys and girls cutely  dressed in khaki at the AWB rally will grow up quite normally as  a new estranged generation. Estranged, and with a growing  resentment, and therefore increasingly dangerous. That must be  prevented, because it is totally unnecessary."</p>

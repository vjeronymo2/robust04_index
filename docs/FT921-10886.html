			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Light profit-taking hits share prices NEW uncertainties on the political and economic fronts discouraged UK equity investors yesterday and share prices gave ground in sluggish trading. However, there was no shortage of corporate features to enliven the market. Profit-taking was encouraged by nervousness over the UK political outlook and by doubts on the near term prospects for Wall Street. Last weekend brought indications in the latest UK opinion polls of reviving support for the Labour party, and of increasing bitterness in the general election campaign already effectively under way. London showed only a cautious response to the developments in the wage negotiations in the German steel industry. UK investors feared that the compromise agreement might provoke the Bundesbank to raise German interest rates, thereby snuffing out hopes of an early cut in UK base rates. However, optimism on UK rates was encouraged by another steady performance from the pound yesterday. Stock index futures provided a lead for the underlying market but the March contract on the FT-SE Index closed well below 2,600, leaving the stock market without direction at the end of the session. Among the privatisation issues, which have been closely linked to the opinion poll fortunes of the Conservative government, water stocks gave ground as some market analysts took a fresh look at the sector. Elsewhere in the market, share prices suffered modest profit-taking but the FT-SE Index bounced when it approached the 2,500 area at mid-session. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,560.2, for a fall on the day of 11 points. Traders pointed out that this is the final week of an equity account which has brought significant gains in shares and that the dearth of company news ahead may have encouraged investors to take their profits in case prices sag at the end of the week. Seaq volume fell to 414.8m shares from the 668.5m recorded on Friday, when retail or customer business remained high at Pounds 1.4bn. The increase in retail business on days when the FT-SE Index has been rising tends to confirm that the institutions are willing to top up portfolios when they feel more confident about the outlook. The concern over Wall Street proved unjustified, for the time being at least, and the Dow Industrial Average was two points ahead when London closed for the day. But UK analysts remained cautious ahead of the meeting of the Opec ministers in the middle of the month. Among the day's features, a cloud continued to hang over the brewery sector following Friday's reports that the UK Office of Fair Trading had made an unexpected ruling regarding a planned deal between Allied-Lyons and Brent Walker. The picture was complicated by the Allied boardroom's rejection of bid speculation. There was further demand for Reuters, the global data communications group, after the UK press reported strong recommendations for the shares from London brokerage houses, some of which claim that the group now merits an international market rating similar to that accorded the top grade pharmaceutical stocks which dominated world equity markets during the 1980s.</p>

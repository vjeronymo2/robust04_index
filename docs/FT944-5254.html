			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Machine tool chiefs to meet Treasury Leaders of the Machine Tool Technologies Association are to meet officials from the Treasury on Wednesday to hear why manufacturing industry's plea for increased capital allowances was rejected in last week's Budget. Mr Stan Vaughan, association president, will head the delegation which is likely to express disappointment at the short shrift given by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to the pleas. The association, which represents Britain's machine tool builders, was one of seven industrial associations which wrote to Mr Clarke in October asking for increased allowances to stimulate 'permanently higher levels' of industrial investment. But Mr Clarke said in his Budget speech that the argument for higher allowances had a 'simplistic appeal' and would distort investment decisions. He restated the government's philosophy of favouring lower overall corporation tax rather than higher allowances. Ironically, forecasts released by the association late last week predict strong growth over the next three years in machine-tool investment in the UK and substantial increases in exports of machine tools. According to forecasts for the association by Mr John Walker of Oxford Economic Forecasting, sales of machine tools in the UK market will grow from Pounds 280m next year to Pounds 345m in 1996 and Pounds 380m in 1997. This reflects the significant improvement in company finances and relatively low interest rates. Also, says the association, the need to invest to maintain competitiveness will become increasingly important. The buoyant forecast for investment could be used as an argument against increased capital allowances, as it suggests that such a stimulus is not needed because of the upturn in industry's fortunes. But the association and other associations such as the Engineering Employers Federation have argued that under-investment is a long-term problem. The forecasts are derived from market surveys by the association and are based on a narrower definition of machine tools than that used for regular Central Statistical Office figures on the industry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Russia Will Have Its </F> Counterintelligence Doctrine"]    [Text] It is expected that this Thursday [26 May]  President Boris Yeltsin will sign the Fundamentals of Russia's  Counterintelligence Doctrine. The setting for this will be a  conference in the headquarters of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] with Russian  counterintelligence leaders.    Informed sources, in giving this information, noted that, in  the event that the results of the conference require any  modifications to this document, which has already been agreed in  principle, the signing will be postponed.    Let us recall that the president visited Foreign  Intelligence  Service headquarters some weeks ago. However, no conceptual  documents similar to those which have been prepared for the  conference in the FCS and which would have defined Russia's  [foreign] intelligence doctrine were elaborated for that  meeting. At the same time, the sources stressed, in his speech  to intelligence workers and in his more private talk with the  Foreign Intelligence Service leadership, Boris Yeltsin posed a  number of fundamental questions -- including on the subject of  cadres -- the essence and details of which are not yet being  made public, but which could also be interpreted as defining  some of the key guidelines of a possible [foreign] intelligence  doctrine.    The sources do not rule out that the counterintelligence  doctrine, if it is signed by the president, will be made public,  albeit with a number of cuts.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Redress for long-forgotten work Sir, It is clearly Proms season in your letters column too. I was delighted to be reminded of that long-forgotten work, Pascal's Wagner (Letters, July 26). Too gloomy and Germanic, however, to be representative of a now-reviving French philosophical-cum-musical tradition which always put the accent on lightness of touch, risk and extravagance. To redress matters, I hope to read that you will shortly be announcing the new production of Descartes' Ditties (arr. Attali). The first one goes: 'Je depense, donc je suis.'

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coking coal cut of Dollars 2 a tonne in new contract deal THE JAPANESE steel mills have struck their first coking coal contracts for 1993, bringing a Dollars 2 a tonne cut for top quality Australian hard coking coals. The settlement, to be announced in Tokyo and Sydney later today, will result in a new fob price of Dollars 49.30 and set the benchmark for Australian and Canadian sales throughout Asia. The Dollars 2 cut, rather than the actual price level itself, will also be required from the mills' US suppliers. The cut reflects the oversupply of hard coking coal throughout the world and the poor state of the steel mills' finances. It was made possible by the recent slide in the Australian dollar from US75 cents a year ago to 68 cents. The US producers, faced with increased costs and no currency benefit, will be hard pushed to match such a price cut. Although the price levels in Europe are different for the same coals, the settlement will probably see the start of European price negotiations in earnest. So far the only settlements appear to have been between the Polish state coal trader, Weglokoks, and its European customers - last Friday British Steel is believed to have agreed to a cut of about Dollars 2 for its Polish supplies. The Australian/Japanese settlement is also expected to open the way to a fairly swift agreement with Australia's steam coal suppliers. Steam coal price movements are normally linked with those of semi-soft coking coals, which have been cut by Dollars 2.50. There are hopes among suppliers that the cut will be closer to Dollars 2 but a recent accord between three South African suppliers and Japanese power companies on a reduction of Dollars 2.45 suggests these hopes will not be fulfilled. The new South African price of Dollars 30.59 a tonne, while lower than 1992's contract price levels, is well above the spot market throughout Europe and Asia with business being struck at below Dollars 25 fob in most markets. The Greek cement company Heracles has just struck an agreement for spot South African coal for about Dollars 23.50 a tonne. Similarly, the 1992 Australian price of Dollars 38.90 a tonne, is more than Dollars 10 higher than spot settlements into Asian and European markets.</p>

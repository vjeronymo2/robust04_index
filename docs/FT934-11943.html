			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (10): Welcome boost for companies - Japan JAPANESE companies, facing the need for financing more than ever before because of the depressed cash flow from falling profits and rising costs, have welcomed the rise in the Tokyo stock market since August. Thanks to the ministry of finance propping up the stock market by pumping in public pension funds, the Nikkei average has recovered 41 per cent from its six-year low, and companies have piled in to raise funds through equity-linked issues. A survey taken by the Nikkei Newsletter on Bond and Money, indicated that during the first six months of the business year to September, manufacturers saw a 4.9 per cent fall in cash flow from the previous year, while non-manufacturers faced a 9.7 per cent decline. A rise in redemption of equity-linked bonds issued during the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s is also still squeezing cashflow at companies. Domestic issuance of convertible bonds rose 2.2 times to Y722bn during the first six months to June. On the overseas markets, Japanese companies issued USDollars 7.3bn in warrant bonds, 47 per cent higher than the previous year, and USDollars 2.2bn in convertible bonds, an 11 per cent decline. On the overseas markets, companies shifted from the Eurodollar market to the Swiss market, due to lower costs and an easing in underwriting regulations. Eurodollar equity-linked issues fell 55.9 per cent during the April-June quarter to Y153.7bn from the previous quarter, but Swiss franc issues rose 2.1 times to Y244.1bn. The securities industry is hoping the ministry of finance will lift its ban on share offerings by listed companies, which has been in place since the market plunged in 1990, after Tuesday's debut by East Japan Railway. Meanwhile, corporate financiers point out that more Japanese companies, facing deteriorating earnings and a stock market which has moved sideways around the 20,000 level since mid-April, have been forced to turn to the straight bond market rather than to equity-linked financing. 'You need a volatile market for investors to become interested in equity-linked investments,' points out Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. According to the Bond Underwriters Association of Japan, Japanese companies raised a record Y59.5bn during September. Traders say that historically low interest rates also prompted the sharp increase, but companies face higher costs by raising capital through domestic corporate bonds rather than through equity-linked paper overseas. A growing awareness within the ministry of finance of the need for optional fund-raising measures amid the sluggish stock market and increasing reluctance among banks to lend, have prompted the gradual liberalisation of the domestic bond market. Last April, the ministry eased restrictions on companies eligible to finance on the corporate bond market. The emergency economic package announced last month also included the introduction of new products, such as bonds with shorter maturities and floating rate notes. However, the lack of a liquid secondary market, due to the 'buy and hold' strategy of most Japanese institutional investors, where once a bond is bought it is kept until maturity, has been a barrier to fully-fledged growth of the bond market. Foreign issuers are also concerned that the credit ratings are not properly reflected on bond prices. The lack of price differentiation between issuers with high credit ratings and low credit ratings is prompting an increasing number of overseas issuers with triple-A credit ratings to move away from the samurai market. Mr Mikio Fujii at Nomura Securities' fixed income department, laments: 'Japan's Samurai market is turning into a junk bond market because issuers with low credit ratings can issue at relatively cheap cost.' Market participants point out that several factors are preventing the domestic bond market from becoming more sophisticated. One reason is that many Japanese fund managers still do not evaluate options according to investment returns, making them oblivious of credit risk and pricing of the bonds. Financing costs are higher due to the trustee fees paid to banks, which act as guarantors in the case of a bankruptcy. The lack of a central clearing system for corporate bonds and the complicated registration procedure for transferring bonds from one investor to another, are also hampering growth of the secondary market. The ministry of finance and brokers have finally started to work on solving some of the structural problems. The ministry has called on a group of academics and members of the financial industry to study reforms for the secondary market. Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, says that attitudes of Japanese institutional investors towards credit risk, are gradually changing. Mr Masaru Kakutani, representative director of Moody's Japan, says investors are becoming more aware of credit risks at companies. This is because banks have become more reluctant to take on risks as trustees, and deregulation has allowed less creditworthy companies to raise funds.</p>

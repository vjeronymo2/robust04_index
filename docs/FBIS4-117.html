			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 1 SAPA -- The security forces have  been given wide-ranging powers in terms of the emergency  regulations which came into effect in kwaZulu/Natal on Thursday.  Regulations published on Friday in the Government Gazette  provide for the arrest and detention of those deemed to be a  threat to public safety and the maintenance of law and order.    Fines and a maximum of ten years imprisonment can be imposed  on any person convicted of an offence which include contravening  regulations prohibiting:     -  organising unauthorised military or para-military training  or the use and construction of weapons and ammunition;    -  interference with lawful gatherings (in terms of this  regulation no person may by words or conduct threaten others or  intimidate them;    -  contravening the prohibition on the carrying and displaying  of  weapons including firearms, assegais, spears, axes, pangas and  knobkierries;    -  publication, posession or dissemination of material  containing  threats to life or property; and    -  hindering any other person in the carrying out of his duties.       Organisers of any march should obtain prior written  magisterial permission for the procession, stipulating the exact  route and details such as time and venue.    The regulations also limit security forces' liability.    Security force members may arrest, without a warrant, any  person who in their opinion constitutes a threat to public  safety or the maintenance of law and order, subject to an order  obtained "not later than 24 hours after arrest".    A person may be detained under a written order from any  security force commissioned officer of the rank of captain or  above, "without hearing that person" if he or she is deemed to  constitute a threat.    "A person arrested ... may be released ... at any time but  shall be released or charged in a court of law after the  expiration of 30 days from the date of his arrest."    Those arrested may be questioned by security force members.    The minister is authorised to appoint "special advisers" to  visit detainees. If they deem an offence has been committed in  respect of the detainee they can submit a report to Defence  Minister Kobie Coetsee or the attorney-general.    Security forces may also, without warrant, enter and search  premises and seize objects if deemed necessary.    The emergency regulations also provide for the minister, in  consultation with the Transitional Executive Council, to appoint  "control officers" for any area defined by him.    The Independent Electoral Commission may second a suitably  experienced international observer to control officers who have  powers to close-off areas and control entry, traffic flow,  temporary closing of any public or private place and control of  any essential services.    The regulations also empower security force members to  order any person or persons out of any area if they are  reasonably deemed to be endangering public safety or public  order. If they refuse, security forces may arrest them or  remove them.</p>

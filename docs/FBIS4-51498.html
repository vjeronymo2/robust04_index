			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 4 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA carried a  report on pages 1, 11 citing the 2 March edition of CAMBODIA  DAILY concerning an anti-FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] rally  held "outside Phnom Penh" on 1 March. Some 200 "former"  FUNCINPEC supporters claimed that party officials had promised  to find them jobs during the election campaign, but now those  officials are demanding bribes for jobs. A demonstrator from  Kompong Cham--who had worked for FUNCINPEC during the  campaign--said "Now that FUNCINPEC has won the election, they  can't find me a job. They even told me it would cost me $400 to  get a police lieutenant's position." Demonstrators who  requested anonymity said that FUNCINPEC police "were corrupt  from top to bottom" with the amount of the bribe based on the  police rank sought.    The CAMBODIA DAILY notes that Co-Minister of the Interior Yu  Hokkri's response was that "those demonstrators were not among  those who had been promised vacant positions." However, Yu  Hokkri did admit that the demonstrators' claims of corruption  could be valid, saying that "we cannot promise that all of our  officials are good." The article noted that during and after  the campaign, FINCINPEC personnel had promised voters jobs as an  inducement not to support the party's rival, the Cambodian  People's Party, which these officials had labelled as totally  corrupt.</p>

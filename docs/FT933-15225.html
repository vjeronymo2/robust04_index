			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mixed fortunes for US retailers JUNE was a mixed month for US retailers, with performances ranging from a strong improvement in same-store sales for Sears to a decline in comparable store sales for Woolworth, which also warned that it would post disappointing second-quarter earnings. In the previous month the big retailers generally experienced modest sales gains. Woolworth, which has reported weak figures recently, posted a 0.5 per cent decline in domestic comparable store sales for the five weeks to July 3. It predicted that second-quarter earnings would fall significantly below the previous year's results. 'Consumer spending continues to be under pressure in our principal markets and sales are continuing to run well below plan,' said Mr William Lavin, chairman and chief executive. 'Consequently, we are anticipating that earnings for the second quarter will fall well below last year's second quarter,' he added. Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based retailer, fared significantly better, with same-store sales up 12 per cent in the month in its core domestic stores division. 'A majority of our businesses reported double-digit percentage sales increases,' said Mr Arthur Martinez, chairman of the merchandise division. Kmart, the discount and specialty store group, said June sales had 'strengthened considerably'. The Troy, Michigan-based group attributed the improvement to warmer weather in important markets and the start of Kmart's clearance programme for spring and summer merchandise. Kmart's same-store sales rose by 2.8 per cent in June, including a 4.8 per cent gain on the general merchandise side. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, turned in a 7 per cent rise in same-store sales for June. Comparable store sales were up 5 per cent for the five months to June 30. Its Sam's warehouse clubs posted a 1 per cent rise in same-store sales, compared with a 2 per cent decline in the first five months of the financial year. In the department store sector, JC Penney saw comparable store sales increase 4.5 per cent in the June period. At May Department Stores, store-for-store sales were 5.7 per cent higher, with a 6.2 per cent rise in its department stores. At Federated, comparable-store sales were 6.6 per cent higher, but the company warned that it expected slimmer sales increases in the second half, compared with a strong second half in 1992. 'We have planned on that basis, however, and we continue to view the remainder of this year with what we think is an appropriate degree of caution,' said Mr Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive.</p>

The ongoing round of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) resumed here Tuesday morning  after a one-day recess.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu said after the  morning session that the two sides again discussed several  essential points, including the use of binding arbitration to  resolve cross-strait fishing disputes, "automatic repatriation"  of illegal mainland immigrants and exemptions to repatriation of  mainland or Taiwan residents who hijack planes from the other  side of the Taiwan Strait to their homeland.    "As Beijing is still reluctant to recognize Taiwan's legal  jurisdiction, the two sides failed to narrow their gaps on these  key issues during the morning talks," said Hsu, who is heading  the Taiwan delegation to the current round of talks.    Taiwan is hoping to automatically repatriate illegal  mainland  immigrants while Beijing insists that prior consultations be  held before each repatriation. The large number of illegal  mainland immigrants, some of whom have been in Taiwan detention  centers for more than one year, has placed a huge financial  burden on Taiwan.    SEF delegates and their mainland counterparts agreed to meet  again Wednesday morning. However, Hsu said he believes the  chances are slim for the two sides to reach any agreement on the  three issues during the current round of talks.    ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Sun Yafu said the Wednesday  session will be devoted to putting final touches on this round  of talks and discussing the timing for the next meeting.    The current round of talks began last Friday and are  scheduled to end Wednesday. This is the fourth round of  SEF-ARATS talks on the three issues since the heads of the two  organizations met in Singapore last April. The two sides have  not reached any accord on the issues in subsequent talks held in  Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei during the second half of last year.    The SEF delegation is scheduled to leave here for home  Thursday.</p>

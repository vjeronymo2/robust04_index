UN monitors have issued official permits for  this," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said today, answering a  question of the parliamentary faction of the Union of the  Democratic Forces related to a reported embargo-busting passage  of four tank wagon trains across the border with Serbia.  [passage omitted]    This evening Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met the leaders of  the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR). Speaking on the  behalf of the GOR, set up recently by defectors of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party, Aleksandur Tomov told the prime minister the  group will support the cabinet at the no-confidence vote. The  GOR representatives voiced their concern over the fact that the  government is subject to political pressure aimed at personnel  changes in the Interior Ministry before the investigation has  concluded.</p>

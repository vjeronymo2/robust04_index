			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]    The aim of the Science Council of Japan (SCJ), "as an  organization that represents Japan's scientists at home and  abroad, is to advance science and to make science reflect in and  permeate through the administration, industry, and the  lifestyles of the Japanese people."    The total SCJ budget for FY93 is &yen;1,095.827 million,  which is &yen;53.345 million less than its FY92 budget of  &yen;1,042.482 million.    The main increases in the SCJ budget were in the  Consultation-Related Expenses and International Scientific  Exchange Expenses (international contributions, and sponsoring  the Asia Scientific Conference (temporary name)). There were  decreases in International Scientific Exchange Expenses for  holding conferences within Japan.    The budget amounts are shown in the table below, and an  outline of the major items follows.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FY93 Budget                                                                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |(Unit: &yen;1,000)                                      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item              |FY92 budget       |FY93 budget       |Relative increase/|  |                  |                  |                  |decrease          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

Consultation-Related Expenses -- &yen;265.525 million </H5> <H5>  1. Consultation Expenses -- &yen;134.331 million </H5>   These are expenses for the general assembly, which  comprehensively coordinates activities from a standpoint that  covers all areas of scientific fields; the steering council; the  seven sectional meetings; and the regular and special committees  that reply to government inquiries and advise the government  about important problems in the promotion of S&amp;T based on  Sections 4 and 5 of the Science Council of Japan Act.  <H5>  2. Research Liaison -- &yen;131.194 million </H5>   The SCJ sets up research liaison committees for each  specialized field. These committees, which are the central  bodies for research contacts both within and outside of Japan,  consist of members who represent each specialty field. They  function as the Japanese committees of international scientific  groups and serve as a means of mutual contact with scientific  groups and organizations in Japan and abroad. These are expenses  needed for the committees to carry out those functions.  <H3>  B. International Scientific Exchange Expenses --  &yen;221.254 million </H3> <H5>  1. International Contributions -- &yen;74.722 million </H5>   As an organization that represents Japan's scientists at  home  and abroad in matters involving joint research with  international scientific groups, the establishment of research  systems, and the exchange of research information, the SCJ is a  member of 46 international scientific groups, one of which is  the International Scientific Federation. These funds are for the  costs of membership in those groups.  <H5>  2. Domestic Conferences -- &yen;73.543 million </H5>   In order to contribute to the world's scientific advancement  and to raise the level of science within Japan, the SCJ holds  international science conferences in cooperation with Japanese  scientific research groups.    In FY93 these funds are for the costs of holding the  following FY93 conferences and preparing for the following FY94  conferences.    (1) FY93 Conferences    10th General Meeting of the Asian Society Science Research  Conference Federation (5 - 11 Sep 1993, Kawasaki)    15th International Plant Science Conference (23 Aug - 3  Sep 1993, Yokohama)    7th Pacific Science Intermediate Conference (27 Jun - 3  Jul 1993, Ginowan)    24th General Meeting of the International Radio Science  Federation (23 Aug - 3 Sep 1993, Kyoto)    21st General Meeting of the International Pure and Applied  Physics Federation (20 - 25 Sep 1993, Nara)    6th Science Conference of the International Meteorology  and Atmospheric Science Association and 4th Joint Session of the  International Hydrology Association (11 - 23 Jul 1993, Yokohama)    (2) Preparation for FY94 Conferences    8th Meeting of the International Nerve and Muscle Society  (10 - 15 Jul 1994, Kyoto)    24th Meeting of the International Horticultural Society  (21 - 27 Aug 1994, Kyoto)    30th International Conference on Chemistry of Complexes  (24 - 29 Jul 1994, Kyoto)    21st World Electrocardiography Conference (4 - 7 Jul 1994,  Kyoto)    47th Conference of the International Information  Documentation Federation (2 - 9 Oct 1994, Tokyo)    2nd International Conference of the Illness Physiology  Society (19 - 24 Nov 1994, Kyoto)  <H5>  3. Dispatching Representatives -- &yen;44.006 million </H5>   These funds are for sending suitable people to the  scientific  conferences held abroad every year that are sponsored by  international scientific groups corresponding to the SCJ, or to  conferences that the SCJ is obligated to attend.  <H3>  4. Bilateral Exchange with Other Countries -- &yen;6.823  million </H3>   These funds are for systematically sending representative  groups that cover all fields of science to other countries to  coordinate conferences with the scientific organizations of  specific countries, i.e., discussing basic items relating to the  exchange of scientific information and researchers, and to  establish orderly scientific exchange systems.  <H3>  5. Asia Scientific Conference (provisional name) --  &yen;22.160 million </H3>   Based on the recognition that scientific research helps to  overcome environmental and other such problems and contributes  to the peace and prosperity of humankind, these funds are for  meetings between the scientists of Japan and Asian countries  with which Japan has geographical and deep cultural ties so that  they will exchange ideas on the current state of scientific  research in each country and opinions on the ideal form of  cooperation in Asia.  <H3>  C. Expenses for Council Member Recommendations --  &yen;19.574 million </H3>   These funds are for the necessary expenses of the  Recommendation Management Group, whose purpose is to select SCJ  members, register scientific research groups, and to deliberate  related matters.</p>

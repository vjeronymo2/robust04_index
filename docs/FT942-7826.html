			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Technology: Russian banking jumps the queue - Getting money out in Moscow can be a more high-tech experience than in the west / Software at Work At a regional bank in Moscow, a woman of 84 - old enough to remember the last tsar - is examining her plastic card. She approaches a manager who, with charm and patience, explains what it is. She then guides the woman through the process of withdrawing cash at the counter and shows her the gleaming ATM (automatic teller machine) in the corner. This versatile machine puts western versions to shame. Using colour graphics, and a choice of languages to interrogate users, it zips out bundles of roubles at the touch of a few buttons. For security reasons, its screen can only be read from the appropriate angle by one user at a time: bystanders and others in the queue cannot peek. Unlike more elderly western counterparts, the cash withdrawn will be reflected immediately in the balance shown on the next balance inquiry. At the counter, people request various transactions using their cash-cards, keying a secret Personal Identification Number into a big keypad. This summons a database record which appears immediately on the cashier's screen behind the counter. The cashier checks the transaction, matching the signature on the printout slip with a facsimile on her screen. She approves it with one keystroke, and out comes the cash, delivered through an automatic chute: ready counted, in the requested denominations. This is banking in real-time. As with the ATM, the withdrawal will show immediately on the account balance. Supporting this sophisticated service is a roomful of PCs and a tiny box of hard disks, known as Raid (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). The Raid boxes, manufactured by US storage specialist Micropolis, replace the racks of paper files which were previously the Moscow Savings Bank's only customer records. All this suggests that Russia might actually be ahead of the west in some banking services. A greenfield site in technology terms, and with very little to spend, it has leapfrogged its more privileged counterparts in the west by running real-time banking on a network of personal computers. This branch of the Moscow Savings Bank was automated by Intermicro Business Systems. This Russian-grown systems integrator has built up remarkable expertise in banking solutions over the last few years. The background to Russian banking is explained by Leonid Zabezhinsky, IBS's director of banking. 'There is a traditional philosophy that it is best to save. Enterprises and factories paid salaries through the bank, and they managed all pensions. Inflation was unheard of and bankruptcy unthinkable. 'In any new suburb, the first building was the bakery. Next came the laundry, the school, the nursery, and then the bank: it was an integral part of common life.' The average customer is not yet used to a 'choice' of bank, and simply goes to the local branch, as does everyone else in the suburb. This branch of the Moscow Savings Bank is one of 40 in the region, employing 2,000 staff and running 500,000 accounts each, which in turn will support between 20 and 40 sub-branches (730 in all). In Moscow's 35 boroughs live 15m people: everyone has an account. The branches answer to a regional head bank, of which there are 87 (including Kiev and St Petersburg) at national level. Unwieldy paper systems are difficult and expensive to service and do not allow the user to visit any other branch. Like paper-based medical records at a surgery, they belong in one place, and stay there. Their effect is easy to see at an old-style branch of the same bank, where customers queue repeatedly for different stages of the transaction. In the last three years, banks have become anxious to enter the 20th century, says Zabezhinsky. 'Five years ago, the first commercial banks started to grow. Eventually, all the people heading them are bankers not by education, but by mentality. In the last two years banks have grown from 12 to 1,000. 'Today the situation is similar to the west: stringent competition using the highest technology. We're using cards with magnetic strips, some smartcards with embedded chips and the customer's picture and signature on the front. We have grasped this technology at the moment of its birth.' Because the customer belongs to the branch, rather than the bank, it made more sense for the Moscow Savings Bank to start locally, automating from the bottom up, rather than the top down. 'In effect, with no centralised technology, it's only possible to have a client of the sub-branch, not of the entire bank,' explains Zabezhinsky. 'It was very hard to change the mentality. We see ourselves as business people first and technologists second, whereas many of our programmers still share the old separatist IT mentality.' In making such a leap from the old to the new, the bank met head on the problems of change management. The old woman probably could not have chosen a better person to approach than Helen Taganova, manager of the automation department. She has great sympathy for end-users but also a firm grasp of the new real-time way of banking. 'Our bank doesn't look like most in Moscow. We would never have this system today without our manager, who really drove the project. Practically all the managers of sub-branches were replaced by people who shared the vision.' The IBS solution was chosen as the only 'self-supporting' system that could grow as banking changed, rather than reflecting outdated techniques adapted from the west. There were some traumatic staff changes and training was long and thorough for bank staff. 'Our task was to work out the technology,' says Taganova. 'It is working well, but we have had many changes in implementation. The system checks itself daily, and fulfils all routine standing orders and so on. Audit trails are built in. But sometimes a special request comes up from a client of one of the sub-branches. This has concentrated our attention on special needs. We have created a large menu, and it's easy to add new options. 'I can say that the skills in this department are highly developed enough to solve any banking problem. If we understand the problem, we can find a solution: we're not afraid of any application task,' says Taganova. The ATMs provide a good example of forward planning. 'Currently, there are only 10 ATM 'bankomats', and all of them are inside because we had to be sure of reliability and acceptance tests. But eventually they will be everywhere, not just in banks.' There is a Novell network of around 50 PCs inside each branch, connected to sub-branches, all of which have their own local area network. For the head office, the paperwork produced by the computer has to comply with the old-style paper systems. Nevertheless staffing levels have fallen in automated branches, especially in checking and auditing. Errors are rare, and a mere three accountants now oversee 18 sub-branches. Checking for accuracy and logic is done by two people instead of 18. Telecommunications are the rogue factor in building such networks. They are patchy in Russia: telephone exchanges can date anywhere from the 1940s, so IBS supplies its own channels. Banks in the UK could make a lot more use of Raid technology in counteracting fraud, for such process-heavy tasks as fingerprinting, according to Trevor Duplock, managing director of Micropolis UK, which supplies IBS with Raid technology. Anatoly Karachinsky, IBS's founder, saw bank automation as a window of opportunity seven years ago, and has made sure IBS is able to support every area. This means not just tying together the elements of the hardware system but in some cases providing the networking and telecommunications. Analyst Esther Dyson, president of EDventure, a venture capital investor in eastern computer markets, sees IBS as one of the few Russian computer companies that might set its sights beyond Russia. 'Karachinsky is a remarkable entrepreneur,' she says. 'IBS could help make the East become part of a wider world.'</p>

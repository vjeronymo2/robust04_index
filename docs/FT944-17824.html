			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Observer: Norwich school What's wrong with Norwich? It's some months since Mike Sandland, 56, Norwich Union's chief investment manager for the past eight years, let it be known that he was taking early retirement after 33 years on the investment treadmill. He has now quit and his job is yet to be filled. Admittedly, Norwich Union has had its ups and downs, but the job of managing Pounds 33bn must be one of the plums in the UK fund management business. An added bonus is that it took Sandland just seven minutes to get to work, and that was on a bad day. In the US any number of fund managers would exchange the daily grind of commuting into Wall Street for life in a pleasant place like Norwich. By contrast, there still seems to be a school of thought in England that serious fund managers work in the City of London and not the provinces. Perhaps Norwich Union will have to recruit a Scot after all.</p>

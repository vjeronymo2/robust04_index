			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Kyun from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported in its headline  this morning that Japanese-made frequency analysis devices  [chupasu punsoggi], which have been strictly controlled by the  Coordinating Committee for Exports to Communist Areas as  strategic materials, have been illegally flown into North Korea,  and that it is possible that North Korea has used them as spare  parts for missiles.    The paper reported that the devices, which have been  illegally flown into North Korea, are being mainly used for  military purposes to increase the accuracy of ballistic  missiles, and that it is more possible that North Korea has used  them as spare parts for the Nodong No. 1 missile.    The security department of the Japanese Police Office has  obtained such information and is secretly investigating the  route of the illegal flow into North Korea, the corporations  that illegally transported them, and the enterprises which  exported them to North Korea.</p>

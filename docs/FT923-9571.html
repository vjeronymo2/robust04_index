			<p>920804 FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US curb on gear imports is ruled out THE US Commerce Department yesterday ruled out limiting gear imports on grounds they threaten national security, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. An investigation concluded the Pentagon was expecting 'substantial decreases' in defence gear requirements. Inter-agency experts said the US industry was technologically competitive with foreign suppliers. Total gear imports to the US last year totalled Dollars 2bn-worth. Japan took 27 per cent of the market, Canada 23, France 19, Germany 10, and the UK 3 per cent. If the Department had found imports threatened national security, President Bush would have had 90 days to decide a course of action.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Don't be daunted by Poulet Frit Kentucky - Non-French speakers need not worry / Montreal is an easy and enjoyable place in which to do business The signs to 'centre-ville', rather than city centre, as you leave Dorval airport are a sign that Montreal is a North American city with a difference. With the elegance, architecture and culture of a European capital, Quebec's financial hub has a special ambience. Splendid museums, a fine symphony orchestra and a dizzying choice of restaurants can make a business trip to Montreal an enjoyable experience. Nevertheless, visitors whose French is limited to a few tourist phrases (or those who have yet to master the distinctive Quebecois dialect) may feel nervous at the thought of getting around and doing business in the world's biggest French-speaking city after Paris. That discomfort is bound to increase on the drive from the airport. Billboards and signs along the roadside are in French, and only French. There is no Kentucky Fried Chicken in Montreal, only Poulet Frit Kentucky. What once was called Craig Street is now rue St-Antoine. More recently, Dorchester Boulevard, Montreal's main street, was renamed boulevard Rene-Levesque, in honour of a Quebec separatist hero. Although the travel agent may have booked a room at the Four Seasons or the Queen Elizabeth, the taxi drops you off at Hotel Le Quatre Saisons or Hotel Le Reine Elizabeth. The city's newspapers - the only one written in English is the Montreal Gazette - are filled with stories on the popularity of Quebec's French-first nationalists. The Bloc Quebecois, which aims to make Quebec an independent country by the end of the decade, won enough seats in last October's general election to become the main opposition party in the House of Commons in Ottawa. Its provincial counterpart, the Parti Quebecois, is leading in opinion polls in the run-up to provincial elections later this year. If it wins, it has promised to hold a referendum on independence by late 1995, and to reverse recent relaxations in the French-first language law. With such a rise in nationalism, can a non-French speaking visitor possibly enjoy a visit to Quebec, let alone seal a business deal there? Relax. A knowledge of French is useful, especially in shops, restaurants and in dealings with Quebec government officials. But it is by no means essential. 'It's the bottom line that counts,' says Mr Howard Gosselin, a Canadian who heads Barclays Bank's office in Montreal. 'If they can make money by dealing with someone who doesn't happen to speak French, well, so what?' Although Montreal has all the appearances of a French-speaking city, it is more accurate to call it bilingual. English is the mother tongue of about a third of its 3.2m residents, including many members of the immigrant community (known locally as 'allophones'). Before you have a chance to mumble an apology to your Quebecois hosts for your mangled French, they are likely to put you at ease with a tale in fluent English about their latest trip to London, Moscow or New York. Until the late 1970s, Montreal was dominated by pillars of the Anglo-Canadian establishment such as Canadian Pacific, the transport and resources conglomerate, Royal Bank of Canada, Sun Life, the insurance company, and Alcan, the aluminium producer. But the rise of an assertive group of Quebecois entrepreneurs, coupled with the departure of English-speakers to Toronto in the late 1970s, when a form of independence appeared to be on the horizon, has created a new business class of well-educated French-Canadians. Nowhere in Canada was support for the 1989 free trade agreement with the US stronger than in Quebec. Montreal-based companies such as Bombardier (transport equipment), Videotron (cable-TV) and Quebecor (printing and publishing) are now among corporate Canada's brightest stars. Montreal does, however, retain some hallmarks of a close-knit community. Many business deals are still clinched over lunch in the city's somewhat stuffy clubs, like the Mount Royal and the St James. A handful of institutions, notably the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (the public-sector pension fund), Hydro-Quebec (the power utility) and the Desjardins financial services group, are very influential. Business visitors would be well-advised to cultivate contacts in one or more of these organisations. 'More than most other cities, there's a very genuine and fully developed relationship between senior people in business, the universities and government,' says Mr Reid Scowen, Quebec's delegate-general in New York. 'Everybody knows each other and works together.' Barclays' Mr Gosselin adds that French-Canadians 'work hard and negotiate hard, but they don't take themselves as seriously as others (North Americans) do. There's a little more warmth in their attitude.' According to a recent opinion poll published by Maclean's magazine, 40 per cent of Canadians agreed with the statement that 'we should eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die'. In Quebec, the proportion is 71 per cent. This zest for life is reflected in Montreal's array of fine restaurants. Among businessmen's favourites in the old city are the swish La Maree (404 Place Jacques Cartier) and St-Amable (188 rue St-Amable). My own choice is Claude Postel (443 rue St-Vincent): located in a former mortuary and yet to be discovered by tourists or the corporate public relations set, it serves a mouth-watering tarte de tatin (made with caramelised apples). Popular spots in the office and shopping area south of McGill University include Restaurant Julien (1191 avenue Union), Le Cintra (2072 rue Drummond) and the more casual L'Actuel, whose speciality is mussels (1194 rue Peel). Milos (5357 avenue du Parc), an informal Greek seafood restaurant, is a 10-minute drive from downtown. But if you like to dine early, prepare to dine alone. Montrealers tend to eat later than other North Americans. Most restaurants start to fill up only after 8pm. Montreal's top - and thus most expensive - hotels are the Ritz-Carlton and the Four Seasons, which are close to each other on rue Sherbrooke Ouest. If your business is in the old financial district around rue St-Jacques (still known to old-timers as St James Street), the Hotel Inter-Continental on rue St-Antoine Ouest and the less expensive Hotel Radisson Gouverneurs at Place Victoria are convenient. I usually try for a room at the Centre Le Sheraton on boulevard Rene-Levesque. Although in many ways just another large, modern hotel, the Sheraton offers good value for money in a good location (among other things, it is the first stop on the airport bus route). Quebec winters are brutal and long. A foreign visitor will be far more miserable without the right clothing at this time of year than without a French phrase book. Temperatures often hover for days at minus 15'C-20'C. Streets and pavements are covered with a messy - and often treacherous - combination of snow, ice, slush and salt. Gloves, a warm coat (a lined raincoat will do) and rubber overshoes or boots are essential. A hat is advisable. Anyone not used to walking on ice-flecked pavements should take care, especially on the streets sloping down from Mount Royal to the St Lawrence River. One wrong step and your lasting memory of Montreal will not be a fine meal, but the bruises, soiled clothes and embarrassment of being on your hands and knees in the middle of Beaver Hall Hill. Even this well-known landmark is now known by an incongruous official French name: cote du Beaver Hall.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A NEW GENERATION LEARNS WHAT COLD WAR WAS ABOUT  </P> <P> However injurious it is to American national pride, the fact remains that the  direction of the Chinese leadership is not tempered by the righteous protest of  foreigners. Certainly not by the righteous protest of Americans. Within hours  of the Bush Administration's appeal for clemency for demonstrators sentenced to  death, the Chinese government responded with bullets to the back of the head.  An American writ that does not extend to Panama City will not extend to  Beijing.  </P> <P> But the Chinese authorities would have been undeterred even by America at its  zenith. When it comes to matters of state, most dictatorships are impervious to  foreign protest. And for the Chinese communists, the democracy movement was the  ultimate matter of state: a threat to the very existence of the regime.  </P> <P> If we cannot influence events, why then sanctions? As in the case of South  Africa, it is important to have no illusions about sanctions. They will not  materially help the people we want to help. The main purpose for sanctions, in  China as in South Africa, is internal: to make us feel that we have expressed  moral outrage in some more-than-rhetorical way. It is entirely correct for a  nation dedicated to a proposition to express itself on issues of international  morality. But such actions are not to be confused with diplomacy.  </P> <P> Deng Xiaoping has made it clear that politics takes precedence over economics.  He knew full well what repression would cost in terms of economic development.  Yet for the sake of power, the ultimate Marxist-Leninist value, he decided to  pay it.  </P> <P> These costs have been most clearly on display in Poland following the smashing  of Solidarity in 1981. The resulting scenario is this: The regime retains  power, but the population refuses to cooperate. A sullen work force, an  alienated intellectual class, a general suspicion produce economic stagnation.  That is the real economic cost of repression. Western sanctions -- which, in  any case, can confidently be predicted to be short term, given the West's  attention span -- add only marginally to the cost.  </P> <P> The East European model is worth keeping in mind because in much of the  coverage of China the impression is given that the current repression is a  peculiarly Chinese tragedy. In fact, the reign of terror is not uniquely  Chinese, but characteristically communist -- from the massive propaganda  campaign, the show trials, the forced confessions, the encouragement of family  members to turn one another in, right down to the invocation endlessly repeated  in the media to "Love the Party."  </P> <P> Now that Soviet communism has adopted a human face, the baby-boom generation  has a hard time recalling what the Cold War was about. A popular revisionism  holds that the Cold War was a cherished project of the American right that fed  on a mutual paranoia. In fact, China has dramatically recreated precisely the  kind of forces America fought during 40 years of the great twilight struggle.  </P> <P> Which is what makes Tian An Men Square an important event not just in Chinese  but in Western consciousness. It is the first time that this generation -- too  young to remember Budapest, 1956, too distracted to notice Prague, 1968, too  far removed to fully absorb the Vietnamese gulag and the Cambodian genocide of  the '70s -- has finally been directly exposed to the meaning of  Marxist-Leninism.  </P></p>

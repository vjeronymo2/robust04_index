			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PHILHARMONIC FACES THE CRITICS IN NEW YORK;  </P> <P> MUSIC: PERFORMANCES OPENING CARNEGIE HALL'S CENTENNIAL SEASON ARE PRAISED AND  PANNED.  </P> <P> "Incandescent," "unpressed grandeur and heart-tugging eloquence," "sonically  ravishing."  </P> <P> Those are a few of the glowing adjectives you may see quoted by the Los Angeles  Philharmonic publicity office to represent the New York reception given the  orchestra for its pair of concerts that opened Carnegie Hall's centennial  season last week.  </P> <P> The ones you won't see are: "dragging," "lugubrious," "occasionally untidy" or  "prevailingly tame."  </P> <P> New York is, as you have no doubt been hearing lately, a contentious, dangerous  city, with even the safest-seeming places fraught with peril for a visitor.  </P> <P> The L.A. Philharmonic is, of course, no stranger to New York, performing here  fairly regularly. But last week's concerts brought an unusual amount of  critical scrutiny. Typically, the orchestra's New York appearances tend to be  in late spring as part of a national tour after the regular Los Angeles season.  By then most of the great orchestras in the world have already passed through  town, and the Los Angeles orchestra just isn't news.  </P> <P> But this year it was. The Philharmonic happened to have been invited by  Carnegie to open is most gala season ever, and it was flown out, at Carnegie's  expense, for the honor. That alone -- since neither the Los Angeles  Philharmonic nor its former music director, Andre Previn, are considered  exactly gala names in New York -- was enough to make some observers suspicious.  </P> <P> Donal Henahan, the crusty chief critic of the New York Times, from whom all the  above negatives were quoted, found nothing in the playing distinguishable from  "what might be encountered from a visiting orchestra on almost any night during  an ordinary Carnegie season."  </P> <P> Complaining even more about the program -- which contained two major American  works, Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto and William Schuman's Third Symphony --  than the performances, Henahan summed it up as "a puzzling evening Toscanini  himself might have had trouble delivering the audience from somnolence."  </P> <P> While consensus is an unknown concept in New York, others did find that the  Philharmonic -- which played, many felt, better than it ever has in New York --  and Previn both came away with their reputations considerably enhanced.  </P> <P> Writing for Newsday, Tim Page noted that "the Los Angeles Philharmonic has  grown into an excellent ensemble." Bill Zakariasen, who was responsible for all  the raves above, wrote in the Daily News that "the orchestral playing was  superb." The third New York tabloid, the Post, concurred, Susan Elliott finding  the orchestra to be "in top form, playing with a richly hued string sound and a  solid sense of ensemble."  </P> <P> What really seemed to win over New York audiences and critics alike was the  second program, which Previn ended with a deeply felt and gorgeously played  performance of Vaughan Williams' Fifth Symphony.  </P> <P> Peter Goodman, writing in Newsday, said that Previn gave the Vaughan Williams  work a "depth, confidence and patient sense that, come what may, this world  will survive." Allan Kozinn, in the New York Times, praised the playing for a  sound that was "smooth and focused, and admirably precise." And for Zakariasen  the performance reached "unforgettable moments in the beatific slow movement."  </P> <P> Also unanimously enjoyed was a masterly account of Beethoven's Third Piano  Concerto, with Emanuel Ax as soloist. But New Yorkers always need something to  fight over, and the premiere of Los Angeles Philharmonic composer-in-residence  Steven Stucky's "Angelus" -- the first of a series of new works Carnegie has  commissioned to celebrate its anniversary year -- provided it.  </P> <P> A piece of otherwise innocuous tintinnabulation, it ends in a spectacular blast  of sound that left some complaining of aural pain and others exhilarated.  </P> <P> "It's impossible to dislike," enthused Zakariasen, "and at 12 minutes, doesn't  wear out its welcome."  </P> <P> At the other extreme, Goodman, complained that Stucky "strikes at Carnegie's  greatest acoustical weakness since its renovation. There's nothing like nine  minutes of nonstop, virtually undifferentiated, high-pitched ringing to  emphasize the bright, hard sound that can now be induced in Carnegie Hall under  certain circumstances."  </P> <P> The piece lasted, by the way, a little over 10 minutes.  </P></p>

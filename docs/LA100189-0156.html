			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIRALESTE RUNS PAST ORANGE LUTHERAN IN FINAL MINUTE  </P> <P> An overpowering running game helped Miraleste High School rally in the second  half for an 18-14 victory over Orange Lutheran in the Olympic League opener for  both teams Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> Miraleste tailback Dan Sarner rushed for 180 yards in 27 carries, 46 yards  coming on the final scoring drive, which ended when Sarner plunged over left  tackle from a yard out to give Miraleste the lead with 54 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran running back Gil Greene ran for 102 yards in 19 carries, but 93  yards came in the first half, when the Lancers (2-2, 0-1 in league) opened a  14-3 lead.  </P> <P> Greene scored on a three-yard run in the first quarter, and his 52-yard sprint  from scrimmage in the second quarter set up Orange Lutheran's second touchdown,  a 26-yard pass play from Lenny Gavin to Phil Matheson.  </P> <P> Sarner, a sophomore, also scored on a six-yard burst in the third quarter to  trim the Orange Lutheran lead to 14-11. Sarner's running mate, Dan Crofton,  also a sophomore, gained 93 yards in 15 carries for Miraleste (3-1, 1-0).  </P> <P> Still, there's the business of establishing a passing game at Sunny Hills.  Quarterback Rick Orr threw for only 61 yards and has thrown for only 197 yards  in four games.STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

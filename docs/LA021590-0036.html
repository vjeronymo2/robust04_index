			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TCU'S STRICKLAND SHOOTS DOWN ARKANSAS FROM LONG DISTANCE  </P> <P> Michael Strickland hit nine of 12 three-point shots as Texas Christian upset  eighth-ranked Arkansas, 81-79, Wednesday night in a Southwest Conference game  at Ft. Worth.  </P> <P> Strickland tied the SWC three-point record set by Texas' Travis Mays last year  against Rice. All 27 of his points came on three-point shots.  </P> <P> "I hit a couple of shots early, and that kept my confidence level up,"  Strickland said. "I wanted to keep my head up because I hadn't been shooting  well lately."  </P> <P> Arkansas' Lee Mayberry had five three-point shots in the second half and scored  24 points for the Hogs, but it wasn't enough to overcome a slow start.  </P> <P> Arkansas dropped to 20-4 in losing its second consecutive SWC game after 11  victories. TCU is 13-10 and 6-6.  </P> <P> The Razorbacks lost Saturday, 82-77, to Baylor.  </P> <P> No. 6 Duke 84, East Carolina 51 -- Freshman Billy McCaffrey, starting in place  of injured Phil Henderson, scored 21 points to lead the Blue Devils at Durham,  N.C.  </P> <P> Duke (21-4) beat East Carolina (12-15) for the 18th consecutive time. The  Pirates of the Colonial Athletic Assn. have never beaten an Atlantic Coast  Conference team, losing 45 consecutive games.  </P> <P> No. 11 Oklahoma 85, Kansas State 69 -- Skeeter Henry and Smokey McCovery scored  16 points apiece to lead the Sooners in a Big Eight Conference game at Norman,  Okla.  </P> <P> It was the 42nd consecutive home victory for Oklahoma (18-3, 6-2). Steve Henson  scored 21 points to lead Kansas State (14-13, 4-5).  </P> <P> No. 15 Illinois 88, Northwestern 75 -- Kendall Gill scored 25 points at  Champaign, Ill., as the Illini handed the Wildcats their 35th consecutive Big  Ten road defeat.  </P> <P> The Illini (18-5, 8-5) were in control most of the game, but had to hold off a  Wildcat rally in the final minutes. Northwestern (8-14, 1-11) pulled within  74-67 on a three-point shot by Rex Walters with 3:40 remaining.  </P> <P> But a basket and free throw by Ervin Small and two free throws by Stephen Bardo  put Illinois ahead, 79-67, with two minutes left.  </P> <P> No. 24 St. John's 90, Seton Hall 81 -- Boo Harvey hit a three-point shot at the  buzzer to force overtime and then scored 13 of his career-high 40 points in the  extra session to lead the Redmen in a Big East Conference game at East  Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> The victory was the third in a row for the Redmen (20-6, 8-4) after a  three-game losing streak and gave Coach Lou Carnesecca his 17th season of at  least 20 victories in 22 years at St. John's.  </P> <P> The win also moved the Redmen into a tie with Syracuse for third place in the  conference. Seton Hall (10-12, 3-8) lost its fifth consecutive game, its  longest streak since dropping eight in a row during the 1985-86 season.  </P> <P> Virginia 81, North Carolina 80 -- John Crotty scored 21 of his 27 points from  three-point range to lead the Cavaliers in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at  Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> Crotty made seven of 13 three-point shot attempts as Virginia (15-7, 4-6)  defeated North Carolina for only the fourth time in 21 games.  </P> <P> North Carolina (17-9, 6-4) had a chance to win, but Scott Williams was long on  a 15-foot jump shot as time expired.  </P> <P> Auburn 75, Florida 55 -- Derrick Dennison scored 22 points, hitting nine of 10  shots, as the Tigers handed the Gators their 10th consecutive loss in a  Southeastern Conference game at Auburn, Ala.  </P> <P> Auburn (10-14, 6-7) is the last team to lose to Florida. Since then, two  veteran starters have left the Gators (6-15, 2-11).  </P> <P> Notre Dame 79, Marquette 76 -- Joe Fredrick hit four free throws in the final  two minutes and scored a season-high 22 points to lead the Fighting Irish at  South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> Marquette (11-10) was led by Trevor Powell's game-high 29 points. Notre Dame is  13-8.  </P> <P> Mississippi 81, Tennessee 80 -- David Midlick's three-point basket with 2:20  left broke a 77-77 tie and the Rebels held off the Volunteers in a Southeastern  Conference game at Oxford, Miss.  </P> <P> Allan Houston had a game-high 37 points for Tennessee (12-10, 7-6).

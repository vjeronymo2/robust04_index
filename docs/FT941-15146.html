			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fairness each side of boundary Sir, After the remarkable revelations about the City of Westminster's decisions, your readers may well ask where Westminster gets its money from in the first place. As a neighbouring borough, with similar population but much higher levels of deprivation, Camden gets Pounds 21m less per year from government grants. Despite this, we have no problem in comparing key services nose to nose. Camden's education results are better than Westminster's across the board. Camden no longer uses bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless families, while Westminster is still spending some Pounds 8m per annum on this very unsatisfactory form of accommodation. Surely the Westminster story stresses the need for the redistribution of government and political favouritism? Only then can the average citizen know that he or she is being dealt with fairly, as compared with someone the other side of a borough boundary. Richard Arthur, leader of the council, The Town Hall, Euston Road, London NW1 2RU</p>

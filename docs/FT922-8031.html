			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Clean sweep for paint brushes but often smells unpleasant. Rohm and Haas, the specialist paint pigment manufacturer, has developed a water-based emulsion paint which is low in ammonia odour and high in opacity. The new low-odour pigment polymer, known as Ropaque OP-62 LO, is free from formaldehyde and is the latest development in the company's solventless acrylic chemistry. Indoor and outdoor paints, from matt to gloss, can be made using the new polymer. Rohm and Haas: UK, 081 686 8844.</p>

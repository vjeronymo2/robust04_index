			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chrysler follows road to recovery CHRYSLER, the smallest of the Big Three US car manufacturers, yesterday underscored its continued recovery from recession with third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 202m - which contrasts sharply with expected heavy losses from rivals General Motors and Ford. The profits figure, which was struck after a Dollars 101m pre-tax charge for the restructuring of its car rental operations, compared with a loss of Dollars 82m in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues were up 22 per cent at Dollars 9.2bn, and earnings per share worked through at 62 cents, compared with a loss of 36 cents a year ago. Chrysler has been benefiting from a Dollars 3bn programme imposed at the start of the US recession to slash its manufacturing costs and from good demand for its trucks and mini-vans. Mr Lee Iacocca, who is retiring at the end of this year as chairman, said other factors contributing to the results were lower discounts and a reduction in less profitable sales to fleet buyers The company is in the middle of launching a new range of medium-sized cars - the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde - which are crucial to the revitalisation of its tired car range and have won enthusiastic reviews from the motoring press. Mr Iacocca said orders for these vehicles were very strong. Chrysler's combined US and Canadian car and truck market share for the quarter was 12.5 per cent, compared with 11.3 per cent in the same period of last year. For the nine months it totalled 13 per cent, up from 12.2 per cent. Earnings for the nine months totalled Dollars 367m, or Dollars 1.08 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 892m, or Dollars 3.94 a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 26.7bn, up from Dollars 21.2bn. Chrysler's financial services unit contributed third-quarter earnings of Dollars 45m, down from Dollars 81m in the same period of last year, due to lower levels of earning assets and the increased cost of a debt agreement the company recently struck with its bank lenders. Mr Iacocca, reporting his last quarterly earnings statement as chairman, said the July to September results, coming on top of a profitable second quarter, were particularly satisfying in the middle of the slowest US economic recovery in decades. He said it demonstrated the company's achievement in controlling costs, improving margins and lowering break-even points.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee prices reverse early gains  -Market Report COFFEE futures prices eased in late trading at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday after putting in a strong performance in the morning. As the market digested news that Brazilian producers had presented a plan to retain 817,000 bags (60kg each) the May delivery price climbed to Dollars 1,232 a tonne. But the rally ran out of steam with traders generally adopting a more cautious attitude on the Brazilian news, and a weaker New York market setting the tone in the afternoon. By the close the May price was at Dollars 1,210 a tonne, down Dollars 11 on balance, and traders said there was room for further weakness. The COCOA market had a featureless day, the main activity again being cross trading between March and May futures positions. The May price ended Pounds 6 down at Pounds 911 a tonne, but most traders remained confident the support at Pounds 900 would not be breached. At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER market stood firm in the face of the aluminium price tumble. An early test of support below Dollars 1,870 a tonne for three months delivery quickly found underlying buying interest and the price ended at at Dollars 1,875 a tonne, a gain of Dollars 3 on the day. LEAD and ZINC prices continued to come under pressure with prices drifting dangerously close to support levels of Dollars 460 and Dollars 950 a tonne respectively. NICKEL slipped to a low of Dollars 5,650 on trade and general liquidation before finding support. Compiled from Reuter</p>

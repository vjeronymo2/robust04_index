			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundeswehr may soon be  flying over 200 MiG-29 fighters. The news magazine FOCUS  reports that a Kremlin offer to this effect was put to the  German Finance Ministry two weeks ago and was being examined.  At present, 24 such aircraft were deployed from stocks of the  GDR People's Army.    Manfred Opel, the SPD [Social Democratic Party] defense  expert, said the purchasing price totalled 4 billion marks. He  said the amount could be deducted from the debts owed to Bonn by  Moscow.</p>

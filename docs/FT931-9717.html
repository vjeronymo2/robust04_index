			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / German steelworkers protest at further job losses STEELWORKERS in east and west Germany took to the streets in protest yesterday, as details of further job losses emerged from the country's leading steelmakers. Hoesch Stahl confirmed that one entire steel plant would have to be closed down, with a loss of between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs, in order to reduce its monthly capacity from 700,000 to between 550,000 and 570,000 tonnes. A company spokesman said a decision would be taken by the joint board of the newly merged Krupp-Hoesch combine, before the end of February, whether the closure would be at Dortmund, the company's headquarters, or at its sister plant in Duisburg-Rheinhausen, in the heart of the Ruhr industrial area. Some 1,500 workers yesterday demonstrated outside the gates of the Krupp steel plant at Hagen, near Dortmund, over the planned job cuts - which were specifically excluded last year when Krupp launched its merger bid with Hoesch. In eastern Bavaria, some 2,000 steel workers occupied the railway station at Sulzbach-Rosenberg, protesting at the loss of jobs at the ailing Maxhutte steel plant. In east Germany, some 3,500 workers at the Eko steel plant at Eisenhuttenstadt are planning protests for today, while workers in the Saarland have announced a mass demonstration for March 10. The announcement by Hoesch that it will close a plant is the most dramatic development in the German steel industry to date, although IG Metall, the steel and engineering workers' union, estimates that 25,000 in the industry will be threatened by capacity cuts. Mr Viktor Braun, company spokesman, said that the merger with Krupp had not been supposed to cause any job losses, but 'the situation in the market has worsened dramatically since then. It is now worse than at any time since the 1970s.' Preussag AG - the steel, trading, energy and metals group - said yesterday that it would not be able to reduce any capacity, under the EC steel plan proposed in Brussels this week, without causing a reduction in company earnings. Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive, said the EC plan would not impose output quotas for individual companies, but leave it to industry to divide the cuts. He said steel production had fallen by 20 per cent in the first quarter of the 1992-93 financial year.</p>

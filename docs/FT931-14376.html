			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Abolition of ACT would be to throw out baby with bathwater Sir, Your articles ('Government urged to look at ACT issue' and UK company news, January 12) on the problems that advance corporation tax is causing for many UK-based companies made some telling points, but might have given a somewhat misleading impression of the ACT system. It does have good points: When a company accounts for ACT, on paying a dividend, it also gives its shareholders an equal tax credit to set against their own personal UK tax liabilities. The ACT that can be set against the company's corporation tax bill is not a long-term cost to the company. Only ACT that cannot be used in this way (surplus ACT) is a real cost to the company, and even then the creation of that surplus ACT will have provided an equivalent economic benefit for its shareholders. The tendency of the ACT system to encourage profitable investment in the UK rather than overseas might be seen as helpful with the UK in recession and 3m unemployed. So while the system clearly has flaws, any call for its abolition would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The preferable approach, which the 100 Group is taking, is to suggest constructive changes to relieve the worst of the current problems. The most obvious and eminently simple improvement is to get rid of the antiquated rule restricting the amount of ACT paid that can be set against corporation tax due. Allowing pound for pound set-off would improve utilisation at relatively low cost. ACT is an important tax. Flaws in its operation have been swept under the carpet for far too long. By some positive indication in the budget, such as abolishing the limitation on setting ACT against corporation tax, the chancellor would show that he recognises this and is seriously considering ways to improve the system without losing unacceptable amounts of tax.

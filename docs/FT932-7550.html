			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Reform plan for divorcee pensions - Radical changes to family and pension law are proposed FAMILY and pensions law will be changed radically if the government decides to follow a long-awaited report on pensions and divorce released this week. The working group on pensions and divorce was formed in January last year by the Pensions Management Institute with funding from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Its report recommends that courts should be given the power to divide occupational and personal pension rights between a divorcing couple. A pension is often the most valuable asset after the home. Yet, the courts have no power to transfer pensions rights from husbands to wives. In Scotland, pensions are regarded as part of 'matrimonial property' which should be shared fairly on divorce but specific guidelines and valuation methods do not exist. The issue is compounded by the high numbers of divorces in the UK where one in three marriages ends in failure. The recommendations apply to men and women but women will be the principal beneficiaries of changes to the law. Some 67 per cent of men receive an occupational pension in their own right compared to only 26 per cent of women. Since women's average earnings are less than men's, the average income from an occupational pension for a woman is only Pounds 30 a week compared with Pounds 61 for men. For these reasons, the principle of pension splitting on divorce has been recognised but the difficulty has been deciding the best way of doing this. The PMI working group recommends that pension rights should be calculated by using the same statutory cash equivalent as that used for calculating transfer payments. The courts would decide the proportion to which the wife would be entitled and the sum would be released from the husband's scheme. It would then be transferred to the wife's occupational or personal scheme; alternatively, the wife could choose to have benefits in her husband's scheme, without the need for a transfer. The husband's pension benefits would be reduced accordingly. If maintenance is being paid, the court should be able to oblige the husband to take out life assurance for his former wife. 'To split a pension payable in the future, you have to put a value on it now,' said Richard Malone, director of actuaries Noble Lowndes and a member of the working party. 'The recommendation, therefore, is to use the current transfer value - a figure which would be paid out to another scheme if the member had changed jobs. This value is readily available and would not require substantial costs and administration.' In Scotland, the usual practice is for a cash equivalent of the husband's pension to be given to the wife in cash. She can either use it to provide for her own pension or can spend it. The PMI's recommendation of a transfer to another scheme means that the cash equivalent could only be used to provide a pension for the former wife. A transfer also gets around the problem of scarce liquid assets on divorce. 'One often used device (in Scotland) is to give the house to one party and leave the pension rights for the other unaffected. While this may work where there is a great deal of equity in the house, recent conditions make this solution less and less likely to be effective,' said Bob Hubbard, president of the PMI. The working group adopts the principle of a 'clean break' (see below), where the financial link between the divorcing parties is severed as soon as possible. The reallocation of assets is thus not dependent on either party's future actions. There are complications, however. Many employees are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme with part of their pension rights - the guaranteed minimum pension - standing in place of Serps. When payment of the pension starts, this portion is set against the Serps entitlement. The PMI would like to see the GMP regarded as a pension fund asset which could therefore be reallocated on divorce, but this may not be possible if it is treated as a state benefit. Another difficulty is where a divorce takes place when the pension is already being paid. The PMI recommends earmarking part of the pension and paying this to the divorced wife with life assurance for her funded from other assets. The PMI's report is a set of recommendations and it is too early to say how much will be acted on. Women considering divorce will probably find that there is little point in a tactical delay in the hope of benefitting from any law changes. Sir Alec Atkinson, chairman of the working group, estimated it would be at least another two to three years before prospective changes in the law would take effect. However, if the recommendations are followed, divorced women stand to benefit substantially as illustrated by the following case studies provided by Noble Lowndes. A couple divorce at the age of 35 after 10 years of marriage. The husband, who started a pension before the marriage now earns Pounds 40,000 and the value of his accrued pension rights is Pounds 31,000. His wife, who stopped work on a salary of Pounds 15,000 to have children, has 5 years of pensionable service behind her and the value of her accrued rights is Pounds 7,000. The balance is Pounds 24,000 in the husband's favour. Under the PMI guidelines, the wife would be entitled to half this amount - or Pounds 12,000 on divorce. At the other end of the scale, a couple divorce after 35 years of marriage. The 60-year-old husband has just retired on a final salary of Pounds 70,000. The value of his pension rights is Pounds 713,000 and his current pension is Pounds 46,667. His wife, who has never worked, has no pension rights in her name. On divorce, she would be entitled to either half the value of her husband's pension fund - some Pounds 356,500 or an earmarked pension of half that payable to him, namely Pounds 23,333.</p>

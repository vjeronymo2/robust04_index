			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Peugeot Talbot falls 54% PRE-TAX profits at Peugeot Talbot, the UK subsidiary of the French car maker, fell 54 per cent last year to Pounds 50m, against Pounds 109m in 1990 and a record Pounds 135m in the preceding year. The company out-performed most rival car makers in the UK, however, as Ford, Rover, Jaguar and Rolls-Royce plunged into heavy losses in the face of the steep recession in the new car market. Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director, yesterday forecast a small increase in that market this year to around 1.7m units, from 1.59m in 1991, the lowest level since 1982. 'The car market is still sluggish but we believe that with the recent reduction in car tax and the uncertainty of the General Election behind us, overall sales will now pick up.' He forecast that Peugeot's UK car sales would increase by about 10 per cent this year to 127,000. and that output at its Rytonassembly plant would rise 3 per cent to 90,700. Mr Whalen warned however, that profits would again be under pressure. in 1992. 'It will be difficult to improve on the 1991 position.' Production at Ryton fell by 24.5 per cent to 87,965 (116,505). The company was aiming to increase productivity at the plant by 10 per cent this year following a 13 per cent improvement in 1991. Productivity had improved by 30 per cent in the last three years. Total turnover fell by 10 per cent last year to Pounds 1.44bn (Pounds 1.59bn).</p>

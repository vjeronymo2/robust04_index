			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Serbia's stark choice: Sunday's elections could determine whether the Bosnian conflict spreads into a wider Balkan war After more than a year of war and economic decline, Serbs are facing a choice between continuing international isolation and a chance for a fresh start. Sunday's parliamentary and presidential elections in Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise the unrecognised Yugoslav federation, could determine whether peace can be returned to Bosnia; they could also determine whether the conflict spreads into a wider Balkan war. The contest for Serbian president appears simple. Some 6.9m voters will chose between Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic, the Belgrade-born California millionaire who promises peace and prosperity, and Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the incumbent. Mr Milosevic promises the same, but since coming to power in 1987 his aggressive territorial expansionism has led to the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and pushed Serbia relentlessly into war and economic chaos. If Mr Milosevic is re-elected, his policy of confrontation in Bosnia is unlikely to change, possibly provoking ethnic violence in Serbia itself. If Mr Panic is elected he will try - however improbably - to negotiate a peace in Bosnia by disavowing Mr Milosevic's ambitions of creating a 'greater Serbia'. The alternatives facing voters should therefore be clear. But in Serbia's distorted political landscape, where paranoia and a sense of victimisation prevail, the race is wide open. Amid mounting international demands to prosecute Serbian leaders as war criminals for their 'ethnic cleansing', Mr Milosevic will cling to power at all costs. If he fails to gain the 50 per cent majority required to win outright in the first round of elections, western diplomats fear Mr Milosevic will provoke ethnic violence in Serbia to rally Serbs around him. If he is defeated in the run-off, he could refuse to cede power and unleash a wave of violence which could spill into Kosovo in southern Serbia where Serbs and ethnic Albanians are in conflict, and even beyond the rump of Yugoslavia. Clashes in these regions could draw in neighbouring Albania, Macedonia or Hungary, and could even touch off a chain reaction eventually affecting Greece and Turkey. By stoking unrest, Mr Milosevic would be throwing down a blatant challenge to any successor regime. If Mr Milosevic and his so-called Socialists (the former communists) with their ultra-nationalist allies win a controlling majority in parliament, the war in neighbouring Bosnia will continue and ethnic cleansing will gain momentum in Serbia. The Serbian president can call on the support of officials, police and bosses of state companies who will lose their jobs if he is defeated. Well-armed fighters loyal to the Serbian president stalk the streets of Belgrade with impunity. If Milosevic's regime is deposed the tens of thousands of paramilitaries would join the 40,000-strong Serbian police force in its defence. The top echelon of the Yugoslav army has given support to the federal government in Belgrade under Mr Panic. State television is Mr Milosevic's most important weapon. Praise for the Serbian president, coupled with vicious attacks on Mr Panic, have bolstered Mr Milosevic and spread the notion that his rival is a CIA agent, conspiring to tighten United Nations sanctions and give away Kosovo - seen by Serbs as the seat of their civilisation - to Albania. Few know of Mr Panic's dynamic campaign, partly because independent television, the only service to which he has access, does not broadcast beyond Belgrade. He tells cheering crowds he will make them rich, so he can hand over their taxes to the state. This slogan would not win votes in the west, but it offers a semblance of normality in a climate of fear. Predictably, state television paints a fanciful picture of Serbia's economic recovery under the embargo. Mr Milosevic fills the screen each night, boasting of oil discoveries and defiantly pledging that Serbs will never bend to the will of the international community. Except for a flourishing arms industry, the real economic picture is a grim contrast with Mr Milosevic's claims. Living standards have plummeted and industry is on the brink of collapse. Inflation is running at 30 per cent a month and the average monthly salary is about Dollars 60, a tenth of what it was five years ago in real terms. In an effort to lure voters, workers have been given holiday bonuses, and pensions have been paid out in full for the first time in many months. Before the election campaign, the Serbian opposition, disorganised and quarrelsome, had been a thin reedy voice, defending itself against the charge of betraying Serbia. Now, Depos, the main opposition coalition, and the Democratic party, a centrist group, have rallied behind Mr Panic but they, too, suffer from lack of access to the state media. The opposition, working on a shoestring budget, is optimistic, however, saying they will split the vote with the Socialists. Opinion polls, many of which are unreliable because polling is still undeveloped, predict Mr Panic will coast to victory on the back of support in the opposition stronghold of Belgrade and a few other cities, and among national minorities, which make up a third of Serbia's population. For all the risks of civil war, the stark choice facing Serbia is embodied in Mr Panic's campaign slogan: 'It's now or never.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  first open Majles session for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995] was held yesterday, chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Hamadan, the  Jewish minority, Bahar and Kabudar Ahang, Rasht, and Dorud and  Azna gave speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech  concerning the exalted leader's speech about the work ethic and  the social order and also about the injustice of the  international organizations, which was printed in the previous  issue. We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the  detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Seyyed Jalal Sadatian, Deputy From Hamadan </H5>   The Second Five-Year Plan must be written in such a way that  it will make the people more hopeful about the nation's future.    The first preagenda speaker at the open Majles session was  Sadatian, deputy from Hamadan. He offered congratulations on the  beginning of the new year and the day of the founding of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, 12 Farvardin [1 April]. He said: In  the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] many important tasks  were completed and steps were taken to build Islamic Iran and  make it more prosperous. The Majles approved and studied  important motions and bills and gave a vote of confidence to Mr.  Hashemi's new cabinet. It studied and approved the 1373 budget  with a view to the Second Five-Year Plan, and it increased its  control and supervision of the government companies.    He then discussed the high and proud role of the Majles.  Continuing, he said: The exalted leader emphasized two basic  elements, the work ethic and social order, as elements that will  build a civilization with reliance on culture, insight,  understanding and holistic human thinking, and he gave the good  news that our nation is building a civilization.    For reaching this lofty goal, Sadatian mentioned the  following points:    1 - Duplicate organizations, inefficient organizations, and  organizations that do not work must be eliminated by the Majles,  and the real needs of the people for organizations that provide  service must be met through necessary elimination and  consolidation.    2 - The Second Five-Year Plan must be written in such a way  that it provides incentives for the people to work and make  effort, and makes them more hopeful about the future.    3 - The Social Security, Social Insurance and Government  Services Bill that is on the Majles agenda must be approved in  such a way that it serves to develop as much as possible social  justice, social incentives, and more public participation in  social activities.    4 - To eliminate the negative effects of inflation and  prevent the problems caused by high prices, in addition to the  things provided in the 1373 budget bill, measures that will  control prices and in particular, prevent monopolies, must be  implemented.    5 - Discrimination is one of the things that undermine the  work ethic and the social order. It is incumbent upon the  judicial power to emphasize implementation of the law more than  ever. In the same regard the deputy from Hamadan discussed  greater cooperation between the government and the Majles in the  year 1373. He said: An effort must be begun to encourage more  than ever the spirit of mobilization and the spirit of doing a  good job throughout this dear country of ours, which is busy  with work and activity. For example two or three years ago the  management at the Esfahan Iron Foundry was able to bring about a  change and strengthen the work ethic in the work environment. In  this spirit they were able to carry out a large part of the  project.    At the end of his speech he discussed the importance of the  role of the people in reconstruction, and he called for greater  belief in the people in the reconstruction of the country.  <H5>  Kuros Kayvani, Deputy From the Jewish Minority </H5>   Contrary to the purposeful rumors of the human rights  organizations, religious minorities in Iran have every kind of  freedom.    The next speaker was Kayvani, deputy from the Jewish  minority. He offered congratulations on the new year, and in his  speech he discussed the Jewish holidays, which coincide with the  New Year celebration. He said: For hundreds of years these  holidays have been celebrated with complete tranquility and  brotherly coexistence in this wide land of Iran, and they can be  an example for the world. All the people of this land have  worked and sacrificed their lives to preserve this freedom and  solidarity. The minority martyrs are testimony to this claim,  and it is confirmed by minority participation in the 10 Days of  Dawn Celebration and on God's Day, 12 Farvardin.    The speaker also said: Perhaps a careful study of the free  staging of these celebrations by the human rights organizations  and societies would prove to them that, contrary to purposeful  rumors, religious minorities in Iran have every kind of freedom  to practice their religious rites and every kind of facility has  been made available to them, including, the right to leave for  the soldiers under the flag, government agents, and closing the  religious schools on their religious holidays.    Continuing, Kayvani added: The religious minorities have  always followed their religious rules in their individual lives  and have been free to teach their faith. The Constitution of the  Islamic Republic of Iran guarantees this.    He also said: History shows that comparing the Jews in the  East for example with those in the Islamic lands and especially  Iran, the latter have had greater freedom. If in the West it can  be said that after the French revolution and what came from it,  the Jews were given the full right to follow their religion and  that the doors to cultural institutions were open to them, on  the contrary in the Islamic lands and Iran the Jews have had  scholars, professors and great artists and have played a part in  the nation's destiny. They have even reached high government  positions such as prime minister.    He discussed the fact that racism and limiting the rights of  minorities and the publication and spread of inappropriate and  empty insults are undeniably part of the imperialist political  and cultural invasion. He said: A look at the sayings and  writings of that great mystic and wise leader who founded the  Islamic Republic of Iran will show the extent to which he  respected the rights of religious minorities. Even in his  political positions he always emphasized that we make a  distinction between Jewish society and Zionism.    The speaker continued: As has been said many times, the  banner of Islam and the great scholars of Islam and Shiism have  always sheltered and protected religious minorities.    Therefore such writings and accusations are far removed from  the behavior and actions of the nation of Iran, from the laws  and goals of the Islamic revolution and from the Imam's path.  The great spirit of Iran and the government of the republic,  which is great because of the laws of unity and the legacy of  the Imam's teachings, is innocent of these accusations.  <H5>  'Ali Ya'qubi, Deputy From Bahar and Kabudar Ahang </H5>   The triumph of the Muslims of Turkey shows their interest in  Islamic culture and their contempt for the culture of the West.    The next speaker was Ya'qubi, deputy from Bahar and Kabudar  Ahang. In his speech he offered congratulations on the new year  and discussed the slaughter of praying Palestinians by Zionists  at Dar al-Khalil last year and the silence of the international  organizations. He said: The result of the silence of the  international societies and organizations in the face of this  savage slaughter and the criminal and compromising approach  taken by most of the Western regimes to these crimes will be  that we will see a repetition of the al-Khalil tragedy.    Continuing, the speaker also said: Despite extensive  propaganda by the Turkish secularists, who have vast propaganda  resources at their disposal, the Islamic Rifah Party was  victorious in the Turkish mayoral elections, and I congratulate  the Muslims of Turkey on this victory. This shows the awareness  of the Muslims and their interest in Islamic culture and  government, and their contempt and loathing for the culture of  the West and secular governments. It is hoped that in the near  future we will see victory by the Muslims of Turkey in the  elections for parliament and other political areas.    Ya'qubi then discussed the exalted leader's New Year's  message to the people and government leaders, and he asked them  to strive to bring this message to fruition.    He then discussed increasing efficiency in the offices. He  said: The structure of the administrative system must be  revised. The existence of huge organizations with duplicated  functions and a complicated bureaucracy will have no result  other than to reduce efficiency and leave the public with no  place to go. Improving management in the government companies  and in the institutions affiliated with the government, and  making using of committed and specialist manpower that is  concerned about the Islamic revolution in key positions will be  effective in improving efficiency.    The speaker then discussed social order and observing order.  He said: We must all obey the law. If someone violates the law,  he must be dealt with severely. If the laws approved by the  Majles are carefully implemented, we will then no longer see the  spending of some 6.5 billion rials on printing calendars and  various magazines using funds from the public treasury.    In this same regard, he then discussed the fact that in the  1373 budget these kinds of expenditures and frills are  prohibited. He said: I ask the speaker of the Majles to take  measures even as the year begins to economize and avoid  ostentation and to deal with law breakers in accordance with  regulations.    At the end of his speech, the deputy from Bahar and Kabudar  Ahang discussed inflation and the fluctuating foreign exchange  rate in the year 1372, and he called for dealing seriously with  violators and punishing according to the law those who disrupt  the nation's economic system.  <H5>  Mohammad Baqer Nowbakht, Deputy From Rasht </H5>   The next speaker was Nowbakht, deputy from Rasht. In his  speech he offered congratulations on the new year. He said: The  nation's management, in view of the characteristics and  conditions in the year 1373, needs more planning and  comprehensive thinking. The writing and approval of an orderly  budget for the current year, whose approved revenues are less  than 60 percent of the revenues approved for the previous year,  and which has a 13-percent reduction in current expense credits  and a 7-percent reduction in development credits in the Majles  compared to the figures in the government's proposed budget,  entails a coordinated effort by the government and the Majles to  apply realistic management.    The speaker then discussed the utilization of the same  resources and the submission of a more desirable performance  report from the government and the Majles in the year 1373, and  he called for the implementation of the following:    1 - The government should be careful to apply supervision,  to  intervene effectively in the nation's economic affairs and to  deal seriously and lawfully with those who sell at high prices.  Unfortunately, two related phenomena have always kept the  government from taking real and proper measures in this regard,  or else it has resisted. One of these two phenomena is the  incorrect language some people have used, posing as concerned  experts and economists, in describing the policy of economic  adjustment and the need to adjust the market based on the  mechanism of supply and demand. They say that practical  supervision or any kind of government intervention in the market  are obstacles to private sector cooperation in economic affairs.  They suggest that the government's reasonable decision for  rational and planned privatization may have been a mistake, and  they constantly spread fear.    The other phenomenon is the invisible economic abusers, who  create such a furor the minute the government intervenes in a  market affair that one would conclude that wherever the  government does something or intervenes in the market, the  situation gets worse.    Continuing, he added: In submitting and approving the  general  form of the Consumer Rights Support Bill, the Majles and the  government must first show that they are serious about this and  that they will deal clearly with two realities, the first that  government supervision and intervention to control the market  and even with economic investment activities is not even in  conflict with economic and investment goals, much less in  conflict with the economic goals of Islam, and second that a  distinction must be made between the private sector that wants  sound participation and a reasonable profit in economic affairs  and those who are abusers.    In this same regard the speaker said: Therefore, the  deliberations in the second consultation on the Consumer Rights  Support Bill will be a good opportunity for the Majles to make  the government more careful about preventing uncontrolled price  increases, most of which are done without economic consideration  on the pretext that foreign exchange rates have increased, and  to use all government resources to supervise the marketing of  goods at the finished cost with a reasonable profit percentage.  This supervision will be no less important than defending the  public against an enemy military invasion.    2 - Realistic and praiseworthy measures the government and  the Majles have taken, which must be compiled and approved in  the best possible way in the year 1373, is the amendment to the  Uniform Payments System Law and the increase in retirement  pensions.    He said the implementation of this law has created many  problems for government retirees. He said: In some cases  retirement wages have dropped so drastically compared to  employment wages that retirement is seen as complete bankruptcy.    Elsewhere in his talk he asked the National Expediency  Discernment Council to approve Note 1, Article 1 of the  Universal Payments System Law, which pertains to employees with  bachelor's degrees and lower.    In conclusion he said: Another measure the Majles must take  has to do with the Social Security Law and eliminating the age  restrictions for women retirees. If this is done, women workers,  who will have the ability to retire voluntarily without age  restrictions, will have more of an opportunity to carry out  their maternal responsibilities in the home. This will also  create appropriate employment opportunities for individuals  willing to work.  <H5>  Jahanshah Sadiq, Deputy From Dorud And Azna </H5>   The final preagenda speaker was Sadiq, deputy from Dorud and  Azna. He offered congratulations on the new year, and in his  speech he discussed the province of Lorestan hosting the  president of the republic and the joyous and unequalled public  welcome he received. He said: The deputies from Lorestan declare  their praise and thanks to the respected president of the  republic, and they sincerely thank him for designating the  province as one in need of development, industrial expansion,  services, agriculture, and other services.    The speaker also added: Following numerous follow-up  measures, messages concerning Lorestan's problems and issues to  the executive organizations and the statements by the president  of the republic, it is incumbent upon the executive officials,  especially the members of the Council of Ministers, to give  importance to alleviating the problems in the province of  Lorestan, changing the face of the province, developing  industry, ancillary petrochemical industries and the Arak  refinery in Lorestan, developing higher education and  educational affairs, and other things.    In conclusion he thanked the minister of the interior for  making Pol-e Dokhtar va Azna ol-Shotor a municipality.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Health Insurance Bill </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the first consultation of the Joint  Health Care and Plan and Budget Commission concerning the  National Health Insurance Bill.  <H5>  Joint Commission's View </H5>   Hasan Aminlu, expert for the joint commission, gave a speech  discussing this bill. He said: The nation's health care and  treatment problems and malfunctions require that a basic change  be made in the nation's health care system. This is necessary to  establish social justice in the country and have subsidies be  directed so that our people will receive good treatment, and  also so that the people will not have problems when they go to  the health care centers, which makes them disappointed with the  government.    Continuing, he said: Clearly there are points in the details  that will be changed in the second consultation.    Mr. Aminlu discussed the financial load from this bill. He  said: Government staff employees are to pay between one-third  and one-fifth of their own per-person treatment fees, and the  government will pay the remainder as subsidies. If treatment  retains its current subsidy and if the treatment situation is  like this, and if government makes infrastructure investments  for treatment, then the per-person cost of treatment at current  rates will be 500 tumans.    Workers will be treated in accordance with the Social  Security Law, and clearly a load will thereby be added to the  Social Security Organization's responsibilities. Concerning  rural people, the fee will be 250 tumans, of which one-third  will be paid by the rural people themselves and the rest by the  government as subsidies. Self-employed people will pay 100  percent of the costs themselves.    The government now pays 75 billion tumans for insurance. In  the year 1373 the government will also pay 15 billion tumans for  staff employees, bringing the total to 90 billion tumans. The  government has also set aside 4 billion tumans to give the  Imam's Aid Committee for the vulnerable classes. Therefore the  total subsidies for treatment is 94 billion tumans.    However, the cost to the government in connection with this  bill will be as follows: if we take 10 million people from the  vulnerable classes into consideration at the 500 tumans, this  will be 96,000 tumans for each person and for that number of  people the total will be 60 billion tumans. If we consider 25  million rural people at 1,500 tumans per person per year, this  will total 375 billion tumans. For 5 million government staff  employees the cost will be 22.5 billion tumans, and the total  for all groups will be 120 billion tumans. The government will  also have to pay some 20 billion tumans for repeat treatment.  The commission expert discussed the hospitals absorbing their  own high costs. He said: The hospitals absorbing their own high  costs is provided for until the end of the Second Five-Year Plan.  <H5>  Dr. Jabbarzadeh, Opposition </H5>   Dr. Jabbarzadeh, deputy from Tabriz, spoke in opposition to  the general form of the bill. He said: This bill cannot solve  the existing insurance problems. Also, with the formation of the  Supreme Insurance Council, in effect the main responsibility of  the minister of health care and treatment is being taken away  from him and will be given to a nonspecialist council. Another  of his objections to the bill is its method of financial  procurement. He said: Every year the price of social security is  increased. How are those who are covered by social security  insurance going to pay for it?    He then criticized the policy of transferring government  hospitals to the private sector. He said: The entire message of  the bill is the transfer of government hospitals to the private  sector, and if this bill is approved it will not benefit the  people.  <H5>  Dr. Zare', Support </H5>   Dr. Zare', deputy from Shiraz, spoke in support of the bill.  He said: It is very important to have proper supervision of the  implementation of treatment and providing coverage to all the  people in society, and this need requires that a new change be  made in the insurance system.    He also said: One of the bill's distinctions is that it will  end the insurance monopoly . That is, people will be able to  meet their treatment expenses entirely through insurance, and  the physician's ties to money will be completely cut.  <H5>  Rahbari, Opposition </H5>   Rahbari spoke in opposition to the National Health Insurance  Bill. He said: The new insurance system that you want to pass  will bring increased prices for the people. When you want to  modernize the treatment system, in practice the people for whom  you want to provide treatment will have to pay a high price for  it, and in practice a person who cannot pay will expire.    He also added: Why is it that the physicians, pharmacies,  and  treatment centers do not accept this insurance? You go and look  for the reason. The financial burden issue is that whoever has  more money will receive good treatment, and a person who cannot  pay will expire.    Rahbari also noted: What mechanism exists so that our rural  people can go and get insured? Since they are not connected to  any place that can insure them, in effect those who are old and  in need of treatment will be insured, and those who are young  will not be insured. In practice this will mean that the  financial burden on the government's shoulders will be great,  and this is very damaging and will hurt the nation's treatment  system.  <H5>  Kuhkan, Support </H5>   Another supporter of the aforementioned bill was Mohsen  Kuhkan. During a speech he said: One of the bill's distinctions  is that if we are going to subsidize drugs and treatment, we  should give it directly to the patient, not to the importer, the  distributor, and other people.    He then added: The gentlemen are saying that the nation and  the government will have to pay more money, but this is not  correct. Approving the bill will raise the quality of treatment,  and this is acceptable to everyone.  <H5>  Nurbakhsh, Opposition </H5>   Nurbakhsh spoke in opposition to this bill. He said: What  they always say about drugs is that they are not available in  the pharmacies, but they can be found on Naser Khosrow Street.  Is there any guarantee that when this bill is approved we will  no longer have problems getting drugs? He also said: Where in  this bill does it say anything about society's vulnerable  classes? We believe that government staff employees are also one  of these vulnerable classes.    He also added: We believe that this bill reduces the  prerogatives of the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and  Medical Education. We must strengthen this organization so it  can supervise drugs and treatment. We should not reduce its  supervisory role and give it to a council.  <H5>  Dr. Sadr, Support </H5>   Dr. Sadr, deputy from Tehran, spoke in support of this bill,  arguing we cannot say that universal insurance is not a good  thing. He said: Every day the price of treatment supplies  increases in the world and we cannot deny this. One day our  brothers in the provinces were trying to get a CAT scan machine,  and now they are trying to get an MRI machine. Next they will be  wanting a laser machine. Therefore we cannot ignore these  issues. We must accept the realities. In the nation's  dysfunctional drug and treatment situation, this bill can solve  some of the nation's problems.    He then said: The government cannot bear the country's  entire  burden. This will never happen. However, with the government's  resources and the money the government pays to the insurance  fund, it will definitely benefit the people. Dr. Sadr also  added: High prices have nothing to do with the bill, because if  you do not approve this bill, drugs and treatment will  automatically go up.  <H5>  Nowruzi, Opposition </H5>   'Abdollah Nowruzi, deputy from Molayer, spoke in opposition.  He said: On the first Majles work day of the year, we are giving  our nation the good news that Majles is causing prices to rise.  We accept universal insurance, but this bill is not universal  insurance.    He then said: When you want to collect the finished cost of  drugs and treatment, how can professionals and self-employed  people, many of whom do not have financial resources, bear the  burden of these costs? The cost of heart surgery is already 1 to  2 million tumans. Who can pay for that? He said: The  unemployment rate is already 11 percent. Do those people have  the ability to pay for insurance? What are they going to do?    Nowruzi added: Mr. Hoseyni Shahrudi went to the hospital for  treatment. When he came back he said: "what a joke." If they  tell me to turn the military bases over to the private sector, I  will do so, but I believe you should not transfer the hospitals.  <H5>  Dr. Shahrzad, Support </H5>   Dr. Shahrzad, deputy from Esfahan, spoke in support with the  bill. He said: I say to our dear people, treatment in the year  1373 will be as it was before, and there will be no change in  rates or organization. In view of the fact that this bill is  going through its first consultation, and its credit resources  will have to be procured in the year 1374 [21 March 1995-20  March 1996], this is an answer to some of the respected  opponents, for studying and approving this bill is not  inconsistent with the Second Five-Year Plan, and it is certainly  better for us to study it in the year 1373, The plans for  universal insurance and social security services is definitely  part of the Second Five-Year Plan. It is very likely that its  implementation will be deferred to the year 1374.    He then said: I support the general form of the bill, but I  do not fully support the bill's current form. When we reject  this bill, that will mean that although the existing situation  is not desirable, we want to accept it [as published].    Dr. Dastjerdi, a woman speaking in support of the bill,  said:  The government has left the deputies a free hand to make any  kind of change to this bill. Today is a good opportunity for the  Fourth Majles to correct the insurance situation for 35 million  people in society. I am surprised that the opponents are saying  this bill will make the situation worse for the people. Those  who do not have an insurance booklet, such as the rural people  and society's vulnerable classes, do not have anything. How are  these people going to go to the treatment centers? For Caesarian  operations in government hospitals, they must pay 20,000 tumans.  Where are they going to get this?    She said: I have 70 office calls every day, and 20 of them  have counterfeit insurance booklets from other people, because  they do not have the money to pay.    She also emphasized: We members of the commission are 100  percent opposed to transferring hospitals to the private sector,  but the hospitals must absorb their own high costs in this way  so that they will economize on the materials they consume.    The minister of health care and treatment also spoke in  support of this bill, and then the general form of the bill was  put to a vote and approved.</p>

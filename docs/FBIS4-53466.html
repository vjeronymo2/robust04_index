The article says:    History has never seen such society as the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea where politics strictly serves the  people.    This is because the dear leader General Kim Chong-il  possessed of the noble idea of "believing in the people as in  heaven" shapes policies of benevolence, affection and trust.    The dear leader perfected a scientific political idea on the  basis of the Chuche idea and established a new Chuche view of  politics.    His noble political idea and unshakable political creed is  that the popular masses are the master of politics and it must  serve them.    One of the advantages of his politics of affection and trust  is that all members of society can live and develop  independently and creatively as the masters of the state and  society with immortal socio-political integrity.    The dear leader General Kim Chong-il said:    "Genuine politics for the people means respecting them and  doing them all favours."    His politics of affection and trust finds graphic expression  in his famous slogan "We serve the people!" He guides the party  and the state to firmly defend the interests of the people and  strictly subordinate everything to them in making and  implementing the lines and policies.    His politics provides all members of society with freedom  and  equality and gives full play to their individuality.    His is a great politics which makes it possible to give full  play to social attributes of man. It also enables people to  defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation, and  mankind to live a happy life in harmony. This politics will be  everlasting with the future of mankind.    His politics of affection and trust reaches the overseas  compatriots, especially the Koreans in Japan.    We Koreans in Japan including the officials of Chongnyon  live  and fight full of confidence and optimism with the most precious  socio-political integrity in Japan which is based on the  principle of struggle for existence and the law of the jungle,  not wavering no matter which way the wind may blow.    Even in the corrupt and ailing capitalist society, we live a  dignified life with precious political integrity because the  dear leader is constantly infusing life-giving water into us all.    There are many countries and leaders in the world, but no  such leader as our dear leader General Kim Chong-il who works  hard to give immortal socio-political integrity even to the  overseas compatriots and exalt it.</p>

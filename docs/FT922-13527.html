			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / French court issues warrant for Medecin A FRENCH court yesterday issued an international arrest warrant for Mr Jacques Medecin, the former mayor of the Riviera resort of Nice, who fled to Uruguay 18 months ago to escape prosecution for fraud. The warrant, over alleged embezzlement of city funds, comes two months after Mr Medecin was sentenced in his absence to a year's imprisonment and a FFr2.5m (Dollars 453,000) fine for misusing public money. He still faces charges over four other fraud and financial corruption allegations. Formerly one of southern France's most influential local politicians, the right-wing Mr Medecin now sells T-shirts in Punta del Este and has had his luxury villa near Nice confiscated to pay back-taxes. Yesterday's move also increases the pace in a general crackdown on financial corruption in politics, enthusiastically taken up by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the new prime minister. He made a stir on Wednesday during his maiden prime ministerial address, by brandishing in parliament a list of alleged offenders. Several MPs, outraged at the apparent threat, left the chamber, though Mr Beregovoy later said no MPs were on the list. At the same time, a number of legal actions against party financial corruption are coming to a head. In the past month, charges have been laid against Mr Geard Monate and Mr Michel Reyt, the heads of two consultancies accused of having used illicit methods to raise funds for the ruling Socialist party. Opposition parties are also implicated in other investigations stretching back several years. Yesterday's warrant, issued by the Grenoble prosecutor's chamber, concerns FFr2.2m found missing from a city-funded group established to promote Nice opera house. As a next step, the French authorities are expected to ask Uruguay to extradite Mr Medecin. Technically, Uruguay can refuse because it has no extradition accord with France, so the outcome hangs on diplomatic contacts. Despite his exile, Mr Medecin still exerts strong indirect influence on politics in the region of Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur. He has lent his support to the extreme-right-wing National Front (FN), which emerged as the second most powerful party there in last month's regional election. Mr Medecin's eldest daughter joined the FN's list in the election, but failed to win a seat.</p>

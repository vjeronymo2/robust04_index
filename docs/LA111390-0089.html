			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIMEDYNE'S LASER TO UNCLOG ARTERIES APPROVED BY FDA  </P> <P> Trimedyne Inc., a Tustin medical laser catheter manufacturer struggling to  revive flagging sales, said Monday that it has received Food and Drug  Administration approval to market the first "cold laser" for opening blocked  leg arteries.  </P> <P> Trimedyne in 1987 was the first company to win the FDA's approval to market a  laser-powered "hot-tip" catheter to sear through fatty plaque in leg arteries.  The hot laser uses laser energy to heat the metal tip of a catheter, which is  then threaded through arteries to vaporize blockages.  </P> <P> But hot laser sales fell off when the medical community expressed preference  for an alternative technology, the cold laser, which uses a free beam of  laser-produced light, administered in short bursts, to remove plaque without  producing significant heat. Doctors prefer it because they want to eliminate  the possibility of thermal damage to healthy tissues.  </P> <P> Although Trimedyne's hot laser has shown success in opening clogged leg  arteries, the FDA has not approved it for use in the heart. The market for  using lasers to unblock clogged heart arteries is estimated by Trimedyne to be  worth up to $800 million a year.  </P> <P> Trimedyne began developing a cold laser about two years ago. The Trimedyne  Omni-Pulse laser approved by the FDA is powered by a holmium crystal that  generates short bursts of ultraviolet light to vaporize plaque, said Richard  Demmer, Trimedyne's executive vice president, who added, "The medical world has  said the cold laser is the way to go, and now we have met the challenge."  </P> <P> Demmer said it is too soon to tell if the cold laser will prove superior to the  company's hot laser in treating blood vessel blockages in the legs.  </P> <P> Trimedyne's main objective, he said, is to get the cold laser approved for  cardiac use, although he acknowledges that the process will probably take two  years.  </P> <P> Another Southern California firm, Advanced Interventional Systems of Irvine, is  expected to become the first U.S. company to get federal approval to market a  cold laser to treat blocked coronary arteries.  </P> <P> A FDA medical panel recently approved the AIS device as an alternative to  bypass surgery in certain cases when balloon angioplasty -- forcing an opening  with pressure -- is ineffective in clearing a patient's heart arteries.  </P> <P> Trimedyne lost $6.2 million on revenue of $10.2 million for the first nine  months of its fiscal 1990 year, contrasted with earnings of $929,000 on revenue  of $26.6 million for the year-earlier period.  </P></p>

At the same time, the minister  of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] stated that in the past  year there has been a atmosphere of tranquility on both sides of  the fence separating the national territory from that occupied  by the foreign military base.    The second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba referred  to the madness of and provocation by those who attempt to leave  the island through Caimanera. He pointed out that this was  madness because they have to cross a densely mined field on both  sides of the fence. He added that this constituted a provocation  and an unwitting act of treason against the national security of  Cuba, because armies which are not friendly have been deployed  on both sides of the fence.    Raul made these declarations on visiting (Elmis Brooks  Chivas) of the border patrol brigade, who is hospitalized at the  military hospital in Santiago de Cuba. The 22-year-old soldier  lost one leg as he tried to rescue a group of people crossing a  field mined by the Yankee base in an attempt to leave the  country illegally.    During the visit, Raul was accompanied by Juan Almeida  Gomez,  who read the agreement designating (Brooks) a member of the  Cuban Revolution Veterans Association. At the same hospital Raul  visited Simon Despain, a civil worker of the FAR who also lost a  leg while carrying out technical work on the same border in  Caimanera.</p>

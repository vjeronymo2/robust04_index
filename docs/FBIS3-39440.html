The MOU will provide the framework for discussions on  equipment collaboration and co-operation. Industry will play a  key role in fulfilling the opportunities offered by the MOU and  the Ministry of Defence will explore the scope of co-operation  by investigating defence procurement requirements.    The MOU will build upon previous contact between British and  Swedish Industry and discussions continue between British  Aerospace and SAAB concerning further development and export of  JAS 39 light combat aircraft. There may also be opportunities  for joint development of a new generation medium range air to  air missile for the Eurofighter 2000 and JAS 39 Grippen as well  as for subsequent export.  <H5>  Mr Rifkind said: </H5>   "This is a very positive step and a number of defence  requirements which contain areas of similarity are currently  being considered. There may be more and what this initiative  will require is innovative action by our respective industries  to pursue and fully exploit the opportunities offered."</p>

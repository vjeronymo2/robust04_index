			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.H.: "The Reverse Side of Fear"] </F>   [Text] A huge crowd paid a final tribute yesterday to Ahmed  and Rabah Asselah at the Higher School of Fine Arts, then  accompanied them to their last resting place at the Garidi  Cemetery in Kouba. There were several thousand close relatives,  friends, students, artists, film makers, theater people,  writers, journalists, academics, and people of all occupations  and conditions. The Garidi Cemetery could not hold them all.    Sadness furrowed faces that we had previously seen only as  friendly and welcoming. Weariness could be seen on their  shoulders. "At every funeral we ask ourselves the same question:  who will be next?" said one of them. Another person replied:  "You don't have to ask that question anymore; he is among us  here!"    "As in the case of Tahar Djaout, Belkhenchir, Boucebsi, and  so many others, targets are chosen on the basis of integrity,  goodness, modesty, and freedom of thought. Along with the  bullet's physical impact, the desired psychological impact is  discouragement, fear, and dispersal. But it is the opposite that  is being produced." All around us, determination could be seen  in the hardening faces and the looks exchanged.    "We are paying a high price for the freedom to think when we  pay with the lives of the best among us. History will recall  that our freedom to meet was exercised first in cemeteries and,  especially, on a day in March when the stupendous artist Mohamed  Racim and his wife were murdered," said one intellectual.    "It's like shooting clay pigeons!" said one academic.    "We are not going to remain defenseless. Fear currently  exists in only one camp. There is no way that it is going to  stay there forever. Arm yourselves!"    His neighbor corrected him: "Let us arm ourselves!"    Ahmed Asselah, a discreet and peaceable man, was not sparing  in the encouragement he gave artists through his presence at  previews of art exhibits, photographic exhibits, theatrical and  movie premieres, musical concerts, and other types of  entertainment. And everyone from that world had come to pay  their last respects. But there were also people who had known  him only by name and others who had not heard of him before he  was killed but who came to pay him tribute in a show of  solidarity.</p>

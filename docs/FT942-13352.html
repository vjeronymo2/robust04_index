			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Clinton attempts to inject urgency into health reform committees President Bill Clinton has urged congressional leaders to complete the committee stages of drafting a healthcare reform bill by May 27, when Congress goes into recess. 'The president asked me if we could get a bill out by Memorial Day. We'll try,' said Senator Pat Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee. But committee chairmen have found it difficult crafting a bill that will secure a majority in their own committees, let alone in a full vote of the 100-member Senate or the 435-seat House of Representatives. Congressman John Dingell, whose energy and commerce committee is one of three principal House panels with jurisdiction over the healthcare reform, has sought to win over more votes by proposing to exclude businesses with fewer than 10 employees from the mandate to provide health insurance for workers. The proposal has so far failed to persuade Congressman Jim Slattery, a moderate Democrat from Kansas who is regarded as a crucial swing vote on the committee. Nevertheless, Mr Dingell hopes to start the final mark-up of a bill as early as this week. The House education and labour committee is still engaged at the sub-committee level on a draft similar to the original Clinton version, while the ways and means committee, which has jurisdiction over tax aspects, is not expected to begin a full committee mark-up for another few weeks. Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, ways and means committee chairman, provoked a furore last week when he suggested some form of broadly based tax increase, possibly through income tax, would be needed to finance healthcare reform - at least in its early years. While a large majority of Congress has now signed on to the general aim of providing universally guaranteed health coverage, such an extension of healthcare will cost the government money, whether to pay for insurance for those who do not now have it or to subsidise the costs of small businesses. Mr Clinton said he was unperturbed by Mr Rostenkowski's proposal. 'I think Mr Rostenkowski is trying to achieve our common objectives, which he defined as universal coverage, cost control and 218 votes,' the president said. Some Republican leaders, meanwhile, have sought to shackle the health reform bill by taking away one of the main sources of funds already agreed on - a higher tax on cigarettes - to pay for lost revenues attributable to tariff reductions agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, which under US budget rules must be offset.</p>

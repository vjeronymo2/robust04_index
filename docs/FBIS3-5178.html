The group reached their  conclusion at a luncheon meeting at Princess Hotel after a hand  grenade was lobbed into the home of the former public health  minister off Wiphawadi-Rangsit Highway shortly before 2 a.m.    But the allegation was immediately rejected by Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai who said the Government was not involved.  "I really don't know how this happened, but it is definitely not  what the Opposition said," he said.    Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "This  Government respects the basic right of people to criticise its  performance," he said. "We can live with those with different  opinions because our society is an open one. And we can use the  same right to argue and defend ourselves. "There is no need for  this government to resort to illegal means or violence. That's  not the nature of this government or politicians in this  government."    Yesterday's meeting was attended by Opposition and Chat Thai  leader Praman Adireksan, Chat Phattana [CPP] leader Chatchai  Chunhawan, SAP [Social Action Party] leader Montri Phongphanit,  Ratsadon leader Chaipak Siriwat, Chat Thai deputy leader Sano  Thianthong, CPP secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan, SAP deputy  leader Suwit Khunkitti and SAP secretary-general Chaloem  Yubamrung.    Mr Montri, the nephew of Mr Bunphan and a resident of the  same compound in Soi Panni, said he was confident the bomb  attack was intended more as intimidation than actually hurting  anyone. He said he had recently been pointing out the  Government's shortcomings to people during the city and district  council election campaign. "So this is apparently aimed at  preventing the Opposition from telling the people the truth," he  said. "I have thought it over and I cannot see why anyone would  ever want to hurt Mr Bunphan. We finally concluded it was an  act of intimidation. "But I don't know who could be behind this  act because we don't have any personal problems with anyone."    Mr Montri said he respected Prime Minister Chuan Likphai.  "By  nature, we are political enemies. We criticise the Government  because we want it to work and it must listen to us. I am  really sorry. Anyone who sees what happened will know how  violent it was." The politician said he and other Opposition  leaders would not seek extra protection during the remaining  campaign period, but would continue to inform the people of the  problems in the Government.    Pol Capt [Police Captain] Chaloem said he did not think  police would be able to arrest anyone in connection with the  attack. "It's just intimidation and only those who were behind  it know who the perpetrators are," he said. "This kind of thing  never happens to people in the Government but is frequent with  Opposition members." Pol Capt Chaloem later told the BANGKOK  POST at Mr Montri's home a police officer who is a younger  brother of a senior official with the Prime Minister's Office  and the bodyguard of a Democrat minister might be responsible  for the attack because of Mr Montri's rude criticisms of Prime  Minister Chuan during political activities.    SAP deputy leader Dusit Sophitcha, in a separate interview,  said the bomb attack was the work of "a third hand" to distract  the public attention from conflicts within the coalition.    Mr Aphisit said it was the duty of the police to find who  were behind the attack and the Opposition should provide  evidence if they can help investigators locate the culprits.    Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian called on the  public to treat the Government fairly over the incident.</p>

According to ITAR-TASS, on the eve of the new year, Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev expressed dissatisfaction with the  directorate's activity at a meeting with journalists. In his  opinion, under new conditions many personnel officers in  generals' positions are still doing everything in an  old-fashioned way, trying to work less with the soldiers and  looking after higher command personnel better. At the same time  the head of the military department was not uncomplimentary  about the lower echelons of the army personnel department, which  work with sergeants and other ranks. The reform will not affect  the interests of this category of officer.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: American Barrick defies market trend AMERICAN Barrick, the North American gold producer, has again defied the lacklustre bullion market by doubling first-quarter earnings. Net income jumped to USDollars 46.1m, or 16 cents a share, from Dollars 23.2m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. The per-share figures have been adjusted for a two-for-one share split last month. Revenues rose to Dollars 144.1m from Dollars 81.5m. The continued surge in profits was due largely to rising production at Barrick's flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Goldstrike produced 307,800 ounces in the latest period, up from 151,800 ounces a year earlier. The company ascribed the advance to higher-grade sulphide ores. The higher output and improved grade pushed down operating costs to Dollars 174 an ounce from Dollars 199 an ounce. Barrick also continues to benefit from its active hedging programme. It realised an average gold price of Dollars 410 in the first quarter, slightly below the previous year but still above the average Comex price of Dollars 330 an ounce. The company said it was on track to meet its 1993 production target of 1.5m ounces. Its five mines produced a total of 354,800 ounces in the quarter.</p>

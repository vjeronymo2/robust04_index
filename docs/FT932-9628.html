			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Row delays training revamp AN OVERHAUL of the education and training of young people, which would result in all 16-to-19-year-olds working towards a recognised qualification, is being delayed by a squabble between government departments, the Training and Enterprise Councils claimed yesterday. Tec leaders said they had expected Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, to publish a white paper on the issue this spring. A working party - drawn from Tecs, the Department for Education, the Employment Department and the Further Education Funding Council - submitted a report to Mrs Shephard, at her request, towards the end of last year. The working party recommended that by the year 2000 all people up to the age of 19 should be taking take part in an activity leading to a recognised qualification. The report called for a strengthened careers guidance service and a common system of funding for academic, vocational and job-specific training. It is understood that the education department favours the proposed reforms but the Department of Social Security may have objected to a transfer of funds from its budget to those of other government departments in order to cover the scheme. The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday urged a narrowing of the gap between academic and vocational training. It put forward a planto the government for a new national qualification awarded to those who achieved three Level 3 National Vocational Qualifications, or three A-Levels, or equivalent units of AS examinations and/or vocational qualifications.</p>

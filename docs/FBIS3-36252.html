The meeting is considered to be the first step  toward establishing interparliamentary ties between the two  countries.    Burbulis together with his American and Japanese  counterparts  participated in the trilateral forum on security in the north-  Pacific region which closed here on Wednesday.    Burbulis emphasized the significance of his meeting with  Takako Doi "from the point of view of a revival of the Russian  Parliament's prestige and the authority of the Russian  parliamentarians" in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday.    According to him, Takako doi showed much interest in the  process of forming the new Russian Parliament and emphasized  that it was important to establish fruitful cooperation between  the Russian and Japanese lawmakers as soon as possible.    She called on the Russian Parliament to resume the  activities  of the Russo-Japanese parliamentary committee which was  suspended because of the dissolvement of the former Supreme  Soviet.    Takako Doi expressed grave concern about the fact that the  last transformations inside Russia's Government might result in  curtailing the economic reforms. In response, Burbulis, who  represents the "Russia's Choice" faction in the lower chamber of  Russia's Parliament, said that the new Russian Constitution,  which was adopted on December 12, 1993, had for the first time  given the chance to secure political stability in the country.    "In no case shall we leave President Boris Yeltsin in  isolation, without the indispensable support of the  professionals who carried out the economic reforms," he  emphasized.    In his opinion, joint work of President yeltsin and Premier  Viktor chernomyrdin Is a sure guaranty of stability inside  Russia.    "Boris Yeltsin has received enough powers to provide for a  stable and competent system of government. As for Viktor  Chernomyrdin, he has always demonstrated his ability to make  strategic decisions which were in line with the course of  economic reforms," he said.    "Today it should have been dangerous to let the union  between  the president and the chairman of goverment collapse," he  emphasized.</p>

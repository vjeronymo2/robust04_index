			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> POOL TIMING SYSTEM DONATED TO COLLEGE  </P> <P> A private swim club has given Golden West College a new timing system for its  Olympic-size pool.  </P> <P> The community college announced that the private Golden West Swim Club had  purchased the $3,000 system for the pool.  </P> <P> It has been installed in time for use at the Long Course Junior Olympic  Regional Competition, which begins Saturday at the college.  </P> <P> On Monday, Ken Hamdorf, swim and water polo coach at Golden West, praised the  donation and said it is a valuable tool for all competitive swimming events.  </P> <P> "The swimmer comes in and touches the electric pad, and this then goes to the  computer, which records the exact time," Hamdorf said. "It eliminates a lot of  people having to hand-time events, and it gets rid of a lot of headaches."  </P> <P> Hamdorf said the electric pads are at the ends of swim lanes in the pool. The  pads are covered with a rubberized fabric, and the timer is triggered by a  touch from any part of the swimmer's body.  </P> <P> The Golden West Swim Club comprises about 300 swimmers ranging in age from 4 to  81.  </P></p>

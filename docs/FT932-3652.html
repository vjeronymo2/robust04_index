			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Books: A weird kind of icon HUNTER by E Jean Carroll Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 341 pages LIKE IT or not, it is difficult to avoid Dr Hunter S Thompson. Only recently Garry Trudeau devoted another of his 'Doonesbury' cartoon strips to the latest episode in the extraordinary life of Duke, the drug addict, quondam diplomat and Colorado recluse who is modelled on the self-styled 'gonzo' journalist. There have been at least three biographies of the man in the last year or two. For those who keep track,E Jean Carroll's is the one by the author who actually slept with him and nearly married him. This is not bad for a character who has produced only one seriously good book in 30 years (Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, a brilliantly idiosyncratic account of the 1972 election) and is considered even by his fans to be one of the most disappointing literary talents of his generation. Ms Carroll's technique is clever. Every third chapter or so gives an account of her own 'romance' with Thompson, written in the best Vanity Fair/Tom Wolfe style, deliciously revealing, funny, and self-mocking. The rest is a series of quotes from family, friends and enemies, from Louisville, Kentucky, via the Hell's Angels and political writing to the Colorado cabin. Thus she begins: 'I have heard the biographers of Harry S Truman, Catherine the Great, etc etc, say they would give anything if their subjects were alive so they could ask them some questions. I, on the other hand, would give anything if my subject were dead. He should be. Oh yes. Look at his daily routine: 3.00pm rise: 3.05 Chivas Regal with the morning papers, Dunhills. 3.45 cocaine: 3.50 another glass of Chivas, Dunhill: 4.05 first cup of coffee, Dunhill: 4.15 cocaine: 4.16 orange juice, Dunhill; 4.30 cocaine; 4.54 cocaine . . .' Eventually you get the picture, through the 7pm lunch at the Woody Creek Tavern (Heineken, two margaritas, two cheeseburgers, fries, tomatoes, coleslaw, taco salad, fried onion rings, carrot cake, ice cream, bean fritter, Dunhills, another Heineken, cocaine, and for the ride home a glass of shredded ice over which is poured three or four jiggers of Chivas.) At 9pm he 'starts snorting cocaine seriously'; at midnight, fortified by Chartreuse and pornographic movies, he is 'ready to write.' Or not, because it is a long time since Hunter Thompson has written anything. But there is no point in being po-faced about this. To write may be to disappoint: to be Hunter S Thompson is to be a weird kind of icon. Dick Goodwin, an old friend and intimate of the Kennedys, says: 'Hunter Thompson is a unique character of our times. He is a reality, which is one thing. And he is a symbol, which is another totally different thing. And thirdly he's both ultimately sane and crazy. He is also drunk and sober'. Carroll, with the deftest of touches, offers the most entertaining of reads with, correctly, an absence of moralising. Other minor literary characters should be so lucky.</p>

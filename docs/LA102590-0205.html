			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THE INCREDIBLE MR. FISH  </P> <P> Just down the road from the Southwest Museum in Highland Park, across the  street from a Chevy dealership and right next door to a locally notorious  church of the occult, is the tiny Mexican seafood cafe Senor Fish, its kitchen  a former burger shack, its dining room a clean, party-tented patio overrun with  friendly cats. (I like to think that a Senor Fish actually owns the place, but  who knows.) Outside there's a neat awning, and brightly painted shrimps and  shells on the wall; inside, not much more than a takeout window, and a stack of  newspapers. It's an extremely pleasant place to spend an afternoon.  </P> <P> Seated around the rough wooden picnic tables at lunch, a crowd of sweaty  mechanics and telephone linemen bolt down fried-fish tacos, giant octopus  burritos, torrents of the milky rice-flour drink, horchata, smoking and  laughing, occasionally flipping a shrimp or the odd scallop to a cat. The  loudest noise is the squawking of parrots from a house two doors down.  </P> <P> A little later, young mothers come in pushing strollers, or guys in green scrub  suits show up from County Hospital, or local writers and artists come strolling  down the hill from their restored two-bedroom Craftsman houses for  bargain-priced scallop burritos. Senor Fish is the kind of neighborhood  restaurant that boosts property values for blocks around.  </P> <P> The concept of a marisqueria is as fine as they come, all lobsters and lake  crabs and caldrons of stewing squid, but great Mexican seafood is almost as  hard to find in California as a coelacanth in the Pacific. A place near MGM has  perfect Veracruz-style fish soup, but ceviche you wouldn't feed to your dog; a  seafood joint by the cemetery in East Los Angeles serves wonderful fried  catfish but inedible garlic shrimp. Even south of Tijuana, those famous lobster  shacks in Puerto Nuevo fry lobsters until they resemble bright red huaraches.  </P> <P> Senor Fish is different. It's cheaper, for one thing -- it would be pretty hard  to spend more than eight bucks a person here, an amount that's less than the  fancy places charge for a shrimp cocktail. The cooking is careful and  imaginative; the seafood scrupulously fresh. Dollar for dollar, it could be the  best seafood restaurant in town.  </P> <P> There are spicy fried-fish tacos more delicious than the ones they sell on the  Ensenada waterfront, without the crunch but far fresher, and fat burritos shot  through with lightly cooked shrimp or sea scallops. (I don't know how Senor  Fish can afford to put so many scallops in a $3.25 burrito, but they're  spectacularly good, the smooth sea taste mellowing both the bite of salsa and  the earthiness of stewed beans.)  </P> <P> Charbroiled fish are fine. Caldo siete mares, the Mexican bouillabaisse that is  the test of a good Mexican fish house, is everything you want in a fish soup,  impossible quantities of fish, clams, shrimp and mussels mounded in a huge bowl  of strong, garlicky broth. The Landlubber's Delite -- an exemplary grilled  chicken adobado, fragrant with garlic and spice -- is better than the sole meat  entree has a right to be at a seafood restaurant.  </P> <P> Tostadas, the flat, fried corn tortilla kind, are topped with the usual fish  ceviche, sharp with vinegar and chopped cilantro, or with canned abalone, or  with shrimp. The best tostada is topped with a wonderful octopus salad -- bits  of tentacle zapped with sesame, mixed with chunks of cucumber, onion and ripe  avocado, strewn with herbs, smooth, cool and unctuous. (If Senor Fish called it  poulpe au sesame et avocat, he could sell it as a $13 appetizer in a West  Hollywood expense-account restaurant, and "foodies" would line up to eat it.)  </P> <P> Senor Fish has a thing for cheese: seafood quesadillas plump with molten  Mexican cheese and a garlicky saute of shrimp, scallops and fish, the nicest  quesadilla ever; rich hors d'oeuvres called "Costa Azul," crisp, bacon-wrapped,  cheese-stuffed shrimp skewered to squares of fried bread. He fresh-roasts  chiles for chiles rellenos -- you can see the green things blister right before  your eyes -- then stuffs them with shrimp and Mexican cheese, dips them in a  light egg batter, and fries them to order. It's not the fastest fast-food in  the world, but it's among the nicest.  </P> <P> Of course, Senor Fish has some faults. He doesn't serve beer. The French fries  are limp. And he seems rather too fond of "Krab" with a "K," which is all right  -- the stuff tastes just fine to those ubiquitous cats with a "c."  </P> <P>  Senor Fish, 5111 N.

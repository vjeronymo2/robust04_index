			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Leading Article: In search of a foreign policy Bill Clinton never intended to be a foreign policy president. He knew well that his predecessor was ejected from the White House in part because of a perception that he was more interested in international affairs than in sorting out US domestic problems. President Clinton was determined not to make the same mistake. From his inaugural speech onwards, the focus was on his social and economic agenda at home; references to the wider world were brief, unspecific and emphasised the constraints on American leadership. The foreign policy priority - in presidential rhetoric as much as in top government appointments - was damage limitation: to prevent crises abroad from intruding on his domestic tasks. Yet as Mr Clinton has discovered repeatedly in the past 18 months, the demands of international affairs will not go away. Time and again, he has found himself distracted by foreign policy brushfires as well as by bigger questions concerning relations with Russia, China and Japan. To almost every brushfire, his response has appeared fitful and reactive: witness the bursts of interventionism on Bosnia, or the sudden reversals on Haiti. On bigger questions, his policy has often seemed hesitant or riven with internal contradictions: for example, China, where his campaign promise to link renewal of most favoured nation trading status with progress on human rights coexists uneasily with his desire to boost relations with Asia's fastest-growing economic power. Nervous allies As a result he stands accused by the foreign policy establishment at home and by nervous allies abroad of failing to take a consistent lead commensurate with the US's role as the world's only superpower. Above all, he is charged with failing to articulate a coherent set of principles or priorities for American engagement with the outside world. Seen from the Oval Office, a good deal of this criticism must seem unjust. Challenged on the administration's foreign record, Clinton aides tick off successes such as completion of the Uruguay Round and Nafta; even in Bosnia, they can claim that the conflict has so far been contained. Moreover, they argue, the US like every other power is still coming to terms with the post-coldwar era - one in which there are no reliable precedents to guide policy, the US faces no strategic threats, and parts of the world are gripped with intractable civil conflicts whose direct relevance to America's national interests can seem hard to define. Valid charge Yet the fact that a task is difficult does not mean it should not be attempted. The US's importance to, and involvement in, the wider world means that it, of all countries, cannot afford not to have a coherent foreign policy. The most valid charge against President Clinton is that he has devoted insufficient energy to developing an intellectual framework within which such a policy could take shape. Instead of setting the agenda, or even entering a full-scale debate on what the agenda should be, he has let the shifting tides of Congressional opinion and lobby group pressure set it for him. Instead of attempting to define the criteria on which the US would be prepared to intervene in foreign trouble spots, he has wavered between stressing the limits on American action and promising actions that he cannot deliver or which will not have the desired effect. The least incoherent thread of this patchwork is the Clinton administration's attempt to put US economic and commercial concerns at the heart of foreign policy. But even this can seem narrow - as in the obsessive focus on America's bilateral trade deficit with Japan - and tangled, as in China. Neither it nor sporadic activism over peace-keeping, peace-making and the promotion of democracy reflects a clear and internally consistent concept of US international interests. It is not too late for Mr Clinton to begin articulating such a concept. With one, however limited in scope, he would have a basis for weighing the huge competing demands on America's attention and resources. Without one, the domestic-policy president will continue to be buffeted by foreign policy crises not of his choosing.</p>

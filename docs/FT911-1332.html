			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Pounds 40m cash raising by Coats Viyella COATS VIYELLA, the textiles group engaged in a Pounds 252m hostile bid for Tootal, is raising over Pounds 40m from the disposal of its stake in two overseas manufacturers. It is selling its 80 per cent interest in Consoltex, a North American synthetic fabric company, for some Pounds 40m. A CDollars 33 per share public offer for Consoltex, valuing the company at CDollars 98m, has been made by a group of international investors led by Les Gantiers of Jersey. In addition, Coats has sold its 50 per cent stake in Gelvenor Textiles, a South African manufacturer, to Avtex Holdings, the textile group of Anglovaal Industries. Avtex already holds a half share in the company and is paying Pounds 3.6m for full control. Coats also announced that it is to close its thread manufacturing activities in Ochsenburg, Austria. Production will be transfered to sites in Italy and Portugal, bringing a benefit of Pounds 2m in a full financial year and a one-off Pounds 2.5m from asset sales this year.</p>

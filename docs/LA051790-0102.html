			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORNADOES RIP OKLAHOMA; FLOODS STILL MENACE TEXAS  </P> <P> A tornado pulverized a path across Stillwater, Okla., leaving a 4-year-old boy  dead as it smashed cars, blew away roofs and drove wooden planks from shredded  rafters 2 and 3 feet deep into yards.  </P> <P> Along with the tornadoes, torrential rain, hail and floods struck the nation's  midsection, while Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana kept fighting roiling  floodwaters, the National Weather Service reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> Eight people were injured in the Stillwater tornado late Tuesday and more than  200 homes and businesses destroyed or damaged. More than 200 people were  evacuated from homes and from where power lines on the ground posed a threat,  said Stillwater Police Lt. Kirk Mittelstet.  </P> <P> A tornado also struck near Foyil in northeastern Oklahoma, injuring eight  people and damaging 10 homes. Gov. Henry Bellmon promised he would seek federal  disaster aid.  </P> <P> Mittelstet said some looting had been reported. Police and a National Guard  unit cordoned off 1 square mile with the heaviest damage in Stillwater. Only  residents, authorities and the media were allowed in.  </P> <P> In Missouri, 275 residents were evacuated in Kansas City as the swollen Blue  River spilled over its banks. Storms dropped up to 3 inches of rain at  Lockwood, about 25 miles northwest of Springfield. Southwestern Missouri was  under a flash-flood watch and more storms were expected, said Jim Lee, weather  service specialist.  </P> <P> Heavy rain flooded residential areas in Champaign, Ill., and University of  Illinois student Mark Drendel reported up to 3 feet of water in places. "It  looks like a river more than anything. Cars are under water."  </P> <P> In the South, flooding from the Red River reached Louisiana, after inundating  thousands of acres in Arkansas and Texas. Flooding from the Red River forced  about 400 people in Shreveport, La., to evacuate low-lying homes and a number  of roads were under water.  </P> <P> Midway between Alexandria and Shreveport, the Red River was up to a mile wide.  </P> <P> In other spots, horses and cattle huddled on small islands amid the flooding.  </P> <P> In sections where flooding appeared imminent, levees were reinforced with extra  dirt then covered with plastic sheeting and more sandbags.  </P> <P> In flood-stricken South Texas, the Trinity River Authority released a record  88,000 cubic feet of water per second through the floodgates at Lake Livingston  Dam toward the Gulf of Mexico to relieve a Trinity River swollen in places to  10 miles wide.  </P> <P> The Federal Emergency Management Agency extended a presidential disaster area  Wednesday to four more Texas counties, bringing the total to 33 counties  eligible for government assistance because of severe weather and flooding since  April 15.  </P> <P> Liberty County officials warned holdout residents in low areas along the  Trinity to join about 7,000 others who have evacuated in the past two weeks.  </P> <P> Among the holdouts are Joe and Annie Loftin, who fished from the porch of their  new stilt home as water crept to their steps and soaked the net of a basketball  hoop on a nearby cottonwood tree.  </P> <P> "Somebody better pull the plug, my St. Augustine grass has done been watered,"  Joe Loftin said.  </P></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ RTZ is coming to the end of its greatest shuffling of assets since it bought BP's minerals division and sold out of specialty chemicals in 1989. The acquisition of Nerco's US coal interests in February and disposal of Pillar sharpens RTZ's focus on mining. While laudable in terms of strategy, shedding Pounds 1bn of industrial turnover nudges the group's sensitivity to metals prices higher still. It comes as no surprise to find that the 6 per cent fall in the shares so far this month is matched by a fall in copper, RTZ's most important metal due to the BP acquisition. With the copper price taking another tumble on Friday, the immediate outlook for the shares is far from rosy. While copper might quickly recover from the current depths, a sustained improvement looks a year or more away. Copper has suffered less than other metals on the downswing, but the overhang of stock in the market will act as a drag on recovery. The broader question is what mix of commodity exposures RTZ wants to build in the longer term. Acquiring an interest in US coal makes perfect sense by providing a stable stream of earnings to balance the metals interests. But low-cost reserves of the type RTZ finds attractive are few and far between. Building an interest in aggregates might perform a similar function. With gearing reduced to 17 per cent following the disposal of Pillar, it has room to make another substantial move.</p>

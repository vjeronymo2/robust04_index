			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Transportation Safety Board Recommendations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its investigation of the April 22, 1992, accident in Haleakala National Park, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that the FAA ``[c]reate a specific classification for, and operating rules governing, commercial air tour operators based on the complexity of flight operations, aircraft flown, flight frequency, number of passengers carried, air traffic densities in the area of operation, and other relevant factors'' (A&hyph;93&hyph;8). In addition, the NTSB recommended that the FAA ``[i]dentify airspace which warrants special protection due to air tour operations,'' and ``[c]reate special operating rules for such airspace to reduce the potential for midair collisions and other accidents commensurate with meteorological and terrain considerations.'' (A&hyph;93&hyph;10) In response to the NTSB's recommendations, the FAA has informed the NTSB that it is considering a special rule for air tour operators in Hawaii. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the NTSB recommendations, accident investigations, and discussions with the NTSB, the FAA has identified the following as needing to be addressed: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Air tour operators fly too close and too low to various attractions and land features. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) There is no clear definition of ``suitable landing site'' for helicopters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Sightseeing helicopters are operating in the avoid area of the height-speed envelope (deadman's curve) where successful autorotations are not possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Helicopters operating along the shorelines of the Hawaiian Islands should be equipped with appropriate flotation equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Passengers should be briefed before flights on the use of flotation gear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Actions Other Than Rulemaking to Address the Problems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA, the State of Hawaii, and the air tour industry have been attempting to correct safety problems that affect air tour operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1986, the FAA conducted a study of helicopter sightseeing operations in Hawaii. The study team was composed of representatives from the FAA, the State of Hawaii, and industry. Based on the study, recommendations were made to the State and to operators in Hawaii to improve safety and community relations. Recommendations included the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The FAA should study the possibility of imposing limitations, through operations specifications, that would require the helicopter to be operated at a combination of height and forward speed (including hover) that would permit a safe landing in event of engine power loss, in accordance with the height-speed envelope for that helicopter under current weight and aircraft altitude. These limitations would also prevent the helicopter from being flown over areas in which a safe forced landing could not be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The FAA should advise helicopter operators who conduct passenger-carrying operations under part 91 or part 135 that a flight (1) over an area in which a successful forced landing could not be made, or (2) at an airspeed and altitude combination that places the aircraft beyond its performance capability to successfully autorotate, would be considered a reckless operation under &sect;91.13 (formerly &sect;91.9). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study team was also concerned about the lack of helicopter flotation equipment on some aircraft, particularly for operations along the coastlines of the islands, where cliffs and rocks make a successful autorotation to shore virtually impossible. The team believes that the shoreline must offer a reasonable chance to land safely in the event of engine failure, and that, if no such area exists, appropriate helicopter flotation equipment should be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, in 1986, the FAA conducted a joint study with the State of Hawaii on helicopter heliport and airport access. A result of that study was the Helicopter Operating Plan for Hawaii. Based on portions of that plan, the Hawaiian Helicopters Operators Association (HHOA) developed its ``Fly Neighborly'' program. The HHOA plan calls for voluntary compliance with a standoff distance of 1,500 feet and a minimum altitude of 1,500 feet over communities. In addition, the plan calls for a 3,000-foot standoff distance in areas of Volcanoes National Park. The HHOA program includes part 91 operators as well as part 135 certificated operators. This is a voluntary program without FAA oversight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 17, 1992, the FAA issued Handbook Bulletin No. 92&hyph;01, Air Tour/Sightseeing Operations. The bulletin advises principal operations inspectors to recommend to operators that they include procedures in their operations manuals for conducting air tour/sightseeing operations. The bulletin also advises the inclusion of charts of air tour areas, procedures for obtaining current weather, provisions for pilot training, and other information specific to air tour operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In January 1994, the FAA held four public meetings in Hawaii to investigate complaints regarding flight safety, aircraft noise, and possible intrusive flights of helicopters. While the vast majority of the commenters addressed the noise issue, some commenters did raise safety issues. Some of the public meeting comments and subsequent comments submitted to the FAA highlight a number of personal experiences of individuals who witnessed helicopters flying dangerously low over scenic areas and above people and property on the ground. In some instances, witnesses claimed that the aircraft flew lower than the people who were walking on high elevation trails. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Honolulu Flight Standards District Office, during the past 3 years, has conducted an extensive inspection and surveillance program of the air tour industry. On July 15, 1994, in response to a number of recent accidents, the FAA initiated a comprehensive review of operations and maintenance practices of the Hawaiian air tour operators. In addition, the FAA requested that all air tour operators in the State of Hawaii immediately conduct a ``stand down'' safety review of their operational and maintenance practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Need for Emergency Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Despite the voluntary measures, the cooperation of the Hawaii air tour operators, and the FAA's inspections, the accident data show that additional measures are necessary to ensure safe air tour operations in Hawaii. The current regulatory scheme is not comprehensive enough to ensure the safety of all air tour operations in Hawaii. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

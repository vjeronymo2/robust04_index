			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / 'Civil disobedience' urged over Scottish rule THE LEADER of Britain's biggest local authority yesterday called for 'civil disobedience within the law' to put pressure on the government over demands for a degree of self-government for Scotland. Mr Charles Gray, Labour leader of Strathclyde regional council, called for mass demonstrations and strikes, and did not rule out 'civil disobedience outside the law' if Westminster did not respond to calls for changes in the way Scotland is governed. In a speech to the Scottish Trade Union Congress in Perth, Mr Gray said he would not follow government instructions to implement another round of compulsory competitive tendering for local government services. 'We cannot accept another swathe of job losses,' he said. Mr Gray was speaking in the debate on home rule, which ended with the STUC backing a motion calling for a 'multi-option referendum' on the constitutional question, offering the choice between no change, devolution and independence. 'If this government isn't going to speak to us in the united way we are demanding, maybe we are going to have to live a little dangerously,' Mr Gray said. 'We have had the poll tax, compulsory competitive tendering where I was witness to thousands of good local government people protected by trade unions being made redundant - and I'm not bloody well going to do it again.' Mr Campbell Christie, STUC general secretary, said the Conservatives had raised the constitution in the general election. 'Seventy-five per cent of the Scottish electorate voted for parties supporting constitutional change. We now want to know when we are going to get that change.' The Rev Norman Shanks, convener of the Church of Scotland's church and nation committee, told the conference: 'There is a mounting groundswell of concern, discontent and frustrated expectations that will not be prepared indefinitely to take no for an answer.' Canon Kenyon Wright, chairman of the executive of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, told the 500 delegates that Scots had voted in the general election for a democratic, devolved, just and sustainable society. 'The government had better listen.' The first large-scale demonstration of public antipathy to Westminster is being planned for the December European summit in Edinburgh. The STUC also moved yesterday to end the longstanding enmity between the labour movement and the Scottish National Party. The STUC general council, dominated by Labour party loyalists, decided on Sunday not to invite Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, to address the congress. But a majority of delegates are clearly in favour of co-operating with the nationalists and the motion passed yesterday called for discussions with all parties ready to 'co-operate with or join the Scottish Constitutional Convention'. The SNP has said it will not join the convention but is ready to co-operate with it.</p>

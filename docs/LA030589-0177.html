			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREFERENCE FOR THREE-BEDROOM HOMES REPORTED  </P> <P> The dream house of a nationally representative sample of families polled by  Professional Builder magazine is a three-bedroom, two-bath ranch-style house  with 1,900 square feet and an average price of $121,000.  </P> <P> They want brick siding (45%) -- except in the West where stucco is the  preferred exterior material and the East where wood siding is the preferred  material; a two-car garage (63.5%), traditional architecture (35.5%), a full  basement (77.8%) and a master bedroom suite with walk-in closet and a private  bath. The overwhelming number of shoppers (84.6%) want a detached house on its  own lot.  </P> <P> The survey in the magazine's December issue is based on 1,072 replies from  families who said they would purchase a home within six months. Along with a  separate survey questioning builders about their construction and marketing  practices, it was conducted by National Family Opinion Inc.  </P></p>

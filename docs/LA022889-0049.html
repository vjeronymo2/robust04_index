			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The all-Spanish Univision television hopes that comedian Paul Rodriguez's first  television special in Spanish will lead to other TV projects combining elements  of "Saturday Night Live" and David Letterman's show. "Hecho en America" aired  Sunday night on Univision's KMEX Channel 34, and network president Joaquin  Blaya now envisions 13 weekly shows or three or four specials hosted by the  Mexican-born comedian Rodriguez. Blaya said network officials will meet with  Rodriguez in coming weeks to discuss these options. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

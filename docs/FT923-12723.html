			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Credit card gives boost to AT&amp;T AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications and computer group, yesterday reported a 3.5 per cent increase in second quarter net income. It said its credit card, launched in 1990, had moved into profit for the first time in June. Mr Alex Mandl, chief financial officer, said the group was targeting 'strong earnings for the second half and 1992'. AT&amp;T reported net income of Dollars 961m, compared with Dollars 928m in the same period of last year, when the figure included an Dollars 87m, or 7 cents-a-share, after-tax gain from the sale of its stake in Sun Microsystems, the computer manufacturer. However, earnings per share were unchanged, at 72 cents, between the two quarters because of the issuance of more AT&amp;T shares. Revenues rose from Dollars 15.72bn to Dollars 15.84bn. The group's telecommunications services revenues grew Dollars 215m, or 2.2 per cent, to Dollars 9.85bn, while long-distance calling volume rose more than 6 per cent. The gains were concentrated in business services. The AT&amp;T Universal card, a credit card which can be used for general purchases as well as phone calls, was a big contributor to a 43 per cent jump, to Dollars 425m, in financial services revenues. AT&amp;T said it was now the third-largest credit card issuer in the US, with 9.5m accounts and 14m cards issued. At 2 per cent its delinquency rate was well below the industry average. The group's revenues from products and systems dropped 5 per cent to Dollars 3.84bn. Network communications sales declined as US customers deferred purchases, while consumer product and large business phone system sales were flat. NCR, the computer group taken over by AT&amp;T last year and merged with its own computer operations, suffered from the weakness of the computer market, particularly in Europe and east Asia. However it continued to report strong orders in the US. Although it made operating income of Dollars 98m, AT&amp;T acknowledged that, on a like-for-like basis, NCR's revenues probably declined slightly in the quarter, compared with the independent company's figures in the second quarter of last year. For the first six months, AT&amp;T made net income of Dollars 1.84bn, or Dollars 1.39 a share, compared with income of Dollars 1.67bn, or Dollars 1.31, last year. Revenues rose slightly from Dollars 31bn to Dollars 31.2bn.</p>

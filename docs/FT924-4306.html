			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arrest of Nissan UK defendant sought A WARRANT for the arrest of Mr Tore Arne Thorsen, a defendant in the forthcoming Nissan UK tax fraud trial, was issued yesterday. He is refusing to return to the UK from Norway to face prosecution. Mr Thorsen, the managing director of the Norwegian shipping agency Scansiris AS, is due to stand trial in March next year, charged with helping prepare false invoices which understated the profits of Nissan UK by Pounds 100m. Mr Thorsen wrote to the trial judge last week announcing his refusal to appear in court for his trial. His move means that only Mr Michael Hunt, former assistant managing director of Nissan UK, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director of the company, are now likely to face trial next March. Both deny charges of corporation tax fraud. A warrant has also been issued for the arrest of Mr Octav Botnar, the former chairman of Nissan UK. He is now in Switzerland and is refusing to return to the UK. The Inland Revenue is unable to extradite him back to the UK. The Inland Revenue said after yesterday's hearing that it was considering the possibilities of bringing extradition proceedings against Mr Thorsen. However, extradition from Norway for alleged tax offences present big difficulties for UK prosecutors. In his letter to Mr Justice Gatehouse, Mr Thorsen wrote that having seen the prosecution's case: 'I have decided not to partake in this case any more'. He claimed the prosecution brought by the Inland Revenue was 'disturbingly fragmented, lacking in substance, tilted and myopic'. Mr Thorsen has dropped his British lawyers and is refusing to discuss his case with any representative of the UK legal system. Mr Peter Rook QC, for the Inland Revenue, told the judge yesterday that Mr Thorsen had been warned of yesterday's hearing and the consequences of his non-attendance.</p>

The economic exchange between Budapest and Warsaw dropped  drastically after the dissolution of the Council for Mutual  Economic Assistance. Last year, our economic exchange amounted  to only $330 million.    [begin recording] [Andrzej Olechowski] We have two projects  in common that will have a symbolic significance for our links  and will give them additional strength. One of them is our  joint application for full membership in the European Union; the  Hungarians will do this as early as 1 April, and we will follow  soon afterwards. The other thing is Partnership for Peace.    [Waldemar Pawlak] We have talked about the idea put forward  by us in Prague: Partnership for Development. We should seek  cooperation as partners within this region, so that cooperation  between our countries can make use of both the human potential,  the potential of friendship, and the potential of our economies.  [end recording]    [Reporter] Tomorrow the Hungarian president will visit  Poznan.</p>

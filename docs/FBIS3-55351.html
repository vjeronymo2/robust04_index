The Estonian delegation at present is headed by Defense  Minister Juri Luik. Some sources say Luik is likely to be  appointed the foreign minister in a series of changes in the  government due before the Jan. 10 meeting of the parliament.    The official status of the Estonian delegation rose first  with Luik's appointment as defense minister. The Russian  delegation is headed by Special Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin.    "If we reach a breakthrough and an agreement on the main  issues, including that of the troop withdrawal, and when only  more prosaic and technical issues of detail remain on the  agenda, we can easily replace the head of the delegation,"  Olljum said.    He also said the Foreign Ministry already had a candidate  for  the new leader of the delegation, but added that he considered  it premature to reveal the candidate's name.</p>

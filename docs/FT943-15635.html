			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Building societies' cheers give way to caution: How the government's proposals for change have been received by the industry The initial burst of cheering from building societies has died down. After Wednesday's announcement of the government's decision to give them more powers and to maintain their relative protection from takeovers, societies are now considering altering the ways they do business. Three specific changes are planned to give societies greater flexibility: an increase from 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the ceiling on the amount of their funds that they can raise on the wholesale money markets; an ability to own all of a general insurance subsidiary dealing in housing-related insurance; and a broadening of the types of business loans they can undertake. All could be in place before the end of the year. Alongside these changes, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, emphasised the need for more effective accountability of societies' boards to their members. The most significant change is to require a board to inform members at a general meeting of any non-confidential takeover offers from organisations other than societies. With the increase in the wholesale funding limit already widely expected, the greatest immediate enthusiasm among societies was directed at the proposal on general insurance - there is now a limit of 15 per cent in the stake a society can hold in a general insurer. Halifax and Woolwich, the largest and third-largest societies respectively, expressed some interest in setting up general insurance subsidiaries. Others such as National &amp; Provincial, the eighth-largest, saw a benefit in terms of structuring existing relationships with insurers. While in some cases this might simply mean being able to drive a harder bargain, so as to make savings to pass to the customer, it might also mean partnerships with general insurers. These could reflect the arrangements some larger societies made with life insurance companies whereby each had an equity stake in a venture. Mr Brian Davies, the new chief executive at Nationwide, the second-largest society, noted the risks in moving into general insurance, but agreed it was a logical step in developing societies' functions. 'It will take time,' he said, 'but in due course I would want to be responsible for the product the customer sees.' In spite of general enthusiasm for this proposal, it was not seen everywhere as immediately relevant. At Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, the priority was seen as consolidating the life insurance subsidiary it has just launched. The prospect of carrying out unsecured lending to businesses has been greeted with much more caution. However Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich, and Mr Alistair Lyons, finance director of N&amp;P, both said that it would be an advantage in developing relationships with customers who were involved in small businesses or were self-employed. Mr Kirkham said: 'I don't think societies will be wanting to take on big, national companies but we want to be effective in the personal sector where we operate.' Such a reaction was probably the closest to what Mr Nelson seemed to want to hear, in terms of increasing competitive pressure on the banks in the small-business sector. Mr Dick Spelman, marketing general manager at Halifax, said his society's prime concern in this area was the restriction that the previous bar on this type of lending had put on the society as it looked at acquisitions, particularly in continental Europe. Many societies appeared to be more conscious of the risks than the opportunities. Several privately agreed with the view of Mr John Fry, group services director of Abbey National, the banking group which used to be a society. 'Societies are welcome to do small-business loans,' he said. 'We don't have the expertise and I doubt very many building societies have either.' Even at Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest society which already has experience of small-business accounts through its ownership of Girobank, reaction was guarded. Mr Peter White, chief executive, emphasised the importance of having the expertise to carry out business lending successfully. The Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, would 'take a tough prudential line with societies intending to move into this sector'. Societies and their competitors are now looking forward to the further possibility of changes. Mr Fry believes that the principle that greater accountability should go with any new powers has been usefully established. On the other hand, at least one society chief executive is so relaxed about accountability that he doubts the government will even bother to legislate on the specific change it has already announced. There is still much to play for.</p>

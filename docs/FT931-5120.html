			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Chemical dreams turn to ashes THE UK chemical industry is proud of its trade record. Over the past decade chemical manufacturers have produced consistent trade-balance surpluses. But for how much longer? The balance in chemicals is already deteriorating and the long-term outlook is bleak. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer of ICI, said: 'It just does not make sense manufacturing bulk chemicals in the UK any more.' In 1980 exports of chemicals, excluding pharmaceuticals, exceeded imports by 55 per cent. Last year the surplus was only about 20 per cent. The decisive moment came in the early 1980s. The worldwide recession meant that growth rates in plastics slowed rapidly, leading to heavy overproduction and steep losses. Europe's petrochemicals and plastics capacity was cut by about 25 per cent, and British companies took more than their share of the pain. ICI closed two ethylene processing plants, Shell closed another and Monsanto closed its low-density polyethylene plant at Fawley, Hampshire. For each, the closures made sense. But when the economy picked up in the mid 1980s there was a surge in imports because domestic production could not meet demand. It was worst in the PVC market. The construction boom sucked in imports of products such as PVC pipes and windows to meet demand during the mid and late 1980s. Export tonnage of PVC halved between 1980 and 1991 while imports trebled. Although some new capacity came on stream import penetration continued during the late 1980s, only to be halted by the recession. Since then British chemical companies have endured cuts in jobs and capacity. ICI, for example, was cutting staff before German chemical groups admitted that the European economy was slowing. The group has cut its staff by 21,000 since 1990 and more redundancies have been announced. Traditionally, UK-based chemical groups try to export their way out of trouble. Mr Ian Fyfe, a director of the UK subsidiary of the BASF chemical group of Germany, estimated that the industry's exports as a proportion of sales rose from 35 per cent in 1977 to 48 per cent in 1985. British companies, however, do not need to service their customers from a UK base. Most are building plants near their new customers in the US, continental Europe or in Asia. ICI, for example, authorised capital expenditure of Pounds 3.5bn in the UK between 1981 and 1991, but spent Pounds 7.6bn outside Britain in the same period. In the short-term, the UK industry's surplus is expected to improve. According to the Chemical Industries Association, the UK trade body, the devaluation of sterling will also help the trade balance to increase over the next 12 months. The long-term future is far bleaker. If the industry is to halt or even slow its decline it must restructure - moving away from commodity products and into niches. If a success is not made of such products the trade surplus could turn negative, sending the industry down the same path as the shipbuilding and textile sectors.</p>

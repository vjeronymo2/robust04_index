			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Tokyo gingerly embraces Russian bear: According to Japanese opinion polls, people still do not trust Moscow WHEN hosting a Group of Seven ministerial gathering last week, Japan unveiled a fresh aid package for Russia, heralded a planned Tokyo visit by President Boris Yeltsin, and steered around a territorial dispute that has soured relations with Moscow for four decades. Having drawn praise from an international audience last week, Japanese officials are now playing to a less approving domestic audience and the carefully measured tones are giving way to blunt opinions. Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, suggested that he 'distrusts' Russia and doesn't understand 'why we should help such a country'. And Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, who had indicated that he would travel to Moscow to finalise details of Mr Yeltsin's visit, expected in late May, now says there is no reason for him to go. Behind the schedule change is the belief that Japan has done enough to prepare the way for the Russian president, who abruptly cancelled a planned trip late last year. After convincing G7 members of the Japanese commitment to supporting Russian reform, the government must convince its sceptical citizens that not too much has been given away. Mr Kajiyama is not the only LDP politician to reach for pejoratives when it comes to Mr Yeltsin, seen as not much more sympathetic to Japan than his predecessors in Moscow. In trying to explain what happened last week, various ministers at varying times have suggested that nothing much had changed in Japan's official policy on Russia, that a great deal had changed, or that a bilateral dispute takes on a different meaning during a multilateral meeting. But, as one finance ministry official said yesterday, the meeting itself was part of the education process for Japanese, whose perceptions of Russia are coloured by sentimental and selective textbook accounts of injustices and indignities their country has suffered during the last century. Aware of that deep feeling, a foreign ministry official warned that the government must be careful to address popular concerns when dealing with Russia: 'If you look at the public opinion polls, Russia does not rate very highly. People do not trust Russia.' The visiting G7 ministers assisted the education process by emphasising Japan's growing international responsibilities and giving a sense of the costs that may follow the collapse of a reform-minded Yeltsin administration. Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, said the 'world will be a considerably more dangerous place.' However, Japan still waits for Russia to return four disputed islands, the Kuriles, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the Second World War and known to Japanese as the Northern Territories. And while Dollars 1.82bn (Pounds 1.18bn) was promised in aid last week, Mr Koko Sato, the LDP's executive council chairman, said further aid must be limited until Moscow opens negotiations. 'If Yeltsin falls, I don't think that Russia will revert to socialism or communism. I cannot accept the view that the world will be turned upside down without Yeltsin,' Mr Sato said. Business leaders echoed the reservations of Japanese politicians about embracing Russia. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said assistance to Russia was 'unavoidable' and the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations said the country had 'no choice.' Japanese companies' wariness of Russia was reflected in trade figures for the fiscal year ending in March. Exports to Russia were down 35.8 per cent on a year earlier and imports from Russia fell 21.5 per cent. Until last year, Japan had insisted Russia would not get significant economic aid until the islands were delivered, but that policy became unsustainable after Japan became chair of the G7, which gave priority to supporting Russia's reforms. In attempting to explain the change, Mr Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, said the policy of directly linking aid to the islands was 'only intended for a Communist government in Moscow,' and that a reformist government should be treated differently. But Mr Muto said the link remains and that Russian policy, officially called 'expanding equilibrium,' remained the same. To keep that equilibrium expanding, the foreign ministry expects Mr Yeltsin to give ground on the Kuriles during his May visit. The Russian representatives were aware last week that their country has an image problem in Japan. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, took time to make a well-publicised visit to Mr Michio Watanabe, the former foreign minister, who recently resigned because of ill-health. And Mr Yeltsin's offer to visit Tokyo was welcomed, although he invited himself before the Japanese government had the chance to invite him formally, causing mild irritation. A miffed but polite official explained: 'We are pleased that Mr Yeltsin is coming, even if he is unaware of diplomatic etiquette.'</p>

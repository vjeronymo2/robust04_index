			<p>BFN     [Text] Malesi e Madhe, June 21 (ATA) -- During the  1992-1993 period a great number of enterprises have been created  and established economic and trade relations with Montenegro,  according to the Taxes Office of the Shkoder district. But the  cooperation of those enterprises did not succeed because Albania  is observing the UN Security Council economic embargo against  the Federative [as received] Republic of Yugoslavia.    Consequently, the number of the private enterprises which  exercise their activity in Malesi e Madhe district has decreased  to 92 having 553 employed persons. A concrete example of the  embargo's influence is the Vatnikaj Enterprise which had 100  workers before the UN decision for economic embargo against  former Yugoslavia. All the workers have now left this  enterprise and Vatnikaj is close to bankruptcy.</p>

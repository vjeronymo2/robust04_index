			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Polish budget approved Parliament gave the pro-reform government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka an important victory yesterday, authorising higher sales taxes and deeper spending cuts in a year-end budget revision, AP reports from Warsaw. The new 1992 budget was passed with an eye on regaining IMF support for Polish economic reforms, endangered by a gaping budget deficit. The revised budget widened this year's permitted deficit to Zl 82,000bn (Pounds 3.5bn), nearly 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product, instead of the 5 per cent previously promised the IMF. But without the changes, the budget gap would have been Zl 20,000bn greater.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: A daring Touche Fund managers at Henderson and Touche Remnant would surely raise a quizzical eyebrow if one of the industrial companies in their portfolios suddenly announced that it was spending the bulk of a Pounds 55m cash hillock in its balance sheet. It is, after all, no embarrassment in the City these days to keep a little corporate money in the bank. By marking Henderson's shares 6 per cent higher, though, the stock market obviously believes that there are valuable synergies to be had from merging two of the UK's biggest investment management groups. It is hard to make a firm judgment without the final price. The two product ranges certainly appear complementary - thus boosting overall earnings quality. Touche should bring a touch of class to the combined investment performance. Henderson may be on the way back, but it has been through a desperately rocky patch. The vital question is the scale of available cost cutting which, failing a sustained bull market in equities, holds the commercial key to the transaction. On the back-of-an-envelope assumption that the Touche price tag might prove to be anything up to Pounds 45m - for which the bidder would be getting Pounds 18m of cash as well as the funds under management - Henderson shareholders will hope that Pounds 10m of savings does not turn out to be an over-ambitious target. It is fitting, of course, that the deal should have been announced within days of the fifth anniversary of Black Monday - an event which wiped out nearly 70 per cent of Henderson's market value overnight and marked such a sudden change in the group's fortunes. The departure of Societe Generale is also highly symbolic. It may be that unit trusts will one day be sold in Lyon and Marseilles, and French Sicavs in Esher and Chipping Norton. But not yet.</p>

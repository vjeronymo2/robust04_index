			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Svetlana Belousova: "Elections as Fiction"] </F>   [Text] The leaders of the two major political forces have  had a second official tete-a-tete meeting. The first meeting  failed to produce any public results; it only helped Zhan  Videnov legitimize his position as leader of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP]. However, it was that meeting that served  as the cornerstone of his current -- and after the congress --  future political career. Aleksandur Lilov, Andrey Lukanov, Nora  Ananieva, and certain smaller self-proclaimed leaders remained  in his shadow. In this context, the second meeting was a  reciprocal diplomatic act that aimed to convince the Union of  Democratic Forces [SDS] that Filip Dimitrov is its only leader.  Whether he will be able to utilize his position in the upcoming  events or mess things up until they become fully unclear, which  is typically the case, is a different issue.    Against the background of the expanding political cacophony,  which has been brought on by the idleness of the two political  centers rather than by any action on their part, Videnov and  Dimitrov could not meet in order "to discuss the political  situation" -- one of the contemporary politicians' new cliches.  They were expected to discuss the Election Bill and the  amendments to the Constitution, and it was precisely this that  they announced at the news conference as the main topic. Being  led by considerations of "political expediency" -- another  cliche -- became one of the fundamental principles of our  politicians.    At their news conference, Videnov and Dimitrov firmly  explained that there are differences in the manner in which the  two centers view the elections issue. Actually, neither the BSP  nor the SDS are ready for early elections in the fall.  Furthermore, they do not want the elections. Naturally, it is  not advantageous to admit this to the voters nor is it  "expedient." Now is not the time for this, as both parties need  time. They are absolutely sure that the division in the next  parliament will again be between the blue [SDS] and the red  [BSP], and the difference will only be in the satellite  political formations. This is precisely why the two major  parties need time. Forming a new centrist coalition and  expanding the constituency of the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms -- these are goals whose implementation requires time.</p>

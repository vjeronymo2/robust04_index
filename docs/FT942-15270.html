			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (9): A world leader in its field - Manufacturing profile / VA Eisenbahnsysteme Mention Austria to railway technology buffs and they will think first about Plasser &amp; Theurer, the formidable family firm that makes a machine that simultaneously pulls up old track and lays down new. But Austria has another company that dominates a niche in the international railway technology business. VA Eisenbahnsysteme, formerly part of the state-owned Voest-Alpine steel and engineering group, is a world leader in the manufacture of points (switches) for high-speed and heavy-duty rail lines. It also makes other sophisticated rail-related equipment, such as trackside devices for detecting overheated rolling stock axles (hot boxes). Until 1989, VAE was just a division within Voest-Alpine, sharing facilities and management with the group's tunneling equipment division at Zeltweg in the middle of Styria. The first switches were made there in 1866. Its reputation for quality was such that it had very large market shares, especially with European railways. So when VA bosses began looking internally for candidates for privatisation, the points business rapidly emerged at the head of the list. A proper corporate structure was set up and the company launched itself more systematically into overseas markets. VAE was convinced that demand for railway infrastructure was on the verge of huge growth in many countries. At an early stage, the decision was made to carry out expansion through subsidiaries and joint ventures rather than export, not least because of the bulkiness of the products. VAE has moved rapidly, thanks in part to nearly Sch500m in new equity provided by a partial privatisation in December 1992 and a rights issue last November. It now has outlets in the US, Canada, Australia and Hungary. The group's product line is vast, covering every conceivable type of point for tram lines, cog railways, cable railways, standard railways and even some that serve rail lines of more than one gauge. Its success is built on sophisticated welding techniques and cast steel crossings that make its points more durable than those of its competitors, and on its know-how for designing the extremely gently curved points that trains can negotiate at up to 200kph. In 1992, after a one-year inspection, it was awarded the ISO 9001 norm by Lloyds of London for its quality assurance system. The group also makes electronic point diagnosis systems which provide constant surveillance and set off alarms when trouble is detected. Group sales and profits have grown rapidly in the past three years. Last year, consolidated net income jumped 18 per cent to Sch81.3m on sales up 21 per cent to Sch1.7bn, and the directors are forecasting further growth this year. After a difficult start at Sch915 in a weak market in December, 1992, the shares have been among the best performers in the Austrian market. They rose to a peak of Sch1,585 at the end of last year and the trend continued in the first quarter of this year. The state holding company OIAG is expected to sell its remaining 26 per cent stake in the group in the autumn.</p>

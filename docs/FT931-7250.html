			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Invesco MIM hires 'City's policeman' to review compliance MR BOB Wilkinson, the former head of surveillance at the London Stock Exchange, has been hired by Invesco MIM to review the fund management group's procedures for ensuring it does not breach City regulations. Invesco said Mr Wilkinson had been employed as a consultant to help Mr Charles Brady, the group's chief executive, improve the group's compliance procedures. The company has faced criticism from Mirror Group pensioners for allowing the late Mr Robert Maxwell to take pensioners' assets which were under Invesco's control. The company has been sued by Mirror Group pensioners. Mr Wilkinson, who was nicknamed 'the City's policeman' until he retired just over a year ago, is being encouraged in his review by IMRO, regulator of the investment management industry, to whom he will show his report. He is expected to concentrate on assessing whether there are appropriate checks to prevent any repetition of incidents such as the transfer of shares to Mr Maxwell. His review could take from three months to a year, according to an Invesco employee. Meanwhile Mr Brady is examining all aspects of Invesco's business. He is expected by employees to split the group into three divisions and to replace most non-executive directors at the annual meeting in June. The chairman, Lord Stevens, announced last July, when he handed over his executive duties to Mr Brady, that he intended to resign as chairman this year. In January, Invesco admitted it was under investigation by IMRO and could face disciplinary proceedings. In October 1991 Invesco was fined Pounds 75,000 for poor administration of personal equity plans. Invesco is one of the four biggest UK fund managers, with around Pounds 34bn under management. However two thirds of its funds are managed in the US. The group's US operations were described by an Invesco employee as 'clean as a whistle'. Mr Wilkinson's review will concentrate on the UK operations. When he was the Exchange's director in charge of surveillance, his inquiries into National Westminster Bank's role in the Blue Arrow rights issue in 1987 led to the subsequent DTI investigation of the affair.</p>

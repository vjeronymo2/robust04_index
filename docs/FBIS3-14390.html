			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hasan al-Hillawi by Khalid Salah in Turah </F> Prison in Cairo; date not given -- first paragraph is AL-`ARABI  introduction]    [Text] Al-Hillawi is one of the founders of the so-called  Islamic Jihad Movement. He joined the Nabil Bura'i-led  organization in 1967. Ayman al-Zawahiri was also one of the  group's cadres. Al-Hillawi was the fourth defendant in the case  known as the Technical Military Academy case in 1974 but he was  acquitted. He then participated in establishing an organization  that attacked a foreign consulate in Alexandria in 1977.  Al-Hillawi was sentenced to seven years. But he escaped and  spent 16 years abroad. It was reported then that he was one of  the major financiers of terrorist operations in Egypt. He was  arrested by the Saudi intelligence service in May and is now a  guest of the Turah Prison. We met him there. He said he had  renounced terrorism. He declared his new ideas renouncing  terrorism and refuting the ideas of those who kill innocent men,  women, and children.    [Salah] What are the motives behind your statements  condemning terrorism and lashing out at the group of which you  were a principal founder?    [Al-Hillawi] My main motive was that I wanted to defend the  true image of Islam. The current actions of these groups, which  they attribute to Islam, distort the image of Islam and the  Muslims. It is one of my religious duties -- I am a graduate of  the al-Azhar University -- to tell the truth and show that these  actions are not linked with the pure religion, Islam.    These groups, which carry out acts of violence, should not  be  attributed to Islam. True, we called on people in the past to  abide by and defend religion but we never asked them to form  organizations or jihad. At first, we called for jihad in  defense of Egypt, not to spread corruption in it. Religion  demands that we carry out jihad to promote the country and  defend sanctities. Jihad is not sowing discords or shedding  blood unjustly. That is sedition. How could I kill Muslims or  even non-Muslims who are defenseless and who are not our  enemies? How could I kill them and still call it jihad? That  is a crime.    [Salah] Is it not strange for you to say this when you were  one of the founders of this movement and the principal financier  when you were abroad?    [Al-Hillawi] I took part in founding the movement that  called  for real jihad, not for shedding blood falsely. How could we  approach the people now with their hearts imbued with  indignation after satan sowed sedition and used some groups  affiliated with Islam? How could we face the people now that  every bearded person and every veiled person reflects the image  of a treacherous killer? As for the talk about me financing  these groups, this is wrong. It has never taken place.    [Salah] But what made you stay quiet all these years? What  made you declare these new ideas after your arrest? Were you  subjected to specific pressures, for example?    [Al-Hillawi] I was not silent. But travel enabled me to  survey the situation carefully. I wrote a book in which I  refuted their ideas. I recorded this opinion and several  sermons made in Saudi Arabia on tape. I swear that my writings  and announcements were not shaped under pressure. I also swear  that I offered nothing in return for my release from prison.  All my ideas have been prompted by what I have seen of ugly  actions, which they attribute to Islam falsely. I know they say  I have become weak and sick. But this is not true. It is only  the horror that is inflicted on every preacher and ourselves by  the shedding of the blood of Muslims or non-Muslims. God  forbids such actions.    [Salah] In your view, what has led these groups to all this  violence and terrorism?    [Al-Hillawi] They have never consulted the ulema but  followed  their own deficient interpretations until they reached the  current state of confusion. Had they gone back to the scholars  and those who issue religious decrees in Egypt, they would not  have reached this state.    They sought their own interpretations although they are not  qualified to do so and cited legal religious texts in the wrong  situations. For example, they kill innocent people with their  explosions and assassinations and then say they did not mean to  kill them. If we ask them what these people did to be killed,  they would reply that they were killed by mistake and that the  killers will be made to answer and judged by God according to  their intentions. Take the verse: "If any do fail to judge by  (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than)  wrongdoers" [Koranic verse]. This is the verse on which they  establish most of their ideas and deeds. They became so general  in their interpretation that they thought simply that they are  the Muslims and the rest are infidels. This is wrong because  the correct interpretation of the verse is that any one who does  not accept God's rule, thinks there is a better rule, and says  so is an infidel. But even the rulers of Egypt and Arab and  Islamic countries do not say this. Everyone, including the  rulers, knows that Islamic shari'ah is the greatest and most  revered thing. They always declare this but believe that there  are circumstances that impede its implementation to the full.  Such circumstances may be acceptable to some and not to others  and this is something that should be interpreted, because it is  a contentious issue and no judgment can be passed on it in this  unjust manner.    [Salah] They do not only level charges against the rulers  but  also describe the entire state as ignorant.    [Al-Hillawi] This is an erroneous statement because Imam  al-Shafi'i [late Muslim scholar] said every country conquered by  Muslims will remain an Islamic state until doomsday. How can  this be said today? All the Arab countries are Islamic and the  people in them are Muslims and non-Muslims, as is the case in  every society where there is good and bad. Even these societies  include the reformer and the corrupt and the believer and the  hypocrite. Everyone is judged by his deeds. Egyptian society in  particular is an Islamic one and no one can say it is not.    [Salah] Do you have an alternative to the call for change  under these circumstances?    [Al-Hillawi] I have no Islamic line except to follow the  ulema and listen to them. Talk of senior ulema must be heeded.  As for gathering around youths who have imperfect culture and  think they truly understand religion, any act they commit is  imperfect and closer to ignorance. All Muslims must follow the  renowned ulema who are known for their knowledge and piety.    [Salah] Do you think the groups that practice violence in  Egypt are financed by foreign states?    [Al-Hillawi] God knows. Some quarters may want to harm  popular activity in Egypt. I wonder from where those groups  brought the money and weapons. Undoubtedly, some individuals or  groups have an interest in spoiling our affairs. I believe  there are many sources of finance but I have no details.    [Salah] Are there people in the movement who have begun to  accept the ideas and joined your call?    [Al-Hillawi] Yes, thank God. There are hundreds, including  'Abd-al-Nasir Durrah, who was one of the suspects in al-Jihad  incidents in 1981 and who was sentenced to five years in prison.  The number is increasing daily. Hundreds of members abroad are  convinced. But there is a need to spread the call and expand  the new understanding. Those people felt they were breaking  free of wrong concepts and realizing that right is different  from what they thought. Many young men who effectively  understood the truth have begun to explain things to others and  to call them to the right path. If we are given a better  chance, these groups' problems will be solved, God willing.    [Salah] What is your comment on recent political  assassinations and attacks against tourism committed upon orders  from leaders abroad?    [Al-Hillawi] Like the Islamic ulema, I see in them a kind of  corruption on earth; they are religiously unacceptable. Not one  religious scholar condones this corruption. It is against the  shari'ah and a product of inept, misleading minds. I think  those movements were good at first. But I ask them now: Are  you emulating any model from our virtuous early Muslims? I  challenge them to say yes.    [Salah] You said the ulema have a role to play in expanding  the understanding of religion but those groups do not recognize  the ulema; they refuse to listen to them and they describe them  as government ulema.    [Al-Hillawi] Their talk of government ulema is wrong and  misleading. Egypt is full of honest and virtuous ulema. If  they do not listen to the advice of the ulema, they will  continue to listen to the ignorant and their sedition will  continue. Of course, there is a problem here, because they view  themselves as mujahidin, and their dead as martyrs. They  consider their displacement a kind of a patience along the road  of jihad. This is a real problem. It is our duty to be patient  with them and to lead them to the right path.    [Salah] How?    [Al-Hillawi] What is happening in Egypt is a kind of  sedition  among Muslims; there must be a conciliation and a truce. There  must be room for dialogue and the ulema must have the chance to  explain what is right and to calmly let those people know that  they are far removed from God's shari'ah. If they still reject  this explanation, this understanding, and this willingness for  reform, then they must be confronted with all the methods they  deserve! We discuss the issue from a religious point of view;  we discuss religious texts and how they should be understood.  If they answer in a political or an argumentative manner, then  their arguments are unacceptable. I knew that some of them,  such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, wanted to respond to my statements.  Al-Zawahiri is a man of medicine, a surgeon who is not  specialized in religious texts; let him talk about medicine, not  religion. If he mixes medical surgery with religious texts, the  bleeding will be endless. I tell al-Zawahiri: Fear God.  Enough corruption on earth.    [Salah] Aren't you afraid of an attempted assassination in  the context of their desire to continue the violence under the  slogan of "preserving the propagation?"    [Al-Hillawi] They know I say this out of love and concern  for  them. There is no hatred between us and I explain to them what  is right and that what they are doing has benefited no one  except the enemies of Islam and Egypt both inside the country  and abroad.    By the way, I was subject to an assassination attempt at the  hands of Shukri Mustafa, the founder of the Repudiation and  Renunciation Group, inside jail 18 years ago. God saved me. I  believe the devil might applaud them for this act but it will  only bring them evil in this world and punishment in the next.  I am not afraid of saying what is right. Almighty God says:  "Ye who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to  God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin"  [Koranic verse]    [Salah] Do you think the Kaliphate system applies now?    [Al-Hillawi] This is one of the shari'ah's duties and the  way  to this is as the ulema define. But the Muslim ulema did not  speak about this clearly and we follow them. It is a duty, if  possible, like pilgrimage. If it is not possible, God does not  demand that anyone do what is beyond his capability.    Numerous groups advocated the reinstatement of the Kaliphate  system and the call was right. But who gave them the mandate to  set up such groups for this purpose? This is a violation of the  rights of all Muslims and such a mandate cannot be used without  consulting the authoritative people. Establishing groups to  achieve this goal is impermissible, even the Muslim Shaykh  Ibn-Taymiyah [former prominent Islamic scholar] did not call for  setting up such groups. How do you compare such groups with the  organizations of Ibn- Taymiyah, Imam al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad  Bin-Hanbal [former Islamic scholars]? I reiterate to them:  "Show me just one similarity with the deeds of the good  ancestors." Where are the organizations of the prophet's  companions, imams, and ancestors? These are ideas they grasped  as they emulated other world organizations, while Islam does not  advocate this at all.    [Salah] Do you intend to continue advocating these ideas  after you leave prison?    [Al-Hillawi] I intend to continue until the young men know  their rights and duties. I will flatter no one in this regard  -- be they senior officials, rash youths, or any others.  Returning to what is right is better than pursuing ignorance  and confusion and I implore God to guide these people to  righteousness.    [Salah] Do you believe they still have the strength to  continue?    [Al-Hillawi] I believe many of them will soon realize what  is  right and anyone who remains outside this genuine understanding  will have no value or effect.    [Salah] How do your inmates who are members of these groups  treat you in prison?    [Al-Hillawi] Thanks be to God, all those I have spoken to  were convinced by the talk. I asked some factions to introduce  their ulema and cadres so that they might be confronted but they  were afraid of such confrontation and rejected debate and  discussion.    [Salah] Do these factions include anyone you believe to be  more right and closer to understanding?    [Al-Hillawi] These factions are many and all their  differences and disputes resemble pre-Islamic contentions. They  are personal and tribal. The best one is the one who decides to  heed only the words of the ulema.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The solidarity among  residents of different nationalities and social development in  Inner Mongolia are epitomes of China's nationalities-inhabited  regions, according to Ismail Amat, Chinese state councillor and  minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission.    Amat accompanied Premier Li Peng on a recent visit to Inner  Mongolia.    Established May 1, 1947, Inner Mongolia was China's first  autonomous region. It has a long history of solidarity among  nationalities. In the 1950s a large number of intellectuals and  construction workers from other parts of China went there to  help with the construction of the region. The late Premier Zhou  Enlai praised the region as "a model autonomous region" in 1959.    With the implementation of the reform and open policy, Inner  Mongolia reached a new stage of solidarity and economic exchange  in a stable social environment.    Under the guidance of the state nationalities policy and the  autonomous law of the minority-nationality regions, Inner  Mongolia passed a series of regional laws to meet the needs of  the reform and open drive. To train officials from minority  nationalities for regional management is a key task. So far,  there are 157,000 such officials.    Agriculture and animal husbandry have developed rapidly in  Inner Mongolia in recent years.    In 1993 the gross product, per capita income of urban  residents and net per capita income of peasants and herdsmen  were up 8.12, 6.26 and 5.45 times, respectively, compared with  the figures for 1978. Science and technology, education,  culture and health care have likewise made great progress.</p>

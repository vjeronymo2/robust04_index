			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Sokol: "Why Privatization Is </F> `Faltering'"]    [Text] A regular session of the Coordinating Committee for  Fighting Corruption and Organized Crime was convened 20 April  under the chairmanship of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.  Questions regarding measures to prevent abuses and criminal  phenomena in the course of privatization were brought up for  discussion, but in fact problems in privatization overall  constituted the subject of consideration.    Only 2,390 facilities have been privatized over more than  two  years. These comprise 11.3 percent of Group A enterprises and 10  percent of those in other groups. One of the most important  tasks is the privatization of incomplete construction projects.  There are about 55,000 such facilities, but only 52 are listed  for privatization! The main practice in privatization consists  of redemption and leasing with redemption. Other forms of  destatization are not held in high esteem. Auctions and  competitive bidding are seldom conducted. One other significant  aspect: Only 706,000 Ukrainian citizens, i.e., 2 percent, took  advantage of privatization certificates.    Session participants noted that the privatization process is  clearly being hampered by ministries and organs of local  authority. Defective legislation also interferes in this  regard--in many instances a mechanism for carrying out this  process is lacking. In the view of Oleksandr Zavada, chairman of  the Ukraine Antimonopoly Committee, the whole problem lies in  the fact that even state enterprises are not upholding state  regulation (of prices, resources, etc.) and payment of taxes (90  percent of income). We need not even mention private  enterprises. In a number of cases, change in ownership is  impossible due to a breakdown in the technology chain. Many  people are convinced that privatization will not proceed until  the state stops subsidizing poor workers.    Abuses are flourishing magnificently against the background  of all these difficulties. Benefits afforded by legislation to  labor collectives are being actively exploited. Shady  businessmen engage in money laundering under this cover, and  foreign investors operate in a fashion which is not best for us.    The impression has been created that someone is forcing  privatization to "falter." Leonid Kravchuk even posed the  question: "Perhaps they are deliberately proceeding in this  manner, engaging specifically in plunder?" Minister of Economics  Roman Shpek explained that a struggle is still underway in  society concerning whether or not to conduct privatization. He  noted that over the course of a year the Supreme Council has  never been able to examine the program for this operation.    The committee adopted an appropriate resolution. It is  planned to accelerate the development of proposals on the  introduction of amendments and additions to existing legislation  on matters of the privatization of property of state enterprises  and land, and accelerate presentation of these proposals to the  Cabinet of Ministers. The same applies to proposals on  establishing responsibility for violations of the legislation on  privatization and presentation of these proposals for  confirmation by the Supreme Council of Ukraine.    A great deal depends on the new parliament. As the president  expressed it, the parliamentarians must either halt the  privatization process entirely or place it on track as required.</p>

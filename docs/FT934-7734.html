			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (18): Continental launchpad - A look at the industrial potential SOUTH AFRICA'S return to legitimacy coincides with the growing regionalisation of foreign investment decisions. As multinationals rationalise and integrate their foreign operations to secure scale economies and improve co-ordination, so they are looking more carefully at regional, rather than national, markets. Invariably this means consolidating operations at one, or a few, locations to serve a regional market, especially where trade flows are being liberalised. By any yardstick, South Africa is the logical launchpad for penetrating the sub-Saharan market, worth some Dollars 250bn, of which South Africa itself accounts for more than Dollars 100bn or more than 40 per cent. The South African market, although small by global standards, is the only African market large enough to justify a broad range of manufacturing activities. The next largest is Nigeria, worth Dollars 34bn and set to shrink in foreign currency with devaluation next year. While few companies have yet rationalised their operations with the establishment of regional headquarters in South Africa, this is likely to be a pervasive trend, once the violence subsides and business confidence returns. BP is one company that will establish a regional headquarters in South Africa, while a number of manufacturing companies, such as Nissan, are known to be actively considering developing their South African factories as the platform for exporting into the region. The reasons are obvious; South Africa has the best infrastructure on the continent with first-world service industry back-up in banking, insurance, capital markets, hotels and information technology. It has spare capacity in energy and transport, a vast pool of unskilled labour, a rich natural resource base, a better skills endowment that anywhere else in Africa - though way behind Asian levels - and a large enough domestic market to justify most industrial investments. By African standards the environment is investor-friendly and there are few African locations that can match South Africa's quality of life. The disadvantages are essentially socio-political - political and criminal violence, allied with the worry that, even if they are papered over in 1993/4, ethnic tensions will re-surface later in the decade. Labour relations are also a possible reason for steering clear of South Africa given the high cost of labour relative to that elsewhere in the region and far higher levels of unionisation. Against that is the relentless decline in the relative importance of direct labour costs in most business activities, with raw materials, capital and transport costs assuming far greater significance. These costs are likely to be lower in South Africa than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. International business is likely to adopt one of two main strategies for serving the African market in the 1990s: It will export into the region from offshore using agents, licensees or franchisees as a vehicle; or It will use South Africa as the mode of entry, manufacturing or assembling in the country primarily for domestic consumption while exporting residual amounts to the region. Clearly, neither strategy will work if African countries maintain tariffs and other barriers against imports. But with the march of economic reform, regional economies are being liberalised, thereby encouraging foreign firms to sell into the usually-tiny markets from outside rather than setting up shop behind high tariff barriers as was the pattern in the 1950s and 60s. There are two polar views of how trade and investment flows will evolve in Southern Africa. On the one hand, the locomotive theory holds that South Africa will become the region's economic dynamo that helps turn the sub-Saharan economy around. The alternative school holds that South Africa, certainly for the immediate future, has more than enough on its domestic plate to make much of a contribution to the regional turnround. Indeed, there are even those in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe who predict that relocation will, in fact, go the other way, with firms emigrating from South Africa to escape political violence and industrial relations unrest, and exploiting more tranquil labour market conditions - and lower costs - elsewhere. This is an unlikely scenario given the growing tendency for manufacturers to locate as close as possible to their main markets. The more likely scenario is one in which South Africa becomes the platform for exploiting market opportunities in east, central and southern Africa. South African business is well placed, too, to participate in rebuilding the region's physical infrastructure, on which massive amounts - much of it aid money - will be spent. South Africa aside, there is little indigenous capacity in the region to handle major physical infrastructural projects. South African businesses will have the edge, too, in some African privatisation programmes - their investment banks and mining houses are already active in countries such as Mozambique and Zambia where privatisation moves are gathering speed. African leaders will be perturbed less at the prospect of growing South African participation in their economies, than with the potentially one-way traffic that this implies. Few countries in the region have much to sell to Pretoria other than raw materials (oil, copper, coffee, cocoa, tobacco) and tourism. The saving grace - though this will depend on close links with multinationals, often with regional headquarters in South Africa - could be the development of sub-contracting and components manufacture for final assembly in the south. This would turn launchpad South Africa into a positive sum game in which there are winners all round.</p>

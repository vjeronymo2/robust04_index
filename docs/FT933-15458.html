			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Treuhand auction gives impetus to bund investors A WELL-RECEIVED bond auction in Germany provided an impetus for bund investors yesterday. The DM4.25bn auction of bonds issued by Treuhand, the state agency responsible for privatising companies in the former east Germany, resulted in an accepted bid price of 99.49 and a yield of 6.7 per cent. There was no official statement of the demand but dealers said it was well-covered with considerable domestic interest. Traders said investors were selling bund futures to buy the Treuhand bonds, which form part of a DM10bn issue announced on Tuesday. The sale was the main factor in a generally quiet day with no signals coming from the repo rate announcement - the variable rate was left unchanged at 7.3 per cent - and little indication that the Bundesbank intended to cut rates when it next meets on July 15. However, economists hope to glean some information from the next money supply growth figures, due at that central bank meeting. The last M3 figure of 6.7 per cent was above the central bank's target range and if next week's figure is within the range there is a greater chance of a further monetary easing at the final council meeting before the summer break on July 29. Futures selling to buy the Treuhand bond saw the bund contract for September lose earlier gains and close only 2 basis points higher at 95.39. THE UK government bond market ran out of steam yesterday as both sterling and gilts had been considered overbought. With no economic data on the horizon and the tap of 9 per cent stock dated 2008 said to be finally exhausted, the gilts market drifted. Any support that it received was psychological and came from overseas. Gilt futures for September were down on the previous close but  1/8 up on the day. FRENCH government bonds held steady yesterday despite a growing belief that they have hit a short-term high and are ripe for profit-taking. Bond prices were helped by a slightly stronger franc, which recovered from recent weakness against the D-Mark. The yield spread between French and German 10-year government bonds remained very low, closing at 6 basis points, according to JP Morgan. On the Matif, September futures rose 0.18 to 119.78. JAPANESE debt prices were weaker in Tokyo as the Bank of Japan sought to pour cold water on increasingly heated rate cut rumours. Speculation has gathered pace that the central bank will cut its official discount rate, presently at 2 1/4 per cent, by as much as 50 basis points. Although it is considered unlikely that the bank will ease before the general election on July 18, traders have been busily discounting any change. At its money market operations yesterday, the central bank provided far less supply than expected and forced short-term rates higher. The yield on the JGB No 145, which has been below 4.3 per cent in the past few days, rose to 4.35 per cent and when Japanese bond futures began trading in London, the September contract slipped 7 basis points to 109.13. Following comments from a Japanese government official that the pain threshold for Japanese exporters could be Y95 to Y105 against the dollar, the September contract recovered to close at 109.30. AFTER posting early gains on cheaper commodities, US Treasuries fell back as commodity prices retraced their steps. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 105 11/32 , yielding 6.679 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.992 per cent. After Tuesday's steep rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index had deflated Treasury prices, yesterday morning's retreat in the index prompted some buying among market participants, mostly the professional dealers. Treasuries fell back from their early gains, however, when the CRB index began to recover. Otherwise, attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which was meeting to discuss monetary policy. Although the rise in the CRB index raised some fears that the FOMC would keep its strategy tilted towards tightening monetary policy, most analysts believe it will vote to return the bias to neutral in the wake of weak employment data.</p>

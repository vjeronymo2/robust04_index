			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Madrid, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Spanish Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez expressed his approval here today after  U.S.-piloted jets shot down four Serbian warplanes, but he  warned against reoccurrence of such action.    The incident should not repeat itself, Gonzalez said, adding  that a tense atmosphere would undermine the budding hope of a  long-waited peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The prime minister noted that the incident indicated the UN  ban on air flights over Bosnia ought not to be violated. "In  fact, the air attack is in strictly keeping with the resolution  of the UN Security Council," he said.    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana also attributed  NATO's  air attack to Serbs' violation of the no-fly zone and emphasized  that it should not undermine the favorable turn resulting from  the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo.    The attack occurred today as American pilots saw "bombing  maneuvers" of the planes and explosions on the ground. One  American F-16 fighter jet shot down three planes and a second  downed a fourth.    It was the first time NATO used its military might in the  23-month-old Bosnia war and its 44-year history.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US likely to toughen its China policy THE US is set to impose conditions on the privileged access of billions of dollars of Chinese goods to the US market, risking a war of words with Beijing and a possible deterioration of relations. Mr Winston Lord, the assistant secretary of state, told Chinese officials yesterday that the administration was likely to attach conditions to renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status, that guarantees privileged access to the vast American market. Mr Lord is the most senior State Department official to visit Beijing since the change of administration. A former ambassador to China from 1985 to 1989, Mr Lord has been outspoken in his criticism of China's human rights record. His condemnation of China's behaviour at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 was especially forceful. He has made no secret of his view that progress on human rights should be a central factor in relations between Washington and Beijing. China has warned angrily against MFN conditions being tied to human rights, weapons proliferation, and its Dollars 18bn trade surplus with the US, but has not spelled out how it might react beyond threatening a cooling of relations. The clash could damage Chinese efforts to secure the Olympics in the year 2000. President Bill Clinton has until June 3 to rule on renewal of China's MFN status, but pressure from Congress and from within his own administration appears to be pushing him towards imposing conditions in some form. After Mr Lord's meeting with acting foreign minister Tian Zengpei, a senior US official said: 'The Chinese are under no illusion of the seriousness of the situation and of the fact that conditions are very likely. It would have taken dramatic progress (on human rights and other issues) not to have some kind of conditions.' Influential US politicians, including Senator George Mitchell and congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, have threatened to attach conditions to China's MFN renewal if the administration fails to do so. Mr Clinton's advisers have indicated the administration is likely to fall into line, although conditions on human rights, liberalisation of China's own trade regime and weapons proliferation may be less rigorous than demanded by some congressmen. Mr Clinton, said the US official, wanted to find common ground with Congress on the MFN issue. Whatever form the conditions take, 'they obviously will be serious ones .the objective is to make progress and not to lose MFN, which would have harmful effects.'</p>

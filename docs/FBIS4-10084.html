			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The need to establish a commission to fight  corruption was one of the key issues discussed during the  meeting of the Interministerial Political Committee presided  over by Interior Minister German Correa [as published].    Senator Anselmo Sule, the Radical Party president, stated  that the heads of political parties and government authorities  discussed the situation in Congress. They also discussed other  issues that will become draft bills.    When asked about the commission to fight corruption, Sule  said: "It has been proposed; there is a preliminary agreement  and I believe it will materialize in the next few days. There  has been agreement on the need for this for some time now. The  commission will be established by decree and will include  representatives of all political sectors because it is a  nationwide problem that must be tackled by all Chileans. It has  yet to be decided what it will do specifically. What it must  obviously do is to assess the concrete measures, the procedures,  alternatives, methods, and attitudes to be taken to eliminate  the possibility of this problem surfacing or worsening."    As for the government's draft bills, their precedence will  be  determined next week.    Deputy Gutenberg Martinez, president of the Christian  Democratic Party, admitted that disagreements with the  opposition in the lower house were also discussed. He  commented: "We were all surprised by what happened in the  Senate, by the attempt to form an opposition bloc, and by the  comments made by senators like Hernan Larrain, in the sense that  the Senate will become a sort of opposition trench. We regard  the comments by Andres Allamand positive, because they at least  suggest that not event the rightist sector is quite certain  about the matter. We believe their decisions on constitutional  issues and the government's social priorities will allow us to  determine the possibilities of a relationship with the rightist  sector."    Martinez added: "Our sector believes the policy of  agreements  and consensus regarding important national issues is the policy  the Coalition of Parties for Democracy must uphold, but this  does not mean we will not detect or reject any maneuver to turn  the Senate into an opposition trench."

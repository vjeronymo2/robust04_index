			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (4): Ports provide that vital economic lifeline - Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria face competition from Agadir THE Canary Islands depend on tourism for foreign earnings, but the two major ports - Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria - are equally crucial to the economic life of the community, since the vast bulk of all imported goods arrive by sea. Las Palmas is Spain's busiest port, and is placed fifth in Europe in terms of traffic handled. Both are free ports and goods enter without customs dues. To some extent the autonomous region of Las Canarias, which awkwardly sub-divides into the two separate provinces of Gran Canaria and Tenerife, is handicapped by much of its central bureaucracy being handled by the central state from Madrid. This is particularly true of its ports, which are under the direct control of Spain's ministry of public works. That ministry administers via two control boards, one for each province. But it is Madrid which dictates policy - and handling charges for visiting ships. Central government supervision of the container, repair and bunkering services means that although the Canaries' ports are free ports, charges are the same as in all other Spanish ports. In spite of that disincentive, fishing fleets from Japan, South Korea and the Soviet Union have made made both ports their main international bases. Shops selling an array of duty-free watches, cameras and other luxury goods commonly display signs in Cyrillic throughout the port area of Las Palmas. There are well-advanced plans to make the Canary Islands Europe's latest offshore ship register, certainly before June 1991. Spanish shipowners and their professional organisation, the Asociacion de Naveiros Espanoles (Anave) have been lobbying Madrid for some time to permit such a new register, their complaint being the high cost of operating under the Spanish flag. The interest of the Canary Islands' government - which has been promoting the new register - is obviously related to its attempt to find ways of continuing the growth in the islands' shipping industry. The ship owners stand to benefit from the low tax rates of the new register (from zero tax ratings upwards), and reduced social security contributions. Spanish seafaring unions initially fiercely opposed the new register idea, but have since been mollified by an undertaking that the Canary register will permit the contracting of European crews only. LAS PALMAS There are nine principal docking areas, including fishing, commercial traffic, a naval base and repair docks, stretching for 11,000 m. The dock is capable of receiving the world's largest ships. Considerable warehouse and storage space is available: 215,000 sq m open-air and 150,000 cu m of refrlgerated space, 28,000 sq m of covered and 5,000 sq m of semi-covered space - all of which are to be expanded by 20 per cent over the next five years. The facilities offered by Las Palmas include rapid re-fuelling (between 30 and 1,500 tonnes per hour from more than 350 supply points throughout the dock) and rapid resupply of fresh drinking water; the port's desalination plant can pump 500 tonnes per hour from 240 different points, and an ice-plant produces 200 tonnes daily. But it is the port's duty-free status, meaning cheaper fuel, together with its convenient position en route to Europe, Africa and the Americas, which make it an especially attractive spot for major shipping companies. While Las Palmas remains healthily profitable, recording a net profit in 1989 of Pta2.230bn - almost double 1988's performance - on a turnover of Pta4.168bn (up 28 per cent from the 1988 figure of Pta3.249bn), its position is under threat. Traffic grew by just 1.06 per cent in 1989; passenger trade fell by almost 25 per cent in the same year. The port employs some 2,500 people, and there are accusations from shipping agents that that figure is excessive and consequently the port's rates are becoming less competitive. Moreover, both Las Palmas and Santa Cruz are likely to face strong competition from the developing port of Agadir in nearby Morocco. Port officials in the Canaries dispute the idea that Agadir can compete today, arguing that the quality of service offered locally far outweighs any price advantage in Morocco. But they are aware that the situation is bound to change within a very short time. The local port authority - currently in the hands of officials appointed directly by the socialist government in Madrid - has managed to obtain central government support for some Pta19bn to be invested in the next five years at Las Palmas and the smaller ports on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, improving and extending storage and ferry and cruise facilities. SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE Though smaller than Las Palmas, Santa Cruz remains one of Spain's more important ports, with 9,000 m of wharves, roll-on-roll-off facilities and large container areas. Declared a free port in 1852, Spain's first oil refinery was built in the port, in 1930. Today, the dock has some 300,000 sq m of open air and 86,000 cu m of refrigerated storage space, 27,000 sq m of semi-covered area and 13,800 sq m of fully covered storage space. But the most important scheme in the mind of the port's president, Mr Pedro Meneses, is to expand the port's cruise liner and tourist traffic. He has hired a marketing company to investigate ways of capturing a bigger share of the Canaries' passing tourist trade. Against suggestions that Santa Cruz's relatively high charges prevent the port increasing its traffic, Mr Meneses says: 'What we are offering is the equivalent of a five star hotel service, in terms of speed, efficiency and quality of service. Of course, there are cheaper ports in the region, in Morocco and other parts of North Africa, but they do not compare in terms of service.' Mr Meneses has five ports under his jurisdiction (including that of Santa Cruz), the five being part of the separate province of Tenerife. His administration has plans to develop Santa Cruz's infrastructure, which will cost Pta10bn and will include a new container terminal at Bufadero, covering about 12 hectares; expansion of the passenger terminal; and improving traffic flow between the docks and around the harbour area.  ------------------------------------------- LAS PALMAS  ------------------------------------------- Total ship visits                16,987 Total gross tonnage          50,567,237t Of which: Cargo vessels                    11,568 Gross tonnage                47,409,172t Fishing vessels                   4,419 Gross tonnage                 3,158,085t Vessels served 'offshore'            44 Gross tonnage                 2,920,635t Merchandise Total tons                    9,766,623t Oil/fuel                      2,881,353t Bulk liquid                      22,185t Bulk dry                        852,347t Gen merchandise (loaded)      1,587,429t Gen merchandise (unloaded)    2,454,997t Fish                            330,460t Ships' supplies               1,854,126t Transhipped merchandise                       4,809 Passengers Disembarked/embarked            695,279 In transit                       61,070 Containers Units (20 ft equivalent)        201,688 Tonnage                       1,834,514t  ------------------------------------------- SANTA CRUZ  ------------------------------------------- Total ship visits                      13,136 Total gross tonnage          51,621,168tM erchandise Total tons                    6,121,725t Oil/fuel                        485,384t Bulk dry                        957,759t Gen merchandise (loaded)          1,320,530t Gen merchandise (unloaded)    2,157,592t Fish                              2,272t Ships' supplies               1,198,088t Transhipped merchandise           5,327t 1989 figures.  ------------------------------------------- Source: British Consulate  -------------------------------------------</p>

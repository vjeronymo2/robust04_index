			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: Vita and Virginia - Theatre A little bit of history has been made in London's West End Theatre with the first Sunday opening, although some of the national newspaper critics chose to boycott it, not because they are against Sunday theatre in principle but because it seems that they prefer not to work on Sundays. There is no suggestion, as yet, that Sunday openings will become a way of life. Sunday performances, however, should add to the audience. There is after all Sunday cinema, Sunday sport, Sunday shopping and Sunday practically everything else. There is a more genuine dilemma for the actors who cannot be expected to work a seven-day week. The answer may be to knock off on Mondays, as happens in much of Europe. In New York Sunday openings are frequent. For my part, I welcomed the London innovation at the civilised hour of 6pm, which overcomes one of the nagging problems of theatregoing: whether to eat before, afterwards or not at all. For most theatregoers 6pm is possible only at weekends, and dinner comes after. The guinea pig was Vita and Virgina at the Ambassadors. The two Vs are Vita-Sackville West and Virginia Woolf. How you take to them depends on whether you want to hear any more, and indeed old lines rehashed, about the Bloomsbury Set. They sound remarkably precious and insular. Vita's comments on her travels abroad, as the wife of the diplomatist Harold Nicolson, are now distinctly embarrassing, especially on the US. And it is no longer remotely shocking that two women should have had an affair. This must be one of the best-known liaisons of the 20th century. Nevertheless, the piece is very well done. It is written by Eileen Atkins and drawn from the published letters. Atkins also plays Virgina; Penelope Wilton is Vita. Here is a marvellous combination of actresses. Watch their eyes where most of the movement takes place. Listen to the nuances of love and sexual jealousy in their lines. Atkins is moody, intellectual and introverted. Wilton is elegant, less clever but more passionate. They have a very articulate script to work on: Bloomsbury may split hairs, but never infinitives. It is a good story, but whether it is much of a play I have some doubts. Vita and Virginia is very repetitive and would be better performed without an interval. , Wilton wilts, fluffing the odd line, towards the end. Atkins is in some danger of becoming type cast as an ageing, harrowed woman. Someone should give her a really funny part. Patrick Garland directs the piece, as he did last year at the Chichester Festival. What one would like to see is the two stars playing together in a more contemporary script.

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TV ADVERTISERS BALK AT ABC'S 'ROCK HUDSON'  </P> <P> Several advertisers who found "Rock Hudson" to be "problematic" pulled their  advertisements from Monday night's made-for-TV movie, Allen Sabinson, the head  of movies for ABC, said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Rock Hudson" was a film biography of the movie and television star who died of  AIDS in 1985.  </P> <P> The movie was based on a book by Hudson's former wife, Phyllis Gates, and court  records from a civil suit against Hudson's estate brought by Marc Christian,  Hudson's lover during the last years of Hudson's life.  </P> <P> Advertisers buy some blocks of time -- such as the ABC Monday Night Movie time  period -- before they know what will be shown. When the schedules are set,  advertisers are then allowed to preview any programming they think might  concern them. Several asked to see "Rock Hudson" and then withdrew their ads,  Sabinson said.  </P> <P> Those advertisers found the film "problematic by subject matter," Sabinson  said. He added that homosexuality is a "greater taboo" among sponsors than  other controversial topics such as child molestation, which is the subject of  "Unspeakable Acts," ABC's Monday movie next week.  </P> <P> Sabinson declined to name the advertisers who withdrew their ads. He also  declined to indicate how many advertisers removed their commercials. He did say  he believed that fewer advertisers canceled for "Rock Hudson" than had canceled  their ads last spring for NBC's "Roe Vs. Wade," a film about the landmark  abortion rights case that met some of the stiffest advertiser resistance in  recent years.  </P> <P> Sabinson characterized the advertising community as reluctant to become  involved with controversial movies and miniseries.  </P></p>

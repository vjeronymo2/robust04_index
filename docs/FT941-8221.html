			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: 74 per cent of Europa Minerals' shareholders accept Burmine offer The Pounds 15m offer for Europa Minerals, the UK-quoted mining finance house, was accepted by holders of 74.4 per cent of the issued capital by the first closing date, according to its adviser Samuel Montagu. Montagu said that acceptances included 5.5 per cent of Europa held by SBN Nominees and beneficially owned by Mount Edon Gold, the Australian company which previously opposed the merger. Mount Edon has also made a hostile bid for Burmine, the Australian group making the recommended offer for Europa. However, Mount Edon's financial public relations advisers in London said there must be another explanation for SBN's acceptance as Mount Edon would not have accepted the Burmine offer for any of its Europa shares. Mount Edon owns 19.9 per cent of the UK company. Burmine's offer has been extended until March 4 but the merger - a three-way affair also involving Austmin Gold, another Australian company, for which Burmine has made a friendly bid - cannot be completed until the result of various legal actions in Australia are known. Montagu said these might be cleared away this week.</p>

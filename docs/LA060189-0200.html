			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BURIAL PLANNED FOR BEACHED WHALE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach workers planned to bury a beached gray whale today, after  marine biologists took a section of the head for study.  </P> <P> "Our initial plan was to bury the whale (early) today, but there was  considerable interest expressed by several marine life organizations," said  Michael Beuerlein, Huntington Beach lifeguard supervisor. Marine biologists  from the National Historical Society and the Los Angeles County Museum said  they would like to analyze a section from the whale to determine why it died.  </P> <P> Beuerlein said he spotted the whale in the surf at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after  he noticed a large number of pelicans, sea gulls, and other marine birds flying  over it about 2 1/2 miles north of the pier.  </P></p>

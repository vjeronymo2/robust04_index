			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT to reorganise management system The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's busiest futures exchange, is on the verge of reorganising its management structure in a move aimed at preserving its lead in an increasingly competitive industry. Although the CBoT is enjoying record volume, thanks to volatility in world interest rate and foreign currency markets, exchange members have complained of declining profits and a cumbersome committee structure that hampers innovation and expansion. More agile exchanges like London's Liffe and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have surpassed the CBoT in dollar value of contracts traded, and in the amount of institutional business they attract. Last year, the exchange asked the consultancy firm of Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton to examine its management practices and recommend reforms. On Tuesday, the CBoT's board of directors agreed to adopt the Booz-Allen recommendations, subject to an April 14 vote of the full membership. Booze Allen has suggested that the CBoT cut its deeply imbedded and politically oriented system of more than 100 committees to just five, charged with oversight of finance, strategy, audit, management, and regulation. It also recommended that CBoT staff be given more powers for day-to-day management of the exchange, while the chairman and board of directors, comprised mostly of trader-members, focus on strategy and planning for the exchange. Both Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT's chairman, and Mr Thomas Donovan, its president, have endorsed the report.</p>

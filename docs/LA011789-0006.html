			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES MAYOR'S RACE  </P> <P> Now that Yaroslavsky is seeking reelection as a councilman, I am no longer  forced to choose the "lesser of the evils" for 5th District Council office. No  matter what my concerns, from tree trimming to senior citizen issues, his  office has always been able to help me.  </P> <P> His approach to planning issues has been good for both the city and the  district. He is more concerned with what will serve the needs of his district  than the needs of a select group of individuals. I am sorry he is not running  for mayor, but at least we will have four more years of his leadership in  addressing the needs of the 5th District.  </P> <P> FRANCES FIORINO  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

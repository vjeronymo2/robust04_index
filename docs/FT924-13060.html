			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Ofwat price-rise formula falters OFWAT, the water industry regulator, said yesterday that it had failed to agree on next year's price rises with four of the 19 water companies which it had asked to restrain prices, Bronwen Maddox writes. The deadline for responses from the companies was Thursday. North West Water has asked Ofwat formally to reconsider its judgment. South West Water, South East Water and Three Valleys Water Services are still negotiating and have until December to reach a deal. Two weeks ago Ofwat asked the 19 companies to hold back price increases by an average 2 percentage points below the level permitted by their licences. Most of the companies that have reached agreement have persuaded Ofwat that the restraint should be between 0.5 and 1 point because of extra spending to meet environmental rules.</p>

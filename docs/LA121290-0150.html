			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAVAZOS, U.S. CABINET'S 1ST LATINO, QUITS  </P> <P> Lauro F. Cavazos, the first Latino ever appointed to the Cabinet, resigned  today as secretary of education.  </P> <P> He is the second member of President Bush's Cabinet to depart in recent weeks.  </P> <P> There was no immediate reason given for Cavazos' decision to resign, and the  resignation letter did not say what Cavazos plans to do.  </P> <P> Adminstration sources said Cavazos had tired of criticism aimed at his  performance behind the scenes by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. His  critics had faulted the education chief as an inadequate salesman for the  Administration's policies, who never mastered television skills.  </P> <P> Cavazos, 63, has led the Department of Education since 1988. He was appointed  by former President Ronald Reagan and held over in the job by Bush.  </P> <P> Bush, in a letter accepting Cavazos' resignation, said: "For more than two  years, and under two Presidents, you have distinguished yourself through your  devotion to improving the education of our nation's children."  </P> <P> Bush mentioned the Cavazos resignation in passing during a speech on education  today before a group called Jobs for America's Graduates. Calling Cavazos "my  dear friend," Bush cited his contributions to setting national education goals  and said, "I think the country will always be very, very grateful to him for  his service to country."  </P> <P> The Department of Education said Ted Sanders, now the deputy secretary of  education and former Illinois schools chief, will serve as acting secretary  upon Cavazos' departure.  </P> <P> Cavazos, in his own letter, said he is stepping down effective Dec. 15.  </P></p>

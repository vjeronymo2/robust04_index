We interviewed Peter Zwack and  Lajos Kupcsok on this issue. [passage omitted]    [Bodnar] How would you characterize the Entrepreneurs'  Party?    [Zwack] We mainly wish to deal with economic issues. I  would like to remind people that in 1990, before I became a  party chairman, I suggested to [former] Prime Minister Jozsef  Antall that an economic top ministry should be set up; today,  the need for this is recognized by many people. It is very  important for a government to be able to approach issues from  their practical side.    [Bodnar] What makes your party liberal?    [Zwack] Not the fact that it is said to be liberal. From  the beginning, the goal of our party is to be more than the  party of 600-700,000 small and medium size entrepreneurs, we  also want to open to the intelligentsia and others.    [Kupcsok] I would like to mention two factors about the term  liberal. One is that we want to reduce the state's intervention  in the economy to the minimum and what is left should be  operated with great deliberation. The other is that we reject  all kind of racial, religious, or national discrimination.  Ability and work, these our the two standards.    [Bodnar] You are member of the so-called Liberal Bloc  together with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], and the Agrarian  Federation. What justifies the establishment of this bloc?    [Zwack] We feel that a new Hungarian political culture has  to be established; to solve the problems, we need cooperation  instead of discord. The liberal bloc can be suitable for this.  I think it is important to mention that, at first, the  Entrepreneurs Party made an agreement with the Fidesz in October  1992, then with the SZDSZ, and the Agrarian Federation only  joined us afterwards. Getting to government is the clear goal of  the bloc. We feel that the government coalition did not fulfill  the hopes of a large part of the population. Therefore, a  change is needed. We firmly believe that socialist governing  would not be advantageous for the country. It is very dangerous  that a significant section of the population yearns for the  "good old days," not knowing and not feeling the catastrophic  consequences of this. In our view, however interesting the  Bekesi program is, it is impossible to implement it. By its  nature, a socialist economic program is distributive and,  unfortunately, there is nothing to be distributed. This liberal  center bloc is capable of establishing the conditions for an  economic boom if it succeeds at the elections. I do not want to  make false promises, we need everything but these. In my view,  the situation is very difficult, putting the economy back on its  feet will take many years of work, but the processes have to be  speeded up. [passage omitted]    [Bodnar] What relationship do you have with the government  coalition?    [Zwack] I am sorry that many people think I am against the  government, this is a big mistake. I have many good  acquaintances in the government and neither I nor the party are  anti-government. As a matter of fact, only stupid people are  against the government. I have problems with certain members of  the government, and this will always be so, it unfortunately  cannot be changed. I would be ready to extend my hand to them,  but these people are unwilling. We have problems with certain  -- mainly economic -- decisions of the government, and that it  deals too much with ideological issues that are clearly damaging  for the country. It might be enough to refer to the Csurka  affair, the statement on the 15 million Hungarians, and the  media war.    [Bodnar] What are your views on your party's election  chances?    [Kupcsok] I very much hope that we will get into government  and then we will be part of the government coalition. However,  even if we do not get into legislation, we will be much stronger  than now because we belong to the Liberal Bloc, therefore, even  as a nonparliamentary party, we could help the next government  much more effectively.

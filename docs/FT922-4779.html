			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp drop in drug stocks cools enthusiasm for Dow Wall Street A SHARP DECLINE in drug stocks dragged US stock markets lower yesterday as the enthusiasm that had pushed the leading index to new highs on Monday quickly petered out, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.11 at 3,396.10, having spent the entire day in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.80 at 413.50, as did the Amex composite, 0.89 weaker at 393.95. The Nasdaq composite, however, added to Monday's gains, rising another 0.81 to 589.18. Turnover on the NYSE was 203m shares. Although analysts hailed Monday's close above 3,400 on the Dow as an important breakthrough, investors showed little inclination to take stocks much higher. Sentiment was not helped by a smaller-than-expected 1.3 per cent rise in April single-family home sales, another indication that the recovery in the housing market may have stalled. Among individual stocks, Bristol Myers-Squibb plunged Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 66 1/2 in turnover of 7.7m shares after the drug group announced that it expected second quarter sales to be up less than 5 per cent from a year ago, due primarily to low wholesalers' inventories. The weakness in Bristol Myers spread throughout the drugs sector, with all the leading stocks posting losses. Pfizer fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 , Merck gave up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49 5/8 , the ADRs of UK group Glaxo slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 , Schering-Plough fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 50 5/8 and Upjohn gave up Dollars 1 at Dollars 34 5/8 . Unisys rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 9 7/8 in turnover of 1.6m shares after the company said it was ahead of schedule in its plan to cut costs by Dollars 800m annually by the end of this year. Harley-Davidson dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 after the company told its dealers that motorcycle output has been slowed by a one-week production backlog, which will not be made up in the June quarter. General Electric fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 75 1/2 after the defence department suspended future aircraft engine contracts with the company because of allegations that GE committed fraud in jet engine contracts with Israel. On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 26 as investors reacted to the news that the Baltimore-based broking house, Alex Brown, had removed the stock from its 'emphasis list'. Advanced Telecommunications rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 after the company said that it was in talks regarding a possible merger with an unnamed company. Canada TORONTO PRICES closed little changed in moderate trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index gained 6.22 points, or 0.18 per cent, to close at 3,410.20. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 277 to 256. Volume was 25.8m shares, up from Monday's 22.8m, and trading value rose to CDollars 327.5m from CDollars 303.3m. Ten of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by transportation, up 2.3 per cent. The day's biggest decline belonged to the industrial products group, off 0.9 per cent. Financial services also closed lower.</p>

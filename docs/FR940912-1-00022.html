			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Pollutants To Be Regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air pollutant to be regulated by these standards is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC. The primary air pollutant from SOCMI wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities is VOC, which is a precursor to the formation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone and oxygenated organic aerosols.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Best Demonstrated Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 111 of the Act states that NSPS ``shall reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the degree of emission limitation and the percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction achievable through application of the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological system of continuous emission reduction which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (taking into consideration the cost of achieving such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction, any nonair quality health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impact and energy requirements) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technology basis for NSPS that meets these criteria is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to as ``best demonstrated technology (BDT).'' In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards development process for NSPS, BDT should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified, the performance of BDT established, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternative selected that will require the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BDT or an equivalent technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volatile organic compound emissions from wastewater can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be effectively reduced with the following control approach:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Identify wastewater streams with significant VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission potential; (2) recycle or treat those wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams to remove their potential for emissions; (3) prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to treatment or recycling, manage those waste streams in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units equipped with air emission controls; (4) recycle any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment residuals or treat any residuals to destroy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC; and (5) control air emissions generated by treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The treatment technology that is the basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards for wastewater is steam stripping, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven treatment technology for wastewaters generated within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the targeted industry. It is generally applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams with the potential to emit VOC and, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, achieves the highest VOC emission reduction among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated VOC control technologies. Facilities can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply by installing the design steam stripper or by installing a stripper or other treatment device that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieves an equivalent VOC emission reduction. Control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air emissions from the stripper and from treatment residuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is also required. Although standards for wastewater are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the performance of steam stripping, other treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies such as biodegradation have also been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated to be effective. To be considered equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to steam stripping, a properly operated biological treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit must achieve a 95-percent VOC reduction or meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required mass removal while controlling air emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biodegradation may also be used as one of a series of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment processes (e.g., a steam stripper followed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological treatment unit) where the combination achieves a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction of 99 percent or more in volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration. Alternative treatment technologies other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than biodegradation are permitted if their performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equals or exceeds that of steam stripping, i.e., a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 99-percent VOC reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Affected Facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the SOCMI wastewater NSPS, the affected facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be each new process unit (and the wastewater streams it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generates) at a SOCMI plant. A SOCMI process unit will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as one producing one or more of the chemicals listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the regulation. A process unit at a SOCMI plant will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be new if construction, modification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconstruction of the unit commences after the date the NSPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Emission Points to be Regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air emission points selected for the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations include all significant points in SOCMI process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit wastewater collection and treatment systems that manage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process or maintenance wastewater streams or residuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated from SOCMI process units that produce any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed chemicals. The air emission release points in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process unit wastewater collection and treatment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include individual drain systems, which are comprised of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment such as open trenches, drains, manholes, junction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boxes, lift stations, and weirs; surface impoundments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater storage and treatment tanks; oil-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separators; containers; clarifiers; and biological treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units. At these release points, VOC can be transferred from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the process unit wastewater stream to the air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

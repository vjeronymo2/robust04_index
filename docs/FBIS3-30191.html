			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.T.] </F>   [Text] Since the beginning of the year, the Bao Loc bauxite  ore enterprise has mined almost 900 tons of ore, a very small  amount compared with the enterprise's capabilities (each year,  it mines approximately 15-16,000 tons).    For lack of markets, the enterprise has mined only moderate  amounts. At present, the only market for this ore is the  Southern Chemicals General Corporation. This is a great loss for  this abundant mineral.    Based on surveys, Bao Loc and nearby areas have  approximately  a billion tons of bauxite, of which approximately 220 million  tons is concentrated around Bao Loc City. In particular, the ore  at Bao Loc has a very high alumina (AL2O3) content, 45-50  percent. On the other hand, the ore has a hardened, weathered  structure and is easy to mine and transport.    The industrial-mineral sector must make plans to exploit  this  very abundant natural resource.</p>

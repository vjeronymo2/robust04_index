			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Outdoors: The pirates are boarding the slopes - Skiing / Arnie Wilson sees the future of winter sport; it has a T-shirt and an attitude and rides a snurfer I have seen the future, and it is snowboard shaped. Of 21 people in the queue for Lift 26, at Mammoth Mountain, California the other weekend, I was the lone skier. The other 20 were snowboarders, wearing T-shirts and sweatshirts with such messages as 'Snowboarding Is Not A Crime' and 'I Love Animals - They're Delicious.' I travelled up with one sporting a Red Baron board complete with Teutonic red crosses and imitation cannon shell holes. On the slopes, boarders outnumbered skiers by about 30 to 1. I felt like an interloper who had strayed by mistake into the wrong side of town. I felt even more goofy than a right-footed boarder. It was the moment I knew was going to happen - but it came years earlier than I expected. Within a decade some people in the skiing industry predict that snowboarders will outnumber skiers, with 60 per cent boarders to 40 per cent skiers. But perhaps one should not read too much into this particular Sunday - snowboarders traditionally come out to play early in winter, while skiers wait for better snow conditions. And with insufficient snow on Mammoth's new snow-board park, boarders were concentrated in part of the mountain usually dominated by skiers. But it was a glimpse of things to come. Snowboarding is said to be one of the fastest-growing sports in the west. Many resorts welcome the inevitable: others are still agonising over whether to bow to 'progress' or ban them. Tradition has it that snowboarding was invented in the early 70s by a Hawaiian 'surfing freak' called Sherwin Popper. According to local legend, when the Californian summer came to an end he decided to keep going by building himself a surfboard designed for snow - a snurfer. Twenty years later, in both north America and Europe, snowboarders represent fresh blood for a stagnating ski industry. But they are also alienating some of the more conservative skiers with their clothing, culture and configurations. The very arcs described by a snowboard are not in harmony with that of a ski. Collisions between skiers and boarders are inevitable, even when no one is to blame. But boarders are always looking for things to jump off, or get 'air' from . . . skiers much less so. One of the most disturbing things that snow-boarders tend to do is jump out of the trees like Exocets in a diagonal direction without looking before they leap. It is usually up to the skier to be constantly on watch to avoid a collision. Skiers tend to be far more watchful than snow-boarders unless the boarders are ex-skiers. Because of their stance boarders tend to have 'flounder vision', seeing only 90` of their field of vision compared with a skier's 180`. Boarders might benefit from wing-mirrors so that when they leap into skiers' path they can see them coming. Most boarders who started out as skiers tend to be more considerate and aware of mountain safety and etiquette (or shrediquette as it is sometimes known to sneering boarders). But few boarders ever switch to skiing and rarely have the awareness skiers seem to have. Many have come straight from skate-boarding or surfing, and have little sympathy with rules and regulations, even if they are designed for safety. I have been knocked flying by snowboarders when I have been completely stationery, and I have experienced dozens of near misses. One of the saddest blemishes in snowboarding history happened two winters ago when a little girl on the nursery slopes in Val Thorens is in the French Alps was killed by one. During the same winter, tempers flared between snowboarders and skiers at Copper Mountain, Colorado, when some boarders 'buzzed' skiers, sometimes knocking them over and even threatened members of the ski patrol. The local sheriff had to be called in to defuse the situation. Snowboarders are banned in some ski resorts, including Aspen, Colorado and five of the biggest resorts in Utah. Yet many skiers are switching to boarding - and not just in the 14-21 age group which dominates the sport. Ken Hensler - a lifelong skier at Mammoth, California - volunteered to keep one of his 22 grandchildren company when she was in tears during her first boarding lesson. 'Michelle and I learned together,' he says. 'She was 13 and I was 60. I fell and fell and fell, cracked two or three ribs and hurt my hands and knees so much that I felt like quitting the first day. I was black and blue. So I started boarding with a beach towel wrapped around me under my outer clothing and made myself knee and hand protectors.' But after the first day or two of agony the learning curve for a snowboarder is much sharper than a skier's. Two years later, Hensler, the retired boss of a carpet manufacturing company, was out on his snowboard for 130 days. He has never touched his skis since. This winter he aims not to miss a single day on the mountain - and even plans to learn to jump. His moment of glory was being accepted by other snowboarders. 'When they saw me they said: 'Here comes the legend]' Then I discovered what they meant by a legend: anyone over 40 on a snowboard.' Although I rode a chair with Ken and accompanied him down the mountain a few times (I am uncertain whose reputation was most tarnished when we were seen together). I resisted his attempts to get me on to a board. Much as I would love to love snowboarders, they make me nervous. Perhaps in the next decade we will not have to confront them; they will dominate what used to be the ski slopes while skiers will be confined to special ski parks. Skiers like me will be threatened species. Perhaps we already are. The other day an English snowboarder and I became entangled as we moved off from the top of the Beaver Run quad at Breckenridge. Both unbalanced, we grabbed each other for an impromptu waltz. It was probably the nearest I shall ever get to trying snowboarding for myself.</p>

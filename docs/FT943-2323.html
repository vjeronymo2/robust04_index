			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Bank charges take a tumble - In a Nutshell Increasing competition among large UK banks has driven down bank charges over the past two years, reversing some of the rises imposed during the recession, according to a price index published in the newsletter Small Business Perspective. Since June 1992, the big four banks - Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds and Midland  -have reduced bank charges by more than 6 per cent after taking account of inflation, it said. The largest banks have been cutting their charges faster than the smaller banks, although smaller banks generally remain cheaper. 'It does not mean that all bank charges are going down but it does mean  - contrary to the general impression - that basic processing charges for small firms, which rose during the recession, are now being driven down again by competition,' said a spokesman for Small Business Perspective, which is published by Graham Bannock and Partners, a London-based consultancy.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed fortunes leave senior bourses upset PROFIT-taking, caution and the occasional disappointment gave bourses an uncomfortable afternoon in share price terms, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS rallied late in the session to close just above the key chart point of 2,123, the CAC-40 index losing 11.00 to 2,128.20, off nearly 1 per cent on the week. Turnover was FFr2.9bn. Alcatel Alsthom remained one of the most heavily traded stocks on news that its joint venture with GEC of the UK had won the Dollars 2.4bn contract to build a high-speed train network in South Korea. Investors chose this moment to take profits after the shares had improved some 4 per cent over the week; they closed down FFr2 at FFr732, but off the day's low of FFr722. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe in London commented that while this had been an important contract to win, the joint venture had cut its initial bid substantially to secure the deal, which would result in low margins. Reports of a fall in the oil price in New York kept Elf Aquitaine and Total subdued, the former losing FFr5.30 to FFr436.20 and the latter FFr7 to FFr302.10. FRANKFURT's official close was bracketed by late selling on the triple expiry of DTB options contracts. The DAX index closed 16.30 lower at 1,922.68 on the session, still 0.8 per cent up on the week; but the Ibis-indicated DAX sagged to 1,909.60 in the post-bourse. Turnover fell from DM10.2bn to DM8bn. The market's big three, Deutsche Bank, Daimler and Siemens, saw losses of DM4 to DM784, just 50 pfg to DM736 and DM8.90 to DM682.60 extended later as they closed at DM777, DM728.50, and DM674 in the London afternoon. Siemens, down 2.5 per cent overall, was hit by the loss of the South Korean railway order to GEC-Alsthom. Its subsidiary, AEG, lost DM6.70 to DM174.80 in sympathy during the official session, although it had picked up strongly on a domestic train contract earlier in the week. Viag continued to gain on the pending merger with Bayernwerk, rising DM12.50 to DM471; Mannesmann lost DM8 more to DM325.20 on Thursday's dismal results, for a two day loss of 4.8 per cent; and MAN fell DM6 to DM331, slightly in advance of poor German truck sales figures for July. AMSTERDAM slipped back slightly on options expiry but brokers said that sentiment remained positive. The CBS Tendency general index weakened 0.6 to 127.9, unchanged on the week. The publishing sector continued to be firm with Elsevier putting on another 40 cents to Fl 144.40, a week's improvement of 10 per cent, and Wolters Kluwer adding Fl 1.50 to Fl 97.50. Nedlloyd fell Fl 3.90 to FL 42, but brokers put this down to technical trading on the expiry of August options. MILAN saw activity again concentrated broadly in the telecommunications sector as the Comit index closed down 3.92 at 613.68, a gain of 4.2 per cent on the week. Sip and Stet both rose by L53, to L3,618 and L4,550 respectively. Robert Fleming's Italian strategy team commented this week that the market's rally over the last three months has been driven mainly by falls in bond yields. However, against a backdrop of falling European interest rates, the team added, the expectation is for the index to stabilise around the 580-600 level. 'Indications of earnings recovery from industrial companies will not come through unti the second quarter of 1994, which is when we expect the market to start a second positive phase,' they said. BRUSSELS ended with the Bel 20 index down 8.41 on the day, and 0.8 per cent on the week at 1,346.69. Turnover was around BFr960m, excluding a BFr1.4bn off-bourse trade in Banque Bruxelles Lambert reported to the stock exchange before the opening. The insurance company, Groupe AG, which sold the share block to its Swiss counterpart, Winterthur, closed BFr30 lower at BFr2,620. BBL, which had risen 4.5 per cent to BFr4,100 on Thursday, reacted to the deal with a loss of BFr150 at BFr3,950. STOCKHOLM saw profit-taking pull the market down, with the Affarsvarlden general index off 16.7 at 1,309.5, a gain over the week of 1.2 per cent. Turnover was down to SKr1.9bn from Thursday's SKr2.9bn. Disappointing half year results from Investor also discouraged investors, with the B shares dipping SKr7 to SKr144. HELSINKI blamed profit-taking as the Hex index fell 25.70 to 1,464.20, still 1.6 per cent up on the week. In the banking sector, KOP fell FM1.3 to FM16 after Thursday's rights issue announcement. VIENNA edged higher, while there were strong performances from Wienerberger, the building materials group, gaining Sch45 to Sch3,585, and Creditanstalt, up Sch4 to a new year's high of Sch737. The ATX index rose 1.30 to 1,000.36, unchanged on the week. ISTANBUL finished the week another 2.1 per cent higher on buying of some underperforming blue chip stocks. For instance, Ergeli, the steel group, added TL175 to TL1,925. The composite index ended 234 better at 11,149, an improvement of 14.5 per cent on the week.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- August 20                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1304.63      1304.26      1303.80      1303.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1386.59      1387.46      1385.07      1384.97  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1302.58      1300.52      1296.38      1297.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1385.59      1383.35      1380.31      1380.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Aug 19    Aug 18    Aug 17    Aug 16    Aug 13 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1304.07   1303.09   1284.89   1276.32   1276.24 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1385.51   1387.63   1368.15   1359.35   1354.67  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1304.63; 200 - 1387.97 Low/day: 100 - 1296.28  200 - 1378.54.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

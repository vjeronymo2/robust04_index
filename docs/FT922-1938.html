			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African coal prices give 'barely adequate' return on investment CONTRACT PRICE levels for coal are barely adequate at present to offer South African producers a return on existing investments, never mind encourage new investment, says Mr Allen Cook, chief executive of Randcoal, South Africa's second largest producer. Speaking at a recent conference in Australia, Mr Cook said although international demand for South African coal would continue to rise in future years, there were two major points of concern for the local industry. The first concerns the high rate of cost escalation in recent years, which is eroding South Africa's competitive position. This is a function of increased wage demands, rising transport costs and continuing inflation of about 15 per cent. Mr Cook said there was a significant drive in the industry to lower costs by improving productivity. Agreement has also been reached with Spoornet, the state rail company, to peg rail freight costs on the line to the Richards Bay export port in the next few years at about half the inflation level. The second issue is that 'current market conditions, recent price history and some buyers' attitudes to pricing' militate against further investment. Mr Cook said a buyers market had existed for a number of years, with the real price for coal declining in all major currencies. 'The cost squeeze on producers has led to a number of mine closures which, in the medium term, will be detrimental to the continued secure supplies of coal from major producing companies,' said Mr Cook. He added that it was in the interest of all parties that a 'reasonable' price level should be set that encouraged future investment in coal. South Africa has port capacity to export 53m tonnes a year. Fob contract prices would have to rise by between Dollars 5 and Dollars Pounds 8 a tonne to make projects to expand capacity beyond this point viable, said Mr Cook. Coal is South Africa's second largest export earner after gold. Last year the country earned R4.2bn (Pounds 630m) from exporting 48.5m tonnes of coal. Mr Cook said that with sanctions gone, large potential new markets were opening up, particularly in Japan, Korea, Denmark, France, Holland, UK and US. He said that Western Europe had regained its position as the main destination for South African exports. Mr Cook said Europe remained a major growth market for South African coal that was price competitive, 'particularly if the price of coal from current low-price producers in CIS and Poland begins to reflect the actual cost of production'.</p>

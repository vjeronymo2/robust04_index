			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The State Development  Bank (SDB), born two weeks ago, declared here today the success  of its first bond issue of 20 billion yuan.    "By the 25th of this month, the first batch of bonds worth  20  billion yuan had been purchased by state commercial banks and  non-banking financial institutions," said SDB President Yao  Zhengya.    "The sell-out of the bonds marks a good start for key state  projects in obtaining enough capital funds this year," said Yao.    According to the usual practice, these projects should  obtain  40 percent of the yearly financing during the first six months  of the year.    However, the planned capital demand was only met by 19  percent of the projects during the January-June period of 1993  due to a national financial squeeze.    The State Development Bank, the country's first policy bank,  was established to ensure the smooth channeling of funds to  major construction projects, mostly in the basic industries and  infrastructure sectors, and technical renovation of "pillar"  state firms.    According to Yao, the bank will issue a total of 65 billion  yuan in bonds this year. The other issues will be made in May,  July, August and October, with amounts of 8 billion, 13 billion,  12.5 billion and 11.5 billion yuan respectively.    The bonds, which include 45.5 three-year maturity bonds and  19.5 five-year maturity bonds, will be bought by banks and other  financial bodies under quotas set by the People's Bank of China,  the central bank.    The interest rates are 12.5 percent for the three-year bonds  and 14 percent for the five-year ones.    The national treasury provided the bank with one billion  yuan  as a discount this year to make up for the gap caused by the low  interest loans extended by the bank to the projects.</p>

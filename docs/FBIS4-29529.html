			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  stressed Monday that a summit between South and North Korea must  be held to resolve the two sides' problems, presidential  spokesman Chu Ton-sik quoted the president as saying.    While meeting U.S. Senators John McCain (R.-Ariz.) and Phil  Gramm (R.-Tex.) to discuss the political situation on the Korean  peninsula, including the nuclear dispute and military  cooperation between South Korea and the United States, Kim said:  "It is very important for the South and North to make mutual  inspections (of each other's nuclear facilities) in the end,  although discussions are under way on the nuclear issue between  the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA)," according to Chu.    President Kim was also quoted as saying that his government  has been preparing for the South-North summit meeting. "We sent  a telephone message (to the North) this morning, to the effect  that the two sides should discuss the time and place on the  grand principle of holding a South-North summit meeting, because  we think there's no need to delay a summit."    Senator McCain, meanwhile, said he was convinced of the  importance of maintaining close military cooperation between  Seoul and Washington after touring the Korea-U.S. Combined  Forces Command, according to Chu.    McCain reportedly said the American forces have a heightened  awareness of security, which had seemingly weakened since the  end of the Cold War, adding he felt that the U.S. Second  Infantry Division was the strongest in the world.    Congratulating Kim for carrying out vigorous reform, McCain  voiced admiration for the president's popularity. The senator  praised Kim's motto of "clean government, strong economy" and  promised to reflect the motto in the Republican Party platform  in 1996, according to Chu.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Re "An Interview With Paramount's Top Guns," March 18:  </P> <P> I found myself feeling a little queasy as I read the interview with producers  Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. At first I thought a paragraph might have  been left out . . . something that explained how two men whose claim to fame is  producing Eddie Murphy spouting obscenities in formula cop-chase comedies (with  lots of gratuitous violence) and Tom Cruise in puerile macho special-effects  movies (with lots of gratuitous violence) can actually be publicly  congratulating themselves for their "aesthetic."  </P> <P> Reading further, I began to suspect self-parody in this wide-ranging interview,  wherein the reader is told: "I am inclined to be esoteric" and "We're not  producers for hire."  </P> <P> Why are men this self-deluded, greedy and ignorant rewarded with obscenely huge  sums of money? Do studio heads really believe Simpson and Bruckheimer have  talent or taste? No, I'm afraid, to quote Mr. S, "It's beyond the realm of  caca."  </P> <P> SUSAN ROETHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

The homeland's commissioner of police, Major General Manyane  Noqayi, has been taken hostage by striking policemen and is  being held along with about 30 of his officers at the police  college in Bisho. A spokesman for the striking policemen said  Brigadier Gqozo would be taken to the Bisho Independence Stadium  this morning to address the armed forces. The estimated 3,000  policemen who commandeered the police college said earlier that  they would only accept the fact that Brigadier Gqozo had  resigned if he informed them in person. The policemen, whose  ranks were bolstered by Ciskeian soldiers who refused an order  to surround the college, are sticking to their demands before  releasing the hostages. The demands include pension payouts and  an investigation into corruption among senior police officers.    Earlier, Brigadier Gqozo resigned and asked that South  Africa  take over the administration of Ciskei. South African minister  of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, said SADF [South African Defense  Force] troops along the border with Ciskei have been put on  standby in case they were needed to be deployed in Ciskei. The  number of hostages being held by the striking policemen has  grown to 42, and includes five women. A spokesman for the  striking policemen said they had asked the ANC [African National  Congress] to send marshals to protect businesses and government  buildings in Ciskei. He said they did not want a repeat of the  disruption which had occurred in Bophuthatswana.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has decided that  two  administrators should be appointed to run Ciskei. The council  would appoint one administrator and the government the other.  The TEC said that the administrators would be assisted by the  chief secretary of NEHAWU [National Education, Health and Allied  Workers Union], the director general of foreign affairs, and the  minister for administration.    The policemen on strike are demanding that their pensions be  paid out and that steps be taken against administrative  corruption.</p>

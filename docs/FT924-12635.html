			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Mount Banking put in administration MOUNT Banking Corporation, a privately owned London-based bank, has been put into administration rather than liquidation following a High Court ruling yesterday.

The administrators will be former provisional liquidators, KPMG Peat Marwick.</p>

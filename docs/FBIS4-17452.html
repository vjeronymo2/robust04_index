			<p>BFN     [Text] According to SAKINPORM, Georgia's customs department  has received a letter from the Customs Committee of the Russian  Federation signed by Kruglyakov, first deputy chairman of the  committee. The letter says: Because the Republic of Georgia  has been a member of the CIS since 1 March 1994, in accordance  with the edict issued by the Russian Federation Customs  Committee, the heads of its regional departments and customs  houses have been officially instructed not to levy a tax in the  form of VAT, special duties, and excise duties on goods produced  in Georgia and carried from the Georgian territory retroactive  to 1 March 1994. Money already paid for the above-mentioned  taxes should be refunded from the customs house account or it  can be applied to future payments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukui, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's prototype fast  breeder reactor "Monju" is now fully loaded with fuel and ready  for going "critical" throughout the entire core, the  governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.  said Friday [20 May].    The last of the 198 fuel assemblies was installed in the  core  the same day, and the reactor is now set for full chain  reactions of nuclear fission.    Monju, located in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, is expected to  reach critical state early Sunday.    The controversial fast breeder reactor reached criticality  for the first time on April 5, with 168 fuel assemblies  installed.    The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide  and uranium oxide, is believed to have the potential to use fuel  60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors.    Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in  the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction  without outside stimulus.    Since the reactor reached criticality, the governmental  agency has been gradually installing the remaining fuel  assemblies, while experimenting with the critical conditions by  inserting and removing some of the 19 neutron-absorbing control  rods.    The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further  tests in this chain reaction stage before turbines are connected  in April next year for generating electricity. Full operation  is scheduled to start in December 1995.</p>

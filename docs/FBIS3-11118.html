In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, the Cuban  foreign minister, who in addition to Thailand has already  visited Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar (formerly Burma), said that  his hosts have expressed interest in negotiations with Cuba in  the fields of health, biotechnology, and sports, among others.    He said that Cuba does not go around making only appeals,  that Cuba has much to offer the world also, especially this part  of the world. He noted that right now his country is facing  many needs and that other countries could make investments based  on those needs.    In his opinion, Cuba must analyze the economic boom in this  region and determine what can be tailored to fit Cuba's needs.    Robaina emphasized that our diplomacy's main objective is to  contribute, within the framework of an economic model that must  be, above everything else, Cuban and viable, to the solution of  the problems we have.    Robaina said that so far the most important aspect of his  tour, which will also include India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, has  been the understanding and opportunities he has found for  explaining Cuba's true situation.    Robaina noted that the persons with whom he has held  meetings  so far have expressed respect for the way the Cuban people have  resisted and for how, in the midst of difficulties, the island  has begun to show recovery symptoms.    At times like this we have to function with a new-style  diplomacy, one mindful of the main problems all nations face.    After intense sessions in Myanmar and Thailand, Robaina left  for Cambodia where he is scheduled to meet with the prime  minister of that kingdom, Sdeth Krom [as received], and National  Assembly President Chea Sin, among other government leaders.    This is the first official visit of a prominent Cuban  Government leader to Cambodia since the establishment of peace  and stability in that nation.</p>

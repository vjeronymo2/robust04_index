			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Shizheng (2621 1102 2398) and Yin Yongsheng (1438 </F> 3057 3932): "Number One Automobile Group Steadily Pursues  Improved Production Method"]    [Text] When you visit Number One Automobile, you will  discover that its workshops have changed a lot. The spare parts  and components which are stacked up in ordinary plants are not  found there. One person operates several machines. Inspectors  and repairmen go to and fro on the spot ready to solve problems  right away. Plaques giving production instructions in the  workshop are written tidily..... This is what they have become  since adopting an improved production method.    In recent years, in order to give priority to improving  economic returns in the course of modernizing enterprise, the  Number One Auto Group has enhanced its competitiveness in the  market, boldly reformed its traditional method of flow mass  production, and gradually and thoroughly introduced an improved  method of production.    The improved production method is a unique one created by  Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation in the 30 years since the  1950's and is considered another revolution in management  following the "mass production method" created in the United  States in the early 1920's. Its goal is to continuously reduce  costs and waste and achieve zero stocks, product variety, and  the maximization of economic returns with the fewest inputs.  Today, economically developed countries around the world,  especially in the auto industry, are learning and promoting this  production method.    Number One Automobile began to adopt the improved production  method in the company itself in 1992. First, they chose five  special plants, nine workshops, and three production lines with  different technological status, processing methods, and pace of  production for experimentation. After adopting the improved  production method for one year, the jack shaft plant doubled its  originally planned production, increasing its labor productivity  by nearly 100 percent. In the first year of pursuing the  improved production method, Changchun's gear plant found its  output value had increased by 44 percent, labor productivity by  37 percent, and per capita profits by 25 percent over the  previous year.    After obtaining experience, the company, trying to make a  breakthrough in production management, reformed its traditional  mass production method:    They achieved "one-flow" production by changing the original  phased-push process to a successive one-phase process, thus  greatly reducing stocks between processes, reducing the amount  of circulating funds used, improving processing quality, and  greatly reducing waste.    They succeeded in reducing the number of production workers  and achieved full capacity by having one person operate several  machines rather than one machine as in the past, thus greatly  improving production efficiency.    They changed the original large-scale production with a  small  number of batches to small-scale production with a large number  of batches, thus facilitating the organization of varied  production, saving warehouse space, and reducing rotating  workloads.    They changed the original delivery of stocks to just-in-time  delivery, thus smoothing production and maintaining orderly  on-site production.    By adopting improved production, Number One Automobile has  already obtained preliminary results and its economic returns  have obviously improved. In 1993, its sales income increased by  45 percent over the previous year and profits and income  increased by 53 percent, and many of its economic and  technological indicators reached historic highs. Moreover, this  improved production method has also been integrated with reform  of the labor, wage distribution, and social security systems.  Staff numbers have been reduced and have shown negative growth,  and the enterprise has become "slim." A hot wave of "building a  factory with improved production" has now surged in Number One  Automobile, where leaders pay close attention to improving  methods, staff and workers emphasize improved methods, and  everyone stresses work improvement.</p>

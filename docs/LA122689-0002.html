			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: NASTASE RETURNS HOME, FINDS AN UGLY SCENE  </P> <P> Romanian tennis star Ilie Nastase says his legs shook as he watched people  being killed by soldiers in Bucharest, Romania, last week.  </P> <P> Nastase gave this account to the Sunday Telegraph after his arrival in London  Friday:  </P> <P> "On Thursday I had to go to see what was happening. I did not fight but I just  wanted to be part of what all these people were doing. I was shocked. I saw  people falling down as soldiers and police opened fire. Then in the evening  they were firing on them from helicopters."  </P> <P> Nastase, 43, who had "never seen a dead person in my life before," said a tank  started firing behind him. "I wasn't a normal person, my legs were shaking,  everything was shaking."  </P> <P> At Bucharest Airport Friday, his flight was delayed because it was feared  revolutionary forces might shoot it down, Nastase said.  </P> <P> Nastase noted that while he is an officer in the Romanian army, the rank is  merely honorary, "given to me because of my tennis playing. I don't have any  links with them."  </P> <P> Nastase, famous for his flamboyant on-court antics, won the 1972 U.S. Open and  the 1973 French Open.  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Dec. 26, 1955, who passed for two touchdowns and ran for two in  the Cleveland Browns' 38-14 victory over the Rams for the NFL championship?  </P> <P> There ought to be a law: The Seattle SuperSonics' Xavier McDaniel and Charles  Oakley of the New York Knicks were fined $7,500 and suspended for one game for  fighting last week. But the league also fined 13 players $500 each for leaving  the bench during the brawl, which angered the Sonics' Olden Polynice.  </P> <P> "It's not like the refs were going to break it up," Polynice said. "Those were  big guys out there. If we didn't break it up, those guys would still be  fighting."  </P> <P> Helping hand: After learning of an AIDS epidemic in his home of Voskresensk in  the Soviet Union, Vancouver Canuck center Igor Larionov bought 10,000 syringes  for its hospital, where up to a dozen patients were said to have been injected  with the same needle.  </P> <P> Canuck trainer Larry Ashley said: "It's an insight into how much Igor cares for  his people. A gesture like this shows he has real good qualities."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Otto Graham.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Entertainer Bob Hope on today's college football players: "I get a  kick out of how big these guys have become. They should have license plates on  them." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

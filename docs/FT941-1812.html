			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italian spending overshoots target The Italian government yesterday revealed that spending in 1994 was liable to overshoot the budget target by L14,800bn (Dollars 8.8bn). The estimate is based on first quarter treasury receipts which were lower than expected as a result of the recession biting deeper. At the same time social security spending has grown faster and the savings envisaged in the reform of the civil service have been slow to materialise. The budget shortfall comes during the closing stages of the election campaign and underlines the limited options open to the next government. It would make it extremely difficult for media magnate Silvio Berlusconi to carry out his promise to relaunch the economy, reduce taxes and provide more jobs. Instead the next government will probably be forced to introduce a corrective budget shortly after it takes office. The 1994 budget envisages holding the budget deficit at L151,000bn, equivalent to 8.7 per cent of GDP. On yesterday's projections the deficit would expand to almost L160,000bn. One area where spending has grown rapidly is pensions, and officials have warned this week that Italy will have to accelerate its plans to raise the pension age to 65 years. If tough measures are not taken on pension and health spending, the total social security budget may exceed 14 per cent of GDP. Italy's state-dominated pension system is among the most generous in the EC and reforms introduced last year envisage only a gradual tightening of benefits and an extremely slow move from the current retirement ages. At present women retire at 55 and men at 60. The pensions budget has been complicated by the recession with large-scale resort to early retirement agreements in order to facilitate industrial restructuring. This year the government approved a deal covering some 6,000 employees at Fiat and earlier this month agreed to fund an early retirement deal for the bulk of 12,000 redundant workers in Ilva, the state-controlled steel group. The political parties in the election campaign have all emphasised the need to encourage private pension funds and to reduce the burden on the state.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY  </P> <P> In reply to "Justice Suffers in 'Sting' of Mayor Barry," by Jesse Jackson,  Commentary, July 8:  </P> <P> After reading Jackson's column, I have several questions to ask. Who is on  trial here, Washington Mayor Marion Barry or the government? Was there probable  cause that Barry had used drugs and had lied about it? Jackson adroitly  sidesteps the possibility that Barry may be mentally sick and describes him as  "physically sick and chemically dependent."  </P> <P> Should such a person head a city government? Furthermore, should the government  go after drug lords, kingpins, etc. and not after users? Would there even be  such people if there were no users?  </P> <P> Finally, if Jackson believes the government singles out black politicians for  prosecution (which I doubt), shouldn't black politicians behave in such a way  that their actions appear beyond reproach? Would Jackson have black politicians  held to a lesser level of scrutiny than white politicians? Wouldn't that be the  ultimate in patronizing?  </P> <P> ROBERT S. RODGERS  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev -- Leonid Tupchiyenko, an expert at the  International Institute of Global and Regional Security,  considers that the next round of interstate talks between  Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea Fleet, to be held in Kiev on  8-9 June, could end without a result since during the working  consultations in Sevastopol at the end of last week, owing to  Russia's position, the sides were unable to move forward on the  most principled issue -- that of the division of the Black Sea  Fleet's shore infrastructure.    Volodymyr Pryadko, chairman of Ukraine's State Property  Fund,  in an interview with UNIAN, declined to name the exact value of  the property of the Black Sea Fleet's shore infrastructure. He  just noted that "at issue is Ukraine property valued at several  billion dollars."    In an interview with UNIAN after the completion of  consultations, Feliks Gromov, commander of the Russian  Federation's Navy, accused Ukraine of not wishing to include,  first and foremost, the Massandra protocols and by doing so,  casting doubt on the validity of the remaining documents with  regard to the Black Sea Fleet. In the admiral's view, the  absence of a clear political decision does not offer the  opportunity to continue the dialogue with regard to the shore  infrastructure.    Ukrainian Navy Commander Vice Admiral Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy  said: "There are at least 29 shore installations which should  only be used jointly, because of their uniqueness. In my view,  the Russian experts headed by Feliks Gromov were either not  prepared or did not have the authority to discuss this issue  during the meeting in Sevastopol as well as the aspects of the  land basing of the fleet's aviation and shore troops."    During the consultations on 3-4 June they finally succeeded  in confirming the agreement on the conditional 50-50 division of  the fleet's ships. Its conditionality lies in the fact that  Kiev selects 15-20 percent of the ships from its share which are  realistically required to form the basis of the Ukrainian navy.    The members of the Russian delegation are interpreting this  protocol of intent in the following manner: Ukraine has the  right to select 15-20 percent from each ship type. The  remainder of Ukraine's 35-30 percent will be compensated at the  expense of inter- state economic agreements.    Ukrainian experts consider that Russia's position leaves  Ukraine without the possibility of maneuver and therefore  without the possibility of independently choosing the required  number of ships within the limits of the 50 percent of the  floating means owed to it. According to unofficial information,  in practice, during the latest consultations it was not  permitted to coordinate the division of 11 fighting ships.  Ukraine Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov, who met experts from  both sides, local authorities, and personnel of the Ukrainian  naval command in Sevastopol, said in an interview with UNIAN:  "A concrete approach to the division of ships according to the  number and type gives the hope that this issue will be resolved  soon."    Valeriy Shmarov, together with members of the governmental  delegation that accompanied him in Sevastopol, examined, from a  helicopter, the bays of Sevastopol and Balaklava and also  Donuzlav which are increasingly being described as the probable  main base for the Ukrainian navy. [passage omitted]    Independent experts note that Ukraine's desire to split the  fleet in such a way that would enable both parts to cooperate  operationally by defending the Black Sea basin and Ukraine's  southern borders with Russia does not suit the Russian side.  All efforts are being made in Moscow so that the fleet, after  its division, remains a striking power in Russia's hands.  Experts do not exclude the possibility that at the next round  of talks in Kiev on 8 June, Russia's ambassador at large, Yuriy  Dubinin, who heads the Russian delegation, will suggest  preparing for the signing of two documents: a separate document  on the ships and a separate one on the shore infrastructure.  This will, in general, make reaching a principled decision on  the division of the Black Sea Fleet in the near future a  problem.</p>

It said the January 28  incident occurred after a confrontation between an American UN  soldier and a plainclothes policemen, during which the latter  was insulted despite having made known his profession. In an  ensuing brawl involving some 20 UN troops and Skopje police,  witnessed by several passersby, a shot was fired but caused no  casualties, according to the paper. It did not say who had been  responsible for the shot. UN military police then intervened to  end the scuffle, after meeting resistance from U.S. forces,  according to Vecer. Macedonian and United Nations officials,  embarassed by the affair, refused to comment on the report,  other than to say that the incident was under investigation.    An estimated 1,000 UN troops, 315 Americans and 700 from  Scandinanvian countries, have been deployed in Macedonia to  prevent the republic from getting caught up in the conflict  raging elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

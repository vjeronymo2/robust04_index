			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LET'S PLAY BY THE RULES  </P> <P> If American diplomats in any part of the world were detained by foreign  soldiers, the U.S. government would howl in protest -- and rightly so. So why  is the Bush Administration letting U.S. troops in Panama do just that to  diplomats there?  </P> <P> Granted, most of the diplomats who have had run-ins with U.S. soldiers come  from countries that are less than friendly, like Cuba, Libya and Nicaragua. But  others represent parties with whom we are on good terms, like the Vatican, or  countries with whom we should be trying to repair relations in the aftermath of  the Panama invasion, like Peru.  </P> <P> And while some incidents have stemmed from legitimate military concerns, such  as searching for hidden weapons, others seem to represent little more than  bullying. Why is Peru's embassy in Panama City, for example, surrounded by  heavily armed U.S. troops, sandbags and concertina wire? The official  explanation is that the armed troops, the sandbags and the wire are aimed at  intercepting pro-Noriega fugitives trying to get in or out. But it would be a  lot better all around to assign a detachment of Panamanian police, similar to  those stationed at Nicaragua's embassy after flare-ups between U.S. troops and  Sandinista diplomats. Why look for trouble?  </P> <P> The 1961 Vienna Convention guarantees immunity of all diplomatic personnel and  property. U.S. soldiers in Panama, concerned with military rather than  diplomatic problems, probably find such rules bothersome. But those rules  helped U.S. diplomats in many a tense situation, and are likely to be used  again. This nation has interests all over the world, so the last thing we  should do is set precedents that could come back to haunt us. The heavy-handed  tactics used by some American troops in Panama may be doing just that.  </P></p>

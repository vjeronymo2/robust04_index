			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MA, KAHANE IN RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> For all his popular stature, Yo-Yo Ma regularly has made his recitals  partnerships rather than star turns. This season he is touring with pianist  Jeffrey Kahane, and Thursday they arrived at Ambassador Auditorium, with an  encore performance scheduled for Friday at Royce Hall.  </P> <P> The generous, well-constructed program they brought placed an equal emphasis on  the piano, while playing to Ma's singing strength as a cellist. The effort  provided wonders of nuance and idiosyncratic delights, within completely  natural, unexaggerated contexts.  </P> <P> The novelty on the agenda, Kenneth Frazelle's new Sonata in its local premiere,  could quickly become a repertory staple. It is identifiably American -- of the  Ives-Copland-Schickele lineage -- and cast in three originally shaped, tonally  centered movements.  </P> <P> Ma and Kahane delivered it with clarity and affection. They stressed its  lyrical sweetness without sentimentality, let the hushed mysteries of the  central Adagio hover gracefully and projected barn-dance vigor in the  rhythmically complex finale. The North Carolina-based composer was present to  share the bows.  </P> <P> Rachmaninoff's G-minor Sonata offered its characteristic Big Music  opportunities for expressive display, which Ma and Kahane seized in fully  integrated tandem. The surging finale came to a few too many counterproductive  climaxes, but it had lean, concentrated power aplenty and interpretive  unanimity.  </P> <P> In transcriptions of Falla's "Siete Canciones," Kahane moved into the  accompanying background, allowing Ma leeway for his pliant phrasing. Ma pushed  the peerless intensity of his sound into a buzz at peak moments, but the effect  was that of the hoarse cry of cante flamenco.  </P> <P> Kahane had ample chance to work solo marvels in Beethoven's Variations on "Ein  Madchen oder Weibchen," which he did with crystalline poise and evenly  modulated sound. Cellist matched pianist in fleet articulation and focused  brio.  </P> <P> In encore Ma went from the spiccato bravura of Kreisler's "Tambourin Chinois"  to the soulful song of Saint-Saens' "Le Cygne," with utmost verve and pathos.

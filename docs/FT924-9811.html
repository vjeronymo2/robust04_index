			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries regain ground in light trade US TREASURY prices yesterday regained the ground lost on Monday as investors calmly awaited the outcome of the presidential election. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 95 5/16 , yielding 7.645 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/8 at 99 21/32 , yielding 4.416 per cent. Traders said turnover remained light as many participants sat out polling day. Although the final opinion polls predicted a victory for Mr Bill Clinton, the market had already discounted a Democrat win. There was no one particular factor behind the gains. The day's only economic news - a 0.3 per cent decline in September's leading indicators - was mildly positive for the market. It suggested that the economy continues to move sideways, rather than forward as would normally be expected at this stage of the economic cycle. Uncertainty over the size of the next quarterly refunding programme had contributed to Monday's losses, so it came as a relief to investors when the Treasury announced it would raise Dollars 37bn from the November operation, slightly more than in the previous quarter but not as much as some players in the market had feared. UK government bonds ended firmer, helped by sterling's strength against the D-Mark in the foreign exchange markets and a slightly improved political background concerning the outcome of today's Maastricht debate. The pound closed at DM2.42, from DM2.4030, lending a firmer tone to gilt prices. On the political front, fears that the government would be unable to muster a majority in the House of Commons today paving the way for a bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty, are easing, dealers said. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from Monday's close of 120 1/32 to trade at 120 7/32 by late afternoon. GERMAN government bonds ended slightly firmer, but activity was subdued as market participants awaited the US presidential election result. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.33 and dipped to a low of 91.31 before recovering to end at around 91.47, the high of the day. Most of the interest was concentrated in the five-year sector of the market again, dealers said. Dealers said the market shrugged off statements by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, who warned that further German rate cuts depended on slower money supply growth. He added that moves on German rates depended on further cuts in the budget deficit and on wage levels in the 1993 pay round. ELSEWHERE in Europe, French government bonds strengthened, following Monday's quarter-point cut in the key interest rates. The Treasury is due to auction between FFr14bn and FFr16bn of government bonds tomorrow. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the December bond futures contract closed at 110.60, up 0.16 from late on Friday. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 was unchanged from Monday at 8.17 per cent. The Treasury said it would offer FFr14bn-FFr16bn of tap stock at its regular monthly auction tomorrow when it plans to sell the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 and the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2008. New York's Commodity Exchange was today due to open its fledgling Eurotop 100 futures two hours earlier than usual, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. Trading in the Pan-European index will commence at 5.30am EST, although the closing time of 4.15pm pm will not be altered. The Comex, better known for its gold and silver futures contracts, opened futures trading on the Eurotop 100 on October 26 and volume so far has averaged just 1,000 contracts a day. Mr David Halperin, Comex president, said the earlier trading hours were expected to maximise the overlap between the futures market and the period in which most of the underlying European stock markets were open.</p>

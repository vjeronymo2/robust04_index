			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN ARSON OF KAGEL CANYON HOUSE  </P> <P> A man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of setting fire to the home of an  acquaintance who refused to lend him money, authorities said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Douglas Howell, 36, a transient  from Tacoma, Wash., in the arson of a Kagel Canyon home rented by Robert  Cawley, said Sgt. Stephen Keife.  </P> <P> The fire, which broke out about 4:30 a.m., caused an estimated $102,000 damage  to the house in the 11300 block of Rayland Drive, authorities said.  </P> <P> Keife said Howell came to the home earlier that morning and demanded that  Cawley give him $1,400 so Howell could pay a debt. When Cawley refused, the two  began arguing.  </P> <P> Howell hit Cawley and threatened to destroy his house with dynamite, Keife  said. A friend of Cawley's who saw the fight took Cawley away to prevent more  violence, Keife said. When Cawley returned home, he found it in flames.  </P> <P> It took firefighters about four hours to control the blaze.  </P> <P> About two hours after the fire was extinguished, Cawley saw Howell walking on  Kagel Canyon Road, two miles from the house. Sheriff's deputies arrested Howell  about 10:45 a.m. He was in custody Sunday afternoon at the Cresenta Valley  Sheriff's station in lieu of $10,000 bail.  </P></p>

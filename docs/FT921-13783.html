			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Management: Plugged into the quality circuit / Investigation into one company's experience - Customer care Henry Casley calls it the 'Quest for Quality' and as Southern Electric's managing director, he has been pursuing it with all the enthusiasm and zeal of a Arthurian knight. Casley's determination to follow a quality improvement programme at the regional electricity company is based on common sense and pragmatism - and significantly not on a management consultant's blueprint. 'Satisfied customers mean a satisfactorily profitable business,' he says. He firmly rejects the notion that improving quality means higher costs. 'In our view, quality is really getting it right first time, identifying what a customer wants and then making sure the customer gets it. Quality is productivity and efficiency by a much more acceptable name.' When it was privatised in December 1990, Southern inherited a huge business franchise covering 16,500 square kilometres with more than 2.5m customers, 8,200 employees and an annual turnover of about Pounds 1.6bn. But the prospect of privatisation had already provided the crucial catalyst for change. The roots of Southern's quality programme go back five years to when the company's management embarked upon a drive to become the most successful of all the - then - area electricity boards. As part of this effort, the business was reorganised into six operating divisions, each led by a divisional manager and management team. These new teams were asked to come up with proposals for overcoming problems - like staff attitudes and image - which had been identified as 'obstacles to success'. What emerged was a plan for team building and team briefings which started in February 1987. By the autumn of 1990, Casley says the company had 'reached a stage when we were ready for the next leap forward'. He had become convinced that improving the quality of service provided to customers - internal as well as external - was the next challenge. In September that year, Casley contacted all 900 team briefers inviting them to ask their teams to name the two or three things 'that drive our customers crazy'. The response was overwhelming. 'It was obvious that people were bursting at the seams to do something,' says Casley. He was then able to announce that in response to the suggestions, a 'quality manager' would be appointed, a quality improvement programme would be adopted and the company would seek registration with Marketing Quality Assurance, the independent UK body which assesses and designates compliance with BS 5750-type quality standards for marketing, sales and customer service activities. Casley believes strongly that it is important that the workforce 'own the quality programme' rather than having it imposed on them from either above or outside. At the start of December 1990, Edward Hyams, one of Southern's field managers, was appointed quality director. He reports directly to the managing director, makes regular presentations to the executive, and attends the monthly management meeting which always has quality on agenda. Casley said he decided to seek MQA registration because its approach was 'practical, sane, sensible and realistic'. Adopting this route provided a framework for the quality programme while Casely exploited an existing friendship with Southern California Edison, the US electric utility, to provide a benchmark and role model. MQA conducted an initial assessment - asking searching questions about Southern's systems and procedures - an experience Casley describes as like 'holding up a mirror to expose the holes'. But it was up to Southern to plan and execute its own quality improvement programme. The 'master plan' for the project remains the company's 48-page quality manual which embodies the 'mission' or 'ultimate quality goal'. This aims to ensure that all Southern Electric employees work together to provide a quality service which: is profitable satisfies our customers we are proud to present. Wall posters and Quest for Quality leaflets introducing the programme carried the mission message while employees were encouraged to join or set up odd-sounding committees like Quigs - Quality Improvement Groups  - to tackle problems affecting quality. To ensure the message got through, there were presentations to all managers and employees on quality, a corporate quality video and articles in the staff newspaper which is sent to everyone's home. Meanwhile the quality management department produced a set of customer service guidelines. So how were customers made aware of Southern's quality drive? Among measures adopted to improve the quality of customer service, telephone bureau operators answering customer calls now give their names and, on a sampling basis, customers are called back afterwards to find out if they are satisfied with the results. Service engineers use their mobile telephones to tell customers if they will be late for an appointment. At the same time, Southern has successfully managed to better the nine guaranteed service standards which Offer, the industry regulator, imposes on the privatised regionals. For example, the regulator requires that customers be given two days notice of disconnection for maintainance but Southern gives a full week. The company monitors and scrutinises its compliance with the externally imposed standards and with its own 39 business indicators. 'Unless an organisation keeps score, it does not know whether it is succeeding,' says Casley. Southern also draws up a comparative league table for its six divisions. 'People are very competitive and quality is about being competitive as well,' says Casley. Each month a performance report is presented to the management meeting. Casley has no doubt the quality programme has produced gains, although he emphasises that it is a continuing process. Nevertheless, Southern can already claim some real successes. Symbolising the progress so far, the company was recently presented with only the second registration certificate issued by MQA. Henry Casley is particularly proud of the comment made by MQA's six assessors who spent a week at Southern preparing their final report: 'The considerable progress evidently achieved by the company since the initial assesment carried out by MQA in April 91 appeared to be the result of considerable effective effort by southern electric directors, management and staff at all levels in the organisation, who displayed a high level of commitment to Southern Electric and its quest for quality,' the assessors said. Casley believes that Southern's continuing quest will provide real benefits for customers and shareholders alike, and ensure his company stays competitive in an increasingly deregulated market. 'We are pursuing quality for a good business reason,' he says. 'People unite behind quality, it is very proactive. It sounds a bit tough but you can use quality as the key driver within the organisation because it brings the people who provide the service face to face with the real world - with what the customer wants.</p>

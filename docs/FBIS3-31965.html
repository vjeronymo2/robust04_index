They greeted him and  reasserted their support for the way in which he has conducted  the democratic transition process.    The PS leadership reiterated its proposal for the adoption  of  measures leading to the prompt resumption of full diplomatic  ties with Cuba.    Aylwin and the PS leadership share an optimistic view of the  future of Chile in view of the strength of the CPPD [Coalition  of Parties for Democracy] and the projected positive social and  economic development indicators.    The PS leadership is headed by Camilo Escalona, who assumed  his duties on 15 January. A one-hour meeting was held with  Aylwin yesterday afternoon at Government House.    Also present at the meeting were PS Vice Presidents Isabel  Allende, Jaime Perez de Arce, and Marcelo Schilling. PS Under  Secretaries Anibal Palma and Hernan del Canto also attended.    Prior to this meeting, Aylwin held separate meetings with  newly appointed PS Vice President Ricardo Solari and Secretary  General Gonzalo Martner, who will assume their party posts in  March. They are currently working as presidential under  secretary and regional development under secretary, respectively.    Speaking about the issues discussed with Aylwin, Camilo  Escalona said they held a very cordial meeting during which they  exchanged points of view about the administration's experience  over the past four years. The PS reasserted its support for the  progress achieved toward the consolidation of democracy.    Escalona stated that the PS agreed to extend its recognition  to Aylwin for his relevant role during a friendship meeting to  be held after 11 March 1994.    The new PS leader added that they discussed with the  president the future of the nation, concern over the recession  in Europe, and its possible impact on Chile.    He said: "We are all reasonably optimistic about the future  of Chilean politics, particularly because of the CPPD, which is  an alliance that continues to govern the country in the same way  it has for the past four years."    The PS also discussed the party's interest in promoting  specific steps toward the prompt restoration of diplomatic ties  with the Cuban regime.    Camilo Escalona said: "The president is now studying the  issue."    On several occasions the PS has stressed the need to  reestablish full diplomatic ties with Cuba, which were severed  by Fidel Castro's regime in September 1973 following the rupture  of institutional order in Chile.    The Aylwin administration has reestablished ties with Cuba  at  the commercial and consular levels but the PS leadership insists  on the need for full diplomatic ties with Cuba for humanitarian  reasons and the pragmatic nature of Chilean foreign policy.</p>

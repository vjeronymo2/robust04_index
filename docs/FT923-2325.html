			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Saudi political reform move KING FAHD, the Saudi Arabian ruler, has given a further important nudge to a process of political reforms he began more than six months ago by appointing the speaker for a proposed new Consultative Council. The King yesterday named Sheikh Mohammed bin Ibrahim bin Jubeir, at present the Kingdom's justice minister, as speaker to the 60-member council which was announced, along with the promulgation of a new Basic Law for Saudi Arabia, on March 1. Mr Abdallah bin Mohammed al Sheikh is to replace Sheikh bin Jabeir in the justice ministry. Other members of the council, which will for the first time give non-royals a say in running the affairs of Saudi Arabia, have yet to be named. However, at least some of the 60 are understood already to have been selected. Sheikh bin Jubeir is an expert in Islamic law and held the post of chairman of the Grievances Council, a special court designed to expedite solution of legal, contractual and financial disputes. He also helped draft the new Sharia-based Basic Law. A consultative council was originally promised more than 20 years ago by the late King Feisal and the pledge was fulfilled only this year by King Fahd. The new body will have no lawmaking teeth, but would have the ability of summoning and questioning ministers, and would be able to hand legislation back to the King for review.</p>

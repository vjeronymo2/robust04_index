			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Risk &amp; Reward: SocGen's Boosts fail to convince competitors When is a new derivative product genuinely ground breaking? The launch last week by Societe Generale of Boosts, heralded as a new derivative instrument, was greeted with some scepticism by some of the French bank's competitors. 'At this stage in the derivative market's development, I don't think there are any genuinely new instruments, just variations on a theme,' said the head of options at one bank. But according to SocGen, Boosts - an acronym for Banking On Overall Stability - are fundamentally different. The concept is based on a stability band for an underlying asset, within which the investor expects the asset to remain for a set period of time. Every day that the underlying instrument remains in the band, the investor earns one currency unit. Thus if a one-year Boost remains within the set range throughout its life, the investor earns Dollars 365 (less the upfront cost of the product). If the asset falls outside of the range after 100 days, the investor earns Dollars 100 (again less the upfront cost, which means that he may or may not have broken even). The age of the Boost - the number of days spent within the band - and the life expectancy are the main components in pricing. Some derivative specialists argue the technology is the same as for a spate of Eurobond deals earlier this year known as range floating-rate notes. These floating rate note issues are structured so that interest only accrues on days when the three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor) falls within a specified range. In return, the investor gets a high margin over Libor. 'There has been a whole variety of instruments for buying or selling volatility,' argues one derivative specialist. There have been successful examples of embedding derivatives strategies in a security. For example, Swiss Bank Corporation marketed a series of securities known as GROIs (an acronym for Guaranteed Return on Investment). An investor could chose between having, say, a guaranteed 7 per cent return, in which case the maximum bonus - if the SMI index of leading shares on the Swiss stock market over the one-year term performed well - would be only 2.03 per cent. If he chose a 0 per cent guaranteed return, the investor could make as much as 24.72 per cent if the SMI did well. Indeed, several derivative specialists said that such trades have been done in the over-the-counter market, where they are sometimes known as time-trades. However, there are undoubtedly some novel aspects to SocGen's Boosts. Firstly, even if the concept existed, it was not available in the form of a tradeable security. SocGen plans to list its Boosts on European stock exchanges, and to make an active secondary market in the instruments, which may appeal to institutional investors who would not want to buy OTC instruments. 'No single security has previously been able to derive profit from a stable underlying (asset) during a given period,' said SocGen. A similar strategy can be constructed by using options to create 'straddles', 'strangles' and 'butterflies'. So far, Soc Gen has launched six different series of Boosts over one and two years on the D-Mark/French franc and dollar/D-Mark exchange rates and on 10-year OATs (French government bonds) and nine-year bunds (German government bonds). However, the structure can be applied to commodities, equities, indices and short-term interest rates. The remaining question is whether investors will want to buy instruments based on a stable outlook, at a time when markets are extremely volatile.</p>

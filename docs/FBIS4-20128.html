			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roland Gribben article: "Britain Is Wasting Its Time in EC </F> Says Young"]    [Text] Britain is wasting its time as a member of the EC,  Lord Young said in his presidential address to the Institute of  Directors' annual convention yesterday.    He made a stinging attack on the Community and urged  business  leaders to look to the faster growing economies in the Far East  where they faced less restrictions.    Lord Young, who chided the Institute for its criticism of  the  EC when he was Trade and Industry Secretary in Lady Thatcher's  second administration, asked his audience of 2,800 businessmen:  "What are we doing in the European Union?"    He added: "Largely, I suggest, wasting our time in inward  looking arguments about lost causes, causes like single  currencies and various forms of political union. Fiddling while  the Treaty of Rome burns."    Lord Young was pessimistic about the next inter-governmental  conference on the EC producing a "bonfire of directives" or  taking "an axe to the institutions of the Union."    It was more likely to give more power to bureaucrats in  Brussels, reduce democracy by extending qualified majority  voting and end up ensuring that the "good Brussels principle of  equal misery, otherwise known as harmonisation should be spread  across the entire Union."    He added: "We should be examining the work of the Commission  and the European parliament. This is probably our last chance  to wake up before the world passes us by."    The number of unemployed in Europe now represented the  "sixth  largest state in the union."    Lord Young said: "As their number rises, so rises all the  social tensions that we have seen in Germany and France the very  self-same tensions, fattened on a diet of unemployment that  Hitler and his like exploited so well some 60 years ago."    "As a result the greatest growth industry in Europe are the  parties of the extreme, whether of the Left or the Right."    He said the futile arguments over Europe were dividing  Britain. "With our obsession with Europe we see only the  stagnation and lack of will of our partners in the Union."    He said companies should turn their attention to the fast  growing economies of China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and  Singapore. By the turn of the century there would be 50 million  Asian households with an income of $30,000.</p>

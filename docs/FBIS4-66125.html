			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "10 Tons of T-4 Explosive Missing, </F> Mafia Links Sought"]    [Text] (ANSA) Chieti, May 19 -- About 10 tons of T-4  explosive, the same used in three car bombings attributed to  Cosa Nostra, have disappeared from the deposit of an explosives  manufacturer in Casalbordino, near this central Italian town,  police announced Thursday [19 May].    Two former executives of the plant have been arrested on  charges of unlawful possession of explosives, police added.    The T-4 explosives, used to make mines, were deposited at  the  plant by the Brescia-based manufacturer, Valsella, in 1985.    The National Anti-Mafia Directorate is investigating to  determine possible connections with the three car bombings,  which include the May 1992 assassination of judge Giovanni  Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in Palermo, Sicily. The  same explosive was used in the May 14 and July 27 1993 bombings  in Rome and Milan, respectively. Ten people were injured in the  Rome explosion, five were killed and 12 injured in Milan.</p>

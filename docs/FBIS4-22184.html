			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant-General Leonid Zolotov by </F> Aleksandr Oliynik, place and date not given: "Still on the  Agenda"]    [Text] The maintenance of military discipline and  order at a high level today, when the difficult process of  reform of the Armed Forces is in progress and a mixed manning  principle is being introduced, is a task of special importance.  The Chief of Staff of the Moscow Military District, Lt-Gen  Leonid Zolotov, tells how things now stand in this most  important area in the Moscow Military District.    [Oliynik] Leonid Sergeyevich, for the first time in recent  years the district military council, at which the problems of  military discipline and order were considered individually,  certified that the number of military crimes and incidents  decreased by a factor of one-and-a-half in comparison with 1992  in the units and formations, and that the number of draft  dodgers decreased by a factor of more than six. How was this  achieved?    [Zolotov] The short answer is that the entire spectrum of  problems of strengthening discipline and order in the units has  constantly been the focus of activity of the CINC, staff,  directorates, and services of the district. As required by the  well-known order of the Defense Minister of the Russian  Federation of 18 November 1993, we seek to ensure that work to  strengthen discipline and organization is not reduced to a  short-lived campaign, that in each military outfit an atmosphere  of high demands and responsibility is constantly maintained, and  that every violation receives a strict and principled  assessment. As I see it, this is the main reason for the  successes in our foremost units and formations.    For example, take the signals brigade where Colonel  Aleksandr  Semenovich Semakin is the commander. The conditions of service  there and the contingent of draftees are the same as in other  units. Perhaps even more signal troops have to work away from  the unit and participate in various kinds of classes and  tactical exercises. But despite this, in the last three years  there has not been a single serious incident there. In the  military council, incidentally, the CINC Col-Gen Leontiy  Kuznetsov analyzed the work style of this foremost commander and  stressed that educational work in the brigade is reinforced by  an exacting attitude toward the men with respect to regulations,  combined with concern for them. Colonel Semakin himself and many  other officers and warrant officers are models of  industriousness and discipline. Their subordinates see and  appreciate that.    [Oliynik] What difficulties and problems do the commanders  and staffs encounter in working to strengthen discipline and  order, and in particular, how does [this work] influence the  level of combat readiness?    [Zolotov] Today probably as never before it is important to  evaluate the status of observance of regulations not from  quantitative indices, but primarily from its real influence on  the combat readiness of troops, and on the quality of combat  training. Close analysis of the state of military discipline in  the district's units for last year and for three months of this  year showed that the level of organizational work of commanders,  staffers and educational structures unfortunately still does not  correspond everywhere to the provisions of regulations and to  the requirements of the Defense Minister and the Chief of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces. The military council and the  district staff believe that it is this task of raising the  disciplining influence of combat training, guard duty, work  details, etc. that has not been fully accomplished. In this  regard, I recall the words of the military teacher and leader  General M. Dragomirov: "Discipline comes from the sum total of  ethical and legal skills covering the entire content of the  military goals of the soldier." The chief deficiency is that  "the sum total of ethical and legal skills" is now by no means  achieved everywhere.    [Oliynik] Could you give a concrete example?    [Zolotov] Of course. In early March, Pvt. Sergey Komlev from  the Taman Division went AWOL from the unit and returned to the  Ivanov military commissariat which had drafted him. It was  learned that the soldier had been forced to seek protection at  home because he could not find it in his company. Here much of  the blame lies with the company commander Lt. Aleksandr Ebel,  who was indifferent and ignored the soldier's complaints about  headaches. The battalion and regimental staffs did not attach  much importance to this fact. Nor did the deputy commander of  the battalion for personnel work take the requisite steps. Need  it be said that such actions by some officers demean the  prestige of commanders and discredit military order itself?    [Oliynik] And how do you explain the fact that while there  is  some reduction in the number of crimes and incidents in the  district, their seriousness has increased?    [Zolotov] Yes, this is a difficult question, which  incidentally we also discussed at the military council of the  district. To speak the language of numbers, we unfortunately had  a 13 percent increase in the number of convictions for various  military crimes, although the number of their participants  decreased by 50 percent. We do not avoid blame for this, but it  is not only a question of us. It is well known what sort of  replacements we are getting now in the army. If we look at the  statistics, we can see that in recent years every second draftee  is not prepared for service either in the physical or in the  moral and psychological context. Who is guilty? The army? Every  third has serious health problems. The number of persons with  previous convictions and arrests has increased significantly.  Representatives of various unofficial associations, including  those of an extremist and mafioso bent, cause us a great deal of  concern. That is, all of the sores that afflict our society  necessarily create a heavy burden on the army as well. Here is  an example that has already been reported in the press. In the  Naro-Fominsk garrison, a solder from Moscow, Pvt. Aleksandr  Fedyunin, went AWOL from his unit. What prompted the soldier to  do this? It was learned that the notorious "hazing" had been  eliminated. There were no complaints against him either from his  commanders or from his comrades in service. Now he has been  arrested, and the prosecutor is investigating the incident. Of  course, everything will be found out, but it takes a lot of  manpower and resources, and people are pulled away from their  immediate obligations; not to mention the anguish this causes to  his parents and loved ones.    [Oliynik] In connection with the mixed manning of the  troops,  I would imaging a new problem has also arisen, the maintenance  of order among the contract soldiers. Now they number more than  seven thousand in the district, and soon there will be twice  that.    [Zolotov] You have guessed correctly, there are problems  with  discipline even among the contract troops. Judge for yourself.  Of the 7,360 enlisted and NCOs serving by contract in the  district units, the command was forced to nullify the contracts  with 1,266 of them within a month or two after signing,  basically due to lack of discipline and low moral qualities.  Despite all efforts, the commanders and staffs to this point  have not managed to ensure that the contract troops are true  professionals in military affairs, and serve as an example.  Analysis shows that educational and legal work with this  category of service members has still not brought the due  effect. What is more, in many units there have been sharp  conflicts with compulsory-service soldiers on matters of pulling  duty in details and guard mounts and in daily life. A whole  group of measures was required, involving careful selection of  people for contract service and adapting them to the conditions  of present-day military service. Perhaps in the future it would  be more advisable to man some subunits solely with contractors.    [Oliynik] Recently a meeting was held between the Patriarch  of Moscow and All Russia Aleksey II and the Defense Minister of  the Russian Federation, General of the Army Pavel Grachev. A  coordinating council for the resolution of questions of  cooperation between the Orthodox Church and the army was formed.  In your view, will this help to improve the moral climate in the  military outfits, and prevent law-violations in them?    [Zolotov] I think so. Now when many moral criteria have been  lost and ideals are blurred, as we work to educate personnel we  cannot help but use the rich moral and ethical capabilities of  the Orthodox Church and other religious faiths. For these  purposes, a special plan has been worked out in the units of the  district, aimed at close coordination of the units with the  clergy in the provinces. In particular, it is recommended that  commanders of formations and units define procedures for  arranging religious services for believers and members of their  families outside the military garrisons in their free time. In  the period of reception of the new replacements and on the days  when the military oath is taken, priests will be invited to the  units, and spiritual literature will appear in the barracks. In  short, we hope that reliance on religion will justify itself,  and in particular will influence the education of the men and  their moral qualities.    In conclusion I want to stress that the army, as our entire  society, has come up against a whole group of problems that must  be resolved within the framework of military reform. And the  strengthening of military discipline and order is one of these.  Much has already been done toward this end. But whatever the  successes, the question of strengthening discipline will never  be off the agenda, so to speak. Education is a continuous  process, and its ultimate goal is to bring the army together and  raise its combat readiness.</p>

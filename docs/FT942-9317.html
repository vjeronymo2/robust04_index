			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Gaza prison inmates relive horror of torture: Just hours after Israelis evacuate notorious jail . . . Palestinian inmates of the notorious Gaza prison, forced by Israeli soldiers to wear dirty canvas hoods over their heads, knew the geography of the jail by names which captured their torment: 'The Slaughterhouse', 'The Refrigerator', and 'The Bus'. Yesterday, hours after Israel quietly evacuated the prison in the middle of the night, several emotional ex-political prisoners swept through the corridors, spitting on freshly painted walls, banging doors, cursing Jews and reliving the painful experiences of their confinement. One row of murky, tiny cells were known by detainees as 'The twenties' after their numbers. Here, in claustrophobic 9ft by 5ft cells, up to six handcuffed prisoners awaiting interrogation had to sleep with their backs on the floor and their legs resting on the walls for several days. 'There were no windows and you never knew what time of the day it was. Even the smell was a horrible form of torture,' said Mr Taher Shriteh, a Gaza-based journalist who spent 38 days inside the prison for having a fax machine in his house which belonged to a leader of the extremist Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement. Upstairs Mr Shriteh showed journalists 'the bus', where blindfolded prisoners were seated in long rows on small children's chairs for days waiting to be interrogated by Israeli Shin Bet intelligence agents. 'You could hear people screaming and crying as they were beaten behind these walls in the slaughterhouse and everybody was very scared.' At another set of windowless rooms with just a small round ventilation hole in the roof, Mr Shriteh said Israeli officers would inject freezing air during the chilly winter. Before slipping out of the prison at 3am yesterday Israel whitewashed the building and broke down walls between cells to conceal the cramped living conditions. The prison was part of a larger complex of buildings which included Israel's military headquarters and functioned as a nerve centre of more than a quarter century of occupation. Before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war the compound was an Egyptian prison and headquarters, known as 'The Palace'. One room had the rusty chains and trapdoor apparatus of an execution chamber. Exhausted Palestinian soldiers from the Egyptian-based Ain Jalut brigades bedded down in rooms which just 24 hours ago had housed young Israeli soldiers. Hundreds of Gaza residents thronged outside the prison and pressed up against the gates to ask whether their relatives were among newly arrived Palestinian policemen. Palestinian security officers had difficulty holding back the youths as tempers flared. One teenager who was being questioned by plain-clothes security staff threatened that a new civil war would erupt if the policemen did not respect the 'shabab' - the youths who sustained the seven-year intifada or uprising.</p>

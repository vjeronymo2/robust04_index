			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Granada-LWT talks break down over bid price Talks aimed at agreeing an improved offer by Granada Group for London Weekend Television broke down last night, with sources close to Granada accusing LWT of being 'totally unrealistic about price'. This will prompt speculation in the London market that Granada will have to raise its hostile bid - a six-for-five share offer, now worth about Pounds 700m, with a 528p-a-share cash alternative. The talks were the first since Granada launched its hostile takeover bid two months ago. The sides had always seemed far apart, with some LWT executives suggesting privately that a 200p a share increase could be needed. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, the rental, television and leisure group, had sought the exploratory discussions with Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT chairman. He was seeking clues on what it would take to reach an agreement. Granada first approached LWT over the weekend, but Sir Christopher did not want to meet until after his final circular to shareholders went out on Sunday. The talks were expected to explore whether there was any possibility of persuading the LWT management, which owns 10 per cent of the company, to recommend a Granada takeover. Mr Robinson has until Sunday to improve the bid or declare it final. Yesterday LWT's share price held up better than Granada's, which fell 16p to 570p. LWT was unchanged at 705p. The issue has to be resolved by February 27 following the clearance of the Granada bid by the Department of Trade and Industry. The main condition is that combined advertising sales should account for no more than 25 per cent of total television advertising. Lex, Page 22</p>

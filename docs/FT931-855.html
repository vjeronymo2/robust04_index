			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Call money down again GERMAN call money continued to come down yesterday, following the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to cut the interest rate on its 3-day Treasury Bills, writes James Blitz. For the last two days, dealers have been divided over whether the 90 basis point cut in the T-Bill rate to 8.40 per cent signified a more aggressive attitude by the Bundesbabnk towards easing monetary policy. The rate cut bears have argued that the reduction in the T-Bill rate was a foregone conclusion following last week's cut in the discount rate to 7.5 per cent. UK clearing bank base lending rate 6 per cent from January 26, 1993 But there was a strong feeling in the market yesterday that the T-Bill rate had been holding up the floor for German call money. Hence the fall in the overnight cost of lending D-Marks yesterday from 8.45 per cent to 8.31 per cent. The June Euromark contract tracked the easing in rates, rising to a high of the day of 93.00, before closing unchanged on the day at 92.94. The easing in the T-Bill rate helped to dampen concerns which had arisen earlier in the week that the Bundesbank had left the the rate at which it offers short term funds to commercial banks - the repo rate - unchanged. Indeed, some dealers were arguing yesterday that the T-Bill move would raise speculation of a cut next week in the repo rate, currently at 8.25 per cent, and in the Lombard rate, currently at 9.00 per cent. There will be pressure to cut the repo rate, now that call money is approaching the 8.25 per cent level. One of the main reasons for the Bundesbank not to cut the Lombard rate has also disappeared - namely that call money was so close to the Lombard level that an easing there would have triggered 'round tripping' by commercial banks. Both Denmark and Ireland took advantage of the comparative calm in the ERM to ease official rates. Ireland cut its short-term facility rate by 50 basis points to 10.25 per cent. Denmark lowered both its deposit rate and discount rate to 9.5 per cent from 10 per cent. Sterling markets were almost unmoved yesterday, at the end of a week which has seen the futures market taking the view that 6 per cent base rates are here to stay until the autumn of 1994. Three-month money again closed almost unchanged at 6 1/8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ZIMBABWE LEPERS REMEMBER PROTECTOR  </P> <P> Sitting on a carpet of jacaranda blossom, under a broad avenue of spreading  trees in purple bloom, Thomas waves a bandaged arm stump across the Mutemwa  leper colony to point out his home.  </P> <P> Behind him, atop a steep granite mountain, is a tiny cross on the skyline, a  memorial to the man whose legacy this is, a murder victim who some say should  become Zimbabwe's first saint.  </P> <P> Brother John Bradburne of the Roman Catholic Franciscan order transformed  Mutemwa in the 1970s from a barbaric isolation camp of sack-clad lepers,  identified by numbers hanging round their necks, into a calm oasis of clean and  effective medical care.  </P> <P> In the words of Father John Dove, who took over the center after Bradburne was  slain in 1979, the Franciscan brother was "the eyes of the blind, the hands of  the fingerless and the feet of those who could not walk."  </P> <P> His name has since been surrounded by legends and talk of miracles. Some of his  Catholic brethren have asked for the former British army officer from Cumbria  in northern England to be canonized.  </P> <P> The cross on Chitoma Mountain was put up by an Englishman who recovered his  sight after praying for Bradburne to intercede for him with God when he found  he was going blind.  </P> <P> "People around here still revere Bradburne," Mary Hardwick, who helps run the  center, told Reuters. "There was a memorial service for him last year and so  many people came to pay their respects that a whole crowd had to stand outside  the church."  </P> <P> Bradburne carried on treating Thomas and his fellow patients after Mutemwa's  governing committee fired him in 1973, after four years, for refusing to hang  numbers around the lepers' necks.  </P> <P> The heavily-bearded Englishman moved to a tin hut on the mountainside  overlooking Mutemwa but every night until his death he slipped down the hill to  dress his patients' wounds by firelight, Hardwick said.  </P> <P> Respected by the lepers but unpopular with local people, Bradburne died at the  height of a bush war for independence in what was then the British colony of  Rhodesia.  </P> <P> Denounced to black guerrillas fighting in the bush as an informer because he  kept a radio in his tin hut, he was marched off for a summary trial in  September, 1979, released by the guerrilla leader but shot on his way home.  </P> <P> Thomas has been around the longest of the 60 patients who live at this trim  village of terra-cotta houses around a smart modern clinic, which was funded by  the Zimbabwe government and by Catholic donations from abroad.  </P> <P> "When I first came for treatment, it was 1939 and this place was still being  built," he said. "They treated me across the valley and discharged me, but I  had to come back again later to this new place when it (the leprosy) got  worse."  </P> <P> Hardwick said Thomas was so fiercely independent that he came to the clinic  only to have sores treated. With no hands or feet, he still manages to farm a  vegetable plot and tend his chickens and doves.  </P> <P> Nowadays, patients at the center are given a weekly package of groceries and  about $2 a month for spending money. If they work around the clinic, they can  earn up to $15 a month.  </P> <P> Those who want to can farm plots of land beside the center, not far from the  Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches that serve the little community.  </P> <P> Former patients who want to be resettled away from Mutemwa have land found for  them by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement. Mutemwa  provides them with plows, tools, seeds and chickens to start a new life.  </P> <P> Most of the patients at Mutemwa are "burned-out cases" who no longer have  active leprosy but need frequent nursing when their numbed limbs become  infected. About a quarter of them are from neighboring Zambia, Mozambique or  Malawi.  </P> <P> Only five are still being treated for leprosy, with a cocktail of drugs which  must be taken for a year. Since the use of Dapsone, the main anti-leprosy drug,  began on a large scale in Zimbabwe, the disease has been almost wiped out.  </P></p>

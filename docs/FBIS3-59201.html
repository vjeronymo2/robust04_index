The Russian premier, Ciampi said, is firmly convinced that  reforms will move ahead and asked for Italy's support to be  allowed to join the group of seven major industrialized nations.    Italy in July will host the G-7 summit in Naples and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin is expected to attend the last day's  session.    Chernomyrdin, Ciampi said, asked Italy to act so that the  G-7  may become the "G-8" beginning with the Naples summit.    As for reforms, Ciampi said he "heard with great pleasure a  clear and full statement assuring that reforms not only will not  move backward but will decisively move ahead."    According to Ciampi, it is "inevitable" that stabilization  and renewal processes have their "ups and downs and alternating  phases," but "the firm Russian determination is beyond question."    The G-7 summit, according to a joint statement released  after  the talks, will be "an important occasion" to make a progress  report on Russian reforms towards a free market economy and for  "a joint evaluation of international political events."    The statement speaks of Russian reforms as "fundamental" and  also describes Russia as having an increasingly important role  in "the construction of a new Europe."    The U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace, allowing Central  and East European states closer ties with NATO, was also  mentioned as a possible contribution to the creation of a single  security system in the European continent, under the umbrella of  the 52-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe.    Chernomyrdin also spoke of the conflict in former  Yugoslavia,  saying that all efforts to stop the civil war there must be  "peaceful and civil."    Ciampi and the Russian premier signed a political statement  and a declaration of principles that will form the basis of a  future investment cooperation accord, as well as a separate  agreement on the burial of Italian soldiers killed during the  Russian campaign of World War II.    Chernomyrdin on Friday will be received at the Vatican by  Pope John Paul II and will meet Italian President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro.</p>

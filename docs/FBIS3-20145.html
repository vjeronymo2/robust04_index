Eyewitness reports say the two men  are already well-known among German businessmen and German  Embassy staff in Damascus, the news magazine DER SPIEGEL reports  in its latest edition.    Carlos and Weinrich are alleged, among other things, to have  been responsible for the bomb attack on the French Cultural  Center in Berlin in August 1983, in which one person died. The  German Government requested the extradition of the two  terrorists from the Syrian Government in October 1992.    Recent questioning of returning German businessmen indicated  that Weinrich was still openly moving around the Syrian capital  in July 1993. The security authorities assume that Carlos and  Weinrich are still in Damascus, SPIEGEL adds. However, this has  been denied by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' to his  German counterpart Klaus Kinkel last week, the magazine writes.</p>

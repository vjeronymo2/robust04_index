			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Squeeze on public pay likely for further year: Budget wins mixed reception in parliament and markets THE government signalled yesterday that the harsh squeeze on public sector pay would be extended to next year as Mr Norman Lamont insisted that fiscal austerity offered the only route to an eventual recovery in its political fortunes. The warning came amid growing demands from backbench Conservative MPs that the elderly and the low-paid be given higher benefits to offset the chancellor's Budget decision to extend value added tax to domestic fuel and power. But during fierce exchanges with opposition parties at Westminster, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, refused to guarantee that those on low incomes would be fully compensated for the cost of the extended VAT. As the row over VAT and a fierce Labour attack on the government's 'broken promises' overshadowed an otherwise supportive reaction for the Budget from Tory MPs, senior ministers warned of the fresh battle over public sector pay. They said a new ceiling on all public sector awards would have to be imposed in 1994-95 if Whitehall departments were to meet Treasury spending targets. The ceiling would have to be 'very close to', if not below, the 1.5 per cent limit already applied to 1993-94. Nurses, teachers, police officers, and other public sector workers would then face a further real cut in incomes just as the chancellor's deferred tax increases - including higher national insurance contributions - began to bite in 1994. The political risks for the government were underlined last night by the decision of the Fire Brigades Union to press for strike action in protest against the present pay ceiling. The public spending squeeze has been tightened by sterling's sharp devaluation since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism, which has forced the Treasury to raise its medium-term inflation forecasts. That in turn means that small real increases in the so-called control totals for Whitehall spending planned in 1994-95 and 1995-96 have been replaced by a 0.25 per cent cut in the first year and a freeze in the second. But in an upbeat assessment of the medium-term impact of his austerity Budget, Mr Lamont said the squeeze on public borrowing through tight control of spending and increased tax revenues would lay the foundations for a strong recovery in the government's political fortunes. Mr Lamont said that taken with last November's autumn statement the budget had re-established the government's firm grip on economic policy. He denied that the Conservatives had broken firm pledges given during last year's election campaign. Mr Lamont strongly defended the extension of VAT to domestic fuel as essential to meet Britain's international obligations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But as the Commons social security committee prepared to investigate the measure's effect on low income households, some Tory MPs warned they would fight for a clear Treasury commitment to compensate fully those reliant on state pensions and welfare benefits.

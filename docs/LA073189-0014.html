			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Actor Billy Dee Williams defended his association with Colt 45 malt liquor,  saying criticism of liquor advertisements that target blacks is overblown. "I  think people are getting a little ridiculous," Williams said in Detroit after  making a donation to the Special Olympics. "When we don't know what to do we  start picking at anything. The whole focus should be not so much on the beer  but on how you lead your life," said Williams, a spokesman for Colt for several  years. Black leaders in Detroit, citing studies showing more alcohol- and  tobacco-related health problems among blacks than among whites, have been  sharply critical of advertisements for those products in the city. "I think a  lot of people are overreacting," Williams said. "You can't legislate morality."  Claudia Puig  </P></p>

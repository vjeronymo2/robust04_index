			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS NAMED TO TAYLOR RANCH PANEL  </P> <P> Ventura City Councilman Todd Collart and Community Development Director Everett  Millais will represent the city on a Cal State University committee that will  oversee the development of an environmental impact document for Taylor Ranch,  the council decided Monday.  </P> <P> The two were appointed after Cal State invited representatives from all 10  cities in the county, area legislators and community groups that support or  oppose the development of a four-year university at Taylor Ranch, a 450-acre  hillside bluff west of the city of Ventura.  </P> <P> Collart has remained neutral on the issue, which has brought a storm of  protests from those opposing the additional burden on traffic and water.  </P> <P> The university has so far received confirmation to participate on the committee  from state Sens. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Ed Davis (R-Northridge),  and Assembly members Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi  Valley), said John Smart, university vice chancellor.  </P></p>

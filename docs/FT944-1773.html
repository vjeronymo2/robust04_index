			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Scramble for Shanghai's prime sites: The authorities' disposal of the city's majestic waterfront properties Bangkok Bank is renovating No 7, the Bund, Banque Indosuez has signed a letter of intent to purchase No 29, and the Bank of China is repurchasing its old headquarters next to the Peace Hotel. After a hiatus of more than a year, the Shanghai municipality is moving on the disposal of the majestic properties on the city's waterfront, the Bund. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has indicated an interest in purchasing the most prominent landmark on the waterfront - the former headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. The SSE's expression of interest may prompt a bidding contest, as Hongkong Bank itself is keen to move back into its 27,000 sq m premises, now used as the mayor's office and communist party headquarters. The establishment of the Shanghai Bund Buildings Function Transformation Corporation has created a vehicle for the sale of 37 properties in an area the Chinese have taken to describing as Asia's Wall Street, although a revolution in the financial sector will be necessary to realise the dream of restoring the Bund to its former glory. At the same time, across the Huangpu River, on the east bank, work is advancing on creating a separate 'finance district' that will be linked with the Bund by underground railway, pedestrian tunnels, and bridges to create a central business district of Shanghai. Mr Zhang Zhe, vice general manager of the Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development Company, is confident that marriage between the old and the new can be effected to the advantage of both. 'The two banks of the Huangpu can help each other and pull each other forward,' he says. Lujiazui Development was formed in 1992 to develop a 1.51 sq km site in the Pudong development zone, including 69 buildings, among them offices of China's big specialised banks, insurance companies and investment corporations. A new securities exchange is also under construction, and space is being set aside for residential facilities. Mr Zhang estimates development costs for the site, including buildings and infrastructure will run to about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Of this, Dollars 1bn has already been committed. Twelve buildings are actually under construction, and 20 are in the advanced planning stage. The Lujiazui finance and trade zone, as the financial district will be known, will be dominated by three skyscrapers, including a Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation structure rising 88 floors. If the planners' dreams are realised, one of Asia's more remarkable developments will rise from marshy ground in place of a gaggle of decaying godowns, crumbling houses and the odd paddy field. Western bankers in Shanghai welcome plans to create a central business district spanning the Huangpu and envisage no great problems in the city creating a business core bisected by a big waterway. The Huangpu, which runs into the Yangtze near its mouth, accommodates an enormous amount of shipping traffic. Mr Fiepko Klug, chief representative in China of Banque Indosuez, sees no reason why the 'heart of the city' should not span the Huangpu 'like the left and right bank in Paris'. But in common with his colleagues from other banks interested in returning to their homes on the Bund, Mr Klug is extremely circumspect about prospects of securing their old properties, and even more reticent on the issue of price. Banque Indosuez, he says, has signed a letter of intent which is no more at this stage than an indication of an intention to discuss re-acquisition. 'We would see our return to the Bund as an indication of confidence in the development of Shanghai and in the future of China,' he says, 'but the final decision has to be taken on the basis of price.' Other organisations such as Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, eyeing their former Bund properties covetously, are even less forthcoming. Mr Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities, said there were 'political sensitivities' over the prospect of companies such as Hongkong Bank returning to their former 'hunting lodges' on the Bund, from which they were unceremoniously ousted after the 1949 revolution. Hongkong Bank is said to have been asked to pay between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m for its former headquarters, but there is also no doubt that the symbolic value of acquiring the property would be almost incalculable. However, Mr Wei Wenyuan, general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said its present location was insufficient for its fast-growing business. The SSE is at present operating from a converted former hotel, but is building a new exchange in the Pudong area. According to a Chinese news agency report, the SSE wants the old Hongkong Bank site to 'get a foothold on the Bund, which is to become the symbol of Shanghai as an international financial centre'. While the larger western institutions continue to play a game of cat and mouse with the Shanghai authorities over price and leasehold terms, a Thai bank has quietly stolen a march. The Bangkok Bank signed a 30-year lease in October, 1993 on No 7 and renovations are well under way. Mr Chalit Tayjasanant, chief representative in China, said negotiations with the owner, Chang Jiang Shipping, had been completed in a 'few months'. Facilitating the sale was the fact that the building was solely owned by the shipping company, avoiding ownership complications afflicting other properties. For most of the properties, the owner is the municipality, and complex commercial and political considerations involved in the sale of these historic sites have weighed heavily. Delays are attributable in part to an argument within the local government over the best means of disposal  - whether by auction, tender or private treaty. One awkward issue not being addressed in talks on re-acquisition, at least not publicly, is the curious happenstance that the former owners are being obliged to lease back, for substantial sums, properties that belonged to them in the first place.</p>

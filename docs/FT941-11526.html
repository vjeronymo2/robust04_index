			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Chubais sounds inflation warning Mr Anatoly Chubais, the only surviving radical reformer in the Russian government, said yesterday that the first-quarter budget would show whether Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, really intended to change the country's reform course. Unless the government managed, by adopting a tough fiscal and monetary policy, to reduce inflation to 5-6 per cent a month by the end of the year, rather than the 15-18 per cent mentioned by Mr Chernomyrdin at the weekend, economic reform in 1994 would have failed. Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister, vowed yesterday to stick to a tough fiscal and financial policy and to keep the budget deficit to 5-8 per cent of gross domestic product. Like the inflation figure, this target was agreed with the International Monetary Fund by the previous government. Mr Chubais, who has stayed in office to complete his massive voucher privatisation programme, also ridiculed a programme drawn up by veteran pro-market economists proposing price and wage controls and abolition of the voucher scheme. 'It's a long time since I've read academic work which is so far removed from reality,' he said. The report, commissioned to help the prime minister in his search for non-monetary methods to fight inflation, has apparently displeased President Boris Yeltsin, who has remained silent over Mr Chernomyrdin's policy 'corrections' but is expected to address parliament on economic policy on February 18. Meanwhile, Russian negotiators yesterday began a new round of talks with Belarus on the proposed currency union which has been the other main source of friction between conservatives and the radicals who have mostly left the government. After an outcry from the radicals who said an original plan to swap the Russian rouble for the Belarussian currency at one-for-one would hurt Russian economic interests, the exchange rate in subsequent drafts was adjusted to a more realistic rate of one-for-three. Outstanding disagreements include Belarus' desire for subsidised energy from Russia.</p>

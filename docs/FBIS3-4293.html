At a late evening press briefing on Monday [28 March] that  followed his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen,  Han said he was leaving later Tuesday for the United States to  discuss Beijing's proposal with Washington.    "We (South Korea) have not yet chosen between a (binding)  resolution and a (non-binding) statement," Han said. "We have  to weigh the pros and cons of China's proposal (for a statement)  and for this purpose, I am going to Washington, taking with me  China's position and explanation," Han said.    "The pros of a statement of the Security Council is that it  would be feasible on a consensus base and would leave a greater  possibility of a negotiated solution," Han said.    "China says that it will have more to do (in international  efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff) when there remains some  possibility of dialogue," he said.    In the United Nations Monday Security Council president,  Jean-Bernard Merimee, said differences between China, a  traditional ally of North Korea, and other permanent council  members, had bogged down UN action on the nuclear inspections  row.    "Certain delegations still hope for a resolution," Merimee  said, instead of a non-binding statement issued by the council  president, which China has said it would consider if the wording  were objective and mild.    Merimee also said he would meet with Han during his visit to  New York Tuesday, before Han heads to Washington.    South Korea has called on China to take a more active role  in  persuading North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. Han  indicated he was in favor of a statement as a first step in  order to ensure support from Beijing.    Last week, the United States pushed for a draft resolution  that would have pressed Pyongyang to give International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) experts unimpeded access to all its  nuclear facilities.    The U.S. move followed an IAEA report last Monday that it  had  been unable to inspect a radiochemical laboratory at the  Yongbyon nuclear facility outside the North Korean capital  Pyongyang. The U.S. draft text also called for IAEA Director  General Hans Blix to report on the situation again in a month.    China, however, refused to accept a resolution to pressure  North Korea, leading the United States and the other permanent  council members France, Russia and Britain, to consider a  weaker presidential statement in order to keep China on board,  rather than seeing it abstain on or veto a resolution.    In Washington, however, the United States sounded set to  drop  its call for a resolution in favor of a statement, if the  phrasing were right. Han arrived here Monday for a stop off  visit, before flying to the United States for talks at the  United Nations and in Washington then heading to Japan to  discuss the Chinese proposal and coordinate international  efforts to resolve the nuclear issue.    Answering a question about the results of President Kim  Yong-sam's meeting with Chinese leader Jiang Zemin here on  Monday, Han said the meeting had seen "the most direct and  straightforward" exchange of views he had ever seen. But he  denied that Bejing had suggested that Seoul was reponsible for  aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula with a  decision to deploy defensive Patriot missiles or to resume joint  U.S.-South Korean military exercises in response to the North's  rejection of nuclear inspections.    Kim said he would decide on when to start the exercises,  named Team Spirit, after he returned home Wednesday from China.    Jiang on Monday demanded that Kim to stop Team Spirit and  the  planned deployment of Patriots in order to seek a negotiated  solution to the crisis.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Bramalea offering fares poorly THE dismal response to a rights issue by Bramalea, a large but heavily indebted North American property developer, has underlined the severe loss of confidence in the Canadian and US real estate industry. Toronto-based Bramalea said that it had raised CDollars 76.4m (USDollars 64.7m) from the rights issue, compared with target financing of CDollars 115m. All but 120,000 of the 19.1m common shares issued were taken up Bramalea's parent, Trizec Corp of Calgary. As a result, Trizec has raised its stake in Bramalea from 66 per cent to 72 per cent. Mr Frank Graham, Bramalea's chief financial officer, said yesterday that 'everyone is basically nervous' about real estate investments. He blamed the poor public response partly on the troubles of Olympia &amp; York, the cash-strapped developer which is restructuring its debts. O&amp;Y has a 35 per cent stake in Trizec, which is North America's biggest publicly traded developer. Trizec's share price dipped by 37 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday morning to CDollars 6.63, its lowest level in two decades. Bramalea's operations, which range from office buildings and hotels to house-building, are concentrated in the Canadian province of Ontario and in California. Both these regions have been hit hard by the recession. The company suffered a CDollars 4.5m loss in the three months to January 31, and has long-term debt of about CDollars 4.8bn. It aims to reduce its debt by about CDollars 1bn over the next few years through disposal of properties, and is hoping for improved cash flows in 1993 and 1994 as economic recovery takes hold.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Clinton acts to head off revolt over cuts PRESIDENT Bill Clinton met his party members in Congress yesterday in an effort to consolidate support for his economic programme and head off a brewing revolt among conservative and centrist Democrats looking for more spending cuts and fewer tax increases. Mr Clinton has appeared rejuvenated by trips to Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico and California over the last 10 days to seek support for his economic package from the public. The latter, however, must wait three and a half years before they can vote for Mr Clinton again, while members of Congress have a more immediate opportunity to pass judgment. The Democratic leadership appears unwilling to jeopardise the president's economic package by allowing party members to tinker with its components, but they also want to avoid provoking an all-out rebellion by choking off dissent too fiercely. Mr Clinton has so far succeeded in keeping his plan more or less intact, making some concessions on the proposed energy tax and abandoning his efforts for an investment tax credit, but preserving the main elements he sought, such as higher taxes on the rich and cuts in many spending programmes. The work of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on the tax measures will be married today with that of 12 other committees on the plan's spending components into a single reconciliation bill, but some conservative Democrats want to amend the plan when it is debated by the full House. Perhaps 20 Democrats are thought unlikely to vote for any tax bill; it would only take another 20 opposed specifically to the energy tax, allied to the Republicans, to break the Democrats' 80-seat majority in the House. 'We need all the factions of the Democratic party to unite,' said Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House. If the plan cannot be preserved in the House, it would have little chance of surviving in the Senate, where the Democrats have a much slimmer and less disciplined majority. Leaders of the conservative and centrist Democrats, such as Congressman Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma and Congressman Tim Penny of Minnesota, are pushing for a measure to place ceilings on all entitlement spending, which includes medical and social security programmes. They argue that this is essential if overall government spending is to be controlled, since entitlements now make up half the federal budget. Critics complain, however, that across the board entitlement cuts would hurt the poor and needy. They also warn that the ceiling could pre-empt any savings from the reform of the health care system now being prepared by the White House, since medical entitlement programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest growing elements in the budget. Mr Clinton said after his meeting with the congressional Democrats that he was optimistic that his economic plan would pass, and would achieve much of the deficit reduction the conservatives want. Mr McCurdy, however, said the president would have to compromise because there were not at the moment enough votes to pass the bill. But other Democrats said the conservative rebels were seeking to cover their flanks with voters in their constituencies and would, in the end, fall in line.</p>

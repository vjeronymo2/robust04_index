			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Mohamed Lamine: "Despair"] </F>   [Text] Are Algerians--government, citizens, and political  parties--really aware of the drama being experienced by their  country? Are they aware of the extent of the tragedy that is  being joined to their daily lives and claiming so very many  victims? Are they aware that Algeria is marching resolutely down  the road to ruin and that we all--all of us without  exception--share responsibility for the slow death eating away  at a nation and country that nonetheless has what it takes to  experience a far happier fate?    People are dying in Algeria today for nothing. Most of the  time, they do not even know why they are dying. Or rather, they  do not know why they are being murdered, because crime in our  country has exceeded all possible and imaginary limits of horror.    Why must Algerians be sacrificed on the altar of rancor,  hatred, political ambition, lack of education, and ignorance?  Why should a girl who does not want to wear the hijab lose her  life on the pretext that she is not conforming to Koranic law  when big traffickers and the completely corrupt are  hypocritically using the precepts of Islam to enrich themselves  without being disturbed in any way? It must be said that Algeria  has become the country of every danger with its series of  murders, attacks, and political intrigues.    Some influential circles are doing everything they can to  increase the deterioration and maintain a situation verging on  explosion.    In the fog and the anarchy, big interests are being  preserved, and the people, who are suffering and cannot raise  their heads, must be made aware of it. Otherwise, how can one  explain the fact that practically everyone is talking about  "dialogue" at a time when an Algerian is dying from murderous  bullets on every street corner?    The picture is already very dark, and every day it is  growing  a little more apocalyptic. At this rate, Algeria is becoming  more and more like Sudan and Afghanistan. The fall into hell  seems to be planned.    But try telling that to the supporters of "the Islamic  state." They are bent on using force and terror to try to impose  a plan for society that is clearly out of step with the  aspirations of Algerians.    As though wearing the hijab would enable Algeria to solve  all  its problems.</p>

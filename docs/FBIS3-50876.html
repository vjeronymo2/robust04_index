According to EL NACIONAL, the Venezuelan Army intelligence  section detected a guerrilla column of no fewer than 50 men,  allegedly from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  (FARC), between Junin Municipality in Tachira State, some 600 km  southwest of Caracas, and Norte de Santander Department in  Colombia. Area residents confirmed the military report.    EL NACIONAL, quoting reliable military sources, added that  the presence of Colombian guerrillas was discovered during a  joint operation by the Colombian and Venezuelan Armies, which  led to the declaration of a state of maximum alert and the  reinforcement of border posts.    Likewise, the national press agency VENPRES quoted  Venezuelan  military sources as saying that some 10,000 Colombian guerrillas  are reportedly on the border between the two countries.    According to VENPRES, the rebels are responsible for the  intense "theater of war" over the past seven months, which  included an increase in kidnappings and cattle rustling  incidents.    Late last year five Venezuelan soldiers were killed in two  explosive attacks attributed to the National Liberation Army of  Colombia, which prompted angry reactions in Caracas.    As for the Venezuelan National Guard helicopter crash  yesterday in which two soldiers were injured, military spokesmen  described the incident as "a strong reaction by the Colombian  guerrillas to the active Venezuelan air and land patrols over  the southwestern border of the country."    Defense Ministry spokesmen, however, have not yet explained  the real cause of the helicopter crash. Some police spokesmen  say it was caused by a guerrilla attack, while Colombian  authorities say excess weight caused the crash and that the  shots were fired by the Venezuelan soldiers themselves.</p>

[Ichikawa] If we look back over the past seven months, we  must admit there have been many conflicts among the ruling  parties and between the government and the ruling parties.  These have involved such issues as the partial opening of the  rice market, political reform, tax cuts, and making financial  arrangements to cover the losses arising from such tax cuts.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, for instance, has  said one thing while Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has said  another, and both were expressing views on matters about which  the government and the ruling parties were only about to start  discussion.    It has been like having two prime ministers in the same  office. However, the government can be said to have cleared a  big hurdle now that some major issues have been resolved, and  Prime Minister Hosokawa thinks it is about time he did something  to improve unity in the cabinet.    [Correspondent] When do you think the reshuffle will come,  and how extensive will it be?    [Ichikawa] I think the reshuffle will probably come after  the revised political reform bills are passed. This reshuffle  should be considered the coalition government's finishing touch.  The size of the reshuffle will depend on what the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] wants. If it decides none of  its current six ministers should be changed, it will be a minor  reshuffle. As far as Komeito is concerned, we have no plans to  change our existing cabinet members. However, if other parties  in the coalition decide to change their people, we might think  about realigning the Komeito party lineup as well.    [Correspondent] Some coalition members have complained about  your alliance with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General  Secretary Ichiro Ozawa -- the so-called "Ichi-Ichi" duo -- which  they see as leading the coalition. What do you have to say to  them?    [Ichikawa] We had hoped that the SDPJ, the largest party in  the coalition, and the Sakigake-Japan New Party alliance, from  which the prime minister and chief cabinet secretary were  chosen, would become the axis of the coalition. But they have  failed to fulfill that leading role over the past seven months.  As a result, Shinseito and Komeito have had to play major roles  in leading the coalition. Ruling parties simply cannot put off  taking action on pending issues and then pretend these issues  have been resolved. So, Mr. Ozawa and I have had to make  decisions. Of course, we have also tried to take care not to  hurt the SDPJ too much.    [Correspondent] Within the coalition, people are talking  about a tripolar political power structure, which means drawing  a clear line between Shinseito and Komeito on the one hand and  the rest of the parties on the other. What do you think of that?    [Ichikawa] I think the idea suggests that Mr. Murayama, the  SDPJ chairman, and Mr. Takemura want the SDPJ and Shinto  Sakigake [Harbinger Party] to take the lead in running the  coalition and the process of political realignment. If Sakigake  and the SDPJ are willing to use their leadership and not to run  away from issues, we will be happy to follow them. But, in  order to exercise leadership, they must first undergo internal  reform so that they can agree on and adopt policies appropriate  for members of the coalition. I think the SDPJ should first  reform itself if it wants to bear the responsibilities of a  ruling party, rather than talk about a tripolar political system  or a realignment of political parties.    [Correspondent] When will full-scale political realignment  start?    [Ichikawa] It depends on the following three factors: A  strategy on how to organize political forces to fight the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; the selection of candidates to  run in the 300 single-seat electoral districts; and the date of  the general election. If the ruling parties fail to agree on a  future strategy to deal with the LDP, political realignment will  be delayed. If realignment proceeds without agreement within  the coalition parties, the coalition will collapse. We are now  in a dilemma. But by spring, when the new election law is  enacted and the zoning of electoral districts is settled,  negotiations to select candidates will start and at that time we  may be able to reach a cooperative agreement.    [Correspondent] What will be the main basis for the  cooperation?    [Ichikawa] It will be neither a choice between conservatives  or liberals, nor a preference for small government rather than  large. Instead, it will be the maintenance of the reform policy  line. Now that we have a new electoral system, we have the job  of giving life to the system and of seeing if it produces  representatives suited to government. However, there is more  reform work to be done, such as breaking collusion among  politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, and changing the way  the Diet functions.    [Text] [Correspondent] How will the ruling parties deal  with the simultaneous elections next year for local assemblies  and the House of Councillors?    [Ichikawa] As a matter of principle, the parties should  compete independently. In local elections, the voices of local  electors should be respected. In the House of Councillors  election, electoral cooperation will be possible only if the  parties can agree on a future strategy. In addition, the  parties should at least share the same position on basic  policies, such as defense and diplomacy, so as to be able to  jointly support the administration. If the SDPJ wants to start  talking about cooperation in the House of Councillors' election,  we will ask it to clarify, by July or August, whether or not it  still wants a tripolar system.    [Correspondent] The government was criticized for its  concept of a national welfare tax. How will reform of the tax  system be promoted in the future?    [Ichikawa] For one thing, discussion should be held openly.  We failed to do that this time, with the failure largely the  result of actions by a certain party. We will be criticized  once again for being abrupt if we do not hold open discussion of  this issue next time. As there is now, at the request of the  SDPJ, an agreement to set up a consultative body to discuss the  matter and reach a conclusion this year, the rest is up to the  SDPJ. If it opposes a new tax system or an increase in the  consumption tax, there will be no tax cuts.</p>

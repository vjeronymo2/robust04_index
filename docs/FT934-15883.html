			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finland moves to relaunch sell-offs FINLAND'S centre-right government yesterday moved to rekindle its faltering privatisation programme, saying it would shortly seek parliamentary approval to lower the limits of state ownership in five large companies. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said it intended to complete strategic plans for individual privatisation candidates by the end of the year, and hoped to begin the process of share sales in early 1994, at least in some cases. Despite making a commitment in principle to privatise when it took office more than two years ago, the government of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, has made little progress, held back partly by the deep recession. But a dramatic rally in the Helsinki stock exchange this year has greatly improved conditions. Under the latest plan, legislation will be tabled this month to allow the state to drop the level of its voting shares in Enso-Gutzeit, the forestry company, below 30 per cent from 52 per cent now. It will seek to lower the level in Valmet, the paper machinery group, to between 30 and 50 per cent from the current level of 73 per cent; the levels would fall to below two-thirds, but more than 50 per cent, in Neste, the energy company now 97 per cent state-controlled; in Rautaruuki, the steel company (87 per cent); and in Sisu-Auto, the truck maker (98 per cent). The Norwegian government is to reduce its stake in the arms-maker Norsk Forsvarsteknologi to 51 per cent through a public share issue in November, it was announced yesterday. Some of the shares will be offered to Statoil, the state-owned oil company, the engineering company Aker, and the shipowner, Braathens.</p>

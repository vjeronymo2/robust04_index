			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lotus in electronic mail acquisition Lotus Development Corporation, the Massachusetts software company, is buying Softswitch, a privately-held company based in Pennsylvania, for about 1.3m Lotus shares. The deal values Softswitch at just over Dollars 70m. Softswitch supplies electronic mail message switches that create links between electronic mail systems from different manufacturers. Mr Michael Zisman, Softswitch president, will become vice-president of a new Lotus business group, Inter-Enterprise Computing. The group will bring together Softswitch and a venture involving AT&amp;T called Network Notes, headed by Mr Larry Moore, vice-president of Lotus Telecommunications Services. Lotus, one of the largest US software houses, rose to prominence through the success of its integrated spreadsheet, 1-2-3. More recently, it has achieved significant sales for Lotus Notes, a groupware product which integrates messaging, forms-generation and document flow in large networked environments. Among the organisations using Notes is Andersen Consulting, a leading information technology consultancy. Lotus' marketing alliance with AT&amp;T is designed to broaden Notes appeal to large companies. Mr James Cosgrove, head of AT&amp;T's data communications services division, said recently inter-company networking and data-sharing were two of the principal trends driving rapid progress in computer net-working.</p>

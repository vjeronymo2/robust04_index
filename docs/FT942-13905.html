			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Babcock restructures energy side The announcement by Babcock Internat-ional of a fundamental restructuring of its energy division is a crucial component in the new strategy unveiled yesterday by Mr John Parker, chief executive at the engineering group since October. Behind the exceptional charge of Pounds 25m for reducing the division's overheads and manufacturing capacity lies an important shift in the balance of power from the manufacturing plant in Renfrew to the unit's headquarters in Crawley. Mr Parker made clear yesterday that this division had been the cause of the group's profit and cash problems. According to estimated results for the year ended March 31, the division lost Pounds 29.3m, compared with a profit of Pounds 11.2m. The loss excludes the exceptional charge, but includes the Pounds 15m provision on the flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire. It also includes additional provisions from 'the prudent assessment of the out-turn of contracts,' settlement of outstanding claims undertaken as part of Mr Parker's strategic review of the group and unrecovered overheads as a result of a lack of manufacturing volume. The clear message yesterday from Mr Parker and from Mr Nick Salmon, Babcock's managing director, was the need to 'fix energy'. This means that 450 jobs are to go at Renfrew, reducing the manufacturing workforce there to about 400. Financially, the aim is to cut manufacturing operating costs at Renfrew by 30 per cent or Pounds 11m a year. The reshaping goes much deeper, however. Mr Salmon wants to move the division away from a 'manufacturing-led' culture, where everything revolved around keeping Renfrew full, to a business driven by technology and engineering, and held together by project management skills. Significantly, Mr Duncan Cox, the division's new managing director, will be based at Crawley, rather than Renfrew. Mr Cox joins the group next week from Zurn Energy, the US boiler company. COMMENT A hefty right issue gives Babcock some financial muscle to weather the vagaries of international contracting, but at the same time the group is clearly signalling that there will be no repeats of Drax. Shareholders may now have to look on the rights issue, the restructuring of energy, and the exceptional charge as perhaps the only realistic way for the group to go forward - without the new money Babcock could not sort out the energy side and develop its good positions in the materials handling and process businesses. Only a die-hard optimist could be shocked that there is no final dividend, but finishing the year with net cash of Pounds 3.9m is a welcome surprise and a sign that the new team has grasped the nettle. Forecast of Pounds 27m for this year puts Babcock on a p/e of 15 on a pro forma post-rights basis.</p>

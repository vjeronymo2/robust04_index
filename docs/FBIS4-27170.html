			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Kwangju Broadcasting General Bureau] </F>   [Text] A ceremony marking the inauguration of the  second-term Korean Federation of University Student Councils  [Hanchongnyon] has been held in Choson University in Kwangju for  three days from 27 May. Contrary to the people's worries, the  event was held peacefully.    On the afternoon today, the last day of the inauguration  ceremony, about 30,000 Hanchongnyon students staged a rally of  resolution for clarification of the truth in the 18 May [1980]  incident at the plaza in Kumnan-no in front of the provincial  office building in Kwangju. They called for a probe in the 18  May incident and the punishment of the responsible figures.    After the rally, the college students staged a street  demonstration passing by the office building of the Democratic  Liberal Party and the U.S. Cultural Center. However, there were  no clashes between them and police.    The students, who attended the ceremony for Hanchongnyon  inauguration, held final rallies in Chonnam University and  Choson University after street demonstration. After the rallies,  they left for homes by buses.    The Hanchongnyon's inauguration ceremony, which started on  27  May, did not show any act that raises problem, such as excessive  demonstrations in downtown and attempt to contact North Korean  students through telephone or faxmile. Thus, the event showed a  drastically changed shape.</p>

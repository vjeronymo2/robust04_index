			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TROPHY DASH;  </P> <P> FANN AND BRIDEWELL, CANDIDATES FOR DIVISION II AWARD, WILL MATCH TALENTS WHEN  NORTHRIDGE PLAYS UC DAVIS  </P> <P> Walter Payton, Neil Lomax, Ken O'Brien and John Stallworth didn't receive their  share of recognition when they played NCAA Division II college football.  Neither did Harlon Hill, a wide receiver from Florence State (Ala.) Teachers  College. But like the others he made the transition to the National Football  League.  </P> <P> In 1986, in an effort to honor players from smaller programs, the Harlon Hill  Trophy -- the Division II equivalent of the Heisman -- was established.  </P> <P> Two leading candidates for the award, Cal State Northridge tailback Albert Fann  and UC Davis quarterback Jeff Bridewell, will meet tonight at 7 in a Western  Football Conference game at North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> Although both players downplay their desire to win the Harlon Hill, the battle  between two of the nation's best Division II players is likely to intrigue  fans.  </P> <P> Like Payton, Lomax, O'Brien, and Stallworth before them, Fann and Bridewell  have the talent to play in Division I.  </P> <P> Fann stuck by a commitment to Coach Bob Burt and his neighborhood university  after satisfying classroom requirements and renewing the interest of Division I  recruiters who had feared that he would not qualify academically under  Proposition 48.  </P> <P> Bridewell, a late bloomer, did not start at Napa Vintage High until his senior  year.  </P> <P> "If you don't start your junior year in high school it is hard to justify a  Division I scholarship unless you are just outstanding your senior year,"  Bridewell said.  </P> <P> While Fann has started since his freshman year at CSUN and has rolled up 3,390  yards in 706 carries -- he is 183 yards shy of the school career mark --  Bridewell's path to Harlon Hill candidacy has taken several turns.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-5, 220-pound quarterback redshirted his first year, then suffered a  broken wrist his second year and received a hardship redshirt. He was a backup  in his third year and was limited to four appearances and 100 yards passing.  </P> <P> In 1988, Bridewell's fourth season, he started and threw for 405 yards the  first three games. Unexpectedly, he was benched for the rest of the season with  the exception of a few mop-up stints.  </P> <P> Confused and disappointed, he considered transferring.  </P> <P> "I went so far as to talk to coaches at other schools," he said. "I thought  about it and decided that if worse comes to worst at least I have my  education."  </P> <P> Fortunately, for Bridewell, Bob Foster took over the Davis program the next  season and restored Bridewell's status as a starter.  </P> <P> "Everything's been going great since the coaching change," Bridewell said.  </P> <P> "I really didn't think it could get this good. I was hoping it could. When I  was really down, I was thinking that it could go from the very bottom to the  very top."  </P> <P> Bridewell threw for 2,731 yards in 1989 with a 63.3% completion rate.  </P> <P> "The way our offense is designed, if you run our offense right, you should have  a high completion rate and you should throw for a reasonable number of yards,"  Bridewell said. "It is just me executing the offense."  </P> <P> Bridewell attributes a paucity of interceptions -- 13 in parts of four seasons  -- to his sixth-year status.  </P> <P> "The best thing about me is that I know my limitations," he said. "I don't  force the ball. I only make the plays I am capable of making."  </P> <P> He ranks fifth nationally in passing efficiency and sixth in total offense.  </P> <P> In contrast, Fann has been slowed by a hamstring pull. Through three games he  has gained 218 yards rushing and 197 yards in kickoff returns.  </P> <P> "People say that (opponents) are stacking defenses against me, but our offense  just hasn't clicked yet," said Fann, whose hamstring has improved.  </P> <P> "It takes time to grow and I think we are getting toward that. This is the time  when I usually pick it up every year."  </P></p>

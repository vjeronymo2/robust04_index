			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Shipping side behind Global's 31% fall The recession-hit shipping side left pre-tax profits at Global Group down 31 per cent from Pounds 959,000 to Pounds 658,000 in the first half of 1992. Operating profits for shipping were halved at Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 806,000). Falling volumes at Goole and difficult conditions for the fork lift business were responsible. However the food activities increased profits from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 668,000. Canterbury Foods had an 'excellent' first half and the result for meat trading had been 'very satisfactory'. Group turnover in the first half for this USM-quoted company increased 7 per cent to Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 36.1m). Net interest payable was higher at Pounds 418,000 (Pounds 347,000). Earnings per share were 0.4p (0.59p) and the interim dividend is again 0.2p.</p>

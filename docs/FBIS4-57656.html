			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by David Aponte] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello declared that  international observers "are not necessary" for the coming 21  August presidential elections. The only factor that will give  credibility to the elections "will be Mexican society, no one  else," he noted. The chief of Mexican diplomacy explained that  the Secretary of Government's request to the United Nations for  electoral assistance and the current visit to the OAS, is an  "act of sovereignty" by the Mexican Government.    In brief statements before attending a Rotary Club meeting  in  Mexico City, Tello said the UN Electoral Assistance Mission that  will offer advice to Mexican nongovernmental organizations for  the observation of the elections will be here in response to a  direct invitation and does not attack the principles of  sovereignty. This mission will be led by Nguyen Huu Dong.    The same case applies to the OAS mission, composed of Pedro  Gordilho, from Brazil; Eduardo Ferrer, from Peru; Mario  Gonzalez, from Colombia, and Ruben Perina, from Argentina --  with whom "I met on Tuesday," he added. That organization's  experts -- invited by Arturo Nunez, director of the Federal  Electoral Institute -- travelled to Mexico to learn about the 21  August elections.    A reporter questioned Tello on the possibility of inviting  international observers to Mexico. The diplomat replied: "My  position remains the same: foreign visitors are not necessary."  Why do you think they are not necessary? Because of the  reforms that have been implemented and in the way the elections  are structured, because of everything that has been done in the  past years, specifically in the past months.    Horacio Boneo, director of the UN Electoral Assistance Unit,  mentioned that the main problem was credibility. Can it be  guaranteed that there already is credibility? It is the society  that grants credibility and no one else, no one but the Mexican  society, he replied categorically.    Later, the foreign secretary mentioned that the Foreign  Relations Secretariat (SRE) is analyzing an OAS proposal to  unite the diverse trade agreements in the Hemisphere for their  possible merger with NAFTA. In the coming three weeks, the  Mexican Government will make known its position on that  multilateral organization's initiative, which by the way does  not limit Cuba's participation, he indicated.    During the Rotary Club work session, Tello explained that  the  market globalization policies open the doors for new projects of  international association that are "unexplored and promising."  This could be the possible establishment of a hemispheric free  trade area.    "If we want to optimize the benefits that a project of this  type represents, we must guarantee that its design and  application are compatible with the principles of open  regionalism that would exclude unilateral actions. The  dissimilarities in the levels of development must be taken into  account and the effective distribution of the advantages among  all the participating states must be assured," he noted.    The Mexican Government has observed that the promotion of  trade exchange and the opening of the markets foster growth in  the national economy. "Nevertheless, we do not ignore nor do we  put to one side the persistent and lagging social drawbacks.  The undeniable benefits of free trade should translate into  greater well-being for the broad majority," Tello assured.    During the questions and answer session, a Rotary member  took  up the immigration matter with the United States: "What will  the neighboring nation achieve with the iron curtain along the  border?" Tello sarcastically said "absolutely nothing" because  people avoid the curtain or they dig or drill holes in the walls  constructed by the United States. "The SRE believes that both  nations should find a joint solution to the immigration problem  which will persist for many years and which could cause a  conflict of greater scope."</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASKET CONTROVERSY;  </P> <P> A CUT-RATE RETAILER IS DISLIKED BY FUNERAL DIRECTORS AND SHUNNED BY SOME  SUPPLIERS.  </P> <P> It is the sort of window display that stops you dead in your tracks: Soft back  lighting, discreet potted plants -- and shiny, open coffins with names such as  "Emerald Mist," "Lord's Last Supper" and "Going Home."  </P> <P> The windows in question are on Main and 9th streets in downtown Santa Ana,  where Hillmark Casket Gallery opened its doors seven weeks ago to a hail of  outrage from the funeral industry.  </P> <P> Sheralee and Kyle Nyswonger own the Santa Ana store and its sister casket shop  in Loma Linda in San Bernardino County, which industry watchers say are the  only strictly retail casket establishments in the nation. To the Nyswongers,  Hillmark is a way to make a living while helping the grief-stricken save money  at a time of great sadness and expense.  </P> <P> But to the close-knit funeral industry, the Nyswongers are virtually committing  blasphemy -- disrupting the tidy supply chain that traditionally links casket  makers and funeral directors and underselling the competition in the process.  </P> <P> Tempers are so hot that Ron Hast, publisher of Mortuary Management magazine and  a partner in Abbott &amp; Hast Mortuary in Los Angeles, likens the young  entrepreneurs to "wholesale butchers," and the nation's largest casket makers  are refusing to supply Hillmark, citing longtime policies of dealing only with  licensed funeral directors.  </P> <P> Buying a casket from the Nyswongers "would be like going to a restaurant and  saying, 'I want your chef's ability to serve fine meals, but I want to bring my  own steak, because I can get it cheaper at the butcher shop,' " Hast said.  </P> <P> In fact, when a consumer buys a casket at a retail establishment, most funeral  homes tack on "handling fees" of up to $1,000. Funeral directors, therefore,  contend that retail casket companies make dying more -- not less -- expensive.  But the handling fees are under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which  investigates unfair and deceptive business practices.  </P> <P> Nyswonger's response to comments such as Hast's is a shrug and a smile. After  all, she concedes, if the burial industry is in such an uproar, then she must  be doing something right. The Nyswongers sell their caskets for $489 to $1,530,  which she says beats funeral homes' prices by 30% to 40%.  </P> <P> She said she has already received about 100 requests for distributorships from  throughout the nation. And the 9-month-old Loma Linda store should bring in  $250,000 in sales its first year of operation. Nyswonger views these as good  indications that she was right to sell caskets instead of styling hair or  selling flowers.  </P> <P> "We work within peoples' budgets," she said. "I wouldn't want to have to bury  my husband and scrimp and save to buy him a casket. Services are expensive  enough. A full-service funeral costs $5,000."  </P> <P> By buying a casket at Hillmark, she said, a family can save in the neighborhood  of $1,000. "That's why we're in business."  </P> <P> Until 1988, Sheralee Nyswonger, 26, had spent most of her short career working  in florist shops arranging flowers and in medical offices processing records.  Kyle Nyswonger, 30, was the sales manager for an automobile dealership, a post  he still holds.  </P> <P> When the entrepreneurial spirit hit, Sheralee Nyswonger said they first thought  of more traditional businesses, but "we decided there's a hair salon or a  florist on every other corner." Processing medical records gave her some  knowledge of the costs of death to a family, she said, costs that she realized  could be lessened.  </P> <P> In addition, "people are more shopping- and price-conscious these days," she  said. "If they know they can get something at Price Club, they'll go there and  not to a department store."  </P> <P> It took two months for Sheralee Nyswonger to persuade her husband that they  could make a profit in caskets. On Nov. 11, 1988, the first Hillmark Casket  Gallery opened in Loma Linda. Its profits, she said, are bankrolling the new  Santa Ana shop.  </P> <P> But while she thought she was getting into "a nice, quiet business," she has  found out otherwise. On the Loma Linda store's opening day, she said, the owner  of a local mortuary stormed into the shop, demanding to know the identity of  Hillmark's casket suppliers.  </P> <P> "When my husband asked him to leave, he said, 'No,' " she recalled. "He left  when we were dialing the sheriff's office."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costs Tied to Caskets  </P> <P> Relationships with local vendors have been equally difficult. Casket  manufacturers traditionally sell their wares wholesale directly to funeral  homes. George Lemke, executive director of the Casket Manufacturers Assn., said  wholesale casket sales in the United States range between $830 million and $850  million annually.  </P> <P> Funeral homes mark up casket prices to cover a wide variety of operating costs.  Because the coffin is the major piece of merchandise funeral homes sell, many  tie all the overhead costs to the price of the casket, Jeanne Gilbert of the  National Funeral Directors Assn. said.  </P> <P> The markups are necessary, Gilbert said, because funeral homes do not recover  their operating costs through service charges on such items as chapel and  limousine use alone. Casket manufacturers will not divulge their wholesale  prices, and markups differ from establishment to establishment, Gilbert said.  </P> <P> "For an adult funeral, where a casket is used and there's a visitation, the  return is less than 10%," said Lemke of the Casket Manufacturers Assn. "The  average operating cost for a funeral home may be as high as $2,200 per adult  funeral. If a funeral director fully recovered operating costs in service  charges, the casket markups would not be nearly as high."  </P> <P> Because funeral homes are casket companies' major market, funeral directors  wield a powerful influence over their suppliers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Delivery  </P> <P> Inland Casket Manufacturing Co. in Riverside stopped supplying coffins to  Hillmark, Sheralee Nyswonger said, when local funeral directors found out about  the firms' relationship. "Funeral directors were no longer buying from them  because they were selling to us," she said. Peter Fishering, vice president of  Inland, declined to comment.  </P> <P> In addition, a Riverside trucking company made only one casket delivery for  Hillmark before pulling out. Ron Bredelis, owner of Inland Valley  Transportation Co., said his firm transports bodies for mortuaries and does not  usually deliver caskets.  </P> <P> "We did it one time," Bredelis said. "I had heard it was pretty controversial  with the funeral directors. Our business is not transporting caskets. We  transport deceased human beings. So I decided it was better for our company not  to do business with them."  </P> <P> Today, Sheralee Nyswonger removes all labels from the coffins she sells and  refuses to divulge her list of suppliers.  </P> <P> "I'm just so tired of getting beat up," she said. "The customers like you.  Everyone else just wants to cut you to pieces."  </P> <P> Other casket retailers have come and gone, and the funeral industry contends  that consumers have turned their backs on such businesses. Casket retailers  have blamed the funeral industry for their failures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Requires Price List  </P> <P> In 1984, the FTC enacted trade regulations demanding that funeral directors  furnish their customers with detailed lists that break down services rendered  and prices charged. The regulations also prohibit the funeral industry from  misrepresenting to customers the legal requirements for burial. Embalming, for  example, is not necessary under most circumstances, according to Ra'ouf  Abdullah, a staff attorney for the FTC.  </P> <P> The 1984 rules are under review, Abdullah said, and handling fees are at the  heart of the review.  </P> <P> "Some parties feel that handling fees are not a matter for the commission to  review, that it's a matter of the business discretion of the industry,"  Abdullah said. "Other parties believe that handling fees are a device to  inhibit competition in the marketing of caskets."  </P> <P> Hast, the trade magazine publisher and partner in a Los Angeles mortuary, said  his funeral home charges a handling fee "in the $100 category" if the casket  used is not purchased through his own firm.  </P> <P> "I have no quarrel with a family who goes out and buys a casket somewhere  else," Hast said. "Just don't come and impose your wants on a funeral director  for his chapel or embalming or other arrangements. Stay home and do it all  yourself."  </P> <P> It is that kind of attitude that has made life difficult for Willis Webb, owner  of Illinois Casket Co. in Chicago. Webb opened his coffin manufacturing firm  five years ago and sold his wares to the area's funeral homes. A year later, he  opened a retail outlet, and his sales to funeral homes dried up.  </P> <P> But he is able to stay in business, he says, in part because he supplies his  own caskets. In addition, there are so many funeral directors in Chicago, Webb  said, that "there's too much competition for them to solidify against someone  who's selling caskets to the public" by raising handling fees as a group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disliked by Directors  </P> <P> "We get repeat business from people who have used us before and come back," he  said. "But the funeral directors here totally dislike us and think we're the  most terrible thing in the world."  </P> <P> So far, the Nyswongers have been aided by the intense competition in the burial  industry in Southern California. Customers, they say, are the easy part.  </P> <P> One longtime Santa Ana resident visited Hillmark recently, shopping for a  casket for her ailing mother. When she buried her husband four years ago, she  said, she felt "raped" by the experience, by pushy sales tactics and high  prices. Hillmark, she said, "is so much more pleasant."  </P> <P> "My mother says, 'Go out and save what you can,' " the woman recounted. "She  says, 'You have to spend the money on living, not on goodbys. Get a price list,  remember the colors and we'll talk about it tomorrow. But no purple. And no  green.' "  </P></p>

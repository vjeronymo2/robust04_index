			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Jobs: What bosses' pay buys around the world - Survey shows country-to-country differences in rewards for winning promotion up the ranks 'WHY all the fuss, then?' The question, hurled at the Jobs column during a tour of contacts in the North-west of England, had two motives behind it. One was genuine curiosity about a topic raised all too frequently in this corner of the FT in recent weeks. It is the disappearance, perhaps for ever, of large numbers of executive jobs and the consequent plight of thousands of managers and higher rank specialists thrown out of work in the recession. The other motive was the rude provincials' constant urge to mock Londoners for assuming that whatever is happening around Britain's capital must also be going on throughout the universe. For the Lancastrians swore they'd scarcely been affected by the said phenomenon. Nor did they even try to hide their schadenfreude in doing so. All of which is a bit awkward for a hack who is not only almost one of their fellow-countymen (having been born 200 yards over the Lancashire border into Cheshire), but writes in an international paper. Can it be that most of you out there have been equally bemused by my essays on the dire effects of 'delayering'? I can hardly believe same is confined to south-east England. There is evidence that it is being heavily felt in the United States, for example. But I'd be glad of advice from readers elsewhere. M EANWHILE - to prove that the Jobs column has not become totally London-parochial - to the table below which gives pay indicators for non-delayered managers in 24 countries. As in previous years, the figures come from the surveys made by Employment Conditions Abroad, which keeps watch over pay and perks and so on around the world on behalf of some 700 international groups subscribing to its services. Anyone wanting more data thereon should contact Ian Luke of ECA at 15 Britten St, London SW3 3TY; tel 071-351 7151, fax 071-351 9396. My extracts refer to four ranks of executives in each land. They range upwards from a junior and a middle manager in a sizeable division of a group, to the head of a function such as marketing and the chief of the division itself. In each case the table gives two sets of figures. First comes the typical gross salary, including any bonus that is regular as distinct from varying with performance or the like. The second figure translates the salary into buying power. To calculate it, ECA starts by reducing the gross sum to net pay by deducting the tax and like charges standard for a native of the country who's married with two dependent children. The net is then turned into purchasing power by adjusting for price variances shown by living-cost comparisons. Unfortunately, because of problems in devising a consistent international measure of housing costs, no account is taken of that important outlay. Although the salary surveys reflect the position at the start of this year, the other currencies have been converted to sterling at the exchange rates in force at the end of the first week of this month. Since no information was forthcoming on the chief of the division in Japan, the countries are ranked on the buying power of the head of function. Inevitably, the figures are at best a loose approximation of the real state of pay. They are nevertheless as sound as any others available, and shed new light on differences between countries. For instance, in giving pride of place to Switzerland, the ECA findings clash with two separate surveys I reported in May and June, both showing the Swiss had fallen behind the Spanish, French and Germans. That may well be because the other two covered higher ranks, including chief executives, and took account of variable bonuses besides salaries. One rare feature of ECA's study is that it reflects country-to-country variances in the extra buying power typically gained by winning promotion through the four ranks listed. The greatest reward for same is in Hong Kong, whose division chief is nearly 3 1/2 times as well off as the junior manager. The least is in Norway, with a differential between the two of only about 75 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MISSING TEENS FOUND SLAIN IN JERUSALEM;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: BODIES OF TWO JEWISH YOUTHS ARE DISCOVERED NEAR AN ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD.  ANGRY CROWDS SEEKING VENGEANCE BEGIN STONING PALESTINIANS.  </P> <P> The bodies of two slain Jewish teen-agers missing since Saturday were found  today near an Arab neighborhood, triggering revenge stonings of Palestinian  vehicles by crowds of angry Jews.  </P> <P> The bodies of Lior Tubul, 17, and Ronen Karamani, 18, were found in a valley in  northern Jerusalem between the Arab neighborhood of Beit Hanina and Ramot,  where they lived.  </P> <P> The two boys had been bound, gagged and stabbed in the back many times, police  said.  </P> <P> "There is no reason to believe it was for anything but nationalistic reasons,"  Police Commissioner Ya'acov Turner said. "There is no clear-cut evidence. But  there are no obvious explanations why they would be murdered for any other  reason."  </P> <P> Police said that many Arabs had been detained for questioning, but that they  had no suspects. Police put Beit Hanina under curfew and searched the area.  </P> <P> Turner urged calm, but crowds of angry Israeli Jews quickly gathered on roads  in southern Jerusalem and stoned Palestinian cars from the Israeli-occupied  West Bank. Three Palestinians riding in a bus were slightly injured by rocks,  police said.  </P> <P> At least 15 cars were stoned and a van set on fire, police said.  </P> <P> "We turn to the public to stay cool and to let us do our work," Turner said.  </P> <P> The killings, immediately denounced by Israelis as an act of terrorism, came  nine days after a 17-year-old Jewish Canadian tourist was killed by a pipe bomb  on a Tel Aviv beach.  </P> <P> The killing of the two Jerusalem teen-agers was deplored by leaders across the  political spectrum.  </P></p>

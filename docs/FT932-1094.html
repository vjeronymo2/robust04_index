			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Decision greeted with allegations of betrayal The dockyards decision, although widely expected, was greeted with deep disappointment and allegations of betrayal in Scotland. There was scepticism about whether the government's pledges to Rosyth would give it a secure future and whether the new arrangements would be acceptable to the navy. Mr Colm McConnell, secretary of the Institution of Professional Managers and Specialists at Rosyth, said: 'We will see the Navy having another mutiny and demanding service work returned to the south. 'There is no way we can see the Navy accepting these vessels coming away from their base ports, some of them for a year.' The Babcock Thorn management may find that their predictions of thousands of job losses if Rosyth lost the Trident contract may not be fulfilled. However, Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, which runs Rosyth Royal dockyard, condemned Mr Rifkind's announcement as the wrong decision. He believed that Rosyth's last minute proposal, in which it cut the cost of the refitting by Pounds 70m, was the best way ahead. 'Quite clearly our bid was a better bid', Mr Smith said. But he insisted that there was not now a question mark over Rosyth's survival; the surface warship commitment the government had given was more substantial than expected, he said, thanks to two years of campaigning on behalf of Rosyth. Rosyth now had to change from nuclear submarine refitting. 'We must accept the challenge,' he said. But he added:'I still think it's the upside down solution. I don't think there's much logic in what they have done.' Mr Smith accepted that Devonport might try to close Rosyth by vigorous competition, but he insisted that Rosyth would gain such expertise in surface refits in the coming eight years that it would have the greater expertise of the two yards. 'I accept we are going to have difficulty in the long term maintaining our position against competitors', he said. 'We will make the best of what we have and I think there's an opportunity'. Mr John MacDougall, leader of Labour-controlled Fife Regional Council, said the council had grave doubts that Rosyth could survive in the long term with surface ship refitting alone. 'Rosyth is geared to submarine refitting. Devonport is geared to surface work. Swapping roles could mean an immense cost to the taxpayer.' He said there were vital links missing from the package. The 450 job losses predicted by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is much less than the thousands forecast by the management. But the loss of submarine work will be a grave blow to the dockyard's business, which work on surface ships may not offset fully. Submarine work is much more valuable and labour intensive than other work. At present, submarine work makes up about half of the Pounds 160m turnover of the Babcock Thorn consortium, with the rest provided by surface ships and work for the private sector, the latter alone making up 20 per cent of sales. Rosyth employs 3,700. Mr Smith said this could fall to 1,500 within two years and could easily drop to 1,000, even if the submarines were replaced by surface ship work. Any rundown will affect the rest of the economy of Fife and eastern Scotland because the dockyard and the adjoining naval base (also running down) generate Pounds 380m a year to the Scottish economy and directly or indirectly supports 18,000 people, of whom 11,000 are in Fife. The yard generates about Pounds 30m of purchases among companies in Scotland, excluding direct purchases by the Ministry of Defence. In 1992 the company's wage bill was put at Pounds 100m, of which 86 per cent went to people living in Fife. Shops, hotels, restaurants, public houses and taxi firms will suffer. The yard deals with 800 companies in Scotland and the effect of its rundown would be spread beyond Fife across the Firth of Forth into the Edinburgh area, and further afield to the Glasgow area. It employs half of Scotland's engineering apprentices. The unions questioned how the dockyard could possibly maintain its current 3,700 employees in the light of yesterday's announcement. 'It's a slow, lingering death,' said Mr Brian Negus, chairman of the Rosyth industrial unions. The Rifkind promise, he said, amounted to one and a half ships a year and Rosyth would find it very hard to compete against Devonport, which would seek to undercut it. Mr Colm McConnell, secretary of the Institution of Professional Managers and Specialists at Rosyth, dismissed Mr Rifkind's promise of surface vessels as a 'sop' to get the government off a political hook. 'We don't believe the guarantees spelt out by Rifkind will come to fruition,' he said.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): First, identify the right tiger . . . - In the Pink / How investors should approach Asia David Roche, an expert on the emerging markets of south-east Asia, is president of Independent Strategy, a new investment research boutique The Asian boom is now a cliche. It is such a well-worn story that it will not drive financial markets. What matters now is how Asia handles the many hurdles to the next stage of development. How will these economies handle the flood of capital that is coming their way? Many suffer from the vice of excess virtue. As foreign money hits them, their domestic liquidity rockets. To control liquidity, they could raise interest rates. If they do, more foreign capital flows in. If rates are lowered, the inflows turn into unsustainable levels of demand. The answer is to let their currencies appreciate. Can the new Asian tigers dismantle the many domestic structural impediments to growth? Many have crassly inefficient domestic service sectors, particularly in finance, agriculture and utilities. Some, like China, have such poor banking systems and warped mandatory savings schemes that it is a moot point whether high domestic savings (35 per cent of GDP) can be matched with investment opportunities. Asia is rather like a train being driven from the front by the hi-tech economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, and from the rear by the super-cheap producers of basic commodities like China, India and Vietnam. Asian economies now do over 40 per cent of their external trade with each other, which means they act as catalysts to each others' development. What Thailand was competitive at producing last year, China is better at this year. So Thai exports of textiles, shoes and toys fall while China's rocket, and Thailand must move along the train to a new carriage that produces more high-tech products. The right way to shift economic gear from basic to high-tech products is to let the currency rise. The alternative, and more damaging, choice is to let domestic inflation price countries out of making traditional products. Most Asian governments have yet to choose. Only Singapore has done the right thing convincingly. Asia is reaching its limits to growth. Published inflation figures do not provide a good measure of over-heating in the region because many governments control many prices (hardly a measure of a commitment to free market economics) and then doctor the index. Nevertheless, inflation is creeping towards the upper limit in most countries. Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia are virtually out of labour. Thailand, too, is short of skills. Hong Kong and urban Malaysian property prices are just another financial bubble driven by excess liquidity and silly low interest rates. The biggest challenge comes from the increasing 'sameness' of the growth models in the region. The old model of Asian growth is over. The Korean and Taiwanese economic model was based on fear and reality of war. The over-riding economic principle was self-sufficiency. Japan's post-war leap was based similarly, but without the external threat. Economic strength was built with the bricks of huge trade surpluses, massive domestic savings rates, and making sure they grew enough food, irrespective of cost. Today, the result is a tangle of protectionist practices, internal as well as external. The old tigers' growth was often at the expense of world growth because the trade and capital surpluses were kept in their domestic economies and not recycled through imports or outward investment. At present, Japan acts as a global vacuum cleaner of the world's money pile, accumulating current and capital account surpluses, flogging the dollars it takes in, and keeping the capital at home as excess savings. But the new tigers such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia have a completely different growth model. Their economies are far more open to the world and they invest more than they save; inward international investment can be as high as 6 per cent of GDP. International trade accounts for a quarter of Korea's GDP and only a tenth of Japan's, but it makes up three-quarters of Malaysia's. The result: their internal growth adds to world growth rather than detracts from it. China's model is more like the new tigers than the old. Its leaders will squeeze every last drop of juice from the fruit of growth straight into the glass of its 1.2bn consumers - because they know that, otherwise, their rule will end. Asia will be the particle accelerator of world trade, too. Within two years, I think the biggest trade deficits for both the US and Europe will be with China and not, as today, with Japan. That is as it should be. But the rich countries will not allow China such a big slice of their prosperity for nothing. China and the rest of Asia will have to harmonise their economic models and liberalise for reasons of trade and efficiency. That will make for many losers among cosy government contractors, over-blown banks, and overstaffed public utilities and food companies. The major winners will be those countries that make the leap to high-tech from low value-added products and stocks connected with this process. The electronic stocks of Taiwan, Singapore and Korea are examples. Indonesia should do well as a supplier of commodities and as a country with labour costs below southern China. I would focus on infrastructure development and forest products out there. Selected China B (Shanghai) shares are cheap. They are in for a rough ride from currency depreciation and Deng's eventual demise, but I would still put them away in my retirement portfolio. In the shorter term I think Japanese blue chip industrials will see their profits boom as the yen declines and the productivity gains of moving plant to Asia come through. They would be my big blue chip bet for next year. India and Pakistan are just a bit too fashionable for my liking. Those countries that fail to take the right steps will lose, and lose big. The investment challenge will be to identify which Asian economies can adapt best and move up the production train. That is the story that will make investors more money than the Asian growth cliche.</p>

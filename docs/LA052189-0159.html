			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUESTION OF GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS  </P> <P> The Bible-beating smugness snaking many of the faces last Monday night at the  Santa Ana City Council chambers underscored why I rooted for Orange County  Cultural Pride from the Council members' breezeway.  </P> <P> I grew up in Cypress next door to a family of three girls and two boys headed  by a lesbian couple named Elaine and Linda. They were nice women raising decent  children who all turned out heterosexual. I attended Bible school with the  children. I learned respect for the women from my parents. Unfortunately, a  conspiracy of silence bubbled in my neighborhood. Elaine and Linda felt  compelled to identify themselves as biological sisters in the face of contrary  evidence. Most of the adult neighbors supported the lie by changing the subject  when questioned by their own children.  </P> <P> Out of respect for their privacy, Elaine and Linda are pseudonyms. This plus  their presentation of themselves as siblings stems from having swallowed  intolerance and bigotry -- the rigidity masqueraded by Christian Alert and its  cohorts as "traditional values."  </P> <P> Christian Alert and its ilk assume that lesbians and gays are "sodomites" and  that a pride festival would misrepresent the community. I beg to differ. As a  board member of the county's lesbian and gay hot line, I have found that 96% of  all the callers seek alternatives to the bar scene.  </P> <P> Clearly the interests of Santa Ana's gays and lesbians -- as well as those of  their brothers and sisters in Orange County's 27 other cities -- reach far  beyond the bedroom. They are taking responsibility for themselves! They look to  OCCP to promote the facts on all aspects of their lives. They can do without  the kind of falsehood-breeding which sent my neighbors Elaine and Linda into  hiding more than 20 years ago, and which still prevents self-acceptance for  thousands of homosexual women and men today.  </P> <P> KELLI BOND  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Economics: Strike vote may affect interest rates THE GERMAN wage round will continue to attract attention this week, with markets looking to Friday when the result of the steel strike ballot will be announced. With the Bundesbank keen to see a reduction in inflationary pressures, settlements in the wage round will influence the decision whether to reduce German interest rates, a move that could lead to lower borrowing costs across Europe. The steel section of the IG Metall union needs a 75 per cent vote in favour to call the industry's 135,000 workers out on strike. After last week's dismal industrial output figures for the UK, the markets will focus on today's trade and current account figures and on the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly trends survey published tomorrow. City predictions of an Pounds 800m visible trade deficit in December would bring the deficit for 1991 to around Pounds 10bn - less than for 1990, but, in the view of some, worryingly high for a country deep in recession. Recent CBI surveys have pointed to weakening expectations of economic recovery, after some improvement in the early autumn. In the US, President Bush will tomorrow unveil his plans for a fiscal growth package in his State of the Union address. These are likely to include measures to encourage jobs, investment and savings. The economic highlights of the week are as follows. The median of City forecasts, provided by MMS International, a business information company, are in brackets.

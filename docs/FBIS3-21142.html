This, in combination  with the technology for concentrating NO[.sup]X[/] and  carrying out absorption and desorption that is being developed  by the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Osaka  Prefecture (Shiro Akita, head), is aimed at construction of an  NO[.sup]X[/]removal system for automobile tunnels, etc. The  development of this system is being pushed forward by Prof. Anpo  and the Industrial Technology Research Institute under  consignment from the Osaka Prefecture Coordinating Council for  Global Environmental Problems, and the outlook is for its  becoming practical in two years.    When a catalyst in which copper ions are fixed to zeolite  (ZSM5) is vacuum exhausted at high temperatures, the copper ions  are reduced. Anpo et al. conditioned an new optical catalyst in  which these reduced ions are fixed to zeolite. When this optical  catalyst has absorbed NO[.sup]X[/] and was exposed to light,  the NO[.sup]X[/] was separated into oxygen and nitrogen.  Attention has been drawn to the fact that catalysts in which  copper ions are carried by zeolite can directly separate  NO[.sup]X[/], but in such cases high temperature heating is  necessary. The main feature of this optical catalyst is the  direct separation of NO[.sup]X[/] at room temperature.    In NO[.sup]X[/] removal systems, after the exhaust is  sucked up by fans and absorbed and concentrated using activated  carbon, it is heated and desorbed. The desorbed NO[.sup]X[/]  is transferred to a separation unit that uses the optical  catalyst and purified through separation into and discharging of  nitrogen and oxygen. Development is being promoted with the goal  of making a single practical unit that combines these operations  within two years.    In addition, the idea is to install this system in road  tunnels and the like, but it is also theoretically possible to  install them as exhaust processing systems for automobiles, such  as busses and trucks, that have diesel engines; if small sized  systems can be made, these can be seen as becoming practical.</p>

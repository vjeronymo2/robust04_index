			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Redland to list in Frankfurt after strong German result Redland, the large British building materials group, is to seek a listing on the Frankfurt stock exchange after announcing a 40 per cent rise in German profits in the first half of this year. Germany accounted for half of operating profits of Pounds 157m and 26 per cent of turnover of Pounds 1.27bn. Redland's share price, however, fell 5 per cent yesterday in spite of a 36 per cent rise in group pre-tax profits to Pounds 147.4m. The 29p decline in the share price, to 493p, came after Redland revealed that a higher than expected tax charge of 33.3 per cent in the first half could climb to 35 per cent next year with higher German taxes. Mr Robert Napier, chief executive, said the planned listing would let German shareholders invest in Redland more efficiently. Shares acquired in Frankfurt would be accompanied by profit participation certificates enabling dividends to be paid out of German earnings. Under German tax arrangements, local shareholders would receive 25 per cent more on average from dividends paid in this way, after deductions, than under present arrangements, Mr Napier said. Redland is paying a maintained interim dividend of 8.25p on first-half earnings per share up from 11p to 12.9p. So far, there has been no easing in demand from the German housing market where sales have been boosted by repairs to east German homes and accommodation demands from large numbers of immigrants. Housing permits, one of the best guides to future prospects, increased by 18 per cent in western Germany and 77 per cent in eastern Germany in the first half of this year, said Redland. The company owns 51 per cent of Braas, Germany's largest roof tile manufacturer, which generates a fifth of its sales in eastern Germany. The UK, which increased operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 19.2m, accounted for 12 per cent of group profits and 21 per cent of turnover in the first half. The UK figures were helped by higher sales and prices for many building materials. Overseas profits rose by a quarter from Pounds 95.2m to Pounds 119.7m assisted by an improvement in continental European housing markets. French profits recovered from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 6.6m. The contribution from other continental European countries rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 26.5m. US profits, however, fell from Pounds 19m to Pounds 16.1m because of poor winter weather in Maryland, and a reduced contribution from Florida where roofing sales last year had risen sharply after Hurricane Andrew.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Japanese cabinet Friday  [27 May] approved the itinerary for Emperor Akihito and Empress  Michiko's June 10-26 visit to the United States.    The ambitious schedule will take the imperial couple to 11  cities for visits with President Bill Clinton, UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and two former presidents, among  other people.    The trip will also include visits to a number of historical,  cultural and natural sites but notably will exclude a visit to  Pearl Harbor, the site of Japan's surprise attack on U.S. forces  there December 7, 1941.    The government dropped plans last week to visit the USS  Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from  conservative scholars and critics, who fear the emperor would be  expected to give an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S.  into World War II.    Instead, the imperial couple is scheduled to visit the Punch  Bowl National Cemetery to lay a wreath in memory of the dead of  the war in the Pacific.    The emperor and empress will embark on their trip June 10  for  Atlanta where they will meet former U.S. President Jimmy Carter  and the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King.    During a three-day stay in Washington, the imperial couple  will be hosted as state guests by the Clintons, will attend a  concert and reception at the Kennedy Center, and visit the  Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.    Their schedule also includes a visit to the United Nations,  a  major league baseball game in St. Louis, a visit to the Rockies  and a meeting with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan before  going to Honolulu on June 10.    In 1960, then Crown Prince Akihito visited Pearl Harbor. The  late Emperor Hirohito traveled to the island of Hawaii in 1975  as part of his American tour but did not go to Pearl Harbor.    The imperial couple is scheduled to return to Japan on June  26.    The emperor's entourage will include former Prime Minister  Kiichi Miyazawa. The entire trip will cost some 190 million yen.</p>

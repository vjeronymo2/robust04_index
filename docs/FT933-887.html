			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Private pay rises 'set to near 4%' AVERAGE annual private-sector wage rises could approach 4 per cent by the early months of 1994 if modest economic growth continues, making it more difficult for the government to restrain public-sector pay increases. This is the main forecast of the independent body Incomes Data Services in its survey of pay and bargaining prospects for the 1993-94 pay round, published today. It says the growing divergence between pay in the private and the public sectors will 'create a great deal of catch-up pressure by 1995'. It suggests that if growth is not sustained because of Continental recession 'we may have a new period of difficulty with awkward decisions for pay negotiators'. IDS believes that the retail prices index will be rising at about 4 per cent a year by early 1994 - affected by inflationary measures which may be announced in the November Budget, the dropping of last winter's mortgage rate cuts from the annual measure and increases in taxation and value added tax next April. 'On balance, upward pressures on pay are expected by many private-sector negotiators to outweigh downward pressures,' says the report. 'There is not only concern about the anticipated rise in inflation next year but also that employee expectations will rise if recovery is firm and profitability grows.' The survey adds that the unions are 'worried about the effect on net pay next April when tax and national insurance increases come into effect. Without doubt, the government's clampdown on public-sector pay will be challenged by such upward pressures.' The report claims that the inflation rate remains 'a dominant consideration in most pay negotiations or awards'. IDS points to a number of important private-sector forward commitments in pay that will produce rises of 3 to 4 per cent. Nissan car company is due to pay its workers 3.5 per cent rises in January with Peugeot Talbot committed to paying at least the same rate. The survey says that private-sector employers see 'employee morale and motivation as crucial after a prolonged period during which living standards for many have been restrained or fallen back.'

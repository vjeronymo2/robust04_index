			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Manders sells paint side for Pounds 55m In a sharp, sudden and, in the words of Mr Roy Amos, chairman, 'emotional' change of strategic direction, Manders has sold its decorative paints division to Johnstone's Paints, a subsidiary of Total Oil Holdings of France, for Pounds 55m cash. Last Thursday the Wolverhampton-based group announced that it had bought the printing inks and graphic supplies business of Croda International for Pounds 26.7m cash. Friday's sale will all but wipe out Manders' borrowings. Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, said in a statement that the recent rationalisation of the UK decorative paint industry (with the acquisition by Akzo, the Dutch group, of Crown) had limited the potential for growth in that part of the group's business. There had also been consolidation within the printing inks industry, making it important for Manders to identify which market it should develop. The group would now 'concentrate on speciality chemicals with an emphasis on printing inks'. With Akzo and ICI the two main forces in the UK decorative paints industry, Manders only had 7 per cent of the market. Kalon, which in June 1992 launched an unsuccessful Pounds 106m all-paper bid for Manders, has about 12 per cent. After yesterday's sale, Total will have about 15 per cent. Mr Amos said that Johnstone's had undertaken to continue to manufacture paints at the Wolverhampton and Bingley factories for five years, though he conceded that there would be some rationalisation on the depot side. Manders' decorative paints division, Mr Amos said, was set this year to make 'a little more' than last time's Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m) operating profits, which gives a 'good p/e of 20'. Turnover last time was Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 37.4m) and the asset value is Pounds 20.5m.</p>

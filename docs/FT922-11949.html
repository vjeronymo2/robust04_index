			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Swiss ponder their franc and splendid isolation: Ian Rodger examines the intensifying debate over moves for greater co-operation within Europe AS THE dates for Swiss decisions on joining the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Community (EC) draw nearer, it appears that monetary policy and the future of the Swiss franc will be at the centre of the public debate on whether to end 700 years of splendid isolation. In the past few months, the economic pain caused throughout Europe by the German Bundesbank's severe monetary policy has given the Swiss a demonstration of the negative effects of belonging to a pan-European monetary system. While the Swiss franc does not participate formally in the European Monetary System (EMS), the Swiss National Bank (SNB) tries to keep the currency stable, especially in relation to the D-Mark. This is partly to maintain the franc's image as a stable haven currency and to keep in step with the European trend. But the central bank's main responsibility is to set an appropriate monetary policy for the domestic economy, which has been in recession for more than a year. It has been easing money supply for some time to help stimulate a recovery and in December had the audacity not to follow the Bundesbank's 0.5 per cent official interest rate rise. However, foreign exchange traders early last month decided that the bank could not have it both ways. In a few hectic trading sessions, they drove the franc down about 3 per cent against the mark. The bank, wearing its European-solidarity hat, chose to intervene, but, in doing so, pushed up short-term interest rates to levels that threaten to prolong the domestic recession and drive up politically sensitive mortgage interest rates. For the anti-EC forces, the message was that policies set by a distant authority - in this case the Bundesbank - are often inappropriate for local conditions. Therefore, it is better to keep one's distance, not just from the EMS, but also from the EEA and the EC. For the pro-Europeans, the events were merely part of an inevitable process of bringing Swiss interest rates, which have been traditionally lower than those in Germany, into line. They argue that, because the Swiss economy performs at virtually the same pace as the German one, the country has little to fear and much to gain from moving towards currency union. The debate, which has been rumbling beneath the surface for some time, burst into public view late last month when one of the leading Swiss economic forecasting institutes, the Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF), openly proposed pegging the franc to the mark. The institute painted a gloomy picture of slow recovery for the Swiss economy, hindered by, among other things, uncertainty over the outcome and economic impact of imminent decisions on the country's integration into Europe. It said that, in this 'special situation', the bank should declare a floor mark exchange rate for the franc at about SFr0.91 to stabilise expectations for the currency. Mr Thomas Hess of KOF said the alternative of letting the franc float was too risky: one could not predict how far it would fall, and franc interest rates might continue to rise anyway. The view found support in another institute, the Basle Economic Cycle Research Group (BAK). Mr Urs Muller, vice-president, argued that Switzerland had little to fear from convergence since its productivity was probably closer to that of Germany's than other European countries'. This was denounced as heresy along Zurich's Banhofstrasse, where gnomes have long prospered on the mystique surrounding the franc: pegging it to the mark would remove its raison d'etre. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust and a former central bank official, said that the franc's decline was merely a reflection of the ever-strengthening mark rather than an indication of real weakness. 'The depreciation of the Swiss franc is absolutely in line with what you would expect at this time,' he said. He was unconcerned about a devaluation: 'Credibility is the result of an evaluation of policy over many years. Nobody is going to change his view on the basis of a single move.' Other bankers agreed. 'It was not so long ago that the franc was under one mark in value,' one private banker said. 'It is too strong now anyway.' Another said that the OECD purchasing power parity of the franc in February was SFr1.07 to the mark and therefore indicated considerable room for weakening. The debate is likely to intensify. A referendum to ratify the EEA treaty is expected early next year, and Berne is thinking of applying to join the EC even sooner. Also, if the monetary squeeze became severe enough to provoke higher mortgage rates, the temperature could increase even more. These would be extremely unpopular when the property market and the construction industry are on their knees. A rise would also be inflationary. Rents, which are indexed to mortgage rates, account for 18 per cent of the retail price index. It is worth noting that support for European institutions is highest in French-speaking Switzerland, where the property market is weakest. In the German-speaking cantons, polls indicate that the majority supporting any move towards integration with Europe is a fragile one. Suspicion of remote governments, even the one in Berne, is deeply rooted, and fears about being marginalised or penalised for staying out of Europe are not great. Mr Schiltknecht said, 'We are the EC's second-largest market, and they have a trade surplus with us. Why would they want to hurt us?' Mr Beat Philipp, economist at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, believes the central bank and the big commercial banks have made a secret agreement under which the latter will not raise mortgage rates provided that the former does not let three-month Euro-franc interest rates go above 8.5 per cent. But, with the franc sinking to SFr0.92 to the mark last week, that agreement, if it exists, could be tested soon.</p>

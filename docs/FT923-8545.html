			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Latin American Dollars 50m fund launched HOPES that Argentine and Brazilian bonds will repeat some of the spectacular gains recorded by Mexican and Venezuelan instruments after debt reduction agreements with their foreign bank creditors have prompted the launch of a specialised Dollars 50m fund. The Morgan Grenfell Latin American Brady Fund comes as both Argentina and Brazil are close to completing agreements to convert their bank debt into so-called 'Brady bonds', named after the former US treasury secretary. Since Mexico became the first country to issue Brady bonds, in March 1990, holders of Brady bonds have made substantial paper gains. The Salomon Brothers index of Brady bonds, consisting mainly of Mexican and Venezuelan instruments, recorded a cumulative return of around 75 per cent in its first two years. Morgan Grenfell's new fund is set to join a small list of investment vehicles which specialise in Latin American Debt. Others, such as those run by the London-based Latin American Securities and Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark of the US, are designed to benefit on the higher yield of debt securities from Latin American borrowers. The Morgan Grenfell fund, on the other hand, aims to bring investors capital gains following the completion of Brady-style deals in Argentina and Brazil. The Dollars 50m closed-end fund, which terminates in 1993, is arranged jointly with Nafinsa, the Mexican state development bank, and Banco Medefin of Argentina. Leverage means that up to Dollars 100m can be invested. The bank debt of both Argentina and Brazil is currently languishing as a result of the political scandal in Brazil and concerns about the ability of both countries to provide the necessary collateral to back their proposed Brady bonds.</p>

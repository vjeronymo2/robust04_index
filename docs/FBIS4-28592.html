			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Principle of the `Obsolete' Politicians; </F> Chuan Survives, Chalat Dies, the Country is Divided"]    [Text] As Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other core  members of the Democrat Party repeatedly cite the word  "principle" as an excuse to justify their actions, they  themselves have nakedly exposed the true nature of Thailand's  oldest political party. In the past, the government of General  Suchinda Khraprayun also cited the need for joint efforts to  develop the country's democratic system as a pretext to justify  its actions. Worse still, the Democrats often arrogantly attack  any peaceful activities calling for democracy.    We stated on several occasions that we do not agree with  Chalat Worachat in using a hunger strike to push for the  observance of the major "principle" of democracy. However, we  do agree with the "essence" of his demands. Although we  disagree with his method, we, with unbiased and fair perception,  believe that Chalat has chosen the hunger strike as a means to  create strong agitation in society so that he can attract the  people's attention to the struggle for genuine democracy, the  "principle" which requires the participation of the people in  every aspect of the democratization process such as in drafting  a constitution, the decentralization of power and election of  provincial governors.    Chalat's maneuver would have failed and received no support  from any party had the present government faithfully followed  the fundamental "principle" of the democratic system in  compliance with the aspirations of the people who voted in the  general election on the 13 September 1992. The people clearly  stated that they want the present government to do away with all  conditions and obstacles that hampered the development of the  democratic system and that had been the cause of the bloodshed  in May 1992. The five parties in the coalition government had  all pledged and promised the people that they would amend the  Constitution to make it more democratic. But, none have honored  their words. Recently, the Democrat Party, the core of the  coalition government, has shown no signs of respecting public  opinion. Indulging in power, the Democrats believe that they and  their colleagues represent correctness.    We are extremely disappointed with the unconstructive,  inhumane, and unBuddhistlike behavior of Deputy Finance Minister  Trairong Suwannakhiri, who compared Chalat's hunger strike to a  robbery and said that Chalat will die for nothing. The prime  minister, who is also the leader of the Democrat Party, can best  use the "principle" he has been adhering to for 23 years to  judge whether or not such statements should be uttered by an MP  from his honorable party. We can recall the political confusion  and several conflicts of opinion triggered by the impolite and  inappropriate statements of this minister in the past.    In attempting to end the crisis, the prime minister simply  clings tightly to the "principle" he claims to be correct and  overrides the problem. He has no courage to initiate any  political move and just allows the conflict to be further  aggravated, while his subordinates keep adding fuel to the fire  and provoking , with statements against those who chose peaceful  means to pursue their causes.    The prime minister is reputed for his firm adherence to  principle. This is one of the good characteristics of a leader  of the country. However, if his adherence to the principle is  aimed at preserving his premiership for as long as possible, he  is then a selfish person. It is the obsolete principle which  often causes abnormal problems in the country.    We are extremely disappointed with the prime minister and  the  Democrat Party for they have paid no attention to the valuable  suggestion from Dr. Prawet Wasi. The well respected Dr. Prawet  has recommended that the whole political system be reformed so  as to avoid violent confrontation and so that "Chuan, Chalat,  and the country can all survive." Instead of listening to the  advice, the Democrat Party has resorted to all kinds of  political tricks including lying and setting up pro-government  mobs. In short, the Democrat Party is behaving as the  government of General Suchinda Khraprayun did before the latter  was ousted by the people.    The behavior of leaders of the Democrat Party has so far  clearly proven their cunning and insincerity. They will not  hesitate to do anything to keep the parties in the coalition and  the opposition bloc and private organizations under their thumb.  They will use their own yardstick, which they call "principle."  Those who rebel are labelled as trouble makers. Such an  attitude is identical to that of past "rulers" who also labelled  themselves as the yardstick of society and forced everyone to  accept their criteria.    Obstinate politicians must be stopped now. We are now at the  brink of the dead spot of democracy, which was earned from the  blood of the fallen heroes in the May incident. Otherwise, the  scenario of "Chuan survives, Chalat dies, and the country is  divided," will eventually become reality.</p>

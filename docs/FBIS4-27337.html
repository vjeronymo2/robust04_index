			<p>CSO     [Text] Nine general trading companies announced their  fiscal 1994 March settlement of accounts on 19 May, but they  were settlement of accounts which showed a strong coloring of  bubble-era disposition. Ordinary profit for the nine companies  decreased 21 percent, the first decrease for three consecutive  terms since the war. With the prolonged sluggish economy, major  divisions such as machinery have had a hard fight, and a decline  in sales due to the high yen has had an effect. With the drop in  interest, the financial balance has improved, but it has not  been able to compensate for the drop in regular business. The  major trading companies have depreciated a large amount of bad  assets across the board. The period ending in March 1995 will  also have a grim business environment and there is a great  probability that there will be no more than a weak profit.    Sales for the nine companies in the previous term were about  103 trillion yen, a decrease of about 7 percent. The erosion of  sales due to the high yen amounted to 1 trillion yen for  Mitsubishi Corp. and 860 billion yen for Sumitomo Corp.; Mitsui  &amp; Co. increased its precious metal dealings and was the only  one  to have higher earnings.    Gross sales profits were down for all companies, decreasing  6  percent, a total of 1,434.7 billion yen, for the nine companies.  With the drop in interest, Mitsubishi Corp. at 7.1 billion yen  and Mitsui &amp; Co. at 4 billion yen turned to a financial  surplus,  and Marubeni and Itohchu also reduced their deficit margin.  However, the slump in regular business has had an effect and  ordinary profits decreased in seven companies. Since the heavy  electrical and plant division exports for Asia have progressed  steadily, Marubeni has had an increase in ordinary profits on a  real basis except for stock sales profits, and Tomen had a  slight decrease in profits on a real basis.    The scale for depreciation of bad assets reached the highest  level in the past for all such as Mitsubishi Corp., Itohchu, and  Marubeni. In particular, they are hastening the liquidation of  the financial engineering that expanded in the bubble era, and  specified money trusts [tokkin] and fund trust balances that  embrace latent losses have become half that of a year ago at a  little over 600 billion yen in the nine company total. The move  to dispose of unprofitable group companies at home and abroad  also has been conspicuous.    They have squeezed out stock and real estate sales profits,  but aftertax profits of the various companies have been greatly  reduced, and Mitsubishi Corp. and others have disposed of  internal reserves to maintain dividends.    As a result of full-scale depreciation of bad assets, it has  been emphasized by various companies that "the operating burden  has been alleviated" (Tetsuro Kitaoka, Marubeni director) and  "we are approaching healthiness, and a system to undertake new  commercial right acquisitions is ready" (Tetsuo Uemura,  Mitsubishi Corp. director).    The various companies are anticipating an economic recovery  this term from the second term, but it seems that it is possible  that the nine-company total for ordinary profits will decline  for four consecutive terms if the recovery scenario breaks down.</p>

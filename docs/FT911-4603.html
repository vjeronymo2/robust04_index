			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Lloyd's agrees on computers PARTICIPANTS ON the London insurance market yesterday announced agreement on a new system based on electronic communication designed to harmonise brokers' placement of risks with syndicates at Lloyd's and insurance companies, Richard Lapper writes. Live use of the system is expected to begin in April 1992. It will allow brokers to place through computers policies currently written on a subscription basis with underwriters. Such risks are offered to Lloyd's syndicates and companies outside the Lloyd's market, each of whom subscribes to part of it an agreed premium rate. The new system was agreed by the London Insurance Market Network.</p>

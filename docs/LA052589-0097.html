			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The remaining members of the Allman Brothers Band will be traveling men again  as they take off on a 20th-anniversary reunion tour. Tour dates will be  announced in the next few weeks, they said this week. "It's like a 20-year high  school reunion thing," Gregg Allman said at drummer Butch Trucks' recording  studio. "The timing was right and it just happened. It was a collective idea."  The Macon, Ga.-based band, which formed in 1969, last performed together in  1982. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

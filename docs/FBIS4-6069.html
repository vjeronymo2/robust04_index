			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Chinese Ambassador to  Japan Xu Dunxin urged Japanese companies Monday [18 April] to  invest not only in China's seaside areas but also in the inland,  saying inland areas have a great potential for development.    "It's timely to advance into the inland now," said Xu,  speaking to Japanese business executives at a KYODO NEWS  SERVICE-sponsored lecture session at a Tokyo hotel. He said  China's vast southwestern areas have rich natural resources and  a low-cost labor force.    "The inland areas have weak points in transportation and  infrastructure...but Japan is good at these fields and thus has  a lot it can do there," Xu said. He said the Chinese Government  has also increased its infrastructure investment in inland areas.    Xu also said China will continue efforts to bring a  "peaceful  and amicable" solution to problems related to North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development, saying such efforts so  far have helped. However, he asked international society not to  expect too much of Beijing, adding China is not among the  parties directly concerned with the matter.</p>

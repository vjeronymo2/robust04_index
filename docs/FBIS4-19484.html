			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, Apr 18 (CNA)--President Glavkos Kliridhis  said Monday [18 April] that only through a result-oriented  approach by the U.N. Security Council, progress can be expected  towards a Cyprus settlement.    Receiving the credentials of the first ever South African  ambassador to Cyprus, Paul K. Coetzee, the president referred in  great detail to the developments of the Cyprus problem.    "In our effort to break the deadlock caused by the Turkish  side," he said, "we responded favourably to the initiative of  the U.N. secretary general and held proximity talks on the  confidence building measures (CBM's)."    The president noted that the Turkish side tried, however, to  exploit the procedure of the talks and to secure political  advantages contrary to the guidelines set forth by the secretary  general at the beginning of the process.    "The Turkish side proved that it lacks the political will to  reach an agreement even on the CBM's, let alone on the substance  of the Cyprus problem. As was the case in the last 20 years,  the Turkish side frustrated once again all efforts to reach an  agreement," he said.    President Kliridhis stressed "we believe that the time has  come for the security council to consider alternative ways to  promote the effective implementation of its numerous decisions  on Cyprus."    He continued: "It is my firm conviction that only through  result-oriented approach by the Security Council we can expect  to see progress towards a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus  problem."    Referring to the accreditation to Cyprus of the first South  African diplomat and Cyprus' decision to establish a consulate  general in Johannesburg, the president said these actions were  "indicative of our common desire to promote and strengthen our  bilateral relations."    The presence in South Africa of a considerable number of  South Africans of Cypriot origin, who actively and  constructively participate in South Africa's national life,  constituted an additional bond of friendship between the two  peoples, he added.    Presenting his credentials, Coetzee said that "South Africa  supports the prospect for a peaceful negotiated settlement of  the situation that your country is facing."    Referring to the thriving Cypriot-South African community,  the diplomat said that ``these expatriates from Cyprus have  contributed their rich and refined cultural heritage together  with an immense and active idealism to their new country and  have become respected, prominent and successful citizens of my  country.    ``In many instances they, together with others, have through  the years forged solid business and other ties between our  countries. The establishment of bilateral relations between our  two countries is bound, however, to expand these relations  substantially,'' he added.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Scottish water schemes attacked The government was accused yesterday of privatising Scotland's water industry through the back door by urging local authorities to engage private-sector companies to build, operate and own water and sewerage installations. Mr Archy Kirkwood, a Liberal Democrat MP, said the use of build, own and operate schemes, known as BOO, was 'virtual privatisation'. It would negate the government's promise that Scotland's water and sewerage industry would not be privatised, unlike the industry in England and Wales. It is believed the first BOO scheme for a Scottish water or sewerage project could go to tender in the autumn, following the drafting of specimen tenders by a team involving the Scottish Office, the private sector and a regional council. The use of BOO schemes is favoured by the Scottish Office as a way of financing the upgrading of Scotland's water and sewerage industry in the next 15 years to bring it into line with European Union standards. Under a BOO scheme a private consortium of banks and construction companies contracts with a local authority to build a sewerage plant. It would then own it and operate it under contract with the regional council or, after 1996, the three new publicly owned water authorities. From the government's point of view the advantage of BOO schemes is that they allow the public sector to undertake large capital spending projects without increasing the public sector borrowing requirement, because councils do not have to borrow to finance them. A list of 14 Scottish water and sewerage projects worth about Pounds 1bn suitable for BOO financing was published by the Treasury last November. A project team - including the construction company Balfour Beatty, the French-owned water company Degremont, two banks and Lothian regional council  -has been studying the technicalities of BOO schemes in Scotland. Although the Scottish Office said yesterday that it was up to regional councils whether they went ahead with BOO schemes it is understood that it is unwilling to give councils permission to borrow to finance them. They could, however, finance smaller schemes out of their current budget. Lothian region has allowed its officials to consider the BOO system but other councils, such as Strathclyde, have refused to get involved.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt warns on US retreat from multilateralism - Frances Williams reports on the latest review of US trade policy THE FUTURE of the stalled Uruguay Round of global trade talks and Washington's new-found enthusiasm for regional trade agreements dominate the worry-list of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in its latest review of US trade policy published yesterday. While high hopes are pinned on a successful outcome of the five-year-old Round to strengthen Gatt and underpin economic reform in eastern Europe and developing countries, the report notes growing concern about erosion of basic Gatt principles by the three 'isms' - regionalism, bilateralism and unilateralism - as well as various forms of 'managed' trade. All are prominent features of US trade relations. Discussion of the report in Gatt's governing council this week reflected the fears of many countries that Washington's commitment to an open world trading system is weakening. Frustrating squabbles with trading partners, especially Japan and the European Community, and a weak domestic economy have multiplied the voices in the US, in the run-up to the presidential election in November, calling for protection. In fact, as the Gatt report makes clear, it is the tone rather than the substance of US trade policy that has changed - at least for now. But as the world's largest economy and biggest trader, the US 'has a major responsibility for maintaining and reinforcing the faith of the international business community in the open, liberal multilateral trading system', Gatt says. In particular, Gatt is worried by the potentially adverse effects of preferential regional trading arrangements, such as the proposed North American Free Trade Arrangement (Nafta) and the various deals with central and south American countries envisaged under the 'Enterprise for the Americas Initiative'. The impact on world trade could be far-reaching. The three Nafta countries - Canada, Mexico and the US - have a combined population of 360m and a total output of Dollars 6,000bn; Canada and Mexico are already America's biggest individual trading partners. Given the size of the economies involved, third countries could be harmed by trade diversion, the report says, though it acknowledges that the US has pledged to follow Gatt rules in drafting free trade accords. 'The possible emergence of a complex network of preferential programmes covering the American continent could further undermine the most-favoured nation principle.' Gatt also notes that since its last report on the US in 1989, Washington has taken a 'measured approach' to use of its unilateral powers under the controversial 'Section 301' of the 1988 Trade Act and similar procedures. No retaliatory action against 'unfair' traders has been taken in the past two years. Nevertheless, Washington is still using threats of unilateral action, notably against countries with allegedly inadequate standards of intellectual property protection. One major source of friction in the Uruguay Round has been the US refusal to abandon its right to take unilateral measures as part of an accord on a speedier and more effective multilateral disputes settlement procedure, though Washington has agreed not to use Section 301 before the new Gatt procedures are exhausted. The US also comes under fire for its frequent use of anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions, with more than 200 orders in force in mid-1991, some dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Though the share of total US imports directly affected by such duties is minuscule (less than 0.5 per cent), Gatt says the uncertainty generated may have led trading partners voluntarily to restrain exports or to price their goods 'defensively' or to conclude bilateral deals with the same effect. The report quotes research suggesting that nearly half of all anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations have been terminated by bilateral pacts, especially in the steel and semiconductor sectors. Most of the sectoral voluntary restraint arrangements noted by Gatt in 1989 remain in force, the report says, including those for steel (though these are due to be terminated), machine tools, and textiles and clothing. In addition, the new pact with Japan on semiconductors, aiming at a 20 per cent foreign market share, 'has raised the question of whether US trade policies have moved further towards 'managed' trade'. For all the moans, as Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, stressed in his opening remarks to the Gatt debate, the US has one of the world's most open economies with generally low tariffs (averaging about 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis), relatively few import restrictions, and relatively low farm subsidies. The Bush administration remained committed to a strengthened multilateral trading system. US and Canada: A free trade disagreement, Page 17</p>

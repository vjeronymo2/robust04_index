			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: The system under strain Even before French voters went to the polls yesterday, it was clear that the ERM as we have come to know it was blown. From the moment of Italy's devaluation a week ago, faith in the system's ability to deliver quasi-fixed exchange rates was shattered. What was perhaps unexpected was the tidal wave of speculation that swamped even well-armed central banks. The Bundesbank's admission that it has spent DM60bn in intervention during the recent turmoil is a rude reminder of the scale of short-term capital flows in a world largely free of exchange controls. It is sheer fantasy to assume those controls can be resurrected. The markets have proved they can win, and win quite easily. No referendum result could have changed that. Had France voted No, the franc would almost certainly have come under excruciating pressure. As it is the Yes vote may buy some calm, but it is disturbingly slim and there is other unfinished business: Italy's attempt to re-enter the system, pressure on the peseta, Danish krone, and Irish punt. Maybe the answer will yet be for Europe to split in two with the Benelux countries and, now, France as well as Denmark congregating round Germany. Countries in the slow lane would offer higher growth and higher inflation, but at a price of heightened currency risk. Investors would have to be more nimble than before. The question is whether Europe's leaders would be prepared to ignore the political consequences of such a split. There must be some relief that France looks set to stay in the fast lane, but a two-speed Europe still represents a serious setback. Besides, the scale of international capital flows makes it hard for small countries to go it alone, even when like Denmark and Ireland they could point to economic fundamentals better than those of Germany. The chances are the politicians will want to preserve the system as best they can. One more reshuffle of the lesser currencies might bring stability for a while, but the markets would judge its credibility on the degree of genuine policy cooperation that followed. That would mean the Bundesbank cutting interest rates, even if this still goes against the monetarist grain.</p>

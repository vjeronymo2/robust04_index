			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Leading Article: A murderous path to peace THE POLITICAL murders perpetrated by the extremist enemies of Israel and by the government in Jerusalem during the weekend offer an ugly counterpoint to the international commitment to bring peace to the Middle East. The deaths of three Israeli soldiers, several residents of a Palestinian refugee camp, Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader, his wife and son are testament to the powerful resistance that remains to the concept of compromise. The link between the events is that they all make a negotiated peace less likely. Killing Israeli soldiers will not make an Israeli government more likely to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza. Killing Sheikh Abbas Musawi and his family will not, contrary to Israeli leaders' protestations, make what they call 'terrorism' less likely. On the contrary, the killing of the Hizbollah leader, who was thought to have been helpful in winning the release of western hostages in Lebanon last year, raises the probability of retaliation and further reaction. It also has wider implications of importance to the international community. If the peace process, in which the US has invested so heavily, is to be given a chance, then the parties most involved must at least exercise restraint. It is not asking for anything new or something which cannot be delivered. When Israel was far more threateningly attacked by Iraqi Scud missiles last year, it demonstrated just how restrained it could be in response to US pressure. Growing recklessness The Israeli government may have accurately assessed that no American political leader was going to be too publicly concerned about the death of a Lebanese Shia cleric closely associated with Iran. But there does seem to be creeping into Israel's conduct of foreign policy an almost reckless willingness to challenge the American view of how events should evolve in the Middle East. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, has not just rejected Washington's ideas for modest confidence-building measures, but at times has appeared to be deliberately provocative, particularly on the issue of building Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. It may be a measure of how out of touch Israel's leaders have become with American opinion that they believed the administration would, whatever the provocation, accede to the request for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to help house immigrants from what was the Soviet Union. Qualified sentiment Israel retains a powerful hold on US and European sentiment. But that sentiment is much more qualified than it was at the height of the Cold War and when the Arab nations refused to contemplate peace and territorial compromise. The containment of Soviet ambitions in the Middle East is no longer an issue and the majority of Arab countries have said not just that they are willing to recognise Israel but have already sat down with its leaders in the same room. Israel can be as sceptical as it wishes about the underlying Arab motivation, but what it must not do is refuse to acknowledge the importance of the changes which have taken place or the desire of its closest allies to carry the process forward. The more moderate leaders of the Arab world, buoyed by the liberation of Kuwait nearly a year ago, are again in danger of seeing their political gains eroded. Islam is once more being vigorously promoted as the sole remaining force which can unite peoples against unpopular governments and international manipulation. The killing of Mr Musawi is grist to the mill of religious militants from Algeria to Iran. How much all this matters to the Israeli public should be more than ever a matter of critical debate. In June, it goes to the polls for what might be the most important election since independence. Mr Shamir and his Likud party believe Israel can cope with all the consequences of holding on to the occupied territories. The Labour party thinks it must offer some land in return for peace. Israel's choice will have a direct impact on western interests and could confirm what threatens to become a widening conflict of view.</p>

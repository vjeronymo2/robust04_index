Kenya closed Norway's embassy in Nairobi in 1990  after Norway offered legal assistance to the Kenyan dissident,  Koigi Wa Wamwere, who was under arrest at the time in Kenya.  Norway had also criticized the human rights situation in Kenya.  Kenya took the initiative in restoring diplomatic relations  between the two countries.    Norway has no plans to restart economic aid to Kenya.</p>

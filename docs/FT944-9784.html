			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Toad Innovations raising Pounds 2.5m Toad Innovations, a car security company, is planning to raise about Pounds 2.5m through a private placing of shares that will be traded under the Stock Exchange's lightly regulated Rule 4.2 facility. The shares will move to the Alternative Investment Market when it is launched next year as a replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market. Toad has negligible sales but is developing a range of products to protect car and commercial vehicles, including an in-car camera which records attempted break-ins. Mr Chris Evans, founder and non-executive chairman, has raised money in the last two years for two other companies - Chiroscience and Celsis - both of which availed themselves of Stock Exchange rules allowing biotechnology companies to float on the main list without an established record. Both were lossmakers. Other private backers from Toad's launch in March 1993 include Mr John Precious, chairman of Celsis and former finance director of Wellcome, and Mr Bill Edge, director of Grosvenor Venture Managers. The Toad issue is sponsored by Henry Cooke, an active promoter of issues under Rule 4.2, formerly known as Rule 535.2. It said there had been a steady flow of new issues this year, many of which planned to move to the AIM. Rule 4.2 issues are particularly tax efficient for some investors. Although they have quoted shares they are considered private companies, which means investors can shelter capital gains tax liabilities crystallised on the sale of almost any asset by investing the gains in shares of companies traded under the rule.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Economics chief learns not to upset the markets 'Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds more like (Finance Minister) Derek Keys'. That is the South African business community's idea of a compliment, its way of saying that African National Congress economics chief Trevor Manuel increasingly tailors his economic rhetoric to the hard South African realities stressed by Mr Keys. Mr Manuel is a politician, not a technocrat (Mr Keys pretends to be the opposite, though his political skills are not inconsiderable). But in the two years since he was brought in as political head of the ANC economics department, the 37-year-old Mr Manuel has rapidly scaled a steep learning curve in economic theory. Bombarded by economic home truths from business and international financial institutions, Mr Manuel has avoided saying things which increase the blood pressure of businessmen and investors and sink prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In a weekend interview, he opposed the imposition of a wealth tax - an idea which remains popular among many ANC leaders - preferring instead a 'reconstruction bond' which would attract voluntary capital from domestic and overseas sources, as well as measures to compel life offices to commit a percentage of assets to 'socially desirable investments'; he stressed the need to proceed carefully with any tax increases, noting 'if every time you need money you raise taxes, you can't govern'. But the firmness of his commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline and macroeconomic balance remains to be tested. In the days before the burden of political office descends, Mr Manuel knows he can please the markets without disappointing the electorate. All the hardest choices can be avoided until forced on the ANC by the pressures of government.</p>

Lt. Gen. Shih Tzuo-ching, deputy director of the Political  Warfare Department of the Ministry of National Defense, told a  press conference that because of the malfeasance of a handful of  officers, "the military's image has been marred and the nation's  interest harmed."    Several military officers and arms brokers have been  detained  for being involved in the murder of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng,  whose body was uncovered on Dec. 10. Yin was responsible for  the navy's arms acquisition unit.    The ministry organized a special task force a week after  Yin's body was discovered, but doubts over the role of the ad  hoc group have since mounted because little progress has been  reported in clearing the web of irregularities surrounding the  incident.    Shih denied rumors that the military has been trying to keep  a low profile on the case because many more ranking officers  have been implicated. "No direct evidence is available that can  lead to some suspects being charged," he said.    While pledging to bring the case to its just conclusion,  Shih  said the Defense Ministry is reviewing its arms procurement  system to prevent similar scandals in the future.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was an improved and more general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Brightest east African teas were fully firm and medium descriptions sold readily at firm to dearer rates. Plainer sorts remained about steady. Ceylons were well supported with brighter teas often gaining several pence. The small selection on offer met good demand at firm rates. Quotations: best available 174p/kg, good 158p/kg, good medium 140p/kg, medium 122p/kg, low medium 84p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 186p/kg for a Kenya pf. 1.</p>

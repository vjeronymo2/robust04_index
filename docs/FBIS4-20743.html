			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ehsan Naraqi; place and date not given] </F>   [Text] Tehran--What follows are excerpts from an interview  with Dr. Ehsan Naraqi, a top adviser to the UNESCO  director-general and author of the book "From Shah's Palace to  Evin Prison." The 3-hour interview was published in GOZARESH-E  HAFTEH, a sports, political, social, cultural and economic  weekly published by 'Ali Mohammad Mahdavi-Khorrami. A  translation of the interview appeared in AKHBAR.  <H5>  On penetration of Iranian culture and civilization into </H5> Central Asia and the Caucasus:    "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, these nations were  naturally interested in reestablishing ties with Iran. In a  seminar on Central Asia held at UNESCO last month, I said that  if we assess the services rendered by such Iranian personalities  as Sepahsalar, Qa'em Maqam and Amir Kabir we would notice that  their personality was based on three pillars: Iranianism, Islam  and modernism. We have somebody like Amir Kabir (Mirza Taqi  Khan, the vizier of Iran's Qajar King Nasereddin (1831-96) about  whom men like Fereydun Adamiat and Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani have  written books. In other words, he's a personality with which  everybody agrees. Amir Kabir was extremely patriotic, devout and  Muslim and very much interested in sciences. He set up a  polytechnic institute in Tehran 20 years before the Japanese  established theirs. Dr. Mosaddeq too was a Muslim, Iran-loving  and modernist man. During the Pahlavi era the total divegard of  one of these pillars, Islam, led to inbalance in society with  the Islamic Revolution being its natural and rational final  reaction. Naturally in the early days of the Revolution the  impression existed that Islam was able to take the place of the  other two elements too. Some went to extremes. But in a  conversation with Mr. Rafsanjani, when he had just been elected  president, he said he was like Amir Kabir and would focus all  his attention on those three main pillars. Because he is a true  Muslim and believes in being Iranian and in modernism and new  sciences. That is also true about the Rev Ayatollah Khamene'i.  Perhaps some elements want to go the extreme course and wrongly  imagine that they can count on him. But in my opinion they are  mistaken, for His Reverence (the esteemed leader) has proved to  be an Iran-loving Muslim and a modernist as well. Now it is  possible that he sometimes tells a faction to stay around as  well, but in the final analysis he believes in those three  branches. I have seen it myself that this mode of thinking  exists more or less among officials and second-rank statesmen  too. From all this I mean to deduce that Central Asia turns to  Iran when it sees Iran rest on these three pillars. They are  seeking an Iran which can offer them a suitable combination.  They need each and every of these three factors: Islam, Iran and  modernity. And so, a balanced behavior and the way we approach  the Central Asian and Caucasian republics is reckoned to be a  mojor element. We have to be sensitive and alert. We must not  subject them all of a sudden to extremist and harsh elements,  for they would quickly be driven away from us, as was observed  in certain cases, particularly at the beginning. But I hope  everything will get into its proper course with all these  comings and goings and the aid Iran is providing these  republics."  <H5>  On the PLO-Israel agreement: </H5>   "Two or three years ago and before the present peace plan  the  PLO representative in UNESCO told me, `Deep down we are not  dissatisfied with the Iranian government's tough anti-Israel  positions for we can tell Israel we have in the Orient and among  Islamic states countries which would not agree with the peace  process and negotiation and so you'd better come down and give  in to our rightful demands.' With this reasoning, my impression  is that Iran, with its opposing stand is actually helping  Palestine indirectly. And so for political isolation, we  shouldn't worry, because we are defending the Palestinians, on  the basis of an ideological-religious link with them, as a  Muslim innocent people subjected to the Zionists' oppression. Of  course, some maintain that Iran's opposing the peace process and  then being left alone in the region may cause our country to go  under the burden of making commitments to the Palestinians. But  even this is nothing to worry about. Our diplomats, according to  a French politician I recently spoke to, are very clever and  know what path they are treading. Our Foreign Ministry and its  diplomats have calculated everything and know what will happen  next, just like chess players. Anyway, I think our positions are  not going to harm us. I do believe that Iranian diplomats are  patriots, faithful and have strong Islamic convictions and that  they don't use those convictions as an excommunicating stick."  <H5>  On Salman Rushdie: </H5>   "Apart from the fact that I'm against the prize offered for  killing Rushdie, I am critical of three points. Firstly, our  compatriots, notably the clergymen and Muslim intellectuals have  not yet made any attempt to analyze the book, `The Satanic  Verses'. They have merely endorsed the fatwa, without making it  clear why the Imam issued the fatwa for the killing of Rushdie.  The only substantial thing I have seen is a book by Mr. Ataollah  Mohajerani. Sometime ago he made a speech at the Human Rights  Commission which was highly based on reasoning. I could see  clearly that the majority of those who listened to Mr.  Mohajerani's speech on the fatwa were impressed. My second  criticism is that the fatwa process, instead of being explained  to the Westerners through non-government channels, is purely  handled by the government. In my opinion making the fatwa a  state matter is a weak point. Fatwa is a religious action and so  all those conversant with religious laws should express opinion  in this regard. My third criticism is that although the Islamic  Conference Organization has verified the fatwa on two occasions,  we have not yet been able to bring other Muslim countries onto  the stage. A conference or seminar is still to be held on this  subject. Last December 7, French television asked questions from  seven or eight persons, including myself, about Salman Rushdie  and then Rushdie appeared before the TV camera and for three  hours talked about the views expressed by us. I was the only one  who taked against Rushdie. I told the French television, `I  don't understand it. If you have anything against Imam  Khomeyni's fatwa, OK, fine, that's something. But then you don't  have to give credit and award to someone who has insulted the  beliefs of more than one billion Muslims. Well, you can say  execution is a heavy punishment, but you can't claim Rushdie has  committed no crime. Rushdie is asking us to endorse his freedom  of being slanderous and abusive. Rushdie is telling us he's  being chased, but it was only last month that he was in  Washington and the week before that he was in, France, Germany,  Spain and Italy. What chase? It's you who is chasing us! You go  wherever you like. What's all this. You'd better go and be  thankful to all that publicity which caused your worthless book  to sell so much and made you famous.'    "I told French television, `You're mistaken if you think  with  all this pressure you're exerting on the Iranian government you  can help freedom of idea even a bit in the countries without it.  You are badly mistaken, for to no Muslim intellectual, from  Morocco to Indonesia, freedom means insulting the Prophet of  Islam.' I was asked what I would suggest as a solution. And I  said instead of going to the White House and complaining to  Clinton, Salman Rushdie should go to the Muslims in India and  Pakistan, his bithplace, and repent and ask for forgiveness. If  he did that then the Muslims of India would be able to ask  Iranian leaders to show mercy to that creature. The West and  Rushdie are treading a wrong course; the government and the  system of the Islamic Republic must continue to resist all these  pressures.    "After John Major, the British prime minister, had a meeting  with Rushdie I wrote a letter to the newspaper Times, which, of  course, the British hypocrisy prevented the letter which was  addressed to Major, from being published. In that letter I asked  Mr. Major: Wouldn't the Church of England in the 17th century  have thrown into fire somebody who wrote a book full of insults  to Saint Mary.    "Let me emphasize again that the government and Muslim  intellectuals of Iran have to resist all these pressures.  Besides, those Iranians abroad who have subscribed to the  Support Rushdie Statement have shown utter ignorance. Of course,  what these 200 individuals have done shouldn't be taken  seriously. It's more like a childish obstinacy to the Islamic  Republic. It has no depth or content."  <H5>  On UNESCO: </H5>   "The role of UNESCO is very important. It has to bring  different cultures together and establish understanding among  them. Now it is possible that some extremeist revolutionaries  are not very much in favor of this, but there is no other  choice. First, war and bloodshed has to stop before we can drive  home what we have to say. There it depends on our own  competence, capability and capacity. If the Iranian government,  officials and intellectuals show themselves more than this,  UNESCO too will be able to reflect like a mirror those features  to the world."  <H5>  On Iranian Opposition: </H5>   "First of all, the opposition abroad has never been a  movement. Ever since the beginning these groups have been mere  organizations without reliance on people, and almost all of them  are on the payroll of foreign countries or the intelligence  services of alien governments. An example is the Mojahedin  Organization which is fed by Saddam Husayn. There are also  gentlemen like Manuchehr Hezarkhani and Nasser Pakdaman who,  unfortunately, at one time cooperated with me during the former  regime, have now turned completely into Saddam Husayn's men. But  then, there are a small minority who are getting paid. I haven't  seen any substantial opponent of the Islamic Republic among the  majority of Iranians living abroad."  <H5>  On whether there was any positive current among Iranian </H5> political groups abroad:    "The positive current of these groups is thier failure. When  in 1986 I went to Europe, some people came to me and asked me if  I wanted to meet any leaders of those groups. I said I would  talk to anyone who could tell me how he earned his livelihood. I  remember an old-time friend who had collaborated with one of  those dependent groups for one or two years. He opened up a  bakery in our neighborhood in Paris and it is now some years  that he's making bread and likes his country and motherland very  much. Well now you could see more and more of these people there  whose income is not from suspicious political sources but from  their own work and activity. Basically, such individuals  maintain no hard attitude towards the regime. If they have  criticisms, say of hejab, they are basically a kind of family  complaint and is not deep rooted. They have no enmity toward the  system."  <H5>  On how the Islamic Republic could attract those individuals </H5> and make use of their knowledge and expertise:    "I have often said that 90% of the Iranians abroad,  even if  one day they were political refugees, are now cultural and  mental refugees. They don't consider the Islamic Republic to be  dependent. My recommendation is to be less stringent.  Fortunately, this has been done to a large extent during these  two or three years. Right now, some of our embassies are issuing  passports to the former emigres who have given up political work  and the embassy staff are treating them in a human and agreeable  way. But then it depends on the Islamic Republic, which has to  provide the condition for these people, to prove effectiveness  and make it possible for their expertise to be used in the best  possible way in our industry and economy."  <H5>  On the country's economic problems: </H5>   "I think this too has political roots. It is a question of  how the Islamic Republic interprets the issue. The problem is  that as yet no single line has been defined for the economic  policies. The most important question in the Iranian economy is  that of investment guarantees and boundaries. At present, local  (as well as foreign) investment has no sufficient guarantee for  its own stability. The absence of an overall strategy, the  waywardness of establishments, the lack of coordination among  organizations and departments, the discrete management and the  still persisting confusion, which can render management  unsteady, have forced `capital' to flee our country or ever set  foot in Iran. So, not only the foreign capital will not come  here, but the native capital won't get started. This system  needs reexamination, economically as well as politically. You  see, the Iranian private sector had make some progress during  the Shah's time. For example, men like Khayyami and Iravani, who  are even accepted by the Islamic Republic now, erected a series  of factories in this country. These men could have been  preserved and the Islamic Republic and the people could have  benefited from their work. But unfortunately, we made that  mistake and out of sheer ignorance we shood everybody, both good  and bad, away. In fact, we spoiled and destroyed all that we had  built and belonged to ourselves and had nothing to do with the  Shah's regime.    "To use Hojj Rafsanjani's words, our work is still  sloganeering. It's still not clear to many devout and dedicated  individuals that the end is one thing and the means another  thing. We have all forgotten about the means. Some of the  officials want to turn Iran into an Islamic Utopia overnight  without having first secured the prerequisite means, facilities  and conditions, particularly the world condition. Really, who  has told you that, say, Iravani is someone fed by Mohammad Reza  (Shah)? No, it wasn't like that at all. Iravani was someone who  exploited a specific situation and set up a factory--that's all.  Or about myslef. It makes me laugh when some people say I was  associated with the Shah's regime. In all stages of my life I  have always pursued specific cultural aims. I did deal with the  regime but wasn't associated with it. I'm afraid, this type of  mentality in Iran was advertised by the communists and the  Islamists suffered its blow."  <H5>  On the effects of the Tudeh (Communist) Party's wrong and </H5> Machiavellian methods of branding those in the country's  political environment:    "The Tudeh supporters created the atmosphere of mental  terror  and repression in our country. They pronounced anyone who had  breathed in the Shah's regime an associate of that regime. And  that was while they themselves were for 25 years the unpaid  lackeys, agents and informants of [the] Russians and the total  slaves of the KGB. Yet they came and inculcated in some of our  Islamists that (many of our intellectuals) were Taghuti and  anti-national. These intellectuals could have been of a great  deal of benefit to our country. But those instigations and  insinuations made our country deplete of its potential energy.  And who committed that treason? The KGB agents and Soviet  stooges! Take a look at Mr. Kianuri's (former head of the Tudeh  Party) memoirs. He so brazenly and just to please the Islamic  Republic changes history and where, for example, the British had  caused an event says it was the Americans who did it. They are  not genuine in whatever they do, not even Mr. Ehsan Tabari--who  some imagine was a man of knowledge, a thinker. This one too has  in all his historical analyses referred to religion as being  reactionary in natures. But when the Soviet Union's relations  with the Muslims turned warmer he called religion progressive.    "Our intellectuals are still more or less under the  influence  of this communist propaganda. Just look at the position some of  opponents of the Islamic Republic take. They say since the  Islamic Republic has developed a series of problems (which it  has) and has committed a series of extremisms (which it has),  one must stand up against it and deal with it negatively. This  is just a side-effect of that very communist propaganda. These  individuals must be told that the Islamic Republic's men may be  full of problems, ignorant and uninformed, but they surely take  no order from and are not dependent on foreigners. They may even  commit something wrong in the name of Islam, but still they can  be talked with, for they are independent."  <H5>  On how to give strength to national unity: </H5>   "I hope [the] leaders of the Islamic Republic will expand  their broadmindedness. And if they don't want to formally admit  their mistakes and errors, at least they could admit it to  themselves that they have gone wrong in some cases. What is now  threatening Iran more than anything else is the pressure exerted  on the educated class. Fortunately the Islamic Republic of Iran  has scored some success in the field of agriculture--that's not  to be denied. What the Construction Jihad has done is  praiseworthy. I have often said what keeps me interested in the  Islamic Republic, despite all its shortcomings, is primarily its  political independence and absence of reliance on any power.  This is such that after 200 years Iran now has a government that  is standing on its own feet, irrespective of the errors it may  commit. That the people in the street can now freely criticize  high prices and economic problems shows the situation of the  recent 10-15 years has made it possible for one to criticize.  All this is admirable. But the sort of pressure that is now  being exerted on a few million educated salary-earners is one of  the dangers threatening the character and existence of Iran. In  my view something like 40% of the country's economic woes  is  because of divided management and lack of harmony among various  bodies."  <H5>  On the Persian translation of his book: </H5>   "What I would like to ask the Guidance Ministry is not to  insist on footnotes being everywhere in the book. The book has  already been published in English, Spanish and Arabic. It's  about a month that the book has started to be distributed in  America. Its American publisher has written in his catalogue  that the book by Dr. Naraqi is a reply to Betty Mahmudi's book  `Not Without My Daughter'. When I first told Mr. Federico Mayor,  the director-general of UNESCO, that my book had been published  in Farsi he got up and said with surprise, "Bravo the Islamic  Republic. It has let a book which talks of prison and torture be  freely printed and published.' I have even heard that my book is  read in turn in the houses of some Islamic Republic officials.  Of course, I don't mean to conclude they make use of what I  write, but be sure that they have read it. Fortunately, I have  benefited by these gentlemen's favor. I have always said that  the communist climate threw me into jail and the mullahist  spirit (though some may not like the `word' mullah) saved me  from death. Now some might say that's why I'm defending the  Islamic Republic. But that's not so. I defend what is right.  That's because I know the Islamic Republic has nothing against  me. My writings all indicate I have always been mindful of  Islam, mysticism and national questions. What I expect from my  Muslim brothers is to learn from the earlier extremist mistakes  and put aside excessiveness and let the way open for dialogue  and discussion."</p>

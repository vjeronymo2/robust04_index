			<p>BFN     [Text] At 1730 on 29 March, a reasonably old medium-sized  van drove into Zhengzhou University. With bowls and chopsticks  in their hands, provincial CPC Secretary Li Changchun, and  Deputy Secretary Song Zhaosu entered the student dining hall to  have supper with the students.    Inside the Zhengzhou University Student Dining Hall, Li  Changchun, and Song Zhaosu lined up with students to buy rice  and dishes using coupons they had brought themselves. While  eating their supper, they made small talk with students from the  literature, history, and philosophy departments, asking them  about their monthly board expenses. They also asked them  whether they were satisfied with the rice and dishes supplied by  the dining hall. A male student eating his supper at the same  table as Li Changchun said: Our monthly board expenses are  about 100 yuan and monthly board expenses for female students  are about 70 yuan. Other students said that they were basically  satisfied with the rice and dishes supplied by the dining hall.    After taking their supper, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu  visited the cooks and management staff of the dining hall,  asking questions about managing the dining hall and passing on  the students' opinions and suggestions. Li Changchun said: I  have learned that students are basically satisfied with the  quality and price of food supplied by the dining hall. I hope  that you will continue to make efforts to handle messing  arrangements for students in an even better way. He encouraged  the cooks and management staff to do everything possible to  reduce costs of rice and dishes under the existing conditions to  ensure a balance between receipts and payments. He stressed  that surplus was unnecessary and that they must publish their  accounts regularly. Through their hard work, they would send  the warmth of the party and government to students.    When the students learned that the provincial CPC Committee  leaders were having supper with them, many crowded round and  reported of their own accord their study and life style to the  two leaders, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu, and also about the  situation in their native places. The two leaders cordially  encouraged them to study hard and fully improve themselves in  terms of political thinking and studies, so that they could make  their due contributions to the modernizations in their native  places after their graduation.    When it was getting dark, Li Changchun and Song Zhaosu went  to the offices of the university leaders to study with them ways  to further strengthen management and properly handle the messing  arrangements for students. Li Changchun urged university  leaders to do this from the high plane of training qualified  personnel for modernizations to ensure students' vigorous health  and vim and vigor, so that they can study well. They put  forward several specific demands. In the end they told the  university leaders to go to student dining hall very often to  observe and learn from real life. In doing so, they could have  heart-to-heart talks with the students, discover the real  situation, and heed their opinions in handling messing  arrangements for students in an even better way.</p>

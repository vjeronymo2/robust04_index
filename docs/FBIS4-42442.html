			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio [Forza Italia] has  responded to those members in the ruling coalition who accused  him of having favored the opposition parties by giving the  go-ahead to a new Senate opposition grouping. Scognamiglio said  that he was only following the rules laid down. He spoke to  Anna La Rosa:    [Begin recording] [La Rosa] Speaker, is it still possible to  bring together the broken pieces of the ruling coalition?    [Scognamiglio] If you are referring to the results of the  elections for the chairmanships of the Senate committees, then  the results were due to the numbers and an absence of agreement  between the ruling coalition and the opposition parties.  Therefore, these results could not have been avoided. It does  not seem to me that there are broken pieces of crockery in the  ruling coalition. The ruling coalition exists and it will have  difficulties in the Senate and this is the logic of democracy,  and of having respect for the rules.    [La Rosa] Umberto Bossi has accused you of being in some way  responsible for what happened, for having recognized this new  grouping [Sinistra Democratica]?    [Scognamiglio] I do not feel responsible, in fact, I am  happy  to be responsible for having applied the rules.    [La Rosa] What can be done now? How will it be possible to  govern? If you cannot govern the Senate, then how can you think  of governing the country?    [Scognamiglio] I think that if the ruling coalition produces  laws that are consensual and that have a consensus, then I  believe they will navigate the Senate without any problems.  However, if the Senate shows a willingness to place obstacles  in the way of the ruling coalition's right to govern the  country, then the ruling coalition will have to draw its own  conclusions.

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> KIMBLE HELPS LOYOLA SCORE SPECIAL WIN  </P> <P> Playing before a record crowd of 12,200 at Long Beach Arena, Loyola Marymount  took the court Friday night for the first time since teammate Hank Gathers died  March 4.  </P> <P> The Lions wore round patches with "44" -- Gathers' uniform number -- on their  jerseys and fans waved Hank Hankies.  </P> <P> The Lions seemed to finally get their emotions under control in the second half  and they surged past New Mexico State, 111-92, in the first round of the NCAA  tournament. The Lions will play defending champion Michigan Sunday.  </P> <P> Bo Kimble, Gathers' friend long before he became his Loyola teammate, seemed to  be pressing in the first half and drew his fourth foul with 4:45 to play in the  first half.  </P> <P> When he drew the fourth foul, Kimble said, "I went through a brief meditation  -- do not foul . . . do not foul."  </P> <P> It worked. Kimble finished with a Western Regional record 45 points, 33 in the  second half. He scored 35 points after drawing his fourth foul and added a  career-high 18 rebounds.  </P> <P> The Lions pulled away from a 46-46 halftime tie as Kimble keyed a 28-6 run in  the first six minutes of the second half. The lead grew to 84-56 on a  three-pointer by Kimble and the Aggies never got closer than the final margin.  </P> <P> Kimble also made good on a promise to shoot his first free throw left-handed to  honor his friend. His chance finally came with 14:46 to play, and he swished  the southpaw shot, then was mobbed by teammates.  </P> <P> Loyola outrebounded the Aggies, 51-35, and made 11 three-pointers, nine in the  second half. The Lions also forced 24 Aggie turnovers.  </P> <P> "They went after the ball like a one-eyed dog in a butcher shop," New Mexico  State Coach Neil McCarthy said of Loyola.  </P> <P> Westhead said he wasn't worried about leaving Kimble in with four fouls.  "That's my style," he said. McCarthy said: "I wasn't surprised. He's their main  man. I've seen Paul do that before."  </P> <P> Jeff Fryer added 23 points for the Lions, making five three-pointers and adding  six rebounds.  </P> <P> Forward Reggie Jordan led the Aggies with 22 points. Center James Anderson  added 16. New Mexico State finished the season at 26-5.  </P> <P> Sophomore center Chris Knight, taking over the starting position for Gathers,  scored the game's first basket as the Lions took an 11-1 lead. Knight finished  with six points and eight rebounds.  </P> <P> New Mexico State caught up midway through the first half, taking a 18-17 lead,  and the teams played evenly to the half.  </P> <P> Westhead made a shift in his trapping press after halftime, and the Lions  pulled away, improving to 24-5.  </P> <P> The Lions will play Michigan at 2 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> "When we took the floor I sensed a community spirit," Westhead said. "It was a  great feeling to have the community of Los Angeles supporting us."  </P></p>

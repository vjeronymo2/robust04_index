			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Survey shows UK firms lead on financial advice - Legal Briefs UK law firms dominate the global market for financial legal advice, according to Global Research, the independent market research division of Euromoney Publications. Global Research interviewed 221 heads of legal departments at financial institutions across Europe, North America and the Asia/Pacific region. More than 300 law firms received recommendations, but Clifford Chance, the UK's largest international law firm, emerged as clear leader, with 72 mentions. Second was Allen &amp; Overy with 47; third, Linklaters &amp; Paines with 35; and fourth, Baker &amp; McKenzie, the only firm with US origins in the top five, with 23 mentions. Slaughter and May was fifth with a score of 19. The research showed that most financial institutions will reduce the number of law firms they use over the next few years, increasing competition among lawyers for a bigger share of a growing volume of work. The amount of legal advice that institutions will need is also expected to rise by 20 per cent between 1994 and 1996 with a corresponding 10 per cent reduction in work done in-house.</p>

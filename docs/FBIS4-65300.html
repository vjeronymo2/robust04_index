			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by Luigi </F> Varalli in Rome on 11 May: "I Will Separate Politics and  Justice"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Varalli] Does the  Justice Ministry scare you?    [Biondi] No. I may have been naive, but I hoped to be able  to take a short rest.    [Varalli] What happened in the exchange with Previti [tipped  as justice minister]?    [Biondi] It all happened at 0400 hours yesterday. Prime  Minister Berlusconi called me and asked whether I was willing.  I had already stated my willingness; that seemed to me a  professional decision.    [Varalli] So had you already told Berlusconi that you  preferred Justice to Defense?    [Biondi] When he asked if I would be available at the  outset,  and if so, for what, I told him that I would prefer, if  possible, to deal with the things that I have always loved --  justice, defense, domestic affairs, or the environment. And  when the prime minister informed me that I would be going to the  Defense Ministry, I was very pleased.    [Varalli] So was it not a demotion?    [Biondi] No. I have been a defender ever since I was born,  and to work to ensure that military service is something more  than a drudgery seemed to me a fine task.    [Varalli] But then...    [Biondi] Then when he said, the Justice Ministry, I  certainly  did not feel as though I had been penalized.    [Varalli] Are you not rather afraid of the fact that you  will  have to deal with the judiciary, people with whom you are well  acquainted.    [Biondi] Judges must be beyond reproach, by virtue of the  profession they have chosen. I have had the great pleasure of  knowing many magistrates, whom I trust implicitly, even if their  political stances are different from mine.    [Varalli] What will be the first thing you do at the  ministry?    [Biondi] First, this afternoon, I will meet again with my  predecessor, Conso.    [Varalli] What next?    [Biondi] Then I will make a tour of all Italy's prisons.  Justice must be fair, and a sentence must be not only a sanction  but also a reeducation.    [Varalli] In recent weeks there has been some controversy  about the method for reelecting the CSM [Higher Magistrates  Council] -- a controversy which [President] Scalfaro silenced by  setting a date for the next election. What do you think about  this?    [Biondi] From the procedural viewpoint, I think that the  choice of the single-candidate system could provide better  guarantees. Be that as it may, the president did very well to  call an election, so to speak. If parliament wants to change  the law, it can do so.    [Varalli] The bribery scandals are another burning issue.    [Biondi] Certain investigations should start sooner. Be that  as it may, better late than never. Something is rotten in  Denmark, and it must be removed.    [Varalli] Are you in favor of a "whitewash" or at least of a  political solution to the matter?    [Biondi] I am an old Liberal in this respect, too. I believe  that amnesties and pardons after less than five years are things  of the past and to be avoided, because this creates partial  justice, and we must be very careful not to create inequality  among citizens before the law. It is necessary to think  carefully before reaching any decisions. In any case, I think  that it is better to follow procedural rather than legislative  criteria.    [Varalli] Have you already received many calls?    [Biondi] I did not know I was so popular throughout Italy. I  have received 6,000 telephone calls.    [Varalli] I meant calls from magistrates, from Borrelli, for  instance.    [Biondi] He will call me if he wants.    [Varalli] What about Di Pietro?    [Biondi] I heard from him about a month ago in connection  with a trial.    [Varalli] Now the tables are turned.    [Biondi] No, because there are no conflicts; only calm  assessments.</p>

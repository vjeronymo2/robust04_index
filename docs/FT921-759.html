			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Merloni profits rise to L11.7bn MERLONI Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group, reported a surge in net profits of 80 per cent to L11.7bn (Dollars 9m) last year, due to improved sales and an improved debt-equity ratio. Turnover of the company, known for its Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands, rose by 3.4 per cent to L1,192bn, while investment spending jumped almost 69 per cent to L59bn. Merloni, which has expanded quickly in recent years through acquisitions, had been blighted by general over-capacity in the European white goods industry and saddled in particular by its heavy borrowings used to finance growth. Net borrowings last year amounted to L194bn, compared with shareholders' funds of L212bn. However, results were less satisfactory at parent company level. The parent company slid into a L8.6bn loss last year after having broken even in 1990. Around L3.6bn of the loss stemmed from contributions to an early retirement scheme, which will continue to affect future earnings, and L7.9bn from advance depreciation. Nevertheless, the company has decided to tuck into reserves to pay a dividend of L45 for ordinary shares and L65 for savings shares. La Rinascente, Italy's biggest department store chain, owned by Fiat, raised group net profits by 4.7 per cent to L100.9bn last year. Sales climbed by 10 per cent to L4,595bn, excluding value-added tax. The improvement led the company to raise the dividend by L10 a share to L180 for ordinary shares and L140 for savings stock. Group net cash rose by L46.4bn to L529.3bn. Rinascente confirmed its commitment to an ambitious expansion programme, particularly for new hypermarkets, with three openings planned this year. The group's total network of stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets rose by 38 to 740, including affiliates, by the end of last year. In the first two months of this year, turnover rose by around 12 per cent to L721bn. Further growth will come through a L2,000bn investment programme to 1996, involving around 100 store openings, notably in southern Italy. Rinascente gained government approval last month for a restructuring programme linked to its new investment plans, with some existing stores being converted and others closed. Saffa, the boxboard and packaging group, reported a 24 per cent jump in group sales to around L640bn last year. Consolidated profits will not be released for some time, but Saffa said parent company earnings had risen to around L27bn.</p>

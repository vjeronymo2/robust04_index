			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports and editorials from the ROK vernacular press published  on 27 February on the agreement reached between the United  States and the DPRK in a working-level contact in New York on  the DPRK's acceptance of nuclear inspections.    The liberal daily TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,300-word  article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun under the  headline "Significance of the Settlement of the Inspection  Schedule Agreed Between North Korea and the United States."    The article notes that when the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] inspection team starts the nuclear inspection on 1  March, the ROK side will announce a "suspension" of the Team  Spirit exercise for this year, and thus the road toward the  third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be  "opened." Assessing the current agreement as a step in removing  another "stumbling block" to a solution of the North Korean  nuclear issue, the article stresses that the "stalemate" in the  past U.S.-DPRK talks was caused by a "lack of mutual trust" and  by "difference in views" on designating the date of the third  round of high-level talks and on the "issue of North-South  dialogue." North Korea tried to "step up" the dialogue with the  United States and to "exclude" the ROK while "delaying" the  North-South dialogue, but finally agreed that the United States  announce on 1 March its position that "it will not respond to  the third round of high-level talks unless the exchange of  special envoys between the North and the South is realized."  Noting that this agreement was made on the condition that "if  the South proposes dialogue for the exchange of envoys, the  North will respond," the article pays attention to the North  Korean attitude on North-South dialogue and to the "degree of  progress" in the dialogue up until high-level talks are held.    The moderate daily CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word editorial entitled "This Is Only the Beginning of the  North Korean Nuclear Issue." Noting the recent agreement as a  "fortunate achievement" attained through dialogue, the editorial  says that North Korea has been seized with "a sense of crisis  and the sense of persecution" in view of its claim that "the  IAEA put forward unreasonable demands" to North Korea. The  editorial notes that the U.S. Government revealed its position  that "missile export, terrorism, the human rights issue and even  the conventional military power" of North Korea must be  "discussed" before completely accepting the North Korean  demands, and that "difficult problems," which may be raised in  the future due to North Korea's act of "picking a quarrel,"  should be resolved through "patience" and "efforts."    The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,300- word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik under the headline  "The U.S.- North Korea Agreement and Prospects for North-South  Relations." Paying specific attention to the content regarding  the exchange of North-South special envoys included in the  recent U.S.-North Korea agreement, the article urges the holding  of the special envoys exchange "for discussion of the nuclear  issue" and "for realizing a North-South summit." Noting that our  government called on the United States "absolutely not to  concede" to North Korea on the principle on the exchange of  special envoys during the talks in New York, the article  predicts that the exchange will be realized even "as a matter of  formality" because it is North Korea's "commitment" that should  be fulfilled within a little over "20 days." However, the  article concludes, "the visibility is still poor."    The moderate daily KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  1,200- word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim  Hak-sun under the headline "North Korea-U.S. Negotiations Are  Now on the `Political Table.'" Explaining the process in past  North Korea-U.S. talks on the nuclear inspection issue,  including the "highly strained" 25 February contact in New York,  the article says that the two sides set "21 March" as the date  of the third round of high-level talks, because at least "two or  three weeks" are required for "proving the continuity of nuclear  safeguards" even after the IAEA inspection starts, and because  the ROK and the United States believed that this length of time  is needed for "evaluating the sincerity in accepting the nuclear  inspection" and for realizing the exchange of North- South  special envoys. The article pointed out that both the ROK and  the United States reportedly "have driven a wedge" on the road  toward the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks so  that the talks are "canceled" in the event that North Korea does  not show "sincerity" in the nuclear inspection and exchange of  special envoys. Therefore, North Korea will not carry out  "harmful acts" to the third talks. The article concludes that  the U.S.-North Korea agreement means that the two sides are now  moving toward "the full-scale political negotiation stage."    The economy-specialized daily SEOUL MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN  publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by reporters Yi  Tong-chu and So Yang-won, under the headline "Significance in  the Settlement of North Korea-U.S. Working-level Contact." The  article points out that at the contact, North Korea made a  "somewhat unusual demand" that the content of the agreement be  announced in the form of a "joint statement," noting this shows  North Korea's persistent "adherence" to the third round of  U.S.-North Korea talks. The article refers to remarks of a  relevant government official that "the most serious stumbling  block" during the U.S.-North Korea negotiations was "the issue  of exchange of special envoys" and that North-South relations  will be solved by the "parties concerned" prompted by President  Kim Yong-sam's recent "summit proposal through the exchange of  special envoys." The North and the South are expected to discuss  concretely "the qualifications and missions of special envoys  and the time and method of their exchange" during a  working-level contact to be held "within this week." The article  points out a government official's "optimistic view" that "the  special envoy of either the North or the South will be able to  visit the other side before 21 March, when the third round of  U.S.-North Korea talks are held." However, the article notes  that the North may come to the North-South dialogue "without  attaching any importance to it" because North Korea only adheres  to "dialogue with the United States."    The government-supported daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on  page  3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "We Watch the Time After The  U.S.- North Korea Nuclear Agreement." Pointing to people's  "depressed feeling" despite "the sign of the situation moving  toward the right direction" with the agreement, the editorial  notes that this is because North Korea's "nuclear transparency"  cannot be guaranteed by the forthcoming IAEA inspections alone  and because the issue of "special inspection of two undeclared  sites--the cause of commotions--" is left as a pending question.  Therefore, the editorial stresses, the "task" henceforth is the  implementation of "special inspection" of these facilities.    The editorial points out that "how sincerely North Korea  will  cooperate with the IAEA inspection; what the result of the  forthcoming ordinary inspection would be, and what the North  side's attitude on North-South working contact for special  envoys exchange is, will be the "targets" of the people's  attention in deciding North Korea's "true intention."  Emphasizing that the North's acceptance of "special inspection"  and "mutual inspection" would be an important evidence of North  Korea's "good intention," the editorial hopes that with the  acceptance of these two inspections, the North's "nuclear  transparency" should be ensured.    The leftist-leaning daily HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page  3  a 1,700-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong  Yon-chu, under the headline "Road Opened for Full-scale North  Korea-U.S. Political Talks." Noting an important "breakthrough"  was made toward the nuclear inspection and the third round of  high-level talks after the agreement was adopted, the article  regards the agreement as an "important milestone" for  full-fledged political talks between North Korea and the United  States, and as a "qualitative change" in relations between the  two countries, thus exercising "fundamental influence" on the  Korean peninsula and its neighboring countries. The article  points out that the U.S. position stressed the "insurance of  transparency in the North Korean nuclear issue" and that North  Korea attempted to "tightly hold" the nuclear card in an effort  to improve "political and economic relations" with the United  States. The article emphasizes that regardless of the remarks of  some people that "nothing has basically changed in the North  Korean nuclear issue," this issue is advancing toward a "smooth,  positive solution" judging from "the overall situation." The  article then refers to the remarks of North Korean Ambassador Ho  that during the forthcoming third round of high-level talks,  "the complete return of North Korea to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty; North Korea's implementation of the  nuclear safeguards accord; the U.S. abandonment of hostile  policy against North Korea and the suspension of its nuclear  threat, and other overall political, diplomatic and economic  issues" will be discussed. Pointing to some people's allegation  on the "necessity" of the North-South summit, the article pays  attention to how the North Korean side would "respond" to  President Kim Yong-sam's recent summit proposal.</p>

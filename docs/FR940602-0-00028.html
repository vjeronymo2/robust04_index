			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31622), USEPA published the final rulemaking revising the particulate matter increments so that they are measured in terms of respirable particulate matter. As a result of the rulemaking, the PSD increments and NAAQS for particulate matter will be measured by the same indicator. The final rulemaking also establishes the method by which USEPA will delete TSP area designations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated at 58 FR 31635, the deletion of TSP area designations for each State will occur at the same time that USEPA (1) approves a State's revised PSD program containing the respirable particulate matter increments, (2) promulgates the PM&hyph;10 increments into a State's SIP when the State chooses not to adopt the increments on their own, or (3) approves a State's request for delegation of PSD responsibility under &sect;52.21(u). For States already having delegated authority to implement the Federal PSD regulations, the rulemaking states that ``USEPA will eliminate the TSP designations when the PM&hyph;10 increments become effective under &sect;52.21 on June 3, 1994.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA has delegated to the State of Ohio the authority to implement the PSD program. The delegation agreement provides for automatic adoption of the revised respirable particulate matter increments once the increment becomes effective. On August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41218), USEPA proposed to approve the State of Ohio's regulations providing for attainment of respirable particulate matter air quality standards in areas that are currently designated nonattainment and unclassifiable for respirable particulate matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA interprets section 107(d)(4)(B) of the CAA to allow elimination of all TSP area designations once the respirable particulate matter increments are promulgated. The respirable particulate matter increments will become effective June 3, 1994 and would automatically be delegated for implementation by the State of Ohio. USEPA finds that the promulgation of the respirable particulate matter increments and USEPA's proposed approval of Ohio's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respirable particulate matter SIP fulfills the criteria for eliminating TSP area designations altogether.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the OEPA requested redesignation of all areas in the State, except Cuyahoga County and Jefferson County, from TSP nonattainment to attainment, USEPA believes that it is administratively more efficient to delete TSP area designations totally since the deletion eliminates the need for two rulemaking proceedings. If USEPA were to redesignate the TSP nonattainment areas at this time, the Agency would then have to promulgate another rulemaking on or after June 3, 1994, when the respirable particulate matter PSD increments become effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because, due to the change from TSP to respirable particulate matter under the particulate matter regulatory scheme, the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective June 3, 1994 unless, within 30 days of its publication, notice is received that adverse critical comments will be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If such notice of comments is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent notices. A notice would be published withdrawing the final action, and another notice would begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

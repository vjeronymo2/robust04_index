			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Slovaks reach coalition deal Mr Vladimir Meciar will form a coalition government in Slovakia with extreme right and left-wing parties on Sunday, more than two months after he won national elections. Mr Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) had previously planned to form a government only after the 1995 state budget was passed. The HZDS - which won 35 per cent of the vote in October's election on a populist-nationalist platform - said it would sign a pact with the extreme right-wing Slovak National party (SNS) and left-wing Slovak Workers' party. The parties have agreed that the HZDS will contribute 10 ministers, the Workers' party three and SNS two, the state news agency, TASR, reported. Mr Meciar is expected to return as prime minister after being ousted in March by a parliamentary vote of no confidence. He stunned the caretaker government last month by pushing through a series of controversial laws, effectively giving his coalition parties control of the state broadcast media and state intelligence service. The all-night session also reversed 50 privatisation decisions made by the outgoing cabinet before the elections.</p>

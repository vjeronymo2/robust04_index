			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "May Demonstrations by </F> Intransigent Opposition Have Shaken Authorities"]    [Text] The so-called "working people's May  demonstrations," which ended with the burning of a Russian flag  and calls by A. Rutskoy and his associates to overthrow the  present "police" regime before the 50th anniversary of Victory  Day, have not passed unnoticed in the Kremlin. V. Shumeyko,  speaker of the upper chamber of parliament, came to see  President B. Yeltsin about this incident 17 May, and he was  closely followed by Premier V. Chernomyrdin.    V. Shumeyko told your IZVESTIYA correspondent that during  their discussion about the problem of ensuring stability in  society, opinion had been unanimous: Any actions by  intransigent elements that violate Russian Federation laws and  the Russian Federation Constitution must be stopped. For  example, with regard to the burning of the national flag: Video  footage showed specific individuals, and the Prosecutor's Office  should initiate criminal proceedings immediately. The same  applies to A. Rutskoy's appeals. Extremely gross violations of  the Constitution and Russian laws are plainly evident, and these  cannot be allowed to occur without some sort of reaction from  the authorities.    Of course, the problem of meeting the commitments agreed  under the Treaty of Accord was also discussed, V. Shumeyko said.  At issue are the principles of establishing an observer  commission to implement this document. Unless both chambers of  parliament take part in forming the commission, the operation  will be impossible. It is most likely that the commission will  include representatives of the most influential and largest  political forces. The commission chairman, I think, should be a  politically neutral person who is prepared to accept proposals  from any political group. Academician Topornin figures in this  list, but I would not like to deflect him from his business in  the Public Chamber, V. Shumeyko stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  spoke with newsmen after receiving Samdech Son Sann at the  Foreign Ministry this morning. He said Samdech Son Sann  currently holds the post of counselor to King Norodom Sihanouk.  Son Sann is a senior Cambodian citizen, but now has no  political involvement in Cambodia. His duty is merely to advise  King Sihanouk. Prasong said Son Sann was on his way to a  meeting in Paris and called on him as an old friend.    According to the foreign minister, Son Sann said the  roundtable to be held in Pyongyang tomorrow will be a good way  for the Cambodian leaders to exchange views. The leaders of  various Cambodian factions are already in Pyongyang and the  meeting will be chaired by Samdech Sihanouk. Prasong said Son  Sann hopes that the meeting will be successful and will result  in peace in Cambodia. Prasong said Son Sann understands  Thailand's good wishes to see Cambodian people live in peace.    Asked by newsmen about the disappearance of two UN officials  near the Cambodian border in Sisaket Province, the foreign  minister said he received a report that the Suranari Force was  searching for them. However, the missing officials reportedly  surfaced in Phnom Penh. The Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh has been  instructed to verify this development.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Don Farrell - Obituary DON FARRELL, former chief sub-editor of the Financial Times UK Companies Desk, died at the weekend after a short illness. Don, aged 60, joined the FT in 1960 after working for Exchange Telegraph, the general and financial news agency. He had to relinquish his position as chief sub after a heart attack in the early eighties and in the following years developed another important role on the paper. He became a mentor to many young journalists, being an expert on the nuts and bolts of profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. This knowledge he would freely impart in a patient and kind way, with time for everybody. In his later years, Don became an inveterate traveller, going to America and Australia, with a renewed zest for life. He was an ardent sports fan, following Arsenal for football and Middlesex for cricket, and his interest in the pleasure aspects of life were wide-ranging, including a keen interest in motoring. Don was a private man and an FT institution in his own right. He was due to retire at the end of the year and was looking forward to spending more time with his family. He will be sorely missed by us all.</p>

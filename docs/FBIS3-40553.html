			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takeshi Osawa, head, Technology Department, </F> Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc.]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   During the four years since the last Report on the Prospects  of the Space Industry in Japan was published in 1988, the  environment surrounding the international space industry has  changed drastically with the great changes in the international  situation, including the unification of the two Germanys and the  collapse of the Soviet Union. With these changes, international  efforts toward the development of space seem to be shifting from  competition between the two superpowers of the United States and  the former Soviet Union to joint efforts for the development of  scientific technology for peaceful applications. The technology  will be used for the preservation of the earth's environment and  for other purposes that will benefit international society.  These four years also witnessed the entry of the People's  Republic of China into the international satellite launching  business using their rockets.    By taking these changes into account, the Society of  Japanese  Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC) has compiled a report on the  Prospects of the Space Industry in Japan for FY92. The work of  compiling the latest report was subsidized by the Japan  Auto-Race Association, a special public organization.    The report summarizes the changes that have taken place in  international society in connection with the endeavors in space  development and the measures taken by the Japanese government to  promote the domestic space industry. The report describes the  current situation with respect to the development of rockets and  other space transport systems, and the problems with promoting  these endeavors. The report also refers to the importance of  nurturing the space industry to promote space development, to  the importance of expanding the market for the industry, and to  the necessity of promoting international cooperation and  contributions. Following is an outline of the latest report.  <H5>  Environment Surrounding Japanese Space Industry </H5>   1. Changes in International Situation    The international environment surrounding Japan has changed  drastically in the last few years. Because of the need to  promote the commercialization of space development by  alleviating financial burdens, and because of the need to  promote the development of space technology to enable better  observation of the earth, e.g., for monitoring the earth's  environment, the trend is toward promoting international  cooperation and dividing the burden, with those countries able  to afford it assuming a greater burden.    In the United States, the Clinton administration has placed  top priority on the reconstruction of the domestic economy. As  for his administration's space development policy, there are  some analysts who expect that the emphasis will shift to  smaller-scale scientific efforts, such as the development of  earth environment-related technologies, by drastically cutting  the budget for the construction of a permanent space base as  well as a space station and for preparations for a journey to  Mars.    In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the  commercialization of space development efforts has progressed  under the freer economic policy introduced by the new  government. These days it is becoming a popular practice for  other countries to access the space technologies accumulated by  the former communist state through various means. The country's  space policy and other space-related activities, including  negotiations with foreign countries, is guided by the Russian  Space Bureau, founded in 1992. The relationships between CIS and  neighboring countries are still unstable.    In Europe, the budget for space development has been  curtailed due to the economic recessions in the member countries  of the European Space Agency (ESA). This has been aggravated by  cuts in the monetary contributions to the ESA by unified  Germany. Germany has been forced to cut contributions due to the  deteriorating domestic economy, which was caused mainly by the  merger of the two Germanys. Under the circumstances, European  countries are reviewing their space development policies by  placing greater emphasis on promoting international cooperation.    In other parts of the globe, civil war broke out over racial  or territorial confrontations in a number of countries and  regions after they had been freed from the restraints of the  superpowers following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In  the meantime, the Gulf War demonstrated the usefulness and  effectiveness of space technology, as represented by the  reconnaissance and communications satellites.    The Arche and Munich summits confirmed the importance of  tackling the deterioration of the earth's environment and other  global problems by promoting the use of earth observation and  remote sensing technologies. The importance of environmental  observation from space will continue to increase in the future.    2. Recent Developments in Japanese Space Industry    Sales in the Japanese space industry in 1991 stood at  approximately &yen;294.5 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent  over the preceding year. The number of people working in the  industry and related industries was 11,060 as of the end of  March 1992, a gain of 7.2 percent over the year before.    The major events and developments that have taken place in  the space industry in recent years include:    (1) Agreement in the trade negotiations between Japan and  the  United States to settle the issues covered by the Super 301  Article requires that Japan remove import barriers on satellites  which the Japanese government or domestic organizations directly  or indirectly under government supervision procure for purposes  other than R&amp;D. This will expose the domestic space industry  to  greater international competition.    (2) With the success of the experiments conducted by the  Japanese astronaut Mamoru Mori in September 1992 aboard an  American space shuttle, the fundamental material creation  experiment (FMPT) was completed. Experiments in a weightless  environment were also conducted aboard the Russian spaceship Mir  in January 1992 and by launching NASDA's small TR-IA rocket in  August 1992. In 1991, the construction of the world's highest  free-fall experimental tower was completed in Kamisunagawa Town  on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.    (3) Until recently, the demand for channels from  broadcasting  and communications satellites was brisk for several years.  However, the demand for additional channels by communications  satellite has declined sharply in recent years due to the  economic recession. Private broadcasting companies, which are  using the communications satellite, are losing money because of  higher operating costs, including higher program production  costs, and they are now trying to reconstruct their businesses.    (4) Tokyo and Washington concluded an agreement in 1989  about  mutual cooperation in the construction of a space station.  However, a delay of the space station program seems inevitable  due to the budgetary constraints in the United States in recent  years. We must continue to monitor the developments regarding  budgetary matters in the United States.    (5) In general, the commercial use of satellites will  continue to expand in the coming years. The GPS navigation  system for passenger car drivers is an example of such a service  being offered using satellites.    3. Developments in Space Industries of Other  Countries    The space development budgets in Japan, the United States  and  European ESA member countries in 1991 totaled &yen;2.5309  trillion, a gain of 66.6 percent over 1988 when the last report  was compiled. Of the total, Japan accounted for 7 percent and  the United States for 77 percent. The following are the major  events and developments that have taken place in the space  industries of a number of foreign countries.    (1) Cooperation between the United States and Russia  progressed in the field of space-related matters. In 1991 the  two countries signed the START agreement. In 1992 they announced  an agreement to launch a joint space program. In addition, they  launched a joint business to be operated on a commercial basis.    (2) The Clinton administration, which came to power in  January 1993, expressed its intention the following month to cut  the space project budget substantially in an effort to  reconstruct the domestic economy.    (3) Russia has been promoting the commercial utilization of  space technology to reconstruct its deteriorating domestic  economy. The People's Republic of China, armed with its Long  March rockets, has entered the international satellite launching  business.    (4) The ESA ministerial conference held in November 1992  decided to put off some of its space programs, including the  development of the Hermes space shuttle. Instead, the conference  decided to promote an earth environment monitoring program and  some other space endeavors in which it will be easier to produce  tangible results.    (5) In October 1990, INTELSAT modified part of its agreement  to promote liberalization of the international video data  communications and VSAT service.    (6) Ariane Space Corporation has captured 60 percent of the  international satellite launching business market in terms of  the number of satellites scheduled for launching by offering low  launching prices. The company has cut launch costs by mass  producing rockets. Ariane Space is developing more powerful  rockets.    (7) The formation of a larger company by merger has been a  popular trend among European companies in recent years.    (8) The method of launching a satellite from a B-52 plane,  which was employed by private companies in the United States in  1990, is drawing attention as an economical way of launching  satellites.    4. Current Situation in Japan's Space Industry    (1) The following is a list of the major space development  projects being undertaken by the Japanese government:    (a) The Science and Technology Agency is developing  technology testing satellites, systems for use in space  experiments (space station experiment module JEM, etc.) and  space transport systems (H-II rocket, etc.).    (b) The Education Ministry is promoting the development of a  number of types of scientific satellites and the rockets to  launch them.    (c) The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  is developing remote sensing satellites (earth resource  exploration satellite No 1 (ERS-1), etc.), space environment  utilization satellites (SFU, etc.) and some other types of  satellites.    (d) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is  developing communications/broadcast technology satellites  (COMETS) and tropic rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellites.    (e) The Transport Ministry is operating the geostationary  meteorological observation satellite No 4 (GMS-4).    (f) The Environment Agency is developing various types of  sensors for installation on earth environment observation  satellites.    (2) The following are the major projects in which the  Japanese government is involved that will promote the  utilization of space:    (a) MITI is a member of D-2, promoting international  contributions to space endeavors.    (b) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is studying  the construction of an Asia-Pacific satellite communications  system as part of its international cooperation efforts.    (c) The Home Affairs Ministry has been promoting a plan to  improve regional satellite communications networks since 1990.  The plan is mainly being carried out by the Local Autonomy  Satellite Communication Organization to improve the  communications system for fire fighting, disaster prevention and  administrative information.    (d) The National Police Agency is using CS-3 [communications  satellite] service for obtaining image information regarding  accidents and disasters.    (e) The National Land Agency is using satellites for  disaster  prevention communications and to obtain data on the utilization  conditions of land using remote sensing technology.    (3) Financial Assistance    Private companies have been playing an increasingly  important  role in space development efforts. The government policy  guidelines on space development recommend the introduction of  financial and tax measures to promote space development by  private companies. In line with this, financial assistance is  being extended by the Japan Development Bank and other  establishments.    Specifically, low interest loans are available for those  companies investing money for the introduction of machines to  produce, test, inspect and transport space-related equipment or  systems. The loans are also available to encourage the  construction of facilities for storing the hardware manufactured.    In addition, there is a tax relief system (high-tech tax  system), under which a company which acquired equipment or  machines for use in the research and development of key  technology for space development, such as a psuedo-space  environment test system, is entitled to a tax reduction.  <H5>  Guidelines for Developing Space Industry </H5>   1. Industrial Scale    The scale of the Japanese space industry is far smaller than  that of the United States and some other countries. Further  development of the Japanese space industry hinges on our efforts  in the coming years. The following can be considered as factors  hindering the expansion of the industry.    (1) The effort to expand the industry's activity calls for  long-term collaboration among scientists and engineers  specializing in many technological fields. Under the current  circumstances in which the scale of the industry is small with  few projects being undertaken, it is impossible for a single  R&amp;D  establishment to secure many able specialists on its own.    (2) The fact that space development in Japan is being led by  the government and public establishments causes the demand from  the private sector to be lacking. Even if an increase in demand  from the private sector is seen, some uneasiness over the fact  that the industry must continue to rely heavily on government  assistance will remain.    The percentage of the budget for developing and launching  satellites, both in Japan and abroad, is still low compared to  that of the total space industry. In Japan, all satellites  launched to date have been newly developed. In order to continue  developing new satellites, it will be necessary for the domestic  industry to keep many engineers for a long time. This will be  impossible for the industry, which is still unable to get along  on its own. To promote investment in R&amp;D resources, it is  particularly important for the government to continue fostering  the industry. It will also be important for Japan to participate  more actively in the future in the programs being promoted by  the consortiums of European and U.S. establishments.    In the meantime, of those satellites launched between 1990  and 1993, 55 percent were launched by the United States, 26  percent by European countries, and 9 percent by Japan. The  average per annum launching costs worldwide are expected to  reach $4.5 billion for the century. For Japan, the average is  expected to stand at approximately &yen;50 billion at the most,  even if unreserved efforts against the restraining factors, as  described above, are exerted. This will make it even more  critical for Japan to promote the international division of  burdens encountered in launching satellites.    The space industry can produce demands for completely new  goods and services among the related industries, such as the  cases seen in the communications and broadcasting industries.  For the communications and satellite broadcasting industries, in  particular, the space industry has generated great economic  benefits that have led to the growth of other related domestic  industries. To promote the growth further, the communications  and broadcasting industries must step up their efforts to that  end. However, government assistance is also needed to nurture  these and other related industries.    2. Space Industry as a Strategic Industry, and Budget  for the Industry    One strategically important thing if Japan is going to  promote the growth of the space industry in the coming years is  how to promote international cooperation by maintaining  flexibility in space endeavors.    The political environment in the world has changed greatly  in  recent years, as has the international space development  environment in terms of mounting competition and the increasing  need to promote international cooperation. Historically, space  development has been promoted: (1) to secure international  leadership, (2) to ensure security in the economic and defense  fields, (3) to promote the development of services and  technology, and (4) to deal with matters of global interest.  Under these changing international situations surrounding the  space industry, Japan must promote the formation of a more  comprehensive national space policy that will not be confined to  the development of science and technology.    In satellite development, the global interest factor assumes  particular significance. As evidenced by the operation of WEDOS,  it is important for Japan to use its money and technology to  promote projects that will bring benefits to the world through  environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, and other  satellite services.    As for the development of space transport systems, it is  important to go ahead with it flexibly to ensure continued  progress in the development effort. The issues Japan must tackle  in this effort include: (1) securing competitiveness in  production costs, (2) keeping the technology up-to-date, and (3)  establishing a new frame of international cooperation.    It is expected that the building of an infrastructure in the  space industry will become the main target of Japan's space  development efforts. Taking this into consideration, it will be  important for Japan to define its intentions in promoting such  development, to set goals, and to work out a long-term vision  for development.    The government's budget for space development has recorded  an  annual increase of approximately 10 percent in the past few  years. The expenditures for development must be increased to  promote space development programs, including satellite  launching for environmental monitoring. Japan lags far behind  the United States and some European countries in terms of the  amount of money allocated for space development.    3. Need for Development of Private-Sector Demand    Japan's space industry currently has very few demands from  private companies. To promote the growth of the space industry,  it is essential that the government expand the space program and  introduce measures that will lead to an increase in the demand  from private companies. These efforts will generate quality  through mass production, improved reliability, and better  customer service. These improvements, in turn, will lead to  contact with a larger number of customers, which could help the  space industry better understand the customers' needs and  develop more demand--resulting in the strengthening of the  industrial infrastructure. The development tasks that private  companies can perform well should be commissioned to them. By so  doing, more private-sector money will flow into the space  industry. This will then make it possible for the government to  channel more money to new space projects.    The privatization of the satellite communications business  can be thought of as a method for expanding the demand generated  by the private sector. However, taking into consideration the  fact that the satellites that have been used by satellite  business concerns have been imported from the United States,  privatization has not benefited much from them. Rather, economic  benefits have been extended to related industries. Since the  increase in the number of customers will lead to the growth of  the satellite market, the government should consider not only  extending assistance to private concerns, but also to stimulate  the private sector demand by, for example, the government itself  acting as a major user.    The demand for space transport systems from the private  sector in Japan is still very small, and little effort has been  made to increase this demand. However, an organization designed  to develop the private-sector market has been set up, and  positive results are expected to be forthcoming in the near  future. To increase the private-sector demand for space  transport systems, it will be necessary to (1) develop a variety  of low-cost rockets, (2) promote the transfer of space  technology to the private sector and make it easier to use a  rocket firing center by taking legislative measures, (3) create  an environment which will enable low-cost rockets to be  developed, (4) study the possibility of using rocket firing  centers in foreign countries, and (5) expand the launch window.    Under the current situation in the space industry, tangible  benefits will not be forthcoming by promoting the development of  the space industry infrastructure. However, it is expected that  indirect benefits will be brought about by promoting research on  the instruments and other measurement/observation systems that  will be used on satellites.    4. International Cooperation and Contributions    In order for Japan to contribute to international space  endeavors, it is important for her to be equipped with the  ability to participate actively in international projects by  maintaining her subjectivity. As for international cooperation,  Japan must promote the development of a key technology by  focusing on a specific field. Japan can contribute to the  international endeavor by generating useful results in this  development effort.    In the fields of space science research and space  development, international cooperation has been actively  promoted in past years, and will continue to be promoted in the  future.    The launching of satellites for environmental monitoring and  disaster prevention will benefit, in particular, the peoples of  the Asian and Pacific regions. In the meantime, the low-altitude  satellite communications project to aid in the navigation of  earth-surface transport systems is a vast, costly undertaking  and, thus, will offer a good opportunity for Japanese private  companies to participate in international cooperation.    If Japan is to be able to contribute to international space  endeavors and to produce tangible results in international  cooperation, it is vital that she have commercially-usable  rockets.    In the effort to improve the space industry infrastructure,  too, it is important for Japan to be able to present  constructive proposals and extend support to  technologically-developing countries.    For the time being, Japan must make an effort to equip  itself  with the ability required to actively participate in the  international projects currently being promoted jointly by the  United States, Russia and Europe in order to improve the space  industry infrastructure. As for the on-going space station  program, any shift in U.S. space development policy will affect  Japan. In preparation for such a shift, it is important for  Japan (1) to take the necessary precautionary measures to  minimize the adverse effects of such a policy change on Japan's  space program, (2) to determine the appropriate level of burden  it can afford when the burden of promoting an international  project is divided among the countries concerned, and (3) to  secure separate operating funds.    In order to promote international cooperation, it is  essential that Japan establish its own technology and clarify  the R&amp;D resources it can offer, then expand the range of  resources it can offer in all fields involving satellites, space  transport systems and the space industry infrastructure. At the  same time, it is also important to clarify its policy and the  role it will be able to play in the internationalization of  space development efforts. In addition, it is necessary to  expand the market for the domestic space industry.    Japan must make an effort to contribute to the Asian-Pacific  regions by making the ideas and technologies developed by Japan  available to the peoples of these regions to help them in space  development and the utilization of space technology.    At the same time, Japan must explore the possibility of  accepting cooperation and contributions from foreign countries.    When a private company in Japan introduces a technology  being  developed by a foreign company, it will become necessary for the  Japanese government to extend financial assistance or assistance  in other forms to the development effort.    5. Removal of Development-Impeding Factors and  Introduction of Development-Promoting Measures    The following are the principal factors believed to be  hindering progress in the Japanese space industry:    (1) Research for space development has been confined to  comparatively narrow scientific fields, such as space science.    (2) In fields in which the space industry can get along on  its own, the industry has been exposed to tough competition from  similar fields in existing industries.    (3) The fact that the government budget and contracting  method employed by governmental organizations in procuring  hardware has not been sufficient to cover the development risks  involved when investing huge amounts of money has discouraged  private companies from offering their R&amp;D resources to space  development.    (4) The demand for satellites and rockets has been very  small, making it impossible to use volume production to cut  launch costs.    (5) The agreement reached in the Super 301 trade  negotiations  between Japan and the United States has resulted in exposing the  domestic space industry to tougher international competition.    (6) The lack of rocket firing centers, the narrow launch  window, and the insufficient conditions of the satellite  tracking ground station network have limited the number of  satellites and rockets launched. These limitations have impeded  the development of the domestic market, particularly the  private-sector market, for Japan's space industry.    In tackling these problems, the following measures can be  considered:    (1) Promoting the space industry as a national strategy by  linking it with Japan's international cooperation program.  Encouraging the private sector to extend stronger support.    (2) Promoting the participation of private companies in  international space operation-related consortiums to make them  more competitive internationally. Promoting cost cutting through  volume production and other means.    (3) Realizing an administrative system in which it is  possible to meet changes in domestic as well as international  situations promptly. The introduction of governmental measures,  including financial assistance and tax breaks, to promote the  commercialization of the space industry and private-sector  demand. It is necessary to introduce a budgetary and contract  system that will be appropriate for promoting long-term  development projects.    (4) Making it possible for private companies to use the  R&amp;D  facilities held by governmental establishments at reasonable  prices, just like in the United States and Europe.    (5) The serialized development of satellites, and promotion  of medium- and long-term projects. In particular, the promotion  of such development by having the bus instrument related to the  mission instrument.    (6) Securing an international consensus prior to going ahead  with an international project which will benefit the world  through cooperative efforts. The prompt implementation of an  international project.    (7) Facilitating satellite launching by using rocket firing  centers abroad and by launching from aircraft.    (8) Cutting the production costs of rockets.    (9) Introducing measures designed to reduce the investment  risks for private companies.    (10) The introduction of legislative measures to protect  satellite launching concerns from financial liabilities  resulting from launch-related accidents.    (11) Standardizing the instruments and machines used in the  space industry. Improving and automating orbital maintenance  services and introducing robots.    (12) Securing able manpower and training. Stepping up  publicity for space industry activities to help secure  researchers and engineers.  <H5>  Epilogue </H5>   These 12 measures must be introduced or taken by Japan in  order to promote space development.    To ensure the continued progress of the Japanese space  industry, it is important for the government and private  companies to cooperate with each other in promoting their  endeavors by introducing the necessary measures, including the  promotion of international cooperation.    The author concludes this article by hoping that the  proposals made in this report will lead to Japan's making  greater contributions to benefit the world by promoting the  development of science and space technology, and that this, in  turn, will contribute to further progress being made in Japan's  space industry.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Canker Likely Cause of Cypress Tree Problem  </P> <P> QUESTION: What is killing my cypress trees, and what can I do about it?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Very likely your trees are succumbing to cypress canker, a disease that  is devastating cypress trees in the Southland. According to Bill Nelson, a tree  expert at Pacific Tree Farms, the disease is usually limited to Monterey or  Leyland cypress trees.  </P> <P> Although there are some expensive treatments that will prolong the tree's  agony, once the disease is established, the tree's days are numbered.  </P> <P> Nelson suggests that you replace them with Tecate, Arizona or Italian  cultivars, all of which have demonstrated resistance to cypress canker. Nelson  also notes that regular watering and proper fertilizing will help prevent  cypress canker on susceptible varieties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Which Chili Pepper Wins as the Hottest?  </P> <P> Q: My friend and I have a bet on over which is the world's hottest chili  pepper. He says it is the Tabasco; I say it is the serrano. Who wins?  </P> <P> A: Neither of you. The habanero is the world's hottest pepper. This torrid  delight is many times hotter than either the Tabasco or serrano. If you want to  see for yourself, some supermarkets are now carrying the powdered form of this  incendiary pepper.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Yorker Erred in Adding Lime to Soil  </P> <P> Q: We moved here last year from Upstate New York where we had always had  marvelous vegetable gardens. The garden we planted here last spring produced  poor results although we cultivated, fertilized and limed the soil and watered  regularly. What went wrong?  </P> <P> A: You made a common mistake that gardeners from other areas of the country  often make when they move to Southern California -- you limed the soil.  Although this is standard practice in many areas of the country where the soil  is too acid, in most of the Southland the soil is too alkaline. Instead of an  application of lime, most of our soils require an addition of peat moss or soil  sulfur to raise the acidity. Bill Sidnam  </P></p>

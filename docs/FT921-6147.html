			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Attempt to jail Nadir postponed AN ATTEMPT by creditors of Mr Asil Nadir, chairman of Polly Peck International, to have him jailed for his alleged contempt of court has been delayed. The creditors, owed about Pounds 80m, allege that Mr Nadir broke an undertaking to the court not to dispose of assets. Yesterday Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Nadir, argued that the undertaking had ended by the time of the alleged breach and that there was therefore no basis for the creditors' complaint. Mr Justice Knox rejected that argument but gave Mr Nadir leave to challenge his decision in the Court of Appeal, resulting in the contempt move being postponed to a later date. Earlier the judge had rejected a plea by Mr Scrivener that the contempt case be heard in camera. Mr Nadir has been sent for trial at the Old Bailey on 66 charges of theft and false accounting, involving more than Pounds 100m.</p>

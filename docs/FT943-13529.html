			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Medeva founder shows preference for privacy Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, who stepped down as managing director of Medeva in March, is not really cut out for public company life. Apart from anything else, when things go wrong it is just a bit too public for his taste. He is a relaxed and outgoing Australian but also values his privacy and has not enjoyed the media attention he has received over the past year. It has been a pretty mixed press. Even before last year's profits warning there was talk of a whispering campaign aimed at ousting him from the board. After the share price plunged it was suggested that only his removal would restore City confidence. And coverage of his move to a non-executive role centred on the size of his pay-off. No whinger, he is nevertheless clearly hurt by his treatment at the hands of the press. He particularly resents the suggestion that he was responsible for the problems at the two US subsidiaries last year, pointing out that he was only briefly non-executive president of the American operations. He also attacks the suggestion that the problems revealed a fundamental flaw in the group's hectic acquisition strategy. 'Every acquisition has an element of gamble and it is the total result that determines success or failure.' Although Medeva is a long way from becoming 'one of the most successful companies in British corporate history', as he predicted, he is proud of what he has achieved since founding the company in 1987. Then called Medirace, Mr Gowrie-Smith brought it to the market with just the rights to a drug whose development has since been dropped. 'The market was looking for Aids and cancer plays at the time and one thing I am good at is spotting opportunities and selling ideas.' Another thing he is good at is doing deals. 'He may not have gone down that well with everyone in the City but you have to admit he pulled off some great acquisitions for Medeva,' says one analyst. He hopes to do more working for Medeva on a consultancy basis through his company Brightstone. Formed with long-time business partner Mr David Lees, who resigned as Medeva's finance director in March, the company is looking at a number of projects as well as searching out deals for Medeva. Mr Gowrie-Smith is particularly interested in commercial property where he believes there are now many opportunities. He is guaranteed consultancy fees from Medeva of almost Pounds 1m over the next three years. But he has an incentive to produce the goods as a large part of his wealth is tied up in Medeva shares. He admits to being much happier outside Medeva, which is inevitably developing the big company culture he hates. As a result, he says it is unlikely he will return to the public company scene; but then he pauses; 'You can run quite a large property company without a large head office. The real question is whether being public is worth the loss of privacy.'</p>

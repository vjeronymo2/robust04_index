			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Lilleshall Contributions from new subsidiaries and reduced borrowings helped Lilleshall, the industrial distribution and building products group, increase profits by 25 per cent last year. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.12m) in the 12 months to December 31, thanks mainly to a combined gain of Pounds 771,000 from St Helens Glass and Jay Fasteners, which it acquired during the year. The acquisitions - together with a full year's contribution from Barlow Fasteners, acquired in December 1992 - boosted operating profits by 48.2 per cent to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 2.88m). Funds raised, meanwhile, by the group's Pounds 9.67m rights issue to acquire St Helens last September, were also used to cut borrowings by Pounds 5.04m, leaving year-end gearing at 3.2 per cent. The Newbury-based group said yesterday it had taken advantage of low gearing and cash reserves of Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 1.74m) to acquire Trutite Fasteners, the UK subsidiary of Koninklijke KNP BT, the Dutch paper group. Lilleshall paid Pounds 562,151 cash and repaid Pounds 1.25m of inter-company debt with a further Pounds 300,000 payable at the end of 1994. Mr John Leek, chairman, said the acquisition would lead to a significant expansion of Lilleshall's industrial consumables division. The industrial consumables division, dominated by fastener manufacturing, was last year the only sector to report increased profits. A rationalisation programme and significant income from Barlow Fasteners helped the division make an Pounds 806,000 profit, compared with a Pounds 983,000 loss last time. Although it was the smallest contributor to group operating profits, Mr Leek said its results were encouraging compared with the 'very disappointing' performance of building products, the company's largest division. Profits from building products - including St Helens Glass - fell to Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 2.31m). Pressure on margins also hit the plastics and engineering division, which saw profits decline to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.68). All the divisions, however, increased sales and group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 60.5m. Earnings per share rose to 10p (9.2p), and the final dividend is lifted from 2.65p to 2.85p, making 4.55p.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Strong sales lift Dillard DILLARD Department Stores, the Arkansas-based retailer, yesterday reported solid progress in the third quarter of 1992, with after-tax profits increasing from Dollars 39m to Dollars 44.4m after tax, writes Nikki Tait. Sales rose from Dollars 954.9m in the same period of 1991, to Dollars 1.16bn, with the number of stores increasing to 220. The third-quarter performance means the department store group has posted after-tax profits of Dollars 126m for the first nine months of the year, against Dollars 112m in the first three quarters of 1991. But St Louis-based May Department Stores plunged into the red in the third quarter, after it took a Dollars 298m extraordinary charge to cover planned store closings and consolidations and several other property-related charges. This led May to report a Dollars 190m deficit after-tax in the three months, against a Dollars 91m profit in the same period of 1991. Sales were modestly higher at Dollars 2.67bn, against Dollars 2.56bn. May made after-tax profits of Dollars 284m in the nine months to end-October, compared with Dollars 249m in the same period a year ago.</p>

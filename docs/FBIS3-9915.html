			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  supported Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo when he said that the  latter is "one of the key people in his government program." He  made it clear that "in case of emergency, there are always  courageous and talented people who can take on the  responsibility" of heading the Finance Ministry.    The head of state endorsed his minister on 24 February, a  day  on which financial markets were in turmoil and share prices on  the stock exchange plunged as a result of insistent rumors of  Cavallo's resignation and other technical reasons.    Menem's comment was like an analgesic on the tense  atmosphere  at the stock exchange and prevented shares from plummeting  further.    Menem played down the importance of the decline in stock  prices, stating: "This is not the first time the market has been  bearish."    The president, speaking on Radio America, noted: "There is  invariably speculation on ways to reap greater profits. A  bearish market enables those who want to buy stocks to get them  cheaper."    He once again remarked that the continuity of the present  economic model is not tied to those in charge of implementing  the economic policy.    The head of state said he always keeps a name "in pectore,"  ready to replace each of his cabinet members if need be.    Cavallo's case is no different from any other, even though  he  is considered to be the "almighty" person within the government.    Rumors of Cavallo's resignation affected stock exchange  trading on 23 February, when blue chips dropped by more than 5  percent.    The economy minister has had to withstand several attacks  over the last few days. San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto  Marquevich, for example, accused him of "interfering" in the  case of the Opalsen firm -- linked to businessman Francisco  Macri -- which allegedly failed to pay duties on the importation  of 15,000 cars.    When Cavallo questioned several aspects of the proceedings,  Judge Marquevich charged the executive branch with "meddling" in  the judiciary.    The spectacular operations conducted by the DGI [General  Directorate of Taxation] especially among the "rich and famous"  caused friction between Cavallo and his influential Public  Revenues Secretary Carlos Tacchi, who is held in high respect in  business circles for his struggle against tax evasion.    Cavallo questioned the methodology used by DGI agents -- the  director of which is Ricardo Cossio -- stating that Luis Maria  Pena, the head of the fiscal auditing office, had committed  "excesses" during the investigations.    Cavallo subsequently supported DGI agents, but demanded that  they be more restrained and observe confidentiality in their  operations.    Now that the alleged fraudulent importation by Sevel has  been  brought in the open, the protection of the Argentine car  industry has also come under fire.    Some economists have voiced their opposition to an  indefinite  continuation of this protectionist policy and found that Cavallo  is willing to defend it to the bitter end.    He crashed headlong into Dardo Gasparre and Miguel Angel  Broda on two occasions, labelling them and other economists as  "market fundamentalists."    Cavallo attacked Broda by bringing to light an old incident  of disloyalty within the government.    He recalled that in 1991, the then Finance Secretary Saul  Bouer told Broda that the government was going to pay overdue  securities. The latter interpreted this as an increase in the  money supply, and therefore, a form of devaluation.    Bouer demanded a public apology, with which the minister  complied by issuing a press communique that cleared the good  reputation of the incumbent mayor.    These conflicts obliged President Menem to put Cavallo in  his  place during a cabinet meeting.    He reportedly told the minister: "In politics, peppery  people  lose out."    All these events led people to surmise that Cavallo was  going  to resign, which in turn had an adverse effect on financial  markets.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Retail sales show thin and patchy recovery: CBI survey shows wholesale trade buoyant VOLUME sales in the high streets registered a marginally higher annual rate of growth last month, but they disappointed retailers who said that sales were below normal for the time of year, and growing less fast than in the summer. As the accompanying table shows, the Confederation of British Industry's latest distributive trades survey uncovered a marked variation in performance in the various retail sectors. It also highlighted differing fortunes for the wholesale trade, where sales were buoyant, and the motor trades, where rising sales were considered low for the time of year and where sales growth was only in the parts and accessories area. Among retailers, grocers and chemists experienced a marked slow-down in year-on-year sales growth between September and October, while furniture and carpet stores, booksellers and clothing outlets reported big jumps in sales volumes. Off-licences, which in September had reported a return to growth after 12 months of year-on-year declines in sales, again reported falling sales. Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of economic surveys at the CBI, said the variations reflected the end of discounting in some sectors and highlighted the uneven nature of Britain's economic recovery. He said the survey, which polled 500 companies with 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades between October 18 and November 1, was 'a sign that retail sales are not too solidly based'. The CBI also reported 'stark differences' in the growth of sales volumes among the different categories of retailers. All mail order companies reported higher sales volumes compared with October last year. The large multiples continued to boost their sales, as evidenced by a strong positive balance reporting higher volume sales last month. The number of large multiples reporting a year-on-year growth in sales in October exceeded the number reporting a decrease by 31 percentage points, unchanged from September. Small multiples, with a positive balance of 11 percentage points last month against 12 per cent in September, also reported increased sales. But single outlet retailers reported an accelerating fall in sales with the number reporting lower sales volumes compared with October last year outstripping those with higher sales by 20 percentage points. Retailers, wholesalers and motor traders placed more orders with suppliers last month, although in the retail sector the increase came entirely from mail order companies and the large multiple stores.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Stronger consumer borrowing ..supports moderate retail sales growth ..  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual growthg in sales volumes                                 May    Jun    Jul    Aug    Sep    Oct  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales total              +18    +30    +32    +31    +25    +26 Grocers                         +21    +43    +38    +37    +59    +25 Specialist food                 +49    +18    +13     +5    -14    -15 Off-licences                    -35    -35    -23     -3    -23    -41 Clothing                         -1    +40    +55    +59    +14    +51 Footwear &amp; leather              -55    +43    +55    +37    +84    +59 Durable household goods         +37    +10    +12     +3    -16    +13 Furniture and carpets           +34    +54    +31    +53    +17    +69 Hardware, china &amp; DIY            +3     -5    +10    +14    +23     +5 Confectionery                   +20     +3    +13    +30      0     -8 Booksellers &amp; stationers        +46    +37    +49    +22    +20    +50 Chemists                        +27    +44    +44    +37    +61    +16 Other retail                    +11     +8    +14     -3    +14    +19 Motor trades                     -2     -6     +8    +27    +15    +16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = % reporting an increase minus % reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year before  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CSO/CBI  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

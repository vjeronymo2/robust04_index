			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retraces its steps after initial advance Wall Street Blue chip shares receded yesterday afternoon after an early advance, but broader indices maintained mild firmness as investors shrugged off the dollar's continued weakness, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a net 2.59 lower at 3,667.05, but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.56 ahead at 447.63. Advancing issues on the New York SE had a three-to-two edge over decliners. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.81 at 423.48 and the Nasdaq composite added 1.96 at 704.01. A modest 263m shares were traded on the Big Board, with many investors inactive in the run-up to the long Independence Day weekend and a keenly awaited Federal Reserve policy-making session early next week. But there was extra activity generated by money managers adjusting their books a day ahead of the final trading session of the second quarter. For the second day running, the blue chips shifted direction during the mid-afternoon. At the opening, stocks picked up where they had left off the previous session. Share prices moved steadily higher, building on Tuesday's late rally, which had whittled down a 45-point Dow deficit to just 15 points by the close. The dollar remained a concern but stocks appeared to have broken step with its fluctuations. Yesterday the greenback continued to slide against the Japanese currency, but investors took the news in their stride. Later, when stocks lost their forward momentum, the flagging currency served as an obvious scapegoat, but it never was a big factor. In the fixed-rate markets, traders also seemed resigned to the dollar's latest stumble, giving equities some breathing room. Bonds inched forward in spite of an upward revision of the government's estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product to 3.4 per cent. Economists were expecting no change in the earlier estimate of 3.0 per cent. But investors discounted the relevance of the first three months of the year to the Fed's current thinking. The report was not expected to influence the outcome of next week's policy session. If it were not for a fresh setback for strike-bound Caterpillar, the Dow industrials would have showed a gain. In the event, the issue shed a further Dollars 2 to Dollars 102 1/8 . International Paper gave back Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67. The banking sector was generally improved as stocks tracked the course struck by bonds. NationsBank climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 and First Interstate appreciated Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 76 5/8 . Citicorp added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 7/8 as Kidder Peabody initiated coverage of the issue with an 'outperform' rating. On the Nasdaq, Novell gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 17 and led the most active list with 9.7m shares traded. At least two securities houses - Wertheim Schroder and UBS - had lifted their ratings on the issue. Snapple Beverages firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 1/8 after the company told analysts of its success in the fast-growing market for bottled fruit juices. Canada The Toronto market strengthened as investors began to look ahead to the release of second-quarter earnings results next month. The TSE 300 composite index finished 31.4 up at 4,028.2 and advances outpaced declines by 422 to 293 after volume of 57.9m shares valued at CDollars 637.7m. Mexico Mexican shares opened higher, helped by reports that Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the kidnapped financier, had been released by his kidnappers, as well as by gains on Wall Street. The IPC index was up 24.2, or 1.1 per cent, at 2,256.93. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo had gained a further 5.5 per cent in local currency terms by midsession as domestic investors in particular took positions before the introduction of the new currency, the real, tomorrow. The Bovespa index was 1,949 stronger at 37,585. The financial markets will be closed tomorrow as the changeover in the currency takes place.</p>

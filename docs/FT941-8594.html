			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: First African issue of US CP from supranational bank PTA Bank, a supranational bank which promotes trade in eastern and southern Africa, is set to become the first African issuer to enter the US commercial paper (CP) market today when it issues around Dollars 13.7m worth of asset-backed CPs. PTA, whose full name is Eastern and Southern Africa Trade and Development Bank, was set up in 1985 and has 14 shareholders including the African Development Bank, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mauritius and Burundi, where the bank is located. Today's issuance will be drawn from its Dollars 500m CP programme which is fully backed by a cash collateral account held in Bermuda. The programme is designed to protect CP holders from African risk, said Mr Francis Daniels, a senior adviser at Aidoo Group, a New York-based financial advisory group specialising in representing African governments and companies. Although PTA Bank is unrated, the structure of the programme has enabled it to secure a CP rating of A-1 plus from Standard &amp; Poor's and F-1 plus from Fitch. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are the dealers for the programme. The proceeds will be used to support the bank's trade loans. The move towards democracy in South Africa has turned international investor attention to Africa but the depth of interest is far from clear. Earlier this year, a structured bond issue for the Republic of the Congo intended to raise Dollars 600m from international investors, had to be re-vamped and relaunched due to lack of demand for the original deal.</p>

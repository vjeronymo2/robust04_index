			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Roche puts pressure on Zurich Zurich came under renewed pressure as Roche tumbled 5 per cent in reply to lower than expected first half sales growth. The SMI index, marginally ahead early in the day, finished 54.5, or 2.1 per cent lower, at 2,508.0. Roche certificates fell SFr300 to SFr5,700 after the group said that first half sales increased by 7.3 per cent in local currency terms, but only by 2.4 per cent in Swiss francs, due to the strength of the currency, particularly against the dollar. The market had expected a 10-12 per cent rise in local currencies, or 5-6 per cent in Swiss francs. In London, Mr Richard Davidson at Morgan Stanley, which cut Switzerland to an underweight position in its model portfolio, commented that the market was relatively expensive and earnings growth looked below average. Mr Davidson said that the franc's sharp rise against the D-mark had made Swiss industry less competitive, and that the situation was unlikely to change this year. 'Our analysts', he said, 'find few Swiss companies more attractive than their peers in Europe, with the exception of BBC and, perhaps, Nestle.' The reduction in Swiss weighting was effected by halving the double weighting of Ciba. Goldman Sachs, however, commented yesterday that Ciba's valuation had sound support: it retained its market outperformer rating for the near term and market performer rating long term.</p>

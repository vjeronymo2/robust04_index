			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 12 May (TANJUG)--The command of the 18th  Corps of the Serbian Army of Krajina [SVK] this evening denied  any involvement by its soldiers in the brutal murders in the  vicinity of Daruvar on 11 May. The Croatian side is accusing  the Serbian army and Serbs in western Slavonia of having  committed these murders. An official statement by the 18th  Corps' command says: The corps' command was informed by  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] at 1800 on 12 May 1994 that a  multiple murder had been committed. Five persons were killed  and two others wounded in the village of Vukovije, northeast of  Daruvar, at 2230 on 11 May. The corps' command expresses regret  at this tragic event but vehemently denies any connection  between corps' members and the incident in question.    By resorting to its well-known propaganda methods, the  Croatian side is trying, yet again, to accuse the Serb  side--before the investigation conducted by UNPROFOR and the  Croatian police has been concluded. We believe that such  conduct is not conducive to the building of trust necessary for  the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, says the  statement issued by the 18th Corps of the SVK.</p>

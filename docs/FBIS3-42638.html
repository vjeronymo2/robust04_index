			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy chairman of </F> the State Duma from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  faction, by Andrey Chaplygin; place and date not given: "A  Member of the Team"]    [Text] We are continuing to become acquainted with  new people in the Russian parliament. Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is  the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma from the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] faction. So far he has not said much  in parliament....    Biographical note. Born in 1953 in Moscow. Russian,  from a family of physicians, graduated MAI [Moscow Aviation  Institute], faculty of radioelectronics of flight equipment.  Worked in civil aviation. Served as an officer in the Main  Administration of Military Space Science as a specialist in the  area of computer equipment and systems for control of objects in  space. At the height of his administrative career, already a  "civilian," he became chief of the Main Administration of the  State Committee for Computer Equipment and Information Science.  He oversaw and organized the development of software in the  USSR. He entered the CPSU while in the army. He did not tear up  his communist party card but he terminated his  membership....    [Chaplygin] How do you evaluate the causes of the success of  the LDPR in the recent elections?    [Vengerovskiy] In Rus, for example, there was always a legal  opposition. Under the tsar it was the court jester. But the  people always respected members of the opposition just as they  did God's fools. Recall Vasiliy Vlazhenyy. Our people understood  why we conduct agitation and propaganda in precisely this way  and no other. We speak the same language, using the same sign  system.    In the LDPR I handled purely specialized issues. I was  deputy  prime minister of the shadow cabinet of ministers, that is, I  organized the intellectual team of the LDPR.    [Chaplygin] Are you obliged to follow the party line? And if  you were faced with a choice of whom to obey, yourself or the  party, which so far is associated with one person?    [Vengerovskiy] We have a party leader, we have a politburo,  they are all the chairman's team. I am a member of the team of  the party chairman, Zhirinovskiy. We hold the same positions and  operate on the basis of the same argument-program of the LDPR.    [Chaplygin] You have come to parliament. What is your  minimum  program?    [Vengerovskiy] To work legislatively. The main aspects of my  minimum program are to fight crime. The second is to change the  economic course of reforms and foreign policy. And changes are  taking place even now. For example, Kozyrev has begun to speak  in a more pragmatic language. Moreover, we will defend the  dignity of the Russian person regardless of where he may be.    The success we have achieved is not the end of the line for  us. Our plans for the next two years call for including the LDPR  in the country's political structure and supporting multiparty  democracy. If someone rocks the fragile boat of our democracy,  we shall try to stabilize the situation. They all understand  that we are not fascists, we are a party of realists and  centrists who are not indifferent to the fate of our homeland.    [Chaplygin] Maximum program?    [Vengerovskiy] We will go to the presidential elections  taking advantage of the parliamentary possibilities.    [Chaplygin] And if it seems to members of the politburo of  the LDPR that the party leader is too scandalous would it be  possible to do without him in the future?    [Vengerovskiy] Nobody has been tempted to create a schism in  the LDPR. Our strength lies in unity. We have one leader, there  are no doubts here, it is Zhirinovskiy.    [Chaplygin] Statements on behalf of the LDPR abroad are  alarming more than just politicians, they could evoke hostility  toward Russians.    [Vengerovskiy] There are two types of civilizations: They  are  the spiritual-Russian and the Western-consumer civilization.  Countries and people must determine for themselves which  civilization they will belong to. I am convinced that the  victory will go to spirituality in any case. And Zhirinovskiy is  the leader in this struggle. He is the one now who is restoring  the real parity that should exist in the world. When the balance  of forces--the United States on the one hand and the USSR on the  other--is disturbed, this could lead to the beginning of a third  world war. Until we put an end to this situation and polarity  appears, the world will be on the brink of great trials.  Therefore the LDPR sets for itself the task of restoring our  country's might. Only a mighty Russia and her mighty people will  make it possible to provide stability throughout the world. But  there are forces who do not want this. And we can designate them  with a general term of "world forces behind the scene."    We have a strong intellectual group. We call it the "shadow  cabinet of ministers." It is preparing many surprises for  everyone.</p>

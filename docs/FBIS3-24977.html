In terms of the new schedule of the General Peace  Accord, the Mozambican people turn out at the polls in October  to choose their president and the party whose program they like  and trust the most.    Meanwhile, as elections approach--they are slightly less  than  10 months away--people are showing a growing interest in and  want to know more about the philosophy and programs of each  party and candidate in the elections.    With the aim of satisfying that public need, DOMINGO sent a  questionnaire to the different political parties that have  registered so far--namely, the People's Party for the Liberation  of Mozambique, PPLM; the Mozambique Liberal and Democratic  Party, Palmo; the Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo; the  Social Democratic Party, Sol; the Mozambique People's Progress  Party, PPPM; the Mozambican Nationalist Movement, Monamo; the  National Democratic Party, Panade; National Convention Party,  PCN; the Mozambican National Union, Unamo; Mozambique United  Front-Democratic Convergence and National Reconstruction Party,  Fumo-PCDRN; and the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo.    Our survey contained three questions: 1. What concrete  strategies should be followed to bring the country's economy out  of the chaos it is in? 2. What specific program should be  implemented to ensure social progress (in areas such as health,  education, culture, sport, and so on)? and 3. What foreign  policy should be pursued?    We sent the questionnaires to 11 parties, but only five  replied. They were: Pademo, PPPM, Monamo, PCN, and Unamo. Of  those, the PCN gave us a negative answer, saying that the  questions we asked are "of public interest and will certainly be  topics for debate during the electoral campaign." This party  added that such issues are part of its electoral program, which  "will only be approved by a meeting of the congress to be held,  in principle, in April, so we cannot divulge that information  now or we would be violating our own statutes." Panade was  contacted late, so it will only answer next week.    We did not send the questionnaire to the Mozambique  Liberation Front, Frelimo, for reasons that we believe are  obvious. As the present ruling party, Frelimo's program must be  the one it is implementing at this stage. Among other things,  we have the national reconstruction program, the social and  economic rehabilitation program, and the industrial  rehabilitation program.    DOMINGO will be carrying the parties' answers over the next  few weeks and it will follow the order of the questions, with  answers to the first, second, and third questions, respectively.  The PPPM produced a response that is difficult to grasp because  it gives one four-line answer to all three questions.    Our first question about concrete strategies for pulling  Mozambique's economy out of the current chaos included some  secondary questions: a) Concerning continuity or otherwise with  the IMF restructuring program, in the event of severance, what  other sources of financing would your party rely on? b) What  sectorial policies (agriculture, industry, commerce, and  tourism) and what priorities would you follow? c) Concerning  foreign investment, what policies, strategies, or mechanisms  should be implemented to benefit the country? d) What policies  ought to be followed to control inflation and to improve the  balance of payments?    Let us see how Pademo, the PPPM, Monamo, and Unamo answered  this question.  <H3>  1. Concrete Strategies To Pull the Country Out of Economic  Chaos </H3>   Pademo    a) Mozambique is already part of the world economic system,  and, as such, a market economy must be the keyword. This is how  our party sees it. The "Bretton Woods" institutions, notably  the World Bank, WB, the IMF, and the Paris Club are, in general  terms, the ones that "dictate" the rules of the game. In order  to benefit from their financing, all countries that are members  of those institutions must submit to their norms, but that does  not mean that all recommendations issued by those monetary  institutions must be followed blindly.    We have always believed that it is possible to negotiate  with  the "big shots" [preceding two words in English]. From Pademo's  point of view, our country's membership to those institutions  should be planned so that the recovery of national industry can  be assured, the export sector is encouraged to produce more,  more jobs are created, administrative reform is implemented, and  control is exerted over the outflow of foreign currency, as well  as over imports. It will only be possible for this country to  benefit from loans from the WB, IMF, and other organizations  such as the "Paris Club" if the government draws up a plan to  get the economy back on its feet, thereby allowing the gross  national product, GNP, and exports to increase.    Pademo believes that the relationship between the GNP and  the  foreign debt must be minimized and that efforts must be made for  a more productive use of loans, which must not be used solely  for importing luxury and unnecessary goods that can only benefit  businessmen and their protectors, who are enriching themselves  at the expense of the misery experienced by the majority of  Mozambicans.  <H5>  Agrarian Policy </H5>   The majority of the Mozambican population lives in the rural  areas, where, coincidentally, social and economic development is  poorest. It is important to work out plans for a rural sector  that will be of use to the peasants and other rural people,  whereby production is constantly guided by the goals that are  sought in the areas of participation and division and which  should be implemented through the establishment of new  production relations in the agricultural sector.    Given that the agrarian sector is very sensitive to climate  factors and highly dependent on the degree of incentives  available nationally and internationally, Pademo defends a  policy of diversification of the agents who operate in that  sector. In this way, the private, cooperative, and family  sectors should be stimulated by the state, which will also be  responsible for coordinating the work of those sectors, defining  agrarian credit policies and prices, and buying agricultural  surpluses to guarantee food security in the country.    Agriculture currently demands the intervention of  technologies, equipments, and working methods that are  increasingly complex, which must be introduced for use by  persons who obtain the necessary scientific and technological  skills, thereby improving the levels of education at rural and  agricultural schools. Furthermore, for the sector to become  more dynamic, there is the need to apply specific guidance  measures pertaining to agricultural, forestry, and livestock  production, as well as to establish a policy that will ensure  order is brought to the rural areas.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Pademo endorses the principle that the "cash crop"  [preceding  two words in English] and "food crop" [preceding two words in  English] production areas must undergo proper planning, both at  the central level and at the level of the federate states. As  part of the colonial period's legacy, some parts of the country  currently concentrate on "food crops" and others on "cash crops."    The party will support improvements in the technologies to  be  used by those two agricultural production areas, because both  will help the country earn foreign currency. Furthermore, there  is the need to define an agricultural industrialization policy  that will see such industrialization at work in the areas where  those crops are produced, thereby encouraging a reduction in  losses and waste of those products. To that end, the Federal  Institute for Science, Research, and Technology, in conjunction  with potential national and foreign investors, will define the  appropriate technologies for the processing of previously  identified agricultural products.    In line with its land ownership policy, the party will issue  land property deeds, but it will not enter into conflicts with  the traditional system of each region. It will also define a  land ownership policy for foreigners and for specific purposes.  The most important aspects of that policy would have to be  defined by the federal parliament. Any land transaction must be  confirmed or made official by the Notary Services and can only  be entered into by individuals in possession of a land property  deed.    Pademo will also promote the creation of associations for  farmers or peasants who unite to defend their interests.  <H5>  Forestation </H5>   It has been found over the last few years that enterprises,  particularly foreign enterprises, have embarked on the wholesale  destruction of our forests for the purpose of securing easy  profits. In view of that, there is the need to define a  forestation policy that will help bring order to the  exploitation of those resources and that will also enhance  silviculture planning. Within this context, the following are  the most important points:     -  To define areas for production, conservation, and  recreation;    -  To increase the area of productive forestation;    -  To expand tree planting areas, improve their protection, and  improve pasture areas;    -  To exert rigorous control over landscapes, areas where land  has  been scorched, deforestation problems, and strive to defend  local natural values;    -  To define a reforestation policy for wood-producing areas.   <H5>    Livestock </H5>   Livestock helps decisively to strengthen the gross  agricultural product. Its importance within the context of the  agrarian economy must not be underestimated. The livestock  sector is, however, one of the weakest in our country because of  the effects of the fratricidal war that has decimated both  domestic cattle and wildlife.    The sector must receive significant investments so that  priority can be given to increasing livestock numbers, sector  productivity, and to foster a more correct integration of  livestock into farming or other agricultural exploitation areas.    Such investments must also benefit the family sector, which  contributes substantially toward livestock production in our  country. Within that context, the party will strive for a  return of livestock to the rural areas and to the national game  parks. The parastatal and private sectors must also be  mobilized so they become actively involved in this area.    To that end, Pademo plans to promote concrete action for a  well-integrated operation. Such plans would include:     -  The adoption of realistic policies for the sectors dealing  with resettling and feeding cattle. Nationally produced food  resources must be promoted whenever possible;    -  With the help of cattle breeders, an effective program must  be  established in each federated state to provide hygiene care and  protection for existing livestock;    -  To draw up regional plans that will guide livestock  production  so as to make livestock production part of development plans,  but without ignoring the ecological balance of the areas  involved;    -  To define the real potential and the correctness of livestock  production in each area, as well as to place and guide intensive  livestock exploitation in the areas of hog, goat, and poultry  raising;    -  To promote the modernization of the premises and equipment  used  by livestock companies so as to make them technologically viable;    -  To promote the creation of associations of cattle farmers and  livestock entrepreneurs whose help the state will seek for  technical assistance and professional training purposes, thereby  improving conditions for exploitation.   <H3>    Industrial, Natural Resources, and Environment Protection  Policies </H3>   Industry has a most important role to play in the creation  of  the material and social conditions on which the country's  prosperity and the well-being of the citizens must rest. The  rehabilitation of existing industrial assets and the  development, or introduction, of other industries, are priority  tasks for Pademo. Such operations will, to a great extent,  function as the engine for the promotion of training and for the  optimal use of human resources, with a view to promoting  employment. Natural resources, whether they be in the mining,  agricultural, or fishing sectors, must also be given attention  so as to create the wealth that will absorb consumption needs.  The social sector must also be expanded, whether it be housing,  health care, education security, or cultural development. The  country's industrial growth must be guaranteed by all federated  states in a decentralized manner. Attention must always be  given to the defense of the environment and industrial units  must be integrated into the areas in which they operate.  <H5>  Within the Industrial Sector </H5>   With regard to industry, the exploitation and use of natural  resources, and environmental protection, Pademo plans to promote  the following actions:     -  To adopt an industrial policy that will guarantee a  balanced distribution of industries in the country, both at the  level of federated states and at regional level.    -  To uphold an industrial policy that will be backed by a  policy  promoting academic, technical, and professional training,  thereby ensuring that professionals find employment and that  industry has the qualified workers it needs.    -  To define an industrial planning strategy that will take into  account the fact that Mozambique is a third world country that  produces raw materials for the international market. In view of  that, specialization must be sought to ensure that the country  produces profitable export goods.    -  To promote support and assistance in the form of loans and  other incentives -- to be approved by central parliament -- to  those large and small enterprises that give a positive  contribution to social and economic development by attracting  and investing capital, increasing production and productivity,  and by creating jobs.    -  To take energetic measures, in coordination with the trade  unions, against the reduction of surplus [nao justificado]  labor, the closure of factories, and dismissals without just  cause. The state must exert control and authority over those  enterprises that show an incapacity to abide by their  responsibilities concerning fiscal taxes and the payment of  salaries.    -  To show commitment in helping Mozambican citizens establish  small and intermediate enterprises by means of awarding them  loans and granting them lighter fiscal duties, depending on the  level of development of the areas where such enterprises are  located.    -  To define the energy sector as decisive for a successful  industrial policy and as being of strategic importance for the  country's social and economic system. This sector must be  strongly connected with great state corporations and the state  must have powerful control over it. In this way, the oil, coal,  and gas subsectors must be organized in the form of a national  "holding" [preceding word in English]. The electricity  subsector will also be reorganized so that it becomes a single  federal enterprise that will be responsible for producing,  storing, and distributing electricity throughout the country.  It must also show the capacity to promote electrification  throughout Mozambican territory.    -  To set single tariffs for the various forms of energy  throughout the federation. There will be the need to review the  prices currently charged to domestic and industrial consumers.    -  To promote and increase research concerning new ways of  picking  up and processing energy, particularly geothermal energy in  areas where it can be put to good use, notably solar energy and  in cases of regional power failures.    -  To promote norms and criteria that will guarantee the  participation of administrative organs of the government of each  federated state in the drawing up of industrial sector plans,  programs, and contracts, as well as to follow up their  implementation.    -  To define in legal terms the obligations of the larger  enterprises in the training of personnel and in the areas of  research and development, as well as to draw up a technology  transfer code that will protect the national economy in its  contracts with other countries.   <H5>    Within the Context of the Natural Resources Sector </H5>   The natural resources of the federation are the property of  the federal state and their use will be controlled by the  federal state. It is up to the federated states to participate  in the drawing up of plans and contracts, as well as to control  the implementation of those plans and contracts.    Natural resources include geothermal resources, mineral  deposits, quarries, and waters (whether they be natural waters,  mineral waters for industrial production, or natural mineral  waters).    c) [as published] Foreign investment must be attracted and  encouraged by setting up an effective bureaucratic machine and  by introducing a tax policy that will be both more attractive  and more realistic. Pademo believes that there should be a  division of the sectors where economic agents are to act and  define taxes in accordance with the perceived level of risk in  each given sector.    d) Our party advocates a policy of economic integration for  the peasant majority of Mozambican people. That majority  currently contributes little toward the national economy.  Inflation control requires political and economic measures that  out party has already outlined and which it will submit to an  elected assembly for approval. We did not think it was  opportune to convey those plans to a newspaper before the  electoral campaign has begun. One thing is certain: It will  only be possible to improve the balance of payments by making  local industry and the rendering of services both more effective  and more competitive.  <H5>  PPPM </H5>   "The specific strategy to pull the country out of economic  chaos, to promote social progress, and to devise a foreign  policy is to build federalism, meaning political  decentralization including powers of a statutory nature,  fundamental legislation, and political (?powers) in general, in  addition to administrative, economic, and financial autonomy."  [sentence as published]  <H5>  Monamo/PMSD </H5>   "I. If Monamo/PMSD wins the legislative elections, it  cannot,  unfortunately, form a government, since only the candidate  elected to the Presidency of the Republic can form the  government, according to the existing political constitution  which provides for a presidential regime, contrary to  Monamo/PMSD's proposal for a semi- presidential regime, which  combines the good aspects of both presidential and parliamentary  regimes, according to the dictum "in medius virtus" [virtue is  in the middle].    II. If Monamo/PMSD is called upon to form the government or  even in opposition, it will always defend its political  ideology, its government program of action, and its economic,  political, and social plan. Having said this, we shall now  answer DOMINGO's questionnaire.  <H3>  1. Concrete Strategies To Pull the Country Out of Economic  Chaos </H3>   a) Taking into account the country's economic, political,  and  social situation, Monamo/PMSD feels, unfortunately, that it  cannot ignore the International Monetary Fund's [IMF]  conditions, since we owe a lot to this fund and other financial  bodies.    All the same, it will renegotiate the debt and readjust the  rules of the game defining international financing to our  country's realities, so that in the shortest period possible, we  can establish an equilibrium and settle the debt, through  surplus budgets and balances of payment.    Monamo/PMSD will give priority to sources of financing for  productive investment, which will check the export of foreign  currency.    Our country has the potential to produce cereals in  abundance and, so, it does not need cereals from the  international market. Even wheat can be produced in sufficient  quantities to cover internal needs. We can make bread from  wheat, corn, rice, sorghum, and cassava flour.    The main sources of financing should be national, coming  from  state revenue obtained from the exploration of the Cahora Basssa  Hydroelectric Dam, Pande gas, mineral resources, cashew nuts,  and prawns.    b) Agriculture will be the fundamental sector of our  economy,  in that it will absorb over 70 percent of our active population,  who will be engaged in subsistence agriculture. Monamo/PMSD  feels, however, that the plantation of cotton, oil-producing  plants, cashew nut trees, sugar cane, tea, and tobacco should be  industrialized to readjust the balance of payments.    The energetic industrial sector (fuel, electricity, gas, and  coal), salt pits, fishery, agricultural and livestock  byproducts, exploration of precious stones and metallurgy in  Tete region, which is rich in iron, coal, energy and water, are  essential for the production of national steel.    Trade will only be of major importance to the country if it  involves internal and external trade of national food products,  cereals, vegetables, meet, fish, prawns, drinks, textile, and  others, without imports or with reduced imports of essential  commodities, such as fuel, machinery, and technology.    Tourism constitutes one of the major sources of foreign  currency. To realize this, it will be necessary to rehabilitate  existing hotels, offer good service, and engage in necessary  advertisement and "marketing" [preceding word in English].    c) The first condition for foreign investment is the  security  of people and goods, economic stability, and an attractive code  of foreign investment, which will also defend national  sovereignty.    In the field of national economics, the Mozambican state  should provide certain fiscal benefits to foreign companies, as  well as be willing to finance some of them, as long as they  provide major opportunities for the employment of nationals.  The extent of the project in national terms and its propensity  to generate medium and small national satellite companies should  also be considered.    d) Inflation can only be controlled if there is greater  productivity and subsequently greater national production, less  devaluation of the metical, control in printing currency, a  certain restriction in importing nonessential products and a  foreign exchange policy which conforms with our financial  conditions. Our balance of payments will for many years to come  still be in deficit, but with a good service in our ports,  railroads, revenues from emigrants, workers in South African  mines, and tourism, a significant increase in the export of  electricity from the Cahora Bassa Dam, Pande gas, cashew nuts,  tea, sugar, cotton, manufacturing, and others, we can readjust  and increase our balance of payments during the next 10 to 15  years."  <H5>  Unamo </H5>   1. The only strategy to remove the country from its present  chaos is through a federal government.    a) Mozambique is a big and rich country. There are many  countries worldwide with a spirit of good will, ready to assist  in the reconstruction and development of this country, in case  relations with the IMF become sour. What is more, the country  has its own sources of wealth. The only problem was  mismanagement by the country's rulers.    b) We must give priority to agriculture, small industries,  trade, and tourism.    The agricultural program should involve the following:  Financing small farmers, small industries, small traders.  Because our country is big and highly populated, it must be  developed by the nationals themselves. Unfortunately, this is  not being observed at the moment because of a lack of priorities.    Tourism: Tourism should be encouraged by the state and  supported by businessmen in the country, to increasingly attract  the international community, thus enabling us to obtain more  foreign exchange.    c) Foreigners should be called upon to invest in the country  as much as they can, considering how big and rich the country  is. In turn, they should be allowed to remit a certain  percentage to their home countries or where the capital came  from.    d) To control inflation and improve the balance of payments,  we should increase production in the country. Thus, it will be  easy to control foreign market forces and readjust our balance  of payment accordingly. Considering that the government policy  will be directed toward increasing production, it will not be  necessary to import everything.</p>

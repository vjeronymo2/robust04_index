			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Steel tube producers link up THREE OF Europe's leading producers of steel tubes are combining part of their interests to rationalise production and confront the continuing weakness in prices and demand. Ilva, the Italian state steel group, Mannesmann of Germany and Usinor Sacilor of France will take equal stakes in a joint venture combining their seamless stainless steel tube operations. The deal, still subject to approval by the companies' boards and the European Commission, involves Dalmine Tubi Speciali, owned by Ilva, Mannesmann Edelstahlrohr and France's Valinox. The new venture expects annual sales of about DM400m (Dollars 251.5m). That would give it about 30 per cent of the European market, putting it roughly on a par with Sandvik of Sweden, the current market leader. The deal has been prompted by a mixture of excess capacity, falling demand and the collapse of some export markets for seamless stainless steel tubes. It reflects the partners' satisfaction with the operation of a similar three-way venture, Europipe, in which they have pooled their large-diameter tube businesses. Mannesmann has a much larger, 50:50 collaboration deal in precision tubes and pipelines with Hoesch, part of the Krupp steel and engineering business. This deal, which created a company with annual sales of about DM1.2bn, was approved earlier year by the European Commission, even though the partners shared 50 per cent of the German market. The commission said at the time that other European steel producers, 'such as Ilva, British Steel and Usinor-Sacilor can be expected to act as real and effective competitors in future'. 'To reduce costs further, rationalisations on an international basis are necessary', said Ilva. The company, which owns almost 69 per cent of Dalmine, said each of the three partners would cut capacity by about 30 per cent. Precisely how the reductions would take place is still not clear. 'There are obviously going to be closures and job losses,' Ilva said. Seamless stainless steel tubes, produced at Dalmine's plant near Bergamo in northern Italy, accounted for about L100bn (Dollars 67.1m) of total 1991 group sales of L765bn. Ilva lost L498bn before minority interests in 1991. In spite of putting aside about L411bn of extraordinary gains into a special fund to cover restructuring costs, the group is expected to announce a substantially bigger loss for 1992. IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, has given its management a mid-1993 deadline to produce a wide-ranging restructuring plan.</p>

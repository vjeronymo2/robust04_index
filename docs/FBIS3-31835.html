			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ivica Saric reporting for Croatian Radio. Vitez is  going through one of the most devastating Muslim artillery  attacks since the aggression began on 15 April last year. The  usual afternoon mortar provocations this evening turned into  artillery barrage fire directed at the center of Vitez, the  Croatian Defense Council's [HVO's] Vitez operational zone  reports.    Tank-fired missiles and 122-mm howitzer shells are landing  on  residential areas and other civilian facilities. The attacks  from the direction of Preocica and Poculica and other positions  along the Zenica line have been coupled by 60-mm mortar shells  from the direction of Mahala, the part of Stari Vitez under the  control of the Muslim army.    The command of the Vitez operational zone reports that two  children have already died in this infernal shelling. Nobody  bothers to estimate the extent of the material damage any  longer. The population has been warned by the local radio  station and in other appropriate ways to descend into bomb  shelters. The general alert sounded on 15 April last year is  still in force. It is 1800 hours and the pounding goes on. HVO  units are responding to the hostile fire with the means at their  disposal, the Vitez operational zone command said.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources A dispute has flared up at Alliance Resources, the Louisiana-based oil and gas company quoted in the UK, over the position of the company's chairman, Mr John O'Brien. An announcement on Tuesday stated that Mr O'Brien had resigned as a director and chairman. Mr O'Brien denies that he has left the company and says the statement was made without his knowledge. A second announcement was then issued saying that Mr O'Brien 'had been resigned' (sic) as of Monday. The company said it was seeking a non-executive chairman. In the interim, it named Mr Norris Harris as managing director. The dispute over Mr O'Brien's position follows his disclosure that Alliance's assets at flotation in March 1991 were incorrectly stated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro from Cartagena de Indias; from the </F> "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] During his speech to the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit of heads of state and government, President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari suggested the signing of more bilateral and  multilateral agreements in the region as a new concept of  integration among all the countries of the continent and  Ibero-America. Speaking at the convention center in Cartagena  de Indias, Colombia, the Mexican president explained the reasons  our country had for diversifying its relations and for promoting  domestic efforts for reforms, similar to what is happening in  other nations. However, Carlos Salinas de Gortari warned that  diversification of relations should not be an excuse to distract  commercial flow. Let us hear what he said:    [Begin Salinas recording] Other Ibero-American nations have  implemented plans in accordance to the needs of their people.  This encourages shared purposes. Efforts for integration among  our nations should not be an excuse to distract commercial flow  nor to appear as blocs closed to exchange. Compatible with  GATT, we can reach agreements that will be the motors of our  economic activity, investment, creation of jobs, and  distribution of income, which in the end is the important thing.  [end recording]    The Mexican president also stressed that there must be  greater recognition of the unilateral efforts for opening and  change which must be expanded to areas such as services, labor,  and the environment, all of which are factors for progress,  greater coordination of monetary policies, exchange of  technology, and shared production to strengthen commercial  openings and investment. President Salinas de Gortari said that  Ibero-America must use its influence in the multilateral forums,  especially in the new trade organization. The president said  that our priority today is the well-being of those who have less  because it is not possible to advance with inefficient and  isolated economies, nor can progress be made with  internationalized economies that are socially irresponsible.  For this reason, Salinas de Gortari said that we must insist on  an economic recovery that goes hand in hand with well-thought  and balanced social reforms, with democratic progress in  pluralism.    Today's speeches by Salvadoran President Armando Calderon  Sol, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Argentine  President Carlos Menem, were also very important. They  suggested an opening for the Cuban people's democracy. This  could be important in strengthening peace and stability in the  region. Fidel Castro did not broach this issue; however, he was  very clear in stating that the U.S. blockade on Cuba must end.  This is what he said:    [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, this is an excellent  opportunity to demand that the U.S. Government abide by the UN  resolution on the criminal and unjust blockade against Cuba.  [end recording]    I also wish to add that today's Colombian newspapers,  especially the Cartagena de Indias newspapers, did not give much  coverage to the summit. Instead they reported that the  Colombian soccer team traveled to the United States today to  participate in the World Cup.</p>

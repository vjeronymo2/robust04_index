			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Water company applies for drought order THREE VALLEYS Water, which serves 2.3m people to the north and east of London, has applied for a government drought order to combat the growing risk of severe water shortage in parts of south-east England. Water industry experts predict that unless there is heavy and sustained rainfall throughout the south and south-eastern parts of Britain in the next few weeks, many more areas will be affected by restrictions. Around 4.5m consumers are already subject to hosepipe or sprinkler bans. Supplies within the Three Valleys area, which covers parts of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex, are at their lowest since 1903 after four years of record low rainfall. Mr Jim McGowan, managing director, said it was a precautionary measure and customers should not panic. 'But we have been badly hit by four consecutive winters of low rainfall, particularly as 75 per cent of our supply comes from natural underground sources. Even heavy rainfall now will not change the overall situation much because the sources are recharged mainly during winter.' The National Rivers Authority, responsible for water supplies in England and Wales, said some areas were experiencing their worst drought for 100 years, and 20 inches of rain was needed to recharge underground supplies. 'Given that the average rainfall is two inches a month, this is simply not going to happen.' A drought order would give the water company powers to extend the present hosepipe ban to restrictions on car washes, fountains, watering municipal parks and golf courses and non-essential industrial uses such as window cleaning. The washing of aircraft at Heathrow Airport would also cease. The Meteorological Office said that in the five months from October to February the Thames region had received 54 per cent of the rainfall it would normally expect. Southern had 52 per cent and Anglian 63 per cent.</p>

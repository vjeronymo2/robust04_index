			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Planning Minister Dr. </F> 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani by Nabil Ghazzawi in Sanaa on 22 May]    [Text] Yemeni Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani  has ruled out the possibility that Saudi Arabia will recognize  the state set up last week by the secessionists in Aden, led by  'Ali Salim al-Bid.    Dr. al-Irayni said that if such thing were to happen, it  would return us to the 1960's era and the conflict between the  monarchists and republicans. I do not at all imagine that  anyone in Saudi Arabia wants the situation to return to the  1960's era. Therefore, I do not expect that Saudi Arabia in  particular would recognize this state because they [the Saudis]  are totally willing to have good relations with the Yemeni  people. Otherwise, we would return to an era which the Saudi  officials say repeatedly had been an extraordinary era in the  Yemeni-Saudi relations during the conflict between the  monarchists and republicans. No one wants a return to this era,  and I never expect Saudi Arabia to be one of the countries that  recognizes this enclave set up by al-Bid. This is because, as I  said, they want to have good relations with Yemen, and because  such recognition would return us to an era that we all do not  want.    Answering a question by the Jordanian press delegation last  Sunday on whether al-Bid's state has the pillars of a new state  or whether it is stillborn, Dr. al-Iryani said: In fact, two  thirds of the land is not under the control of this state. The  governorates of Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah are now under the  control of the legitimacy. Certainly, they still control Aden.  As for Hadhramaut Governorate, I have no doubt that it will  soon be under the unity's control. Distance is the only reason  state authority has not so far spread to it. They [southern  leaders] have no popular support on the ground. Most of the  land and population are under the control of the legitimate  state authority. Whoever proclaims a state from nothing will  fail.    On his expectations of when this current situation in Yemen  would be over, Dr. al-Iryani said: In fact, there is a military  dimension, and it is difficult to predict the period required by  this dimension. However, I believe popular pressure will have a  central role now that al-Bid has proclaimed a state. Therefore,  I consider the proclamation of the state a step toward ending  the situation. This means that this proclamation is an act of  suicide that brings the end nearer.    Regarding Sanaa's response to al-Bid's possible use of  chemical weapons--provided they are available to him--if the  legitimate forces entered Aden within the coming days, Dr.  al-Iryani said: First of all, the possibility that he has  chemical weapons is slight, but let us assume that he uses such  weapons, he will then be in his death throes. No one in the  world or in Yemen would forgive him for this crime or for using  any banned weapon. The proclamation of the state, makes the  fall and end of al-Bid more pressing and important. As for  cluster bombs, I am sure he does not have any.    Asked about President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's remarks on 21  May in which he emphasized development and economic reform in  Yemen, and whether that signals a new course, especially after  the legitimate troops have control of the entire Yemeni  territory, Dr. al-Iryani stressed: Undoubtedly, crushing the  rebellion will usher in a new phase in the life of the Yemeni  people, consolidating the Yemeni unity and firmly establishing  the principle of abidance by the peaceful transfer of power.  There will also be a unified central decisionmaking body.  Regrettably, our partners from the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  have understood political pluralism as being both plurality of  parties and plurality of stands. In other words, they have  allowed themselves to be partners and opposionists at the same  time. This is a wrong understanding which leads to subversive  acts. We have seen economic, political, and social subversion  because our partner to the authority is an oppositionist--or  rather a subversive--partner. When the opposition is outside  the authority, it can only be an opposition. Al-'Attas was the  prime minister and an oppositionist at the same time. For  example, we agreed with the World Bank on a reform program which  was received with broad enthusiasm. Everyone was ready to  contribute to the program, particularly Japan, the World Bank,  and the United States. A World Bank mission was supposed to  arrive in October 1993. Al-'Attas said: Postpone the visit.  He did not approve the mission's visit. I personally had to  postpone the visit until December or January. World Bank  officials said they would come whenever we were ready. This is  an example of an oppositionist when he is inside the authority  and a decisionmaker. Look how he ruins things. Otherwise, the  Yemeni economy would have been on the right course now. This is  an unprecedented case.    Regarding the Fattah [after 'Abd-al-FATTAH Isma'il, former  YSP secretary general who was killed in the June 1986 incidents  in Aden] corrective trend and by whom it is led and what their  position is, Dr. al-Iryani said: The Fattah trend is a YSP  wing, most members of which are from Yafi' and Aden, as well as  northern leaders whom we know. They were major loyalists to  'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il. This wing still exists inside the YSP.  It seems that they have decided to assert themselves as a wing  with a certain position. They consider themselves Fattahi's,  after 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il. For example, Fadl Muhsin, minister  of fish resources, considers himself a Fattahi, because his  relationship with 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il was very strong. He  always speaks of 'Abd-al-Fattah with respect. In addition, his  wife is 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il's sister.    On Aden radio's vituperations against him, Dr. al-Iryani  said: This is not the first time. They issued a statement  before the war which was broadcast over Aden radio and  television after the failure of the Salalah [in Oman] meeting.  They described me as a warmongering general. Al-Bid personally  slandered me and the brother president. This is a sign of  bankruptcy. God knows, it never occurred to me that we would  reach the point of war, but there was no other choice.    They led us to war. Two weeks before the war, I had the  honor to pound the table during a cabinet meeting while they  were all present and to tell them that the absence of the  defense minister from that session was a war decision. I said  this with a loud voice. Some of them like Jarallah 'Umar  [minister of Culture and Tourism], al-Salami [minister of  Electricity and Water Resources], and Fadl Muhsin [minister of  Fish Resources] remind me of this incident now. They neither  denied nor objected to my saying that the absence of the defense  minister from the session was a war decision and that he did not  come because he did not want to implement the fourth provision  of the Pledge and Accord Document on withdrawing the forces from  the border areas, and that these forces are the fangs the  secessionists will use if war erupts.    I am not a war strategist. But I exposed them by saying they  were preparing for war. That's why they are angry with me.  They keep accusing me so that one day I will not say that I had  announced at a cabinet session that the YSP had decided to go to  war by not sending the defense minister to attend the cabinet  session. I am proud that I was the one to warn against war, and  not one of them replied. I told Fadl Muhsin: Brother Fadl, it  is a pity if we hand things over to the military, so set your  conditions. Another minister, the minister of electricity,  replied that there are civilians who are more military-minded  than the military themselves, and that this is our problem. I  told him: Why hide things? I know you are speaking about me,  because you discussed this at a YSP Political Bureau meeting and  you decided to accuse me. He did not reply.    Regarding rumors that the YSP ministers are under arrest in  Aden, he said: This is not true. They are there and carrying  out their duties. But are they doing so voluntarily or under  pressure? This can be verified later but not now. I do not  rule out the possibility that many of the ministers who are  Political Bureau members are under pressure and are being  threatened to have them go along with things. I know they do  not support the proclamation of a state as this will mean their  end.    Regarding rumors that he lives a luxurious life, although I  saw him having only yogurt and juice for breakfast, Dr.  al-Iryani said: This is what I have been having for the past  four years. I do not pay any attention to such matters.    The truth is that the YSP started the war because they  expected that fighting would take place on the previous borders  for a few days or weeks, after which there would be pressure to  halt the fighting and negotiations would ensue while the forces  would remain on the borders between the two parts of Yemen.  However, al-Bid was surprised to see that the front has  collapsed and that fighting took place only 21 km from Aden, not  to mention that the fighting also moved to the Shabwah front,  which completely collapsed, as well as that of al-'Anad and its  being captured by the forces of legitimacy. They counted on the  fact that peace-keeping forces would come to disengage the  combatants.    However, the tribes tricked him, particularly in Bakil. The  military were deceived. I view this as the biggest political  trickery ever practiced by politicians against the military.  This is because no military man has ever been tricked as those  who were linked to al-Bid. Not a single bullet was fired in  Sanaa. They told the military that Harf Sufyan, 'Imran, Arhab,  and Naham would be set ablaze and that the Sanaa regime would be  busy extinguishing the fires in its own house. They told them:  We will entrench the partition plan, and you will once again  become a state.    Asked why all battles have started on a Wednesday, beginning  with 'Imran, Dhamar, and al-'Anad, Dr. al-Iryani said:  Wednedsay in the eastern and southern regions in Yemen is an  ill-omened day and not one that heralds optimism.</p>

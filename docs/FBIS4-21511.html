			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed SK: "Switzerland To Participate in the </F> Geneva Conference on Dangerous Waste -- In Favor of a Ban on  Export of Waste to Third World Countries"; as released by Bern  ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern, 14 Mar (ATS) -- Switzerland advocates banning  the export of waste to Third World countries. It will support  this proposal at the second conference of the signatories to the  Basel Convention on dangerous waste. Federal Counselor Ruth  Dreifuss will head the Swiss delegation to this conference which  is to take place from 21-25 March in Geneva, as decided on  Monday by the Federal Council.    The conference will deal mainly with a proposal from Denmark  which aims at banning the export of dangerous waste to Third  World countries, be it for storage or incineration purposes.  Switzerland considers this a reinforcement of the main  objective of the Basel conference on the control of  transnational transport and disposal of dangerous waste. It is  also ready to join OECD countries which no longer export waste  to Third World countries, even for recycling purposes.    According to the Federal Department of the Interior,  Switzerland has not allowed the export of waste to developing  countries since the 1986 regulation on the movement of hazardous  waste was implemented. It virtually initiated the Basel  Convention which came into force on 5 May 1992. The objectives  of this convention proceed along the same lines as the Swiss  strategy: If possible, all waste must be disposed in the  country where it is produced.</p>

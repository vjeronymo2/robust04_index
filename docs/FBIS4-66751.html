			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shehzad Iqbal Lolabi: "Acceleration of Freedom </F> Fighter Activities"]    [Text] The freedom fighters in Kashmir have accelerated  their activities against India's inhuman atrocities and have  caused serious damage to the Indian army. Forty bodies were  recovered from the rubble left in India's largest military camp  in occupied Kashmir which the freedom fighters had attacked  recently. In addition to Major General Fernandes, five  brigadiers and 10 colonels were among those killed. These  military officers had come to Srinagar to participate in an  important meeting to discuss plans to crush militant activities  in Kashmir. Some bodies were badly disfigured from burning and  were not recognizable. Major General Fernandes and several other  officers had come to Srinagar for an emergency meeting called by  Rajesh Pilot to plan a new strategy. During this meeting, there  were some powerful blasts and these officers were buried under  rubble. Important Indian sources and the New Delhi government  have declared the deaths of military officers in occupied  Kashmir to be the worst incident in recent months. According to  Kashmir Media Service, it took a long time to put out the fire  and find bodies. The Indian army had blockaded all the roads  leading to Badami Bagh during this time and even the local  workers were not allowed to travel.    According to the spokesmen for the Kashmiri freedom  fighters,  this is the first step. If the Indian army continues its  atrocities and does not end the siege of Hazratbal, more  destructive and dangerous steps will be taken. The situation in  the region has become more tense after the atrocious actions of  the Indian military. The Indian military is patrolling all roads  and many young men were shot to death during Indian troops'  vicious activities. Most of the freedom fighters are being  subjected to inhuman afflictions in torture chambers. The  Jumiatul Mujaheddin and the Ikhwanul Musalmin have jointly  accepted responsibility for attacking the Indian military camp  in Badami Bagh in the vicinity of Srinagar. According to a  correspondent of Islamic News International, the mujaheddin  launched this attack at the time when the Indian military  officers were looking at an exhibition of ammunition, that  according to them was seized from the freedom fighters in the  Badami Bagh camp. The freedom fighter targeted a patrol tanker  parked near there with rockets. The fire from this tanker  engulfed the whole camp. One major general and three colonels  were killed in this mishap. General Abdulbari, the supreme  commander of Jumiatul Mujaheddin of Jammu and Kashmir, has  announced an award of 100,000 rupees and star of bravery medal  to each of these brave fighters who took part in the devastation  of Badami Bagh military camp and destruction of military  vehicles and government buildings. The freedom fighters also  attacked Galewar cantonment and killed dozens of Indian  soldiers. In addition to damaging the cantonment, they totally  destroyed the artillery building. Various militant groups seeing  the vulnerable situation in occupied Kashmir have accelerated  their activities. They have demanded that Hazratbal be opened to  pilgrims now and to stop the present treatment of Kashmir  people. These organizations have decided to carry out joint  attacks at many places seeing the vulnerable situation. The  Indian army is shaken up by these recent attacks and is  considering increasing its activities against the freedom  fighters. The curfew restrictions are being increased to make  the lives of Kashmiri freedom fighters more difficult. Meanwhile  the Kashmiri freedom fighters have expressed their determination  to continue their efforts until Kashmir is fully  liberated.</p>

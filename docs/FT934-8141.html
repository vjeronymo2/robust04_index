			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Christmas tree demand 'strong' CHRISTMAS TREE growers are struggling to meet demand, the British Christmas Tree Growers' Association said yesterday. The association estimated demand at about 5m this year, but said the strength of demand meant that some trees might not be of a high standard. Growers report that forward buying is encouraging. 'They have not found it easy to meet the demand,' the association said. It added: 'The trees have grown well and there will be some very good quality fresh Christmas trees, but inevitably because of the demand there will be some trees which will not be up to the standard we would like.' The association said about 1m trees would be imported this year, mainly from Denmark and Belgium, which was slightly less than the number imported last year.</p>

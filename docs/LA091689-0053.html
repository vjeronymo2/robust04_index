			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ROBES OF CHINA' TO BE DISPLAYED IN RARE EXHIBITION AT MUSEUM  </P> <P> A rare display of "Robes of China" from the permanent collection of the  Edward-Dean Museum will be on view at the museum from Sunday through Nov. 19.  </P> <P> The 19th-Century court garments -- including robes, skirts and jackets  embroidered in multicolored silk floss and gold-wrapped strands -- afford a  glimpse into the spectacular world of pre-revolutionary China.  </P> <P> Because of the fragility of the garments and materials, and the museum's  responsibility for preservation, exhibition of the garments is uncommon.  (Another rare showing will be Feb. 16-March 23 at California State University,  San Bernardino.)  </P> <P> The Edward-Dean Museum is at 9401 Oak Glen Road, Cherry Valley, on the grounds  of the Riverside County Art and Cultural Center, and is open from 1 to 4:30  p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m.-4:30 Saturdays and Sundays.  </P> <P> Admission is $1; children under 12 free.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 845-2626.  </P></p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Windsor in Pounds 2.3m loss for year WINDSOR, the insurance and reinsurance broking group, finished the year ended September 30 1991 with an attributable loss of Pounds 2.29m, which was largely the result of a number of one-off problems now resolved by the new management. Mr Stanley Cohen, chairman, said the company had written off Pounds 2.4m in exceptional and extraordinary costs involving legal, reorganisation and property matters. The latter involved a Pounds 1m write-down on the value of the Hemel Hempstead freehold premises. He believed the greater part of the historical problems had been addressed and the company was now trading on budget for the current year. The strategy had been to return to the core business of general commercial and reinsurance broking where it had considerable strength. Turnover in the year came to Pounds 7m (Pounds 8.13m) and there was an operating profit of Pounds 369,000 (Pounds 482,000). After interest and exceptionals the pre-tax loss was Pounds 1.2m (profit Pounds 242,000).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Without disclosing how many Salvadoran troops will  be involved in the U.S. Army exercises dubbed Fuertes Caminos  II, [Defense Minister] General Humberto Corado confirmed that  they will participate. The defense minister also said that a  considerable amount of the mechanical equipment used in the  military exercises, which begin this month, will remain in the  country after the exercises conclude on 20 August.  Nevertheless, said the ranking military officer, the importance  of the exercises is the work experience that our troops will  gain.    [Begin Corado recording] Certain pieces of equipment will  remain in the country, and some will be kept by the U.S. Army  because they are quite expensive and can be used for joint  exercises in other Latin American countries. However, we will  have gained experience from working with highly skilled military  engineers. As you can see, the projects completed during the  first phase are of very good quality. In my opinion, the most  valuable part of this experience lies in the knowledge our  soldiers will gain from working with U.S. engineers. [end  recording]    Gen. Corado explained that the Army's new organic law will  broadly reconcile the role of the Armed Forces with the spirit  of the Constitution. He said the internal readjustment process  is growing increasingly positive.    [Begin Corado recording] I have been informed that [words  indistinct] have been sent to the Supreme Court of Justice. As  I already told the president of the Republic, we will adhere to  any court decision that opposes the continuation of these joint  exercises between the U.S. Army and the Salvadoran Armed Forces.  However, as long as a resolution to that end is not issued, we  will continue the operation until 20 August when the second  phase ends. [end recording]    The defense minister argued, among other things, that the  unconstitutionality appeal filed last year with the Supreme  Court of Justice, which opposes the presence of U.S. troops in  the country, is not hindering the military exercises.  Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court decision favors the appeal,  the exercises will be suspended within the framework of respect  for the Constitution. For the time being, however, the  exercises in El Salvador will continue, Corado said.</p>

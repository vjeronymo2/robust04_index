			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Cosmos Speaks--Rudolf Scharping </F> Can Hardly Believe It: Helmut Schmidt Is Campaigning for Him"]    [Text] The "real satisfaction" of being honored, said the  much-praised one, often remains concealed behind cliches and  fulsome praise--namely the message "that others identify with  our intentions and hopes."    This is how Helmut Schmidt formulated it almost 11 years ago  in Berlin in a eulogy of Robert McNamara, former U.S. secretary  of defense and later World Bank president. The anointed words at  that time sounded like an obituary of himself, failed Chancellor  Helmut Schmidt.    One year previously, in the fall of 1982, he had been  toppled  by Helmut Kohl. True, he still had an enormous lead in the West  German popularity list of politicians. But he knew that the SPD  [Social Democratic Party] under its chairman, Willy Brandt,  would cause him grievous shame one month later at the Cologne  party congress "going ballistic" and would shunt him into  political exile once and for all.    Now Helmut Schmidt patently believes he has finally found  someone younger who shares his intentions and hopes: Rudolf  Scharping, 6 foot 4 inches tall, minister-president of  Rhineland-Palatinate, SPD candidate for the chancellorship.  Schmidt considers him capable of replacing [Schmidt's]  successor, Helmut Kohl.    In mid-March, the SPD leadership met in Bonn's "Maritim"  Hotel for a dinner honoring its former chancellor. The festive  party was to belatedly celebrate Schmidt's 75th birthday--and  was surprised by the guest of honor, for notorious SPD-panner  Schmidt praised his party and its chief, Scharping. And the  Hanseat forgot all arrogance and even referred by name to  Palatinate Kohl.    "This man must be toppled," Schmidt twice drummed into the  assembled group. The situation for a turnaround has arrived:  "There is an SPD that can do it." And turning to Scharping, his  neighbor at the table, he added: "And there is one who can do  it."    Schmidt, in his unexpected role as campaign fighter, this  week will present a book of over 200 pages (The Year of  Decision) which was finished in March--political fast food,  prepared for "the male and female voters of 1994." The Schmidt  primer, aggressive, occasionally arrogant in tone, conservative  in goals, is bursting on the scene in the midst of the SPD's  program discussion.    In the "preface," Schmidt already expounds his judgment that  in this superelection year, the voters will decide "whether we  will sink even deeper into the morass of tactical political  games--or rid ourselves of it": through electing a "different, a  fresh Federal Government."    "This man," meaning Kohl, has "no concept for our economic  future, no idea for our spiritual future; he can neither turn  around the mass unemployment caused by him nor put an end to  violent acts in Germany."    The chancellor only pulls his opponents "into the filth of  his suspicions--that he knows how to do." If Weimar Republic  conditions should occur and if democracy were harmed,  then--according to Schmidt's harshest accusation--the chancellor  is culpable: In February, he accused the Social Democrats of  "treason against Germany's future," a slogan used in the Weimar  democracy by the Communists against Social Democrats.    A "fresh force" is needed at the head of the state. Schmidt:  "It offers itself in Rudolf Scharping. This is a man who has  learned how to govern as the head of government in  Rhineland-Palatinate and has shown there what he can do."    What a change: For years, Schmidt had tormented and nettled  the comrades, mostly for fun and to the advantage of their  political opponents. He was constantly quarreling with his party  and its representatives. During election campaigns, he provided  only sparse support for Johannes Rau or Hans-Jochen Vogel.  Schmidt-Cosmos, as comrades named the know-it-all, with lectures  and books raked in the big money which he, while still in  political office, begrudged others.    Despite all that, or perhaps even because of maintaining  such  distance from his own camp, Helmut Schmidt remained a  media-attractive political pensioner even after moving out of  the office of chancellor.    Now the elder statesman--Scharping at first could hardly  believe his good luck--just in time before the elections, is  returning into the arms of his party. The last survivor of the  legendary Wehner/Schmidt/Brandt triumvirate, in his old age  might yet be elevated to the position of "grand old man" of the  traditional party.    Schmidt evidently is impressed by Scharping's will to power  which wants to place the SPD in the center of the voter  spectrum. No fear of a common ground with the conservatives, but  distance from the ecological and pacifist movements which have  changed society and Social Democracy--the former chancellor  likes that. How often had he complained about the "pack of  swine" of Brandt's party. Now he feels belated gratification.    For the election in the fall, Schmidt would like to see  strong people's parties, and not overly strong marginal  parties--FDP [Free Democratic Party] and Alliance 90/Greens. He  hopes that the extremist fringe parties will stay below 5  percent. Whosoever, out of aversion to the large parties, seeks  refuge with the extremists, increases "the probability of a  grand coalition emerging in the end." He is not comfortable with  that, but to him--and here he is more outspoken than his  protege, Scharping--it is preferable to "rainbow coalitions, be  they led by my own party or by the CDU [Christian Democratic  Union]."    Schmidt is reappraising even his own ranks. Most striking is  his differentiated judgment of Oskar Lafontaine. Since the  latter's pronouncements on the secondary virtues of the  then-chancellor 12 years ago, Schmidt had vilified and avoided  him. But at the birthday party in the "Maritim," Schmidt had a  long conversation with the Saarlander [Lafontaine]; he shares  the latter's analyses of mistakes made in the rapid introduction  of the currency union in the course of German unification.    With regard to "perceptiveness, eloquence, and capability of  implementing plans"--all of them secondary virtues--the  Saarlander resembles Franz Josef Strauss, who also "had not been  a trained economist, yet still was a good finance minister." "In  a similar way...one could imagine" Lafontaine "in the same  office."    Once a chancellor, always a chancellor; to hand out grades,  assign places, he enjoys doing that. But whether such assistance  helps Scharping, or whether the wondrous discipline in his party  will get lost when rebellious comrades will soon hold him  responsible for Mr. Schmidt's dispensed wisdom, remains to be  seen--at the latest, in the fall.</p>

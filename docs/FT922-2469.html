			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Prince - Pop It's not hard to see the appeal of Prince. His spectacular show wafts you into the night club of your dreams. The sound system is as energising as it is exciting; the women - and men - on stage as sensual as imagination; look here, and a screen is firing exotic images; look there, and a dancer is cartwheeling across the stage. The lights pulverise; the musicians pound. At the centre of this mayhem is the lithe mannikin himself, five feet nothing of techno-creativity, who travels to the stage by lift, encased in a pod and accompanied by 'Thunder'. Now in yellow suit, now black, now purple, finally in white, he orchestrates the extravaganza from the front, sometimes playing guitar, sometimes portable keyboards. He pokes his guitar between his male rapper's legs, or entwines his body around his two female dancers while tearing off their clothes. He strips off to expose the most elastic 34-year-old body in the business. It is all too frantically jolly to be decadent. Even the gilt bed that hovers over the audience on which Prince capers with the girls during 'Insatiable' is more of a fleeting trompe d'oeil than an erotic image. There is something Shakespearian about it all, Puck's hidden woodland frolics of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and for once the cavernous Earl's Court did not manage to destroy the magic. Perhaps Prince has to keep moving because his songs hardly merit sedentary listening. This is the world's most flashy disco, with the feet doing the talking. The audience hardly need to be harangued into joining in. 'That one was for lovers; this one's for whores', was Prince's main verbal contribution, as he launched into 'Sexy Motherfucker', a song which just about sums up his party line and which got the thousands providing the chorus. After his lacklustre appearance in 1990 Prince was out to prove that he has the most melodramatic imagination in pop. On the screens you could catch his smile as he pushed on relentlessly, never flagging, never doubting the impact of his extravaganza. He is big enough to let the gigantic Rosie Gaines on stage with her six octave vocal range and explosive version of 'Dr Feelgood'. But in the extended finale Prince bags the acclaim. There is no subtlety; no emotion; no humanity in the performance. It hardly touches the soul, but anyone interested in pop music as theatre should catch Prince now. Earl's Court, until June 24. Manchester Maine Road June 26, Glasgow Parkhead Stadium June 28.</p>

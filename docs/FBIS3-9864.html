			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Krasimir Tsigularov commentary: "Yet Another Own Goal"] </F>   [Text] The Bulgarian Danube ports are no longer expected  to handle petrol and liquid fuels for export. Such goods shall  no longer be transported on the Danube. The ban not only  applies to ferryboat transports. In this manner, our country is  formally complying with the restricted Yugoembargo. This is how  Bulgaria itself is actually erecting another barrier obstructing  its already weakened foreign economic relations. In addition to  this, our country is doing so while perfectly realizing that it  cannot expect any advantage whatsoever from its action. There  is even more: Quite a few Bulgarian companies that benefited  from the cheap river transport faciilities for re-exporting oil  products are going to complain. With one stroke they are all  practically ostracized as embargo violators. It is not  difficult to forecast that the elimination of the Bulgarian  competition would be very profitable for some foreign companies  -- simply because any vacuum in international trade is easy to  fill.    The candid enthusiasm with which we recently joined the  embargo against Iraq led to losses that are expected to affect  our economy for a long time in the future. Hundreds of millions  of dollars have vanished somewhere in the course of Desert  Storm, as a result of unfulfilled business deals and more than  $1 billion were lost as a result of Iraq's unpaid debts toward  our country. It appeared at one time that we would be placed at  the end of the queue of those waiting for compensation in  connection with the Iraqi embargo, but even this was forgotten  with time and we never got anything.    The act of submissively joining the Yugo-embargo cut off the  main route of Bulgarian exports to the West. Transit corridors  through Serbia have been opening repeatedly over the last three  months, but not even one truck has passed through them. As far  as Turkey is concerned, it is about to further complicate the  procedure for the transport of oil products and petrol through  the straits, after the tragic incident in the Bosphorus. Gas  deliveries through Ukrainian territory are frequently causing  concern because of the controversies between Russia and the  Ukraine, and also because of unsettled accounts. As things are  going, we might nostalgically remember some Bulgarian magicians  who used to set fire to water and transform it into fuel.    After the Danube was closed for petrol barges, no one is  talking about compensations. However, even if anyone should  mention them, he should immediately remember the lessons of the  past. It is interesting to learn, whether anyone knows that  compensations should be better sought before one has inflicted  his own goal against himself. After we have voluntarily fallen  into our own trap, it is difficult to find volunteers willing to  rescue us.</p>

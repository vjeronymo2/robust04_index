			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Algerian extremists kidnap foreigners ALGERIAN Islamic extremists yesterday kidnapped three employees of the French consulate-general in Algiers, appearing to intensify a new campaign to force foreigners out of the country and increase pressure on the government. The abductions follow the murder of seven foreigners in the past four weeks. They were the first direct attacks on members of Algeria's 70,000-strong expatriate community since Islamic extremists launched a violent campaign to topple the military-backed government nearly two years ago. Algerian authorities also disclosed yesterday that they thwarted the attempted abduction of two Japanese on Saturday. No group immediately claimed responsibility for yesterday's kidnappings. But a group calling itself the Armed Islamic Group - one of many extremist Islamic cells operating in Algeria - said last week it killed three expatriate workers for ABB Sae Sadelmi, a Milan-based oil group. The group said the killings were part of a campaign to target foreigners working for the Algerian regime, and warned expatriates to leave the country. Two French citizens and two Russian military trainers have been killed this month. The attacks signal a new phase in a 21-month-old campaign which has claimed about 2,000 lives since the government cancelled elections to deny almost certain victory for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which had pledged to establish an Islamic state. They are of particular concern for the thousands of foreigners working in Algeria's crucial oil and gas industry - which accounts for more than 90 per cent of hard-currency earnings - whose numbers have swelled in the last two years following government encouragement of foreign participation in the sector. Diplomats are urging all foreigners to tighten security.</p>

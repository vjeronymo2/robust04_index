Kim received the letter from U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James  Laney, who visited the president at Chongwadae [presidential  offices] Monday morning shortly before Kim convened a meeting of  security-related ministers, Chu said.    In his letter, Clinton told Kim that the United States has  the will and determination to honor its commitment to defend  South Korea against any aggression or provocation.    In order to do so, America will strengthen the joint  U.S.-South Korean defense posture, Clinton said.    Clinton also reaffirmed that the United States will carry  out  the security agreement reached with President Kim when the two  leaders met in Washington last November.    Since North Korea has not been sincere in allowing outside  inspection of its nuclear facilities and in its dialogue with  the South, the Korean peninsula and the world have reached the  point where peace and stability are seriously threatened,  Clinton said.    The U.S. President proposed that Washington and Seoul  continue strengthening close consultation between the two sides  while maintaining their basic position calling for a peaceful  resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, Chu said.    In spite of North Korea's attempts to drive a wedge between  Seoul and Washington, the United States will never allow any  such maneuvering to harm its relationship with South Korea,  Clinton noted.    The United States will deal firmly with any North Korean  moves, Clinton said, and will honor its pledge to defend South  Korea under any circumstances.</p>

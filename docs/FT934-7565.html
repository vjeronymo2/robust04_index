			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Graphology 'a waste of money' COMPANIES which use handwriting analysis as part of their recruitment process are wasting their money, a leading psychologist claimed yesterday. Dr Donald McLeod, a corporate psychologist with the Independent Assessment and Research Centre at Ashridge Management College, said: 'If you're using graphology as an indicator of people's effectiveness in the workplace, you might as well throw a sheaf of application forms out the window and choose those that land face up.' In a report for the British Psychological Society, Dr McLeod - previously chief psychologist for the Civil Service Commission - points to recent research which he says indicates that a full-scale psychometric test is the most effective way of studying a potential employee's suitability. Graphology is firmly at the bottom, producing 'zero predictive effectiveness', Dr McLeod said. But the report was attacked as 'alarming' by Ms Mary Nicholson, head of the London-based Graphology Business, which provides a handwriting consultancy service to corporate clients. 'Graphology is based on a very precise theory, with practitioners needing to use their psychological knowledge to be able to understand very precise signs,' she said. While the use of handwriting analysis is not widespread in the UK - in some US states it is prohibited for recruitment purposes - some notable employers do use graphology tests. For example, all applicants to merchant bank SG Warburg must submit handwriting samples for anal-ysis. The bank stresses it takes the results seriously, but says the handwriting test comes towards the end of a lengthy selection procedure and that a candidate would not be rejected solely on the basis of it. Analysis in recruitment seems to be accorded more credibility in France, but may be less significant than in recent years. For example, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, says that while it once used handwriting analysis to sift application forms in the first instance, it now only refers to a graphologist where there might be a doubt about a candidate, and even then the candidate would be called back for a further interview. 'We never make a decision based on a graphologist's comments,' says the company's human resources department, calling the analysis 'a tool' used to contribute to the overall picture of a candid-ate. French headhunters would tend to use a graphologist's services, but other testing methods are also employed.

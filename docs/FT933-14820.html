			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Branson's defiance pays off in France RICHARD BRANSON'S Virgin Megastore has set out to try to prove that France's 1906 Sunday trading law is an ass, and has found the new French government sympathetic to its case. Fined FFr500,000 (Pounds 58,000) in 1990 for trying to open its Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles stores on Sundays, Virgin was last year given a one-year 'derogation' allowing it to open its Champs Elysees store. This ran out last week, when a Paris tribunal ruled that compact discs and Virgin's other wares were not essential fare for tourists, and the local prefet - or government representative - refused to renew Virgin's exemption. Virgin decided to pretend that last Sunday did not exist by staying open for 38 hours from 10am on Saturday until one minute past midnight on Monday morning. It attracted 100,000 people into its Champs Elysees store, sold 30,000 CDs, and landed the government with an awkward political problem. But given rising national unemployment, Mr Michel Giraud and Mr Alain Madelin, ministers of labour and enterprise respectively, seem ready to risk the wrath of small shopkeepers. They said they would look with favour on Sunday opening by companies which could prove they were creating jobs or, if forced to close on Sundays, would have to cut jobs. Mr Pierre Delmas, Virgin Stores' French director-general, said yesterday the Champs Elysees shop had done 20 per cent of its weekly turnover on Sundays in the past year. If forced to close, it would have to shed 15 per cent of its staff. 'If we get the right to open on Sundays across the country, and open four new megastores a year, then at the end of five years we could create up to 800 new jobs,' he claimed. France's Sunday trading law and practice is no less erratic than in other European countries, as shown by the fact that Ikea, the warehouse furniture chain, is allowed to open its shop to the north of Paris on Sundays but is forced to shut another to the south of Paris.</p>

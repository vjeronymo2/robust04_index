			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Humber estuary sees its ship come in: A look at a port's revival that left the Thames trailing in its wake More than Pounds 150m of investment has been committed to developing port and trade facilities in the Humber estuary since the abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme five years ago. The scheme, which gave dockers jobs for life unless they could be persuaded to accept redundancy payments, inhibited investment because of overmanning and uncertain returns. Since port labour markets were deregulated the Humber has become Britain's busiest estuary, shifting 62m tonnes of cargo last year, overtaking the Thames and accounting for 17 per cent of the UK's seaborne trade. The rapid build-up of investment is expected to help expand this share to 25 per cent by the end of the century. Traffic exceeded 40,000 shipping movements last year, a growth of more than 50 per cent in 10 years. The latest substantial piece of investment will open next month at Immingham  -owned by Associated British Ports - on the Humber's south bank. It is a Pounds 14.5m third berth at the port's oil terminal. A further Pounds 4m has been spent by the users - Conoco, Petrofina and Total - on the pipework. The new berth was handed over to the oil companies - which run two refineries at Immingham - last month for trials. It will cut queues of ships in the Humber waiting to load or discharge bulk oil or petrochemical cargoes. The terminal has been handling about 100 ships a month up to now. The Humber has four ports - Hull, Grimsby, Immingham and Goole, all owned by ABP - 10 river wharves and about 100 other berths. ABP's commitment so far is about Pounds 85m. Its other large investments include Pounds 13m for a second large roll-on, roll-off terminal at Immingham, Pounds 13.5m to redevelop Grimsby's fish dock and associated markets, Pounds 12.5m on a new dredger, and Pounds 11m on a floating ro-ro stage in the river at Hull. This floating stage saves two hours' sailing time locking in and out of the port's docks and has encouraged North Sea Ferries to spend Pounds 62m on two ships offering a dedicated overnight freight service each way between the Humber and Rotterdam. Cargoes passing through the Humber include iron ore, coal, oil, petrochemicals, fertilisers, steel, cement, newsprint, timber, containers, ro-ro trailers, fish, grain, sugar and cars. Grimsby imports VWs and Audis and exports Toyotas from Derby. Saab, BMW and Volvo are also regular users. The nature of the ports has changed dramatically since the 1980s. Immingham exported 5m tonnes of coal a year before the miners' strike a decade ago. Now it imports about 4m tonnes for electricity generation and coking. However, a combination of manning agreements and union-controlled custom and practice meant it used to take a week to shift a 25,000-tonne cargo of coal through the port. Now it takes 24 hours. No one is sure what has happened to numbers of jobs in the ports because those for dockers are now scattered through several small independent stevedoring companies. But Mr Geoff Kent, Immingham's port superintendent, says there are about 5,000 jobs dependent on the port. This is growing as more companies move in. Previously they set up warehouses and process plant outside the port boundary so dockers could not claim and regulate new jobs. Mr Robert Smith, assistant port manager for both Grimsby and Immingham, says about Pounds 40m of ABP's investment in the two ports has been made in the last two-and-a-half years as competitiveness and prospects improved. Investment will continue to move up steadily, if only because of the need to keep buying cranes to cope with growth - they cost about Pounds 1m each.</p>

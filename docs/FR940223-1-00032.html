			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (k) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price and the Class III price) by the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to &sect;1135.43(d); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. Any applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during the prior month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Section 1135.61 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1135.61  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Computation of weighted average differential price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  weighted average differential price  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for all milk received from producers shall be computed by the market administrator as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to &sect;1135.60 (a) through (c) and (f) through (l) for all handlers who filed reports pursuant to &sect;1135.30 for the month, and who made the payments pursuant to &sect;1135.71 for the preceding month;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Divide the resulting amount by the sum, for all handlers, of the total hundredweight of producer milk and the total hundredweight for which values were computed pursuant to &sect;1135.60(j); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per hundredweight of milk included under paragraph (c) of this section. The result shall be the weighted average differential price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1135.62  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Redesignated as &sect;1135.63]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14.

France has promised to give Brazil the technology of a liquid fuel  motor called Viking, which powers the Ariane space launch vehicle, the  officials said. In return, the French company Arianespace would be awarded a  $60-million contract for the launch of two Brazilian communications satellites,  they added. However, a statement issued by the French denied that a final  decision has been made.  </P></p>

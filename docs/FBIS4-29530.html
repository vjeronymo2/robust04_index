			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- Share prices jumped  sharply at the Korean Stock Exchange on Monday at the report of  a possible South-North summit meeting.    The leading composite stock price index was up 16.31 points,  or 1.76 percent, over the weekend to finish at 942.50.    Besides the summit issue, the stock authorities' decision to  allow three Hyundai firms' issues to be transacted off-board  contributed to the overall surge.    Volume was large with 49 million shares changing hands at  900  billion won (1,116.62 million U.S. dollars).    Advancing issues overwhelmed decliners 632 to 181 with 76  others remaining unchanged. Mining and insurance were only  major issues that slid. The rise of construction, trade and  banking issues was especially sharp.</p>

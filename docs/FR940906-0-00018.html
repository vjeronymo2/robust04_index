			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.3. Subpart 2 of part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Huntington-Ashland nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 12, 1992, the State was required to meet the provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements to control volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A notice of final rulemaking approving these RACT corrections was published on September 17, 1992 (57 FR 42895).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the 1977 Act, EPA approved the State of West Virginia SIP control strategy for the Huntington, West Virginia nonattainment area. EPA determined that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules are enforceable. As stated above, since enactment of the 1990 amendments the State of West Virginia submitted revisions to its RACT regulations_Title 45 Legislative Rules, Series 21, Regulation to Prevent and Control Air Pollution from Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds (``Series 21''). EPA finds that these additional measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reductions in ambient ozone levels in the Huntington, West Virginia area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other enforceable control measures have come into place since the Huntington, West Virginia area violated the ozone NAAQS. Reductions in ozone precursor emissions occurred due to the mandatory lowering of fuel volatility and automobile fleet turnover due to the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program. The Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline decreased during the years 1988 to 1990 from 10.5 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.5 psi and continued to decrease from 9.5 psi in 1990 to 9.0 psi in 1992. Reductions due to these programs were determined using the mobile emission inventory model MOBILE 5.0a and relevant vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data. As a result of these permanent and enforceable reductions, emissions of VOCs decreased by 1.1 tons/day (1988&hyph;1990) and by 2.2 tons/day (1990&hyph;1992) in the Huntington area. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) were reduced by 0.3 tons/day and 0.4 tons/day during the same periods respectively in this area. The State of West Virginia's maintenance plan requires the continuation of the federal RVP program. The State demonstrated that point source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn during the period in which Huntington area air quality came into attainment. Reductions due to decreases in production levels or from other unenforceable scenarios such as voluntary reductions were not included in the determination of the emission reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA finds that the combination of measures contained in the SIP and federal measures have resulted in permanent and enforceable reductions in ozone precursors that have allowed the Huntington-Ashland area to attain the NAAQS, and therefore, that the redesignation criterion of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) has been met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Fully approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the West Virginia maintenance plan for the Huntington, West Virginia area because EPA finds that West Virginia's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. The Huntington, West Virginia area will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with Section 175A of the Act. Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after the area is redesignated. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period. To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 12, 1992, the state of West Virginia submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. Since this area is part of a multi-state area, West Virginia projected their 1990 inventory to 1993 in order to have a corresponding attainment base year with Kentucky. The 1993 VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO inventory is considered most representative of attainment conditions because no violations occurred in 1993, and it reflects the typical inventory for the three-year period demonstrating attainment of the standard for the entire Huntington-Ashland area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> West Virginia's submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category. West Virginia's submittal also contains information related to how it comported with EPA's guidance, which model and emission factors were used (note MOBILE 5.0a was used), how VMT data was generated, what RVP was considered in the base year, and other technical information verifying the validity of the Huntington, West Virginia emission inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories are shown in the following two tables in section 5.B. The TSD which has been prepared for this action contains a more in-depth description of the base year inventory for the Huntington area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As summarized in the following tables, totals for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions were projected from the 1990 and 1993 base years out to the year 2005. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. The projections demonstrate that the ozone standard will be maintained. i.e., emissions within the Huntington area are not expected to exceed the level of the base year attainment inventory during this time period. EPA believes that the emissions projections demonstrate that the area will continue to maintain the ozone NAAQS because this area achieved attainment through VOC controls and reductions. Finally, EPA's TSD contains more in-depth details regarding the projected emission inventories for the Huntington area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

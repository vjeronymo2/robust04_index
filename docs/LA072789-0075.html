			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> African heads of state, ending a three-day Organization of African Unity summit  in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said the size of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Namibia  is inadequate to guarantee even the minimum conditions for free and fair  elections. They also asked the U.N. Security Council to order South Africa to  halt intimidation of voters in advance of Namibia's pre-independence balloting  Nov. 6. There are 4,650 U.N. troops in Namibia, far below the 7,500 recommended  by the Security Council in 1978. The 49-nation African group also called for  Western nations to emulate the United States and France and write off the  continent's crushing $230-billion foreign debt.  </P></p>

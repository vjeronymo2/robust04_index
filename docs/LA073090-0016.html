			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> 'Little Mermaid' a Little Racy?: Who says you can tell a kid's movie by its  cover? A Phoenix supermarket chain pulled copies of Disney's animated movie  "The Little Mermaid" off its shelves last week when a customer complained that  artwork on the cover contains an offensive phallic symbol. Michelle Couch of  Mesa said that her husband pointed out the offending artwork to her.  </P> <P> She said she complained to the chain, Bashas', only after being ignored by  Disney. Tanya Steele, vice president of publicity for Buena Vista Home Video, a  Disney subsidiary, said that about a dozen people have complained about a  phallic symbol they believe is part of a golden castle drawn on the cover of  the video tape. But she added it is not likely that the drawing will be  changed. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

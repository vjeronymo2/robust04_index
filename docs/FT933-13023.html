			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove expands in US and wins new orders BROMSGROVE Industries yesterday announced an acquisition in the US for Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.33m) in cash and loan notes, and new orders which reflected its investment in specialist niche markets. The acquisition is of the Montgomery Group, a Houston-based precision machinist servicing the international oil and gas extraction industry. Montgomery employs 25 people and in its last financial year recorded turnover of Dollars 3m. A subsidiary, Thornton Precision Forgings, is to supply compressor-vanes for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 engine. Initially the contract is worth Dollars 200,000 and is Thornton's first significant US military order. Rover Group has transferred the casting of 16 engine components to BSK Aluminium, the Droitwich-based company. Initially worth Pounds 450,000 annually, the contract could be worth Pounds 750,000 if machining was brought in-house. BSK has also won orders, potentially worth up to Pounds 2.8m per year from 1994, for component supply to vehicles not yet officially announced.</p>

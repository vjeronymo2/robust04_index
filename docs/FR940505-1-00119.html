Many, although not all, older cars are often perceived to be utilized by citizens with lower incomes. Thus, one could argue straight emission-based fees are regressive. However, on average, older vehicles are driven fewer than 5,000 miles annually for reliability reasons. A fee formula structure which forgives the first 5,000 miles of VMT and emissions, such as the system outlined here, allows low income car owners continued free use of their vehicles for daily necessities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If EPA or the FIP areas were to adopt a VMT/emission fee system other details would need to be addressed. For example, EPA would suggest using actual VMT for each vehicle as determined by odometer checks at the time of the biennial I/M inspection. To discourage odometer tampering, EPA would propose to include in all registration material home and work addresses for all household members so that the distance from home to work could be estimated. EPA would also propose some type of system to ``stop the clock'' on VMT additions when the vehicle is being used out of state as during a vacation. (Granting fee exemptions for all VMT outside the FIP area appears to be too complex and/or cumbersome). EPA invites comment on this and other odometer tampering issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the emission portion of the fee calculation, EPA would suggest using the actual IM240 scores without regard to model year and with no adjustments for evaporative or cold start emissions. Since all three FIP areas need substantial reductions in both VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, EPA suggests that the emission readings for the two pollutants be given equal weight in calculating the VMT/emissions fee. As with other fee programs described in this document, the fee could be charged at the rate of $10,000/ton of emissions, based on the emissions generated by an individual car. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Again, EPA is not proposing a VMT/emission fee within the FIP. EPA believes such a fee system is most appropriately implemented at the local level and invites comment on the suggested program outlined here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Parking Cash Out_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even in downtown areas, most employees in California receive free or subsidized parking spaces. Current tax codes allow employers to offer this benefit without the employer or the employee having to pay taxes on the value of the space. Since parking costs represent the bulk of the daily cost of driving to work, these ``free'' spaces are a strong incentive for employees to drive to work alone. For example, in downtown Los Angeles the average employer-paid subsidy for employee parking is 43 percent more than the cost per average commute trip for gasoline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of his Climate Change Action Plan, President Clinton has called for transforming the existing tax subsidy for employer-paid parking into a powerful reward for commuters to ride transit, carpool, or find other ways to get to work. The Administration will shortly propose changes in the tax law necessary to bring about parking subsidy reform. This same proposal is included in the FIP, in a form which is consistent with EPA's authority. The proposal does not modify the tax code or require payments by any employer. Rather, it applies certain restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain employers may not offer free parking unless they offer employees the option of retaining the parking space or accepting a cash allowance equal to the market cost of the parking space. The cash allowance will be considered taxable income, but under current tax law, up to $60 per month of the cash may be taken in the form of a transit pass, which would be tax-exempt. Those who opt for the parking space will be unaffected by the change. Whether the employee decides to take the free parking or the cash allowance, the company can still deduct the cost from corporate income tax. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cash out provision would be applicable to employer-paid parking provided by firms of 25 or more employees, located in an access-controlled parking lot not owned by the employer. Those spaces or lots leased by employers from a third party before March 14, 1994 are included only if the lease explicitly includes the value of the parking per space and the lease allows the employer to reduce the number of parking spaces leased without monetary penalty. The provisions will apply to all spaces leased on or after March 14, 1994, regardless of the form of the lease. Employers who execute leases on or after this date should make sure the per space value and the right to reduce the number of leased spaces are included in the lease. Absence of either will not be grounds for exemptions. Absence of a per space value will mean that the employer may not offer free parking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time EPA lacks information on the number of employers and employees who would be affected by this program or the average value of leased parking spaces in each of the three nonattainment areas, making it difficult to estimate the exact impact of a cash out program. Analysis by Dr. Donald Shoup of UCLA suggests that if offered in downtown Los Angeles, one form of parking cash out would reduce employee solo driving by 20 percent, and would eliminate 9,000 vehicle trips per day.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- Over 50 percent of the major  companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plan to cut the  number of employees, particularly in clerical sections during  the current fiscal year, a survey said Saturday [4 June].    The poll, conducted by KYODO NEWS SERVICE on 100 companies  which close the books for the business year ending March 31,  says many corporations want to enhance corporate structure by  adjusting employment amid the yen's surge and escalated price  competition.    Of the companies polled, 21 firms said they will reduce the  number of employees even though the economy will recover, while  46 said they will maintain their current stance of scaling down  the workforce for the time being, the poll said.    Ricoh Co., a major office automation equipment producer,  said  in the poll that they will cut back their workforce because a  sharp sales rise will be unlikely amid the current tendency for  stable economic growth.    All Nippon Airway Co. said they want to boost competition  ability by streamlining management arms.    During the 1993 business year, 48 companies increased the  number of employees by 9,993, while 49 companies decreased  39,973 employees.    For the current fiscal year, however, only two firms said  they will boost their workforce, while 52 companies plan to trim  the number of workers, it said.    By sectors, such industries as steel, nonferrous metals,  textiles, chemical, telecommunications and transportation will  step up their workforce reduction plans, it said.    For the reasons of scaling down employment, a majority of  companies want to strengthen competition in and outside Japan  against falling product prices amid the yen's surge and the  global economic slowdown.    They also said rising job operation efficiency needs less  employees than ever before, the survey said.</p>

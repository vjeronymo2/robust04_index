			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Syndicate bank backs bid for Wm Hill ONE OF the syndicate of banks which has lent Pounds 350m to William Hill is backing the Pounds 360m consortium bid for the betting shop chain, part of Brent Walker. A majority of the banks, including some which have also lent to Brent Walker itself, are anxious that the bid, being put together by SG Warburg, should be pursued, along with other proposals for William Hill. For the first time Brent Walker admitted officially yesterday that it had received an approach for William Hill. The offer is from a group of investors advised by SG Warburg. It would be structured about half-and-half in equity and new loans, with the equity coming from a number of venture capital investors. Brent Walker said it was seeking further information from the Warburg group. A meeting was held between both sides last Friday when Warburg is understood to have requested the chance to perform due diligence and talk to William Hill's management. William Hill is ring-fenced from the rest of Brent Walker and its debt is due to be repaid or refinanced by March 1 next year. Brent Walker said it was looking at a number of alternative proposals. These include possible bids from other parties, the flotation of William Hill or even the refinancing of the loan in March. William Hill is one of the pillars on which the Brent Walker business plan, which was agreed with bankers last year when they completed a Pounds 1.65bn refinancing, is built. Without William Hill, Brent Walker could find it difficult to service its other debts.</p>

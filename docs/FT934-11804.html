			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / It will not go away: Major must satisfy two audiences It is a summit that Mr John Major would rather do without. Maastricht is not a treaty that his battered government has any cause to celebrate. Instead, in the words of one senior minister, the UK prime minister would like Europe simply 'to go away for a while'. He has problems enough at home without reopening the raw wounds in the Conservative party over European integration. So as foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd put it this week, Britain will be seeking to persuade its European partners not to treat as a 'passport to paradise' the creation of the European union enshrined in Maastricht. In the familiar language of British pragmatism, Mr Major and Mr Hurd will urge their counterparts to refocus the Community's gaze on the realities facing its citizens: jobs, economic growth and the need for a new world trade agreement. Mr Major has found it difficult to disguise his understandable satisfaction at the roadblocks placed on the road to European union by economic recession and disarray in the European exchange rate mechanism. In Number 10 Downing Street yesterday, senior officials were speaking with open contempt at the notion that Britain's more federally minded partners should seek today to reinstate the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union. The prime minister himself has dismissed the hope of a single currency by the end of the century as one having 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency'. He can claim that the debate in Europe has started to go Britain's way. Of the UK's priorities, enlargement is seen as inevitable, competitiveness treated as a serious issue, and the Gatt trade deal has the support of all member states bar France. But the confident Euro-scepticism that has crept into Mr Major's rhetoric as Germany, France and the other more federalist EC states have scaled down their integrationist aspirations is far from universally shared in Whitehall. Appeasing the anti-Brussels right of the Conservative party will not win the prime minister friends in Europe. Nor will it further his aim of keeping Britain at the centre of the debate over Europe's post-Maastricht future. Mr Hurd has set out the UK's aims in a less triumphalist tone. Acutely aware of the price paid by Britain for isolation during much of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's premiership, the foreign secretary said this week: 'There was a time when we didn't find it easy to have a running, continuous dialogue with our partners. Now it's easier and that's an important gain.' But he was in no doubt that the greater 'realism' displayed by other EC governments after the traumas of Maastricht ratification and the near break-up of the ERM would not curb, in the long-term, their ambitions to make a reality of economic and political union. By tonight Mr Major may well have been forced to concede that the European Monetary Institute, the first step towards economic union, should be set up alongside the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. So the government is aware that its disdain for Emu must be accompanied by a determined effort to give substance to the intergovernmental pillars of co-operation - in foreign and judicial policy - enshrined in Maastricht. If Britain is to press the case for a Europe of nation states, co-operation between governments must be seen to work. Mr Major's problem is that he remains perched uncomfortably between two audiences. The recalcitrant right in the Conservative party demands the impossible: that the government turn back the clock of European integration to a golden age that never was, when Britain decided its own destiny. The UK's partners insist that, if their immediate ambitions have been curbed by the chill wind of economic reality, their federalist dreams have not. Sadly for Mr Major, Europe will not go away.</p>

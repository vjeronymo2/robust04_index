			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] The prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova, Dumitru  Postovan, has taken steps to have Ilie Ilascu, who was elected  deputy to the Parliament of Moldova, released. Immediately  after Ilie Ilascu was elected as a deputy, I officially  intervened with Sergey Leontiev, chief of the Grigoriopol  executive, where the prison is located, Mr. Postovan told the  BASAPRESS agency.    According to the same source, the prosecutor of the Republic  of Moldova specified that, although in his intervention he  mentioned the responsibility for violating Ilascu's status as a  deputy, one cannot count on a serious answer, because only on  the basis of special authority granted by parliament can one  conduct negotiations with the anti-constitutional bodies in  Tiraspol.    BASAPRESS points out that the president of the  self-proclaimed Dniester republic, Igor Smirnov, said a few days  before the 27 February elections that the Tiraspol authorities  will not recognize Ilie Ilascu's parliamentary immunity.    The Central Electoral Commission is working on the last  specifications regarding the final results of the 27 February  elections, a commission spokesman told BASAPRESS today.  According to legal provisions, within 24 hours the final  results will be submitted to the Constitutional Court, which, in  turn, will confirm the legality of the elections within 10 days.    The duties of the Central Electoral Commission will expire  after the validation of deputies' mandates and the setting up of  the new parliament.    Also in connection with the 27 February elections, the  electoral Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity  Movement declared that it has a lot of information regarding  numerous violations of the law during the elections.    According to the (?INFOTAG) news agency, this electoral bloc  submitted a notification to the Supreme Justice Court, which  stresses that all these violations have essentially distorted  the ballot results to the detriment of the Bloc of the Socialist  Party and the Edinstvo Unity Movement.    Notifications to this effect were also submitted to the  Central Electoral Commission, as well as to the justice bodies  in all the districts of Chisinau, the INFOTAG news agency  specifies.    By the middle of the current month, a representative  invested  with the full power of the president of the Russian Federation  is expected to arrive in Chisinau to coordinate the measures of  settling the conflict in the eastern rayons of the Republic of  Moldova, the INFOTAG news agency reports.    According to the same source, the ambassador in charge of  special missions, Vladimir Vasev, will be President Yeltsin's  representative in the Republic of Moldova.    Political observers view Vladimir Vasev's arrival as a  positive reaction to the results of the recent parliamentary  elections in the Republic of Moldova, INFOTAG emphasizes.</p>

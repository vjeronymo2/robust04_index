			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia], President Charles Gankay Taylor, has written a letter  to the chairman of ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], Beninese President  Nicephore Soglo, raising serious concerns over the direction the  Liberian peace process is taking.    In the letter, President Taylor informed the ECOWAS chairman  that the Liberian peace process has lost its momentum, the  outcome of which could be disastrous. He said unless the  elements of government dealing with the Cotonou Accord are put  into play by 22 May this year, the leadership of the NPFL will  be constrained to consider other alternatives. President Taylor  stressed that if the NPFL agreed-upon rights are ignored, it  will have to be considered nonpartisan and (?imagine) itself  otherwise in the peace process.    The commander in chief of the NPFL, President Taylor, has  repeated his call for the immediate establishment of a  Transitional National Army of Liberia. The NPFL leader stressed  the need for the three parties to the Cotonou Accord to begin  providing soldiers for the formation of the transitional army.  The former NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly  Government] president said it is in the national security  interest of this nation to form a national army. He asked, and  we quote him, if this country is totally disarmed, can we leave  the security of this nation solely in the hands of an alien  army? President Taylor said Liberians need to cautiously  reflect on this question and move towards the immediate  establishment of a Transitional National Army.    Presently, the Liberian National Transitional Government has  no army of its own, leaving ECOMOG as the only troops to provide  national security.</p>

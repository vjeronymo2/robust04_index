			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The vast majority of tests of primary specimens have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative results. Of those that test positive, a portion are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified negative by MROs. Of those verified positive by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MROs, not all will result in a timely request by the employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a test of the split specimen. In view of these facts, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be counterproductive for the laboratory to reject an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise testable primary specimen because the split  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specimen was unavailable, inadequate, or untestable. Nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would it be cost-effective for the laboratory to notify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MRO of the problem with the split specimen at an earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stage of the process, which could result in the cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tests that may otherwise stand up. There is no loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection to the employee, who will be in no worse position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than if there was a testable split specimen. As a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter, employers using split sample collection should not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a matter of prudence, take irrevocable action (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminate, as opposed to suspend) against an employee until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the result of the split specimen is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Split specimens may become unavailable for testing at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other stages of the process (e.g., the receiving laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mishandles or loses the split specimen in storage, the split  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specimen is lost in transit between the receiving laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the second laboratory which would analyze the split). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all these cases, the same rule applies. The MRO is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notified of the unavailability, inadequacy, or untestability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the split specimen unless and until there is a verified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive test and the employee has made a timely request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a test of the split specimen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reduction of Marijuana Initial Test Level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its June 9, 1994, revision to its drug testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines, DHHS reduced the initial test level for marijuana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metabolites from 100 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. This rule changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial test level for marijuana in Part 40 to conform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the revised DHHS guidelines. This change is consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the existing language of &sect;40.29(e)(2), which states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial test levels for drugs are subject to change by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DHHS. Since the new DHHS guidelines go into effect September  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1994, this provision will be effective on that date, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that DHHS and DOT testing level requirements remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with one another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Methamphetamine Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is also adding to the chart in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section showing confirmation test levels a new footnote 3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stating that, to be confirmed positive, a specimen containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methamphetamine must also contain amphetamine at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration equal to or greater than 200 ng/ml. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> footnote is also added to be consistent with the revised DHHS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reports to Employers and Consortia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 40.29(g)(6), concerning monthly statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary reports from laboratories to employers, has been the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject of some confusion since it does not specify the role  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of consortia in the reporting chain. Laboratories had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed concern that they were not authorized, by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present language of the paragraph, to provide these reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a consortium instead of to individual employers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is revising this paragraph to clarify this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter. Suppose a laboratory tests specimens originating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with employers 1&hyph;100, all of whom are part of Consortium X.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The laboratory may send its report summary only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consortium X, rather than sending 100 single reports to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the employers. However, the data provided to Consortium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> X must include employer-specific information for each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers and, within 14 days of receiving the laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report, Consortium X is responsible for sending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer-specific data to each of the 100 employers. When,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as provided in the last sentence of &sect;40.29(g)(6),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer-specific data is withheld because no testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent to the employer was held, or because release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the data would permit inferences about individual employees'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identity, the written reports concerning the withholding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the data may also be provided to the employer via the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium, through the mechanism described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> MRO Conflicts of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its revised guidelines, DHHS has added a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision prohibiting relationships between laboratories and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical review officers (MROs) that could have the reality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or create the appearance of a conflict of interest. DHHS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added this provision in the belief, with which DOT concurs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that any such relationship that could be construed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict of interest may be sufficient to undermine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of the program. For this reason and to remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with DHHS guidelines on this important issue, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is adding the DHHS language to &sect;40.29(n).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of Requirement for Second Air Blank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The alcohol testing procedures in Subpart C, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally issued, contained a requirement that the breath  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol technician conduct an ``air blank'' (i.e., an internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check of calibration) both before and after every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmation test. Failure to do so, or a result for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air blank that exceeded 0.00, is a ``fatal flaw'' that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically invalidates a test. We have decided, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further reflection, that the air blank after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmation test is unnecessary. The main point of an air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blank is to ensure that each employee has a testing device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is a ``clean slate,'' unaffected by any alcohol from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous tests or other sources. The pre-test air blank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishes this objective fully; the post-test air blank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not necessary for this purpose. Moreover, on some breath  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing devices, particularly where a test has shown a high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol concentration, it may take several minutes for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol to clear from the device. Under the existing rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the breath alcohol technician were to do a post-test air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blank under these circumstances too soon, it could result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reading above 0.00, invalidating an otherwise valid test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because it is unnecessary, and to avoid problems of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kind, we are deleting the provision requiring a post-test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air blank and the provision making the failure to conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  such a test a ``fatal flaw.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Display of Sequential Test Numbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 40.53(b)(2) requires that EBTs used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmation tests be capable of assigning a unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sequential number to each test, which can be read by the BAT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the employee before the test and printed out on each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copy of the test result. Section 40.79(a)(7) makes it a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``fatal flaw'' if the sequential number displayed on the EBT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the test is not the same as the sequential number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> printed on the test result. However, the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation leaves a gap between these two points, since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for conducting alcohol tests (&sect;&sect;40.63 and 40.65)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not specify the handling of sequential numbers in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is adding language to fill this gap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 40.65(e) is being revised to require the BAT to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the BAT and the employee read the displayed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sequential number before the confirmation test, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;40.65(h)(3) is revised to direct the BAT to enter in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Remarks'' section of the form any disparity between that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number and the sequential test number on the printed result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such a disparity, per &sect;40.79, is a fatal flaw. We have made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parallel changes to &sect;40.63 (d)(1) and (e)(2), which apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations in which a screening test is conducted with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EBT that has the features specified in &sect;40.53(b) for EBTs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can be used for confirmation tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Record Retention Requirement for BAT Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES;  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO JUGGLES LINEUP AND BECOMES A PLAYOFF CONTENDER  </P> <P> Because of injuries and personnel adjustments, high school football teams  usually are in a state of constant change.  </P> <P> Nowhere is that more evident this season than at El Segundo.  </P> <P> Since the opening game, when starting tailback Don Smith was lost for the year  with a broken leg, the Eagles have been forced to adjust their lineup.  </P> <P> Initially it was a problem. But, judging by the team's success in recent weeks,  Coach Steve Newell and his staff deserve credit for pushing the right buttons.  </P> <P> After starting dismally with four straight losses, El Segundo has won its last  three games to occupy second place in the eight-team Santa Fe League with a 3-1  record, one game behind St.Monica.  </P> <P> "We definitely have turned things around," Newell said. "We got off to a slow  start. We had some young kids on the team that we needed to bring around, and I  think we had problems as a coaching staff zeroing in on priorities. Once we  started making those adjustments, we started winning."  </P> <P> El Segundo's most effective adjustments have come on defense. The Eagles gave  up 129 points in their first four games but have held opponents to 27 in their  last three outings.  </P> <P> Newell credits four players, in particular, with helping turn things around on  defense: sophomore twins Eric and Eran Taulua, junior Tom Frechette and senior  Ken Talanoa.  </P> <P> Three have switched positions since the start of the season. Eric Taulua  (6-foot, 240 pounds) was moved from tackle to outside linebacker, Frechette  (6-4, 240) was moved from tackle to defensive end and Talanoa (6-4, 225) was  moved from inside linebacker to defensive end. Eran Taulua (6-0, 215), who did  not play until the third game because of an off-season hip injury, starts at  outside linebacker opposite his brother.  </P> <P> "We thought going into the season we had strong enough kids on the outside to  do the job," Newell said. "But we found out we were weak there, and it forced  us to make the changes. I always figure you have to protect yourself on the  outside first."  </P> <P> The Tauluas, who were not listed as starters before the season, have emerged as  stars. They were a two-man gang in last week's 21-20 victory over Cathedral.  Eric rushed for 43 yards and one touchdown, made eight tackles, intercepted two  passes and recovered two fumbles, while Eran rushed for 62 yards and one  touchdown and had five tackles and a sack.  </P> <P> "They are real good now," Newell said. "I can't imagine how good they are going  to be over the next two years."  </P> <P> The twins' play at running back has helped compensate for the loss of starting  tailback Garret Quaintance. The team's leading rusher suffered an injured foot  in a 17-7 win over Mary Star two weeks ago and is not expected back in the  lineup until Nov. 3 against Cantwell.  </P> <P> El Segundo, which lost its league opener to St. Monica, 39-30, on Sept. 29 with  the Tauluas and Talanoa on the bench because of disciplinary reasons, resumes  league play at 1:45 p.m. Saturday at Pater Noster (3-4, 1-3).  </P> <P> "If this team stays on track, it has the opportunity to get to the playoffs,"  Newell said. "From there, maybe we can surprise some people."  </P> <P> Not all of El Segundo's adjustments have been easy for Newell.  </P> <P> After a 44-7 loss to Garey in the third game, he switched quarterbacks by  replacing his son, Brett, in favor of Tom Cover. Brett is now a starting wide  receiver.  </P> <P> Needless to say, the move created an awkward situation in the Newell home.  </P> <P> "It definitely was a tough decision," Coach Newell said. "I would say there  were some hard feelings."  </P> <P> Gardena football Coach Mike Sakurai, whose team has lost to Carson and Serra,  was asked who he would favor in a meeting between The Times' top-ranked South  Bay teams.  </P> <P> Carson routed the Mohicans, 40-6, and Serra beat them, 36-13.  </P> <P> "I think it would be a good game," Sakurai said. "Speed-wise, Serra is right up  there. But Carson is probably a little better overall. The physical game that  Carson plays would probably present a problem for Serra."  </P> <P> The debate can't be settled on the field this year because the teams play in  different sections. But a future non-league meeting is a possibility.  </P> <P> Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, whose team was idle the third week of the season  because it could not fill its non-league schedule, might have better luck  arranging a game with Serra. After all, the Cavaliers' first-year coach, Leo  Hand, is accustomed to playing highly rated teams from his four years as  Servite's head coach.  </P> <P> It's do-or-die time for Bishop Montgomery.  </P> <P> The Knights entered Angelus League play two weeks ago with high hopes of  qualifying for the football playoffs for the first time from the league. But  after losses to Bishop Amat and Servite, they find themselves 0-2 and in a  must-win situation against visiting Mater Dei (1-1) on Friday night.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll said he was "very disappointed" by his  team's performance Saturday in a 35-13 loss to Servite.  </P> <P> "I thought Servite was a team we could beat, but we came out and played real  flat," he said. "To play football in the Angelus League, you have to be ready  every week."  </P> <P> Carroll said the Knights have several personnel changes, mostly on the  offensive line, planned for Friday's game.  </P> <P> PREP NOTES -- Unbeaten Mira Costa retained its No. 1 ranking in the State  CIF/Coaches girls volleyball poll.

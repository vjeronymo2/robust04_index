			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE LOOKS OK IN 22-POINT LOSS TO UNLV  </P> <P> Maybe there is hope for these UC Irvine Anteaters after all. Maybe not this  season, but in those to come.  </P> <P> Although Irvine lost to Nevada Las Vegas, 99-77, Thursday night in the Bren  Center, the Anteaters had their moments.  </P> <P> There was Jeff Von Lutzow gliding down the lane for a right-handed dunk over  Larry Johnson in the first half.  </P> <P> There was Von Lutzow again, swatting Johnson's five-foot jumper into the front  row a moment later.  </P> <P> Johnson, a 6-foot-7 junior, is considered to be one of the finest big men in  the country.  </P> <P> And there was Dylan Rigdon driving fearlessly around Stacey Augmon, leaning in  for a short jumper while drawing a foul.  </P> <P> Augmon, the Big West Conference's player of the year last season, is widely  considered the nation's best defender and was a 1988 Olympian, largely because  of his defensive skills.  </P> <P> Von Lutzow and Rigdon are freshmen. Von Lutzow had a team-high 22 points and  five rebounds. Rigdon had 19 points and eight assists.  </P> <P> And Ricky Butler had 20 points, making all eight of his shots from the field.  </P> <P> On another night against another team, it might have added up to a victory.  </P> <P> But this was UNLV, one of the best teams in the country.  </P> <P> Anderson Hunt led a late UNLV surge with 25 points, including three  three-pointers in the final 5:36. Johnson added 23, making 10 of 13 from the  field, and had 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> The fourth-ranked Rebels are 23-4 overall, 14-1 in the Big West.  </P> <P> Irvine, which set a school record for losses in a season, is 3-21, 1-14.  </P></p>

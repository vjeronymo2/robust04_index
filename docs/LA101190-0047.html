			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LIFE' AN AFFECTING TALE ABOUT WAR'S AFTERMATH;  </P> <P> FILM: FROM TAVERNIER, AN ANTI-WAR STORY THAT CELEBRATES LIFE AND LOVE.  </P> <P> Bertrand Tavernier's "Life and Nothing But" (Music Hall) is a cause for  rejoicing. More than just a beautiful or affecting film, more than one with  great performances and a significant subject -- all of which it is and has --  it's a movie with breadth of vision and strength of spirit.  </P> <P> This is an anti-war film that doesn't show a moment of battle or drop of blood.  It's a dirge for the dead that somehow turns into a celebration of life, a  social drama that constantly erupts into moments of macabre comedy, a love  story with barely a moment of on-screen lovemaking, hardly even a kiss. In many  ways, it's an anachronism: a deeply, almost defiantly old-fashioned movie,  which helps reveal our own world through a passionate embrace of one long past.  </P> <P> The story is intimate, but the canvas is epic. The action, spread over several  days in the lives of three people, widens to a speaking cast of more than 60.  The backdrop -- France's Verdun and Grezancourt immediately following World War  I -- is so vast that the characters are constantly swallowed up in broad  vistas, sweeps of countryside, hills and huge echoing factories, while  remaining clear, distinct personalities. It's a prodigious ensemble recreation.  Tavernier, like all first-rate film artists, makes the difficult look  effortless.  </P> <P> The movie gives us a microcosm: the passionate encounter between an insouciant  society woman and a rough old soldier. And a macrocosm: the turmoil and  confusion of France after a war that claimed 350,000 French lives. If that war  is over, it's far from forgotten. Thousands of dead or missing remain  unaccounted for and the movie's protagonist, Major Dellaplane (Philippe  Noiret), is in charge of identifying the corpses.  </P> <P> It's an almost maddening task. Scavengers trail the bereaved. The personal  effects of the dead are red-tagged and hawked on tables. Villages try to switch  their boundary lines so they can claim more casualties. Mediocre sculptors do  land-office business in monuments and commemorative statues.  </P> <P> The corpses are often unidentifiable; even their nationality, French or German,  occasionally indeterminate. To make matters worse, live mines still  periodically explode and kill. And the French High Command, to Dellaplane's  disgust, have demanded that, within days, he come up with an Unknown Soldier,  to be interred with full pomp at the Arc de Triomphe.  </P> <P> It was the search for WWI's Unknown Soldier that first inspired Tavernier and  Jean Cosmos' screenplay; there really was a Major Dellaplane. Here, the  imagined chaos around Noiret -- who sometimes gives the impression of being the  only officer around who's actually seen battle -- is appallingly funny,  appallingly sad, and, sometimes, just plain appalling.  </P> <P> Tavernier's viewpoint is resolutely unsentimental. Yet it's not empty of  feeling. In the midst of this madness, Dellaplane meets two women, both seeking  a missing husband or fiancee, both united by an improbable coincidence: a  Parisian industrialist's daughter-in-law, Irene (Sabine Azema), and a country  schoolteacher named Alice (Pascale Vignal). The bitter backdrop accentuates the  love story between Dellaplane and Irene: a curious, whiplash romance, whose  cadences and currents resemble those of movie romantic comedy.  </P> <P> Some will find this romance too derivative; they'll be more correct than  they'll know. Tavernier has said that Dellaplane is based partially on John  Wayne in John Ford's cavalry films and Irene on Katharine Hepburn in her  screwball comedies for Hawks and Cukor. Yet, this influence doesn't diminish  "Life"; only a hopeless snob would complain. Noiret and Azema, two brilliant  actors, deliver performances of terrific emotion, wit and intensity.  </P> <P> Noiret's priceless hangdog look, his mix of melancholy and affectionate  irascibility -- the qualities for which audiences loved him as the bearlike  projectionist of "Cinema Paradiso" -- here seem charged with heroic dignity,  weary calm. Opposite him, Azema has lithe reactions, incandescent flirtiness;  she's a firebird veiled in frost. When they argue with each other, it's  electric. When they connect, there's a melting poignancy.  </P> <P> In Tavernier's last film, "Beatrice," he showed a medieval world bounded by  brute passion and elemental force. Here, his portrayal of the social chaos of  war's aftermath is devastating. Throughout the early sections, he reinforces  the overview by keeping almost constantly in long-shot -- by dwarfing the  characters and letting cinematographer Bruno de Keyzer bathe everything in a  cold, bluish light.  </P> <P> The sometimes harsh, sliding, camera movements, the near-surreal images of nuns  on horseback on a bleak strip of beach, the overhead shots of the rat's maze in  which Dellaplane works: all these reinforce the sense of a world and time out  of joint. Yet the universe of "Life," for all its jitteriness and breadth,  becomes a coherent one and finally, lovely and heartening as well.  </P> <P> 'LIFE AND NOTHING BUT'  </P> <P> An Orion Classics release.

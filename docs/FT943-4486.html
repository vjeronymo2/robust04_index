			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Promodes advances to FFr264m The recovery in French retailing was highlighted yesterday when Promodes, one of the country's leading distribution groups, said net profits rose 15 per cent in the first half of 1994. Promodes, which has large interests in Spain as well as in France, saw net profits rise to FFr264m (Dollars 47.1m) in the first half of the year from FFr229m during the same period of 1993. The group achieved a 3 per cent increase in sales to FFr44.2bn from FFr42.8bn between the two first halves. The French retail sector is emerging from a difficult period in which consumer spending was depressed by the recession. However, the economic climate is improving, consumer confidence is slowly starting to rise and the pressure on the retailers is easing. Promodes said its first-half performance would have been better without the devaluation of the Spanish peseta. It estimated that, on a constant exchange rate basis, its sales would have risen by 5.9 per cent during the first six months of the year. Promodes operating profits rose 11 per cent in the interim period to FFr814m from FFr733m. The company said that it had benefited from improved financial controls and a reduction in exceptional items. M6, the French television station, yesterday confirmed that it plans to go public with a stock market flotation on September 28. The company, now the third force in French television with annualised sales of FFr1.5bn, also intends to launch a new themed TV channel, according to Mr Jean Durkcer, chairman.</p>

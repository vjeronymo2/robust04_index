			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Iron enters his soul: The odds on John Major's survival have shifted this week from a whisker against to a whisker in favour Mr John Major's address to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool yesterday was the most effective he has delivered to such a large audience since he became prime minister. He appeared relaxed, in control. His jokes worked, or at any rate some of them did. He asserted an air of authority. He maintained his dignity. He allowed himself the expression of some passion, and professed strongly held convictions. He came across less as the stilted puppet embarrassing us all with talk of motorway rest rooms, which he did in October 1992, and more as what he is in reality: an ordinary yet ambitious man doing his best in extraordinary circumstances. The content was another matter. Mr Major pandered to the longing of his audience, particularly the elderly among them, for a return to a golden age there probably never was: one in which rows of obedient schoolchildren sat at their desks and did simple pencil and paper tests, the streets were free of crime, miscreants were severely punished, the church was respected, grandparents were held in high regard, and pornography was unheard of. The ancient enemies - trade unionism and socialism - having faded, replacement enemies have been disinterred. Many a conference speech this week centred on the trendy liberals of the permissive 1960s. Mr Major gave the untrendy conservatives of the 1990s what they say they want. This might strike a chord with voters who feel disoriented by the atomisation of society. It is a huge irony. The contribution of Tory policy to that atomisation, to the widespread alienation of individuals from their communities, was not touched upon. The 1980s were somehow missed out. Yet the question asks itself: if crime is rampant, the budget deficit is out of control, illiterates are being produced by our schools, and revered institutions (such as the monarchy) are challenged, then who has been in charge while all this has been happening? The prime minister did not go into that. The essence of his 'back to basics' theme was expressed by the education secretary, Mr John Patten, on Wednesday. Parents must provide a caring and disciplined home environment, said Mr Patten. 'And we should not be afraid to say so - even if we are accused of wanting to turn the clock back. As Conservatives, we should be proud of wanting to do just that . . .' Mr Major clearly longs to turn the clock back - to an age in which prime ministers were not vilified. He may have moved nearer to that objective yesterday. Last year he repeated the words 'Britain' and 'British' in a disastrous speech that did nothing to enhance his stature. This time he used the Union Jack as a stage backdrop to his nationalism. Propped up by the flag, he told the French to get their tractors off our lawn. He spoke with precision. His thoughts were well-ordered. There may be more to him than has so far met the eye. He is plainly capable of learning from his mistakes. The broad strategy for the resuscitation of his prime ministership is now clear. Every effort will be made to restore the public's confidence in the Tories as the party of sound money, the nation state, law and order, and a rigorous education. The Conservatives will be unashamed promoters of business, big and small. As to Europe, the prime minister will stand on his soapbox and campaign against federalism, just as in last year's election he campaigned successfully against proportional representation and a Scottish regional assembly. These were enemies of the British polity, to be voted down. When he is whistling Rule Britannia, the picture of the Union Jack behind him almost flutters. Mr Major's performance may serve to silence some of his detractors. It is not obvious that it was enough to save his job. Before he spoke, you had to search for a long time in Blackpool to track down one of the rarest specimens in contemporary British politics: the Conservative who has complete confidence in his party's leader. It was especially difficult to find any minister whose private view was that the party was well-led. It did not matter whether the question was 'do you think he should resign?' or 'would it make a difference if the government was led by someone else?' or 'will he be forced out?'. Nor did it matter whether the answer to all or any of these questions was 'no'. The message was conveyed in other ways, by a hesitance before replying, by a discursive response, by body language, by a shiftiness of the eyes. There are a few exceptions - Mrs Virginia Bottomley is one - but in the opinion of many of his close colleagues, the prime minister has used up all but one or two of his nine lives. 'He should deploy the powers of his position,' said one member of the cabinet. 'He must learn to convey a sense of direction,' said another. 'He lacks ideology,' complained a third. Yesterday he attempted, with some success, to show that he is capable of meeting all three of those tests. He was less the glad-handing Midwestern politician, more the occupant of Number 10 Downing Street. 'Who would have thought it?' he mused in November 1990, on finding himself prime minister. Latterly he has taken to receiving visitors alone in the cabinet room, seated centre-table. Some of the aura of office has at last begun to enter his soul. The government's survival tactics for the next few months will be dictated by the parliamentary arithmetic as calculated by Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip. To take a celebrated example, the final shape of rail privatisation will be determined by the best package that can be negotiated with a handful of potential backbench dissenters. Again, the biggest parliamentary hurdle ahead is the Budget and spending package due at the end of next month. Mr Kenneth Clarke will not be easily intimidated by the prospect of backbench revolts. In happier times the chancellor would have had no need to be. Perhaps he has none now. Even the most egotistical and self-opiniated Tory rebel may be expected to pause before voting down her or his own government's finance bill, whatever it contains. Yesterday's appeal for unity by Mr Major may reduce the number of renegades. There could, however, be defeats on details during the committee stages. Mr Clarke has sensitive political antennae. He will know without being told what would be too provocative to be assured of a safe parliamentary passage. The imposition of an 8 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel from next April and more than twice that from April 1995 is already legislated for, although Labour may seek a procedural means of reopening the question. Doubling up and taking the whole 17 1/2 per cent hit in 1994, which is one of Mr Clarke's options, would do the job for the opposition. Assuming that November passes safely by, the next determinant of Mr Major's fate will be the judgment of the electorate in by-elections, May's local elections and the elections to the European parliament in June. If these are not the total routs suggested by the current state of voter discontent with the government, the prime minister may regard the battle for the restoration of his authority as half-won. In such circumstances he would doubtless reshuffle his cabinet in July. That would be an opportunity to promote some young bright stars, such as Mr Stephen Dorrell, and to spring a surprise, such as appointing Lord Archer chairman of the Conservative party. The latter is not the darling of the chattering classes, but he could be a skilful street-fighter. He has been weight-training for the job for at least seven years. His speech on Wednesday was electrifying; it was noted, with a wry comment, by Mr Major yesterday. Lord Archer would bring a Hailsham bell-ringing approach to the next general election. The existing chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, could be moved to education. He knows how to run a department. Mr Patten, the present incumbent, has yet to learn to do so. What is going on? Here I am talking about budgets, long-range election planning, cabinet reshuffles in midsummer next year, all as if Mr Major and his government have a comfortable period of office ahead of them. Is this not the clutch of half-competents that has been enduring the derision of the country for the past year? Is this not the prime minister of whom the first question on everyone's lips is: 'How much longer has he got?' It is them, the very same. One more mishap, one further pratfall, and they, plus their leader, will yet again be clinging to office by their fingertips. But the season of political conferences has changed the script. It has shown that the Labour party is not easily reformed. The fragility of the Liberal Democrats' resurgence is now well understood, although, if the vehemence of the attacks on the Lib Dems this week is anything to go by, Mr Paddy Ashdown and his crew are greatly feared. Fear can be productive. This week we have seen how Tory minds can be concentrated by the spectre of opposition. The unity demonstrated at the conference is a facade, but so is the unity of all large political parties. The public face is what the public sees. The appearance of determination, or grip, in Mr Major yesterday is something new, but it may develop into something substantial. The Tories' hard line on crime, social security, housing for unmarried mothers, education and Europe may be regarded as a capture of the party by the right, but that is probably in tune with the instincts of most core Conservative voters. When the economic recovery gets under way, the government will become less unpopular. Mr Major may trumpet, as he did yesterday, the prospect of sustained non-inflationary growth. The odds on his survival, always finely balanced, have shifted from a whisker against to a whisker in his favour.</p>

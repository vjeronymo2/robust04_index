			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / De Larosiere spells out risk to franc speculators SPECULATORS against the franc should remember that France still has a collective competitive edge over its partners in the European monetary system, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the Bank of France governor, warned yesterday. The devaluations and floating of several currencies within the EMS in the past year 'have far from wiped out the gains made by France since 1986', he said. Since 1986 French unit wage costs had risen 11 per cent more slowly, and producer prices had increased 6 per cent less, than the average for other EMS countries, he claimed. The proof was that France's FFr16.2bn (Pounds 1.84bn) trade surplus in the first quarter of this year was triple that in the same period of 1992. 'The speculative attacks of recent days (against the franc) on the foreign exchange markets bear no relation to the evolution of our (economic) fundamentals,' he told the national credit council, a consultative body to the central bank. One positive economic indicator emerged yesterday with the release of official Insee statistics showing that industrial production rose in May by 0.2 per cent compared with April. The modest increase, which ended a three-month downward trend was welcomed by the Finance Ministry, which forecast that the economy would move out of recession in the second half of the year. 'Industrial activity has now stabilised. This result is encouraging,' the ministry said. But private economists said the slight rise in industrial production did not necessarily signal that the economy had turned the corner. They said that May's figures still represented a 3.4 per cent decline on the same period last year and that reduced exports and weak consumer spending remained an obstacle to recovery. According to Insee, output by manufacturing industry increased by 0.3 per cent in May. This included an increase of 1 per cent in output from the motor sector, reflecting the launch of new models by Peugot, Renault and Citroen, the French carmakers.</p>

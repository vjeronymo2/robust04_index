			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Companies fight VAT decision A CONSORTIUM of British businesses plans an intensive campaign against Customs and Excise's decision late last year to restrict the value added tax that holding companies can claim back. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, proposes to orchestrate a Pounds 250,000 campaign involving lobbying and opposition in the courts. Ms Penny Hamilton, a partner in Coopers' VAT unit, said: 'This is a legally unsound policy which is uncertain in application. We are not going to give up to it without a fight.' Representatives of nearly 100 clients which are likely to lose tax rebates because of the decision, which comes into force in March, yesterday attended a campaign launch in London. Coopers intends to identify one of the consortium members, press Customs into making an assessment under the new arrangements and then take an appeal as far as the European Court of Justice, with financial backing from the other members. Customs issued a press release in October declaring that holding companies that own operating subsidiaries within a group would no longer be entitled to recover VAT incurred - mainly on professionals' fees - during their 'basic business activities'. Acquiring and disposing of shares, mounting or defending against takeovers and managing the affairs of subsidiaries would all be excluded from VAT recoveries under the tougher approach. The move by Customs followed interpretation by officials of the wider applications of a ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning a pure holding company called Polysar. Customs claimed the court's ruling determined that the mere purchase and holding of shares was not an economic or business activity and its role was therefore no different from that of a private shareholder. Opponents complain that Customs' new guidelines are unclear, inconsistent, highly costly and were announced only through press releases without any debate. A Coopers' proposal document circulated yesterday says the firm will lobby industry groups, ministers, government officials in London and Brussels and the press as part of the campaign.</p>

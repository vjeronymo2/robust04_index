			<p>BFN     [Text] Brothers Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur  Hadi, the defense minister; and Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Malik  al- Sayyani, the chief of staff, have sent a cable to Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council. Following is the text:    Brother struggler Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of  the Presidential Council and commander in chief of the Armed  Forces; brother members of the Presidential Council:    In the name of your brothers and sons -- the valiant  fighters, the protectors of the revolution, unity, and  democracy, who are holding out at all the positions of honor and  sacrifice across the unified Yemeni state -- we take pleasure in  extending heartfelt congratulations on the advent of the blessed  'Id al-Adha and on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the  Yemeni merger, whereby our people rehabilitated Yemen's history  and which embodies their ambitions for a dignified, decent, and  free life.    Our country is going through delicate circumstances as a  result of secessionists and apostates in the Socialist Party  leadership sparking off war against our people and the valiant  members of the Armed Forces. Members of the Armed Forces are  thus having to cope with the manifold task of protecting unity  and democracy and consolidating constitutional legality and  deterring the forces of secession and rebellion that want the  homeland to lapse into the pre-22 May 1990 era and to wreck the  unity for which our people have striven for so long and which  they have come to regard as the noblest and dearest national  objective for which worthy martyrs have fallen.    Your sons and brothers have, over the past two weeks, fought  the battle of honor and dignity in defense of unity and  democracy against the remnants of the gang of apostasy and the  forces of injustice and aggression that have consistently  plotted against our people's accomplishments to advance personal  ends that, thanks be to God, have come to nothing.    The defenders of the sanctity and every inch of Yemeni  territory reiterate their genuine loyalty under the fluttering  banner of the eternal Republic of Yemen. They renew the pledge  to your dedicated political leadership and to their people that  they will ever be up to their heavy national responsibilities.  They will be prepared to sacrifice their souls for Yemen, for  its pride, stability, and prosperity so that it can take its  rightful place in the community of nations. We reiterate that  the Armed Forces in these decisive moments are better prepared  than ever to protect the country's sovereignty and the gains for  the immortal Yemeni revolution, most of all unity, democracy,  and constitutional legality. We give our word to God and the  people to safeguard these accomplishments against the meddling  of hatemongers to the last drop of our blood.    Once more, please accept our heartfelt congratulations. We  wish you every success in spearheading the developmental and  democratic drive. Many happy returns of the 'Id.</p>

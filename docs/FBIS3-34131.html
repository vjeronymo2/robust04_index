The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that these reports are  absolutely baseless and unfounded. The source added that he had  no information about reports that Jordanian security forces had  arrested a Palestinian group armed with shoulder-mounted rockets  prepared for launching in the direction of 'Arafat's aircraft as  it landed in Amman civilian airport.    For their part, Jordanian security sources have declined to  comment on the report, which was published by a local newspaper.</p>

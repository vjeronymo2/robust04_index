			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Letter: Telecoms in need of a different structure Sir, Your leader 'Time to review the regulators' (June 10) was right for telecoms in many respects, although it missed one point. The regime and the work of Oftel undoubtedly need review. Sir Bryan Carsberg is much respected in the industry. But could it really be correct for him as the new director-general of fair trading to review his past actions as director general of telecommunications? Oftel's accountability to parliament certainly needs strengthening. The House of Lords does not at present have a role in these matters. It has a unique collection of public figures with experience between them both of running and of overseeing the big utilities. They could play a valuable part in improved machinery of oversight. But this will not be enough. Telecoms has a special problem. Unlike that of electricity, BT's structure was left unaltered at privatisation. It is so big that it overshadows its competition; and as a private sector near-monopoly it presents government with even greater difficulties of oversight than its public sector predecessor. This is the heart of the matter. Last July you advocated change in structure for telecoms. You were right. J M Harper, 11 Lullington Close, Seaford, East Sussex BN25 4JH</p>

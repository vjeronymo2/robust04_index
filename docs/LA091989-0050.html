			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> ARGENTINES TO BE PARDONED  </P> <P> Eighteen retired Argentine generals and admirals facing trial on charges they  committed hundreds of human rights abuses in the 1970s will be pardoned,  President Carlos Saul Menem announced. The cases of six other people, including  two former presidents already convicted and sentenced, will be reviewed later,  Menem said. The statement was the first firm indication of those to be included  in the controversial pardon, expected to be formally announced in late  September. A government commission named by Menem's predecessor, former  President Raul Alfonsin, determined that at least 9,000 Argentines disappeared  during an anti-subversion campaign in the late '70s and early '80s.  </P></p>

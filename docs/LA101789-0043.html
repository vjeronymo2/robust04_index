			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISSIDENT POSES A POLICY DILEMMA;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: WHAT TO DO WITH FANG LIZHI? CHINA'S BEST-KNOWN ADVOCATE OF DEMOCRACY  REMAINS HOLED UP IN THE U.S. EMBASSY WHILE WASHINGTON AND BEIJING DEBATE HIS  FATE.  </P> <P> Four months after he fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, Fang Lizhi, China's  most prominent dissident, remains sequestered inside the compound, and U.S.  officials concede that they are stymied in efforts to persuade the Chinese  regime to let him go free.  </P> <P> The U.S. decision to grant refuge to Fang has become a continuing but largely  invisible source of contention between the Bush Administration and the Chinese  government, which has branded Fang a "traitorous bandit" and accused him of  "counterrevolutionary crimes."  </P> <P> So sensitive is the continuing stalemate that the Administration acknowledges  it is trying to say as little as possible in public about Fang's case,  apparently in the hope of letting passions subside.  </P> <P> "I can't say boo about it," a senior Administration official said recently when  asked about Fang. The Fang case has become so touchy at the State Department  that "around here, we call it the F-word," another official said.  </P> <P> Much more is at stake than Fang's personal freedom. The fledgling democracy  movement of Chinese exiles and students in France and the United States has no  single recognized leader, and Fang could well emerge as a powerful symbol and  unifying force. Some U.S. analysts believe the Chinese are reluctant to work  out a deal that could enable Fang to be politically active in the West.  </P> <P> "They are not entertaining what appear to be obvious solutions," a U.S.  official said, referring to proposals that Fang be transferred from the U.S.  Embassy to some unspecified neutral country. "We're at an impasse."  </P> <P> Fang is an astrophysicist sometimes known as "the Chinese Sakharov," after the  Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov. In recent years, he has become the  best-known and most outspoken proponent of a more democratic political system  in China.  </P> <P> Last winter, when President Bush was in Beijing, Chinese security agents  physically barred Fang from attending a banquet to which Bush had invited him.  </P> <P> In June, three days after the Chinese People's Liberation Army seized Tian An  Men Square from pro-democracy demonstrators, Fang and his wife, fearing arrest,  took refuge in the U.S. Embassy. They have been there ever since.  </P> <P> U.S. officials insist that Fang is not restless, that he is hard at work doing  research in astrophysics. U.S. officials are said to be providing him with the  books that he needs.  </P> <P> Some Fang supporters have questioned the Administration's resolve.  </P> <P> Princeton University scholar Perry Link, who befriended Fang while he was  living in Beijing last year and took part in the talks leading to Fang's  seeking refuge in the embassy, said recently that the Administration is not  doing as much as it could to obtain Fang's release.  </P> <P> "He is stuck there for a while, probably until (Chinese senior leader) Deng  Xiaoping dies, or at least until the State Department bargains him loose, which  I wish they were trying harder to do," Link said in a speech at the Woodrow  Wilson Center in Washington.  </P> <P> State Department officials reacted testily to Link's assertion.  </P> <P> "Perry Link should mind his own business," one official said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that although they would like to expedite Fang's release,  they don't want to push too hard or seem too eager because doing so might  strengthen the Chinese negotiating position.  </P> <P> "They probably feel it is a monkey on our back, that there's more pressure on  us to resolve this," one source said. "That's not true. . . . As long as he's  there, he'll be an obstacle to improvement in our relations -- and a big one."  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials reject the argument that the Chinese leadership  benefits from Fang's confinement.  </P> <P> "While he's in there, he's a kind of martyr, a symbol of the pro-democracy  movement," one official said. "The Chinese could remove that symbol by doing  right by Fang."  </P> <P> Last August, Yuan Mu, spokesman for the Chinese State Council, told Japanese  reporters that although the Chinese government will not forcibly seize Fang  from the embassy, it will not allow him to be moved to a neutral country.  </P> <P> Some U.S. officials have suggested another solution -- that the United States  set Fang loose on Chinese soil if the regime will guarantee that he will not be  prosecuted.  </P> <P> But it seems unlikely that China will accept such a deal any time soon. Chinese  authorities last June issued a warrant for Fang's arrest, and he has been  officially charged.  </P> <P> "It may be impossible to settle this, given the current leadership struggle in  China," one U.S. analyst said. "Any Chinese leader who suggested doing so would  be sticking his neck out."  </P> <P> Bush's reticence to talk about Fang contrasts with his often-repeated public  support for Sakharov in the early 1980s, when the Soviet dissident was confined  to Gorky and his wife, Yelena Bonner, was under house arrest.  </P> <P> In 1984, when Bonner was refused permission to travel to the West, then-Vice  President George Bush told a NATO meeting: "It is hard for us to comprehend,  let alone condone, a system where internal and external travel and  communication are subject to such arbitrary state prohibition."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We are going to build socialism following the  European model with the equality of rights for various forms of  ownership -- this according to entrepreneur Yayhen Shcherbanin,  a winner in the recent Supreme Council elections, at the news  conference in Donetsk.    At the same time, the establishment of a centrist faction in  the republican legislature was announced. This faction was  established by the Donbass-based fund for the promotion of  progressive reforms, which includes managers of large industrial  factories and companies. All of them represent the authorities.  [Words indistinct] will become deputies of the new Supreme  Council who share goals and tasks of the fund's program. It is  also taken into consideration that deputies from other oblasts  of Ukraine will join this faction. According to members of this  faction, the holding of early presidential elections is  inadvisable. They believe that Leonid Kravchuk's powers should  be prolonged until a new Ukrainian constitution is adopted. The  immediate goal of the faction is to foster the establishment [as  heard] of Soviets on all levels.</p>

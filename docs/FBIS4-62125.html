			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko under the "Belorussia" rubric: </F> "Aleksandr Lukashenko Has Lost Slavic Sobor Support. This May  Enable Kebich To Get Rid of Main Rival in the Race for  Presidency"]    [Text] The "Belaya Rus" Slavic Assembly was the first and  the biggest political organization to have spoken up in support  of the candidacy of Aleksandr Lukashenko in the race for the  presidency and to have actively joined the campaign to collect  signatures for his nomination. It is this pan-Slavic  organization that formed the backbone of Mr. Lukashenko's  initiative group. Its supporters lead the election campaign in  the provinces -- they were heads of a number of rayon groups  that collected signatures.    It became known late on 10 May that some 100 Slavic Assembly  activists suddenly declined to support Mr. Lukashenko further  and that they would stop collecting signatures for his  nomination. The move is being motivated by Aleksandr  Lukashenko's alleged retreat from his earlier declared  principles of joining Russia in a confederative state and his  taking the liberty of voicing critical remarks about the  recently signed Russia-Belorussia [Belarus] treaty merging their  monetary systems. Besides, Lukashenko brought into his ranks  people who, in the opinion of the Slavic Assembly's leaders, far  from help the candidate's election program to be ideologically  consistent. In particular, helping to put together its economic  part is Valeriy Tsepkalo, former economic adviser to ex-speaker  Stanislaw Shushkevich.    The sudden split in the camp of Mr. Lukashevich's supporters  may have an appreciable influence on the outcome of the campaign  to nominate candidates for the presidency. Aleksandr Lukashenko  has lost a sixth of his initiative group, and chances are that  he may be short precisely this number of votes to be registered  as a candidate. The collection of signatures ends 15 May,  several days from now.    Many observers believe that the sudden difficulties plaguing  Mr. Lukashenko did not arise without some help from the team of  Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich. Aleksandr Lukashenko's rating,  according to recent sociological polls, was much higher than the  prime minister's. Getting rid of a rival before taking the issue  to the polls would be in this situation the more effective and  logical move on the part of Mr. Kebich.</p>

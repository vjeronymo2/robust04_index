			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Kiev] </F>   [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said on  8 June that if the United States agrees to resume the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks, North Korea will allow the  International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon. In a news conference after winding up  his Ukraine visit, Kim Yong-nam said that if the DPRK-U.S. talks  are resumed, North Korea will guarantee the inspection of the  nuclear facilities, including the test, measurement, and  preservation of the fuel rods.    Kim Yong-nam also said that the United States is rejecting  the resumption of the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks by  carrying out stalling tactics. He added that since the United  States and North Korea are the parties directly involved in this  matter, the only way to resolve this matter is through the  United States and North. He pointed out that the nuclear issue  was caused by the United States and that the threat against the  DPRK stems from the United States.</p>

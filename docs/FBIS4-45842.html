			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, may 6 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese National  Center for Control of Venereal Diseases and Leprosy was  inaugurated here today.    Located at the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology  under  the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the center will be  responsible for technically guiding the study and appraising the  research results of sexual diseases and leprosy, providing  scientific data for the Ministry of Public Health to draw up  policies for controlling the diseases, undertaking education and  technical training of personnel in the field, monitoring the  situation of epidemic diseases throughout the country,  collecting international information about sexual diseases and  leprosy, and conducting international academic exchanges in this  field.    After several years of effort, sexual diseases had been  basically wiped out in New China by the late 1950s and early  1960s. Meanwhile, the incidence of leprosy had been greatly  reduced. Statistics show that so far a total of 360,000 victims  of leprosy have been cured. At present, there are about 10,000  leprous patients in the country.    However, the incidence of sexual disease in the country has  risen again since the 1980s. In order to more effectively bring  the diseases under control and to reach the goal of wiping out  leprosy in China by the year 2000, the Ministry of Public Health  decided to set up the national center.</p>

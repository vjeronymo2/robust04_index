			<p>BFN     [Text] The delegates to the Sixth National Conference of  the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], which ended yesterday,  supported the following conclusion, presented by SDS leader  Filip Dimitrov:    [Begin Dimitrov recording] There is no other prudent  solution for Bulgaria other than holding early elections as soon  as possible. This is a conclusion prompted not by the interests  of the SDS as a political formation, but by the need to lead  Bulgaria out of the critical situation in which it finds itself,  and the grave consequences of the rule of the present  government. Therefore it is necessary to effect a decisive  change, prompted by a new political will that is able to  implement changes in the direction of the reforms -- a direction  the SDS advocates in the name of the nation.    The SDS National Conference discussed the issue of adopting  a  categorical position against the existing government and the  creation of a similar one, and against continuing the activity  of the current parliament. The SDS's decisive organs are the  conference and the National Coordinating Council. [end  recording]    According to the changes in the SDS statute as adopted by  the  conference, certain restricting texts were adopted regarding the  future SDS people's representatives. Those texts apply also to  the current members of the National Coordinating Council. They  cannot be former members of the Union of Active Fighters Against  Fascism and Capitalism, active figures in the totalitarian  regime, or people who have submitted requests to join the former  Bulgarian Communist Party.    According to the document that was adopted, if the current  government remains in office, the SDS will begin massive  extraparliamentary protest actions, combined with a  parliamentary boycott. The forms of those actions are yet to be  specified.</p>

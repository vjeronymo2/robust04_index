			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria  said yesterday before the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva  that El Salvador is showing evidence that its peace process is  irreversible and called on the commission to give El Salvador  the credibility it deserves and to decide by consensus to remove  it from the list of observed countries.    The speech by the Salvadoran foreign minister centered  mainly  on demonstrating that the country's regime has basically changed  with regard to respect for and encouragement of human rights, as  proven by the testimonies of various agents designated by the  United Nations, such as Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador],  and the main UN and international community organs.    Salaverria said that El Salvador "is the only sovereign  state  that has encouraged and granted facilities for international on  `site' observance of the development of political events." He  added that the 150 Onusal members move about freely and have all  the means to fulfill their designated tasks.    After admitting that during the conflict "serious violations  to human rights took place," Salaverria added that today "the  topic should be viewed from a realistic perspective and  according to the new existing circumstances." He admitted that  there is a problem of common crime due to the postwar situation.  Despite all this, he said that "it should not be linked to  human rights violations by the state."    Salaverria gave assurances that Onusal's presence in El  Salvador is the best national and international guarantee in the  observance and verification of the country's human rights  situation, because this is done directly and with the active  presence and backing of the UN Security Council.    Minister Salaverria said that El Salvador has decidedly  begun  consolidating peace, implementing national reconciliation,  placing emphasis on a legal state, and strengthening the  democratic system.    On several occasions he insisted on the favorable evolution  of human rights and pointed out how the administration of  President Alfredo Cristiani is complying with the pledge made to  the Salvadoran people and the international community. In fact,  we have even gone "beyond it by giving new ideas to consolidate  world peace."    In this area Salaverria mentioned the National Forum for  Reflection on Education and Peace Culture organized by the  Salvadoran Government in April 1993, which proved to be a  valuable initiative.    He then added that because peace consolidation requires  conceptualizing and putting it into practice, the government has  made invitations to the First International Forum on Peace  Culture, which will take place on 16 February in San Salvador  with UNESCO [UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural  Organization] support. Numerous delegates are expected to attend.    When thanking the international community for the support  given to the peace negotiation and consolidation process, he  warned that this support could, however, run the risk of  becoming "an obstacle" if the recommendations are followed by  those who intend to maintain unnecessary observation in El  Salvador "when undisputable evidence has been given that peace  in El Salvador is irreversible and can only become stronger."    In this part of his speech, Foreign Minister Salaverria made  his call for members of the UN Human Rights Commission to grant  "the deserved credibility to the Salvadoran process and decide,  by consensus, to remove El Salvador from its list."    He pointed out that El Salvador is on its way to an election  on 20 March with the participation of all political forces,  without any of them being hindered, that will be witnessed by  international representatives from several states and by more  than 1,500 observers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is preparing the  composition of the new government cabinet which will be  announced immediately following the Corfu meeting [EU summit].  A possible date for the swearing in of the new government  cabinet is 6 July.    Replying to a question on the upcoming government reshuffle,  government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: The government  reshuffle is the exclusive responsibility of the prime minister,  who is evaluating all possibilities. No one else is  participating in this process. In order not to waste time on  scenarios, Venizelos added, I can tell you a few very simple  things. First, the reshuffle will take place within the time  limit that was announced from the beginning so that the  government's pace remains steady. Second, there is no truth to  rumors of a realignment of ministries or the appointment of  deputy prime ministers.    Replying to other relevant questions, the government  spokesman said that there could be minor changes in some  ministries. He also did not rule out some division of  ministries for better administration.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: London signposts high hopes for Tokyo Expectations and events have moved out of alignment in Japan, but recently international investors have had a chance to get ahead of the game. For example, last Friday the London ISE/Nikkei 50 index of Japanese stocks rose 3.3 per cent after a drop on the week in Tokyo's domestic equity market. UK-based investors were able to move on news of the government's deal on political reform, signposting the exceptional gains in Tokyo yesterday. A week earlier the situation was reversed, Tokyo's Nikkei index taking a Monday fall of 4.9 per cent after a bullish week in the domestic market was followed by the rejection of the government's reform bill in the upper house. Again, London was able to signal the drop in Friday trading. Last week, Mr Nicholas Knight and Ms Allison Southey, Nomura's global strategy team, told investors not to panic, saying the Monday fall had provided a 'poten-tially brief' window of opportunity and that the Nikkei, a little above 18,000 at the time, could push through 24,000 in 1994. Yesterday, they put their target in a bracket between 24,000 - 'and the 20 per cent possibility that the market might go straight to 28,000'. In Europe, the strategists last week were underweighting Germany, expecting that it would produce a positive capital return this year but that there would be more to go for elsewhere. Mr Oliver Kamm, James Capel's European strategist, liked France, Sweden and Spain in particular. In the event, the European markets which moved most were Spain and Italy, the latter leading the Continental pack with a rise of 5.9 per cent on the week. Merrill Lynch's latest European equity monitor picks out two senior European bourses, Milan, in Italy, and Stockholm, in Sweden, which are expected to receive huge earnings boosts from devaluation in 1994 and 1995. Italy's new alliance in the political centre has boosted market sentiment further, writes UBS Global Research, the volume of trading hitting record highs, with the greatest interest in industrial stocks. Spain set all-time peaks last week due to a number of factors, says the Swiss group. The unexpected cut in the intervention rate, the strength of the peseta and further declines in bond yields contributed to the rally, but it was the excellent performance of bank shares that really pushed the market ahead in big turnover.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change                 % change in local currency*       sterling* in US Dlrs*            -------------------------------------------------------------             1 Week  4 Weeks    1 Year   Start of   Start of   Start of                                             1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +0.55    +3.43    +48.47     +46.73     +38.03     +37.09 Belgium      +1.13    +1.86    +29.31     +35.22     +26.81     +25.93 Denmark      +1.34    +7.90    +41.05     +55.19     +45.98     +44.99 Finland      -0.13   +15.40   +119.05    +126.14    +114.60    +113.13 France       +3.17    +3.33    +35.78     +32.03     +24.93     +24.07 Germany      +2.56    -5.07    +34.77     +37.20     +29.53     +28.64 Ireland      -2.89    +7.21    +63.56     +68.43     +50.80     +49.76 Italy        +5.91    +5.09    +40.99     +52.62     +33.87     +32.95 Netherlands  -0.23    +2.67    +42.60     +44.18     +36.43     +35.49 Norway       +2.21   +10.87    +57.71     +57.25     +47.17     +46.16 Spain        +4.06    +8.14    +49.04     +61.23     +32.81     +31.90 Sweden       +0.81    +8.71    +62.16     +51.96     +36.63     +35.69 Switzerland  +3.21    +6.48    +53.42     +52.92     +54.71     +53.64 UK           -1.22    +1.69    +24.20     +23.79     +23.79     +22.94 EUROPE       +1.01    +2.34    +34.70     +35.30     +30.21     +29.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +0.34    +3.49    +42.68     +39.84     +44.87     +43.86 Hong Kong    -0.68    -4.62   +101.72    +110.27    +112.20    +110.74 Japan        -2.79    +5.63    +18.17     +16.99     +34.78     +33.85 Malaysia     +2.19   -15.08   +100.27     +97.89     +88.72     +87.43 New Zealand  +2.71    +6.28    +59.85     +54.62     +71.95     +70.79 Singapore    +1.57    -7.19    +55.47     +56.79     +62.64     +61.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       -0.71    +3.48    +28.45     +26.53     +22.32     +21.48 USA          +0.96    +2.54     +8.64      +9.34     +10.10      +9.34 Mexico       +1.61    +4.14    +52.13     +50.22     +51.96     +50.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -1.28    -4.03    +46.04     +52.97     +68.52     +67.36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -0.14    +2.80    +20.68     +20.89     +25.21     +24.36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on December 28th 1993.

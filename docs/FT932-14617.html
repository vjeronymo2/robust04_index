			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / On song at the opera: Covent Garden has confounded its detractors but the once-mighty ENO is in decline JEREMY ISAACS, general director of the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, can look forward to his dinner tomorrow night. While his colleagues among the arts world glitterati in the Great Room at London's Grosvenor House will be awaiting nervously the announcement of the annual Laurence Olivier awards for excellence in British theatre, opera and dance, Isaacs is serenely confident. Not for him the stomach-churning moment when the winning envelopes are opened and success or failure becomes public property. The reason is that all eight nominations in the opera categories are for productions or performances which took place at Covent Garden in the past year. For Isaacs, it is a change in fortune that would be meat and drink to one of Verdi's tragic heroines. Last summer, not only were the daggers out for the combative Scotsman - but they were entering right between his shoulder blades. The media was full of an orchestrated campaign criticising his management of Covent Garden and suggesting that an Arts Council investigation - chaired by Baroness Mary Warnock, former Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge - would produce an extremely critical report. The hostile headlines were timed to influence the board of the ROH as it considered whether to renew his contract. In the end, the board wavered only slightly under the pressure and extended Isaacs' contract for two rather than three years, until 1995. And the Warnock report, although censuring Covent Garden for giving artistic considerations priority over finance (not in itself a heinous attitude for an opera house), was not totally negative. The would-be assassins melted away and Isaacs ran up many successes. On Wednesday, he put on a typically bullish performance for the media, announcing a profit for the year of Pounds 750,000 (reduced to Pounds 266,000 by contingency payments towards early retirements and redundancies) and audiences over the year of 85 per cent of capacity for opera and 86 per cent for dance. He also confirmed that the Covent Garden board was determined to go ahead with its controversial Pounds 150m re-development programme for the opera house and its surrounds, despite the marked lack of enthusiasm shown for the project by Warnock and the council, Covent Garden's main paymaster. There was even some speculation that Isaacs would be able to announce this week that the funding for the 'new' Covent Garden, which involves modernising a back-stage mechanical system that pre-dates the first world war, was actually in place; but it was not to be. A meeting last month with John Major, the prime minister, produced expressions of goodwill but not a firm promise to deliver the Pounds 45m the ROH is seeking from public funds. It is pledged to raise a matching Pounds 45m itself, with the remaining Pounds 60m coming from an adjacent commercial development. But Isaacs' willingness to pursue the project publicly suggests that Covent Garden is confident the scheme will go ahead. A few hundred yards down the road at the Coliseum, Peter Jonas, director of the English National Opera, also has experienced the vicissitudes of fortune. While Covent Garden could do little right, the ENO was riding a critical high. Just before last year's general election, its success in attracting a new, and younger, audience to its acclaimed productions, always sung in English, was rewarded by the government with the gift of the Coliseum's freehold, worth Pounds 11m. It marked a fitting climax to the nine-year reign of Jonas, who had previously announced he was quitting this summer to take over as supremo of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He seemed to be handing over the musical success story of the age to his successor, Dennis Marks, head of music programmes at BBC Television. Even when the ENO took considerable risks, such as a season devoted solely to 20th century operas, the challenge succeeded. In the past few months, though, the ENO has lost its glitter. The critics have started to quibble at the perverse modernistic gloss - often involving a tilted stage - endemic among its new productions and audiences have been deserting the Coliseum in worrying numbers. The failure to win even one nomination for the Olivier awards was confirmation that Marks takes over a nervous ENO, troubled both artistically and financially. Audiences this season are down from around 80 per cent to nearer 65 per cent and the Coliseum reported an annual loss of Pounds 1m, building towards an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.4m. By its very nature, opera, as the most expensive and exaggerated of art forms, always attracts dramas (not to say melodramas) and recent events in London are tame compared with the traumas in Milan, where the local audience turned against its former hero and booed Pavarotti loudly; and Paris, where the new Bastille opera house has been dogged by strikes, resignations and vast deficits. Yet, beneath the superficial story of an heroic figure defying hostile forces and subduing them, the recent history of Covent Garden has a more sinister sub-plot. Last year, for the first time, there was questioning at the very heart of the arts establishment as to whether Covent Garden need continue to exist. Its annual grant of Pounds 19.5m was a sizeable slice of a total Arts Council budget of Pounds 226m: think how many new arts ventures could be nurtured on this sum, said the critics. The populists also were shocked by Isaacs' attempt to solve the ROH's ingrained financial problems by raising prices way above the rate of inflation, so that a top seat for opera could easily cost over Pounds 100. Lord Palumbo, the chairman of the council - who has pioneered the idea of big building projects to celebrate the millennium - was enthused by a new national opera house to rise up on London's South Bank, where the capital's big concert halls are sited. A modernised Covent Garden seemed a second-best use of scarce resources. Isaacs' opponents seized upon some lacklustre new productions, plus a series of disputes with orchestra and chorus which suggested Isaacs was heavy-handed in labour relations. They also claimed he had an easy-going attitude to financial controls, At the same time, they could point to the Coliseum as an opera house for the age, contemporary in approach and attracting a new audience at popular prices. But, at the crunch last summer, Covent Garden could still call enough well-connected friends to its defence, and the improvements in programming came through in time to charm critics and audiences alike. Now, the scenario has changed radically. Not that Covent Garden is totally free of problems. The makings of a deal are in place, but they depend on the present run of good fortune continuing. The government seems inclined to allocate some of the proceeds from the proposed national lottery, which should come on stream by the end of 1994, towards the re-building fund. In return, Isaacs will eliminate the Pounds 3m deficit by the 1995-96 season. This will be achieved by fewer new productions, a safer repertoire, and clever programming involving more matinees, popular revivals, and an acceptance of the Warnock recommendations on reducing operating costs. But the ballet company seems destined to continue as the poor relation, starved of the funding needed to increase the number of dancers to an acceptable performing level, and of fresh productions. This reflects its position as the inferior revenue-spinner. Isaacs also has promised that his successor should be in a position to accept that the modernisation of the opera house will enable savings to be made backstage, especially in overtime payments. This could increase the number of performances and, along with an additional 113 seats, reduce the size of the annual grant, thus saving the government money in the long run. His hand has been much strengthened by the support of two rich patrons: Lord Sainsbury, the supermarkets tycoon, and Vivien Duffield, who oversees the charitable foundation set up by her late father, businessman Sir Charles Clore; they have pledged most of the Pounds 45m to be contributed by Covent Garden. The recent visits by the company to the Far East have paid off handsomely, too, not only in lucrative sponsorship deals but in uncovering a Japanese benefactor whose contribution of Pounds 2.5m will help to ensure that the deficit is paid off by 1995-96. There are obvious pitfalls ahead. The staff accepted a pay freeze last year and will be asked to accept a minimal increase, if that, this year. They may feel they have been squeezed enough. On top of this, the reductions in overtime could mean employees have less time to spend on quality control in productions. The experience of the ENO suggests that audiences are very fickle. In a recession, too, they are more selective in their occasional visits to the opera. So far, the ENO has suffered most because its policy of extra performances of popular revivals lost it the support of those discriminating opera-goers who went to the Coliseum for an intriguing experience. The Covent Garden audience probably is richer and more conservative and has, to date, accepted more evenings of Madama Butterfly and La Boheme. But its patience could be exhausted soon, especially as seat prices next season have been raised by 4 per cent, making an average price of Pounds 62 for an opera performance. At the ENO, the top performance price is Pounds 39. Isaacs is forcing the pace because the decisions on temporary closure have to be made in the next three months. The plan is to re-open the modernised Covent Garden with a great gala, probably of the Berlioz opera Les Troyens, on December 31 1999. This would involve extended summer breaks in 1996 and 1996 and a total closure from 1997, with the opera company probably confined to touring abroad or doing seasons at a venue such as London's Royal Albert Hall while the ballet company camped down in what could be London's new dance house (lottery money willing). The favourite sites for this are the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, or the derelict Lyceum nearby - but both would require a government hand-out almost as big as that for Covent Garden. So, the imponderables abound. As in many aspects of national life, much depends on the revenue from the lottery, which could be worth Pounds 60m a year to the arts. After a stormy start, Isaacs seems to be getting to grips with the politics of opera. Marks will have a shorter learning programme. He, too, must raise money - around Pounds 15m - to shore up his theatre. And, in the short term, he must stamp a new, popular face on the ENO. The departure of Jonas coincided with the resignation of his two right-hand men, musical director Mark Elder and David Poultney, the director of productions. This gives Marks a clean sheet - but extra responsibilities. His new music director, Sian Edwards, has little experience of working in an opera house and has few productions in her conducting repertoire. Her most recent performance at the Coliseum, in The Queen of Spades, drew mixed reviews. Jonas is leaving London in a relaxed mood. He has done his bit, taking it upon himself to fight the corner for the arts - although he feels he failed to convert the government to the proposition, accepted on the Continent, that a thriving, publicly-funded arts scene is essential in a civilised society. There were periods when the message seemed to be accepted but, in the past two years, the philistines have got the upper hand. Worrying about finance was the biggest concern of his job - and the reason why the ENO never performed a complete Ring cycle during his stewardship. This is an obvious challenge for Marks, and one that could feature when he announces his 1993-94 programme later this month. He is planning an attention-grabbing repertoire, including an opening production of La Boheme in Italian, a provocative break with ENO philosophy. But all Marks' plans will be controlled by the financial imperatives. The really important ENO performance takes place on April 27 when the board meets to discuss the sudden and potentially disastrous financial short-fall. So for some time to come the dominant theme behind the programmes of both of London's opera houses will be the same: Money, Money, Money, Money . . .</p>

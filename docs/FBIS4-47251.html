			<p>Budget   <F P=102>    947A0043A Moscow POISK in Russian No. 15 (257), 15-21 Apr 94  p 1 </F>  <F P=103> 947A0043A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow POISK </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: ``Arguments and Figures''] </F>   [Text] In the last number we reported that the Science  Subcommittee on Education, Culture and Science of the State Duma  tabled the draft budget proposed by the government with respect  to the part relating to appropriations for science. It was  proposed that it be returned to the government for a radical  reworking. What induced the subcommittee (one of whose concerns,  incidentally, is the revision of the budget for the purpose of  reduction of government expenditures) to take such a decisive  step? We bring to your attention the arguments of the  subcommittee experts set forth in their conclusions concerning  the draft law of the Russian Federation entitled ``On the  Federal Budget for 1994'' in the section ``Fundamental Research  and Facilitation of Scientific and Technical Progress.''    ``The amount of funding of fundamental and applied science  provided for in the draft budget is catastrophically inadequate.  In comparison with 1991, when the fraction allocated for science  was 1.03% of the GNP, the expenditures on scientific  research  in comparable prices have been reduced by half.    The calculations serving as a basis for the presented budget  depart from the practices which took shape during the preceding  years, solidify and intensify the pernicious tendencies, make no  provision for structural changes and principles of budgetary  policy have not been laid which would facilitate the necessary  restructuring of the organization of scientific research.    The proposed draft budget retains the deformed structure of  expenditures on science which has taken shape during recent  years when the fraction of sums for the payment of labor and  social security has added up to more than 81/%. The indicated  structure completely ignores the sharp, by a factor of 30-50,  increase in prices for fuel and electric power, the significant  rise in prices for transportation and communal services,  expenditures on scientific equipment, materials, reagents and  scientific information. Thereby this ensures only the  maintenance, and extremely inadequate at that, of part of the  scientific personnel, without the possibility of conducting  scientific research itself.    "The sum of proposed expenditures for science in the amount  of 11.8 trillion rubles, figuring in the composite balance,  should not lead one astray because 2/3 of this sum is an  unbudgeted fund for scientific research, development, testing  and engineering work, allocations to which are not of a  mandatory character and therefore under economic crisis  conditions are unrealistic (in 1993 of the predicted 1.7  trillion rubles of unbudgeted sums for scientific research,  development, testing and engineering work in actuality only 41.6  billion were actually received). Thus, in actuality, one should  count only on the budgeted component -- 4.5 billion rubles  (0.6% of the GNP).    The presented draft budget strengthens the residual  principle  of funding of the scientific sphere because it is funded from  the development budget, whose formation, in accordance with the  law ``On the Budget System of the Russian Federation,'' can be  carried out only in the absence of a budget deficit, but such a  deficit is embodied in the presented draft. Thus, science has  virtually no guarantees of funding.    In the opinion of the subcommittee, the expenditures for  civilian science included directly in the federal budget for  1994 in Article 15, Section 4, should not be 4.5 trillion  rubles, but not less than 7.7 trillion rubles (1% of the  GNP  and 4.2% of all the budgeted expenditures, which is half  less  the fraction of the GNP allocated for science in the  well-developed countries and is acceptable only if there are  substantial tax, tariff and customs privileges), of which not  less than 2.8 trillion rubles must be directed to material  expenditures, purchase of scientific publications, ensuring a  modern level of informational servicing of scientists, as well  as compensation for the expenditures on energy for the  maintenance of scientific institutions and covering the  expenditures on energy by scientific projects having high energy  requirements. Thus, the minimum expenditures on science require  the additional allocation of 3.2 trillion rubles.    Even these sums will make it possible to cover the needs of  only a part of the scientific research and therefore at the same  time it is necessary to make provision for an increase in the  direct funding of projects and programs, specifically directed  support of scientific schools and groups, as well as individual  researchers. The fraction of the budgeted sums (including the  monies subject to distribution through funds, ensuring the  implementation of a selective scientific and technical policy,  must be not less than 45% of the total expenditures on  science.    In this case it will become possible to direct to the  funding  of fundamental science, which is a national cultural treasure  and which which will provide the premises for economic rebirth  of the country, about 2.5 trillion rubles (0.35% of the  GNP,  which corresponds to the structure of expenditures for these  purposes in the well-developed countries). It must be emphasized  that the funding of fundamental science throughout the world is  virtually completely assumed by the state.''    The conclusion that there is a need for allocating  additional  sums was supported by the participants at a conference of the  subcommittee which was attended by representatives of the  Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Agricultural  Sciences, Russian Academy of Education, Russian Academy of the  Arts, Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences,  Russian Engineering Academy, Academy of Technological Sciences,  Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow State University, Council of  Rectors of Moscow Colleges and Universities, State Archives,  State Committee for Higher and Intermediate Education and  Russian Ministry of Science and Technical Policy.</p>

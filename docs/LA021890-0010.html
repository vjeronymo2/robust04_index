			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'd like to call attention to an underrated actor, Joe Penny. In movies from  "Deathmoon" to "The Operation," from guest-starring roles in "Vega$" and "Matt  Houston" to co-starring roles in "Riptide" and "Jake and the Fatman," he has  proven himself a versatile and accomplished actor. Some roles may not have been  the choicest but that has never seemed to tarnish his passion for giving it his  best.  </P> <P> Sheila R. McGee, Nipomo  </P></p>

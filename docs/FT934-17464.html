			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Greek Elections: EC beckons for winners of Greek election RUNNING the European Community presidency for the first half of next year will be the first important foreign policy test for the new Greek government after the October 10 election. With the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement holding a steady lead in opinion polls, anxieties about Greek obstructiveness in Community affairs, frequent under previous Socialist administrations, are reviving. Independent polls predict Pasok will win up to 44 per cent of the vote, against 41 per cent for the conservative New Democracy party, enough for a working majority in parliament. However, the timing of the election, six months earlier than expected, has relieved European Commission officials. A disruptive election campaign and probable change of government midway though the Greek presidency loomed as a nightmare scenario in Brussels. If the Socialists return to power, the first question will be whether Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, will have the stamina to make the rounds of EC capitals and be an effective chairman of next year's summit on Corfu. In 1988, when Greece last held the EC presidency, a shaky-looking Mr Papandreou, recovering from heart surgery, called an early halt to proceedings. Mr Papandreou will have to work hard in any case to reassure Greece's EC partners that his new-found enthusiasm for European economic union, a central theme of his campaign speeches, is more than a convenient election tactic. Still, the constraints of being the EC's poorest member, together with Greece's commitment, accepted by Pasok, to meeting the Maastricht targets for economic convergence, should make a new Socialist government more co-operative than its predecessors. Greece is unlikely to stop raising difficulties over regional issues. It will go on blocking attempts to unfreeze Ecu400m (Pounds 306m) in EC aid to Turkey under the Fourth Financial Protocol and will do its utmost to prevent full diplomatic recognition of the ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. However, regardless of the election outcome, Greece's dependence on EC transfers to shore up its current account and provide the bulk of co-financing for public investment projects will mean that Greek policymakers will think twice before straying far from the Commission's agenda for 1994. Moreover, the presidency will coincide with efforts to speed transfers from the Delors II package of infrastructure funding, from which Greece hopes to get almost Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) over the next six years. Greece's own priority for the presidency will be to push for a co-ordinated EC policy on the Balkans, and to help develop communications and economic co-operation.</p>

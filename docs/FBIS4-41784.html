			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- The Social  Democratic Party of Moldova [PSDM] today held a press  conference. It made public its attitude toward the  socio-economic situation in Moldova in the 100 days since the 27  February elections. "The collapse of the standard of living is  taking place along with a more insolent theft of state property.  The blockage of mass privatization leads to decreasing prices  for patrimonial vouchers: this removes the last chance open to  the Moldovan citizens to escape hunger and poverty," states the  PSDM declaration made public during the press conference. Oazu  Nantoi, PSDM chairman, stated that due to the election results a  single party is at power this party is responsible for the  worsening socio-political situation in Moldova. In his opinion,  the stability of the national currency "is due not only to the  international credits or policy pursued by the National Bank,  but to the Moldovan population's limitless patience." "The  governing party is hurrying to ensure a political comfort  similar to that of the communist party during the stagnation  period. We are witnesses of a cleansing of those who have not  hastened to show their loyalty to the governing party," said  Nantoi. He also pointed out that freedom of expression is  smothered in Moldova and censorship is used in state media. He  alleged that the Government "has no clear strategy on how to  settle the problems of Eastern and Southern Moldova or  consolidating Moldova's statehood." Nantoi stated that another  step toward Moldova's disintegration has been enacted by  creating a symbolic federation within which the central  administration cannot establish sovereignty on its territory.  He said that the officials' exaggerated dependence on the  relations between Moldova and Russia and "Chisinau's political  inefficiency" stimulate Russia's demands for concessions.  Nantoi pointed out that in the recent Tiraspol-Chisinau  negotiations, the opinions of the Moldovan citizens living in  Dniester were not heard. Commenting on the president's joining  of the PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova], Nantoi said  Snegur thus "assumes responsibility for the policy of the  governing party."</p>

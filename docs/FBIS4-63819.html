			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Yet another extremely important subject today is  the NATO defense ministers conference in Brussels. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent K. Mazheyka] At this moment, as you are  watching this report, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who  arrived in Brussels an hour ago, is setting out our conception  of partnership.    [Begin Grachev recording] I have simply brought Russia's  vision of the Partnership for Peace. The first section is  political partnership. The second section is military  partnership, and the third section is a miscellaneous one.  These are the specifically worked out parameters of our  partnership. We shall propose that our representatives and the  special representatives of the NATO countries draw up a  broad-scale agreement. When it is ready, we will sign two  documents: a general conception of the partnership and the  agreement that will be drawn up if the NATO members accept it.  [end recording]</p>

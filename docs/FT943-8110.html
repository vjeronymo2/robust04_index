			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Arrests at Russian central bank Ten officials from the Russian central bank were arrested by interior ministry forces earlier this week on charges that they had 'allocated loans in a criminal fashion'. Government officials yesterday confirmed that the arrests had taken place but would not give further details. They come at a time when financial scandals, complete with midnight police raids, are becoming the norm in Russia. Recently, police have seized sacks of cash from Siberian branches of a struggling investment fund and earlier this month they arrested the president of the controversial MMM pyramid scheme only after clambering along the outside walls of his apartment building. The allegation that central bank officials have misused loan facilities is particularly topical because the central economic issue in Russia today is whether the central bank should bail out the country's indebted enterprises.</p>

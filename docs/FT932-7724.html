			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Wall Street triumphs over its fear of inflation - The abrupt shift of sentiment that took the US market to new highs Confusion, uncertainty, rumour and a touch of hysteria reign on Wall Street this week. There is confusion and uncertainty about where stocks, bonds, gold prices and the economy are heading. There are wild rumours about what well-known investment managers are doing with their money. And there has been a burst of hysteria about inflation and monetary policy. In spite of all this, US stock markets have managed to rise to record highs. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 55.64 to 3,500.03, an impressive recovery from a morning which had seen it 30 points down. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index moved to within 10 points of its all-time peak. Other market indices also approached, or broke through, their records, in some of the heaviest trading ever seen on Wall Street. The week opened with investors in a gloomy mood, fearful that recent news of rising consumer, producer and commodity prices heralded the return of higher inflation. The resurgence in the price of gold, a traditional inflation hedge, had reinforced those fears. The same worries had already undermined bond prices, sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond back above 7 per cent for the first time in more than a month. This made equity investors even more nervous, because rising bond yields make stocks look less attractive. Both the stock and bond markets fretted that signs of revived inflation might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The fretting reached a peak this week because the Fed's open market committee was meeting to review monetary policy. Pessimists feared that the open market committee would put up short-term interest rates to head off a rise in prices. When the committee meeting ended with no apparent change of policy, the markets' mood suddenly brightened. Simultaneously, gold prices were hit by profit-taking and dropped almost Dollars 10 from their Wednesday morning high of Dollars 383 an ounce. The stage was set for a sharp reversal of market sentiment. As Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at fund group Dreyfus, explained: 'What we saw was a popping of the bubble of hysteria about accelerating inflation.' He believed that stock market and bond market investors had 'built up a negative psychology based upon bad inflation numbers, the rising gold price and falling bonds'. It was a fragile psychology which crumbled easily. First, bond prices rallied, bringing the yield on three-year treasuries down from 7.07 per cent to 6.97 per cent. Then stocks turned upwards, heading to new highs. Rumours abounded. During the afternoon Mr George Soros, the well-known investor who had helped spark the rally in gold, was rumoured to be switching back out of the metal into bonds. Then word spread that Fidelity Investment's huge Magellan fund had started to pour money into stocks in anticipation of a big market rally. Neither rumour was true, but they contributed to Wednesday's frenzy. Other factors were at work. The most recent survey of market sentiment had shown that investment advisers were more bearish about the market's outlook that at any time since October 1990. To the professional investors, this was an indication that the bears had exhausted their selling, and a sign that the market was ripe for a rally. Many immediately began buying stocks. Although the buying quickly petered out yesterday - at midday, bond and equity prices were virtually unchanged - at least the fuss over gold prices and inflation appeared to have died down. Mr Laszlo Birinyi, the veteran market watcher with Birinyi Associates in New York, said: 'The whole gold play was overworked. The conventional wisdom that gold is some sort of harbinger of inflation is simply not true.' Yet, the nagging uncertainties that were evident at the start of the week had not gone away. While interest rates will probably remain where they are for a few months, the next move in rates is more likely to be up than down. Stocks still look pricey, and the huge inflows of investor cash (via mutual funds) that has propped up prices for so long will slow down this summer because of seasonal factors. The recent performance of stock and bond markets has left Wall Street feeling dazed and confused. Mr Birinyi is one observer who thinks that there is more to the market's strength than just low interest rates and heavy buying of mutual funds by investors chasing attractive yields. 'Maybe the market is saying something major about the future. What it is, I do not know.'</p>

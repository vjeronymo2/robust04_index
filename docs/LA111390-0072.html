			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Art Imitating Life: A scene in "Rocky V" between Sylvester Stallone and his  neophyte-actor son, 14-year-old Sage, may be left on the cutting-room floor  because it came too close to real life, Stallone told Redbook.  </P> <P> Stallone and his first wife, Sasha, divorced in 1985 and Sage and his brother  Seargeoh, 11, remained with their mother. In the scene, Rocky tells his son  "that no matter what, I'll never desert him," Stallone said. "I really lost it  in that scene. Then Sage started to lose it because he'd never seen his father  cry. It was all hitting too close to home, and I may take it out of the movie  because it's just too emotional." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

Mr. Mesfin Seyoum, in a statement to the Saudi Arabian ARAB  NEWS newspaper, said that Sudan should think twice before  deciding to expand its ideology to neighboring countries, and  noted that we may understand each other if Sudan is limited to  implementing its ideology on its territory only.    The foreign minister went on to say that trying to expand  ideology in a way which would affect the peace and stability of  neighboring countries would affect the countries concerned. Mr.  Mesfin, answering a question on how he views the conflict which  arose between Eritrea and Sudan, said anything which affects the  peace and stability of neighboring countries will concern us,  because it will also affect our peace and stability. Mr. Mesfin  noted however that open and clear discussions were underway  between the two countries.</p>

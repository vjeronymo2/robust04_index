			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Finland and Italy lead the global decline Global equities eased last week in spite of Wall Street reaching a record high on Tuesday. Both the US and Japan suffered falls of around 2 per cent, leaving the FT-Actuaries World index 1.7 per cent lower on the week in local currency terms. The prospects for the world's leading markets continue to diverge. Friday's bigger than expected rise in February non-farm payrolls on Friday has added weight to the US recovery story. Furthermore, the US stock markets are likely to remain buoyant as low interest rates encourage individuals to switch their funds out of bank deposits into equities. By contrast, there are few redeeming features in the Tokyo stock market. Investor hopes for a cut in the official discount rate are regularly disappointed, and sentiment has been dented by the steady decline in the yen against the dollar in spite of repeated intervention in the foreign exchange markets by the Bank of Japan. In its weekly report, Nomura International says that under these conditions it is difficult to foresee the market being able to sustain a rally. Indeed, the consensus opinion is that the market will drift lower in thin volume. Scandinavia supplied the best and the worst performers of the week. Norway and Sweden vied for the best performing slot of the week as attention switched to the laggards. Sweden had risen by only 5.8 per cent by the end of February and Norway was 0.9 per cent below end-1991 values. Finland dropped 5.8 per cent in local currency terms, but Ms Taina Uljas of Kleinwort Benson said this was to be expected after the sharp rise in January and February. In the first two months of this year, the Finnish market climbed by 19.2 per cent on the FT-A world indices, well ahead of the 6.8 per cent rise for the whole of Europe. Ms Uljas says the recent buying spree in Finland has been overdone, considering that an upturn in the economy will not emerge until the end of the year. Investors have also been worried by news that the government has set up a new fund to support the banking sector in case of a crisis. Reports that banks will not be allowed to increase their lending, which would hamper an economic recovery, also weighed on the market. Ms Uljas expects the market to remain weak until the second quarter, when favourable economic data are expected to attract the buyers back, especially into forestry stocks. Italy, rapidly becoming the sick man of Europe, followed Finland with a 4.2 per cent fall. The market was dealt a serious blow by President Francesco Cossiga's decision to scupper an important car insurance reform, which would have made the sector more profitable for insurers. Also, volume has virtually dried up ahead of the general election in April. Pastorino and Partners, a leading Milanese brokerage, says last week's performance offers investors little comfort for the market's medium-term prospects. However, it adds that the current climate of uncertainty and the oversold nature of the market make straddle options attractive.</p>

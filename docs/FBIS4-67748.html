			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has been meeting its commitments on the  supplies of cryogenic rocket boosters to India.    The deal, whose terms in line with the Missile Technology  Control Regime, MTCR, were made public at the end of last year,  has been officially endorsed by the Russian cabinet, a  Vice-Chairman of Glavkosmos, Russia's major space research  establishment, has said in an interview with Interfax.    In line with new terms, Russia is to deliver at least four  cryogenic boosters to India for its SLV-3 rockets. This is  twice more than envisaged by the contract signed by Glavkosmos  in 1991.    Lifted up by a Russian booster, SLV-3 will be able to put  loads in orbit about 36,000 kilometers above the earth.    As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy  Koptev  has told Interfax, supplies of ready-made cryogenic blocks are  within MTCR, which Russia wished to join by signing a memorandum  of intent in Washington on September 2, 1993.    In Koptev's words, two additional blocks will be shipped to  India to compensate for Russia's failure to meet the initial  commitments, concerning the supply of technologies in bypass of  MTCR.    Koptev declared that Russia had kept virtually intact the  volume of financing, totalling $300 million, envisaged by the  contract. India is to get the first booster next year.</p>

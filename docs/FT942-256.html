			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Bulgaria signs accord to reduce Dollars 8bn bank debt Bulgaria and its London Club commercial bank creditors yesterday signed a debt reduction agreement which should re-establish the country's financial links. These have been blocked since 1990 when the Socialist government initially stopped interest and then capital repayments. For the past four years Bulgaria has been cut off from western commercial financing and has had to rely on the IMF, the World Bank, and foreign aid. The agreement provides for a 47.1 per cent reduction in Bulgaria's Dollars 8.1bn (Pounds 5.3bn) debt to a group of more than 300 commercial banks. Bulgaria's total foreign debt, including that to Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries, is Dollars 9.3bn. The deal was signed by the finance minister, Mr Stoyan Alexandrov, and Deutsche Bank, as closing agents for the deal, Citibank, as fiscal agents, and the US Federal Reserve which will sell Bulgaria collateralised discount bonds. Representatives of 14 creditor banks arrived in Sofia for the signing and rest will sign in London and Frankfurt in July. The deal calls for the restructuring of Dollars 3.8bn of debt. Of this total 12.4 per cent is to be reduced by buybacks, 60.5 per cent by collateralised discount bonds, and 27.1 per cent through front loaded interest reduction bonds (FLIRBs). Parliament will have to ratify the deal by the end of July and Mr Alexandrov has been consulting leaders of the parliamentary factions to make sure they will back the deal. Mr Peter Tils, first vice-president of Deutsche Bank, said the agreement was 'a very good tailor-made package' for Sofia 'I cannot imagine what will happen if the agreement is not ratified by parliament,' Mr Tils added. Earlier this week, however, leading economists from both the Bulgarian Socialist party, which currently dominates parliament, and the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, said that Bulgaria's economy would be unable to bear the debt service burden. According to finance ministry sources Dollars 710m in up-front payments will be needed for the deal to be closed, reducing the currency reserves of the central bank to some Dollars 400m. The annual cost of the deal is expected to be just under Dollars 200m over the next seven years. The World Bank and the IMF are expected to put up a special loan of Dollars 250m to help finance buy-back operations, but this is conditional on speeding up reform, including privatisation. Other priority areas for improvement are bankruptcy laws, banking supervision and a reduction in social assistance payments.</p>

President Mugabe could hold it  any time between March and May, and the opposition parties, who  only hold a handful of seats in parliament, are hoping to make a  better show against the ruling party, ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African  National Union-Patriotic Front]. Today, Zimbabwe's home affairs  minister gave a press conference and announced that the voters'  register is going to be completely overhauled before the  election. Rachel Rawlins was there and she sent us this report:    [Begin recording] [Rawlins] Starting next Monday [21 March]  thousands of civil servants will be distributed to registration  points throughout the country in an effort to register every  eligible voter in Zimbabwe. That means not just new voters but  also those who have registered in the past will have to fill in  new forms to appear on the computerized roll. Young people who  reach the voting age of 18 by May next year will also qualify  for inclusion, but that doesn't mean the election will  definitely be held in May.    Announcing the measure this afternoon, Minister of Home  Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said it wasn't possible to extend the  registration process outside Zimbabwe apart from South Africa,  where, because of the large number of resident Zimbabweans --  about 300,000, according to government -- arrangements have been  made for registration at Zimbabwe's Trade Mission in South  Africa. Minister Dabengwa said opposition complaints that the  election was being run by members of the ruling ZANU Party were  unfounded.    [Dabengwa] We cannot allow parties to be involved in the  conduct of elections. We will have chaos and we will have  accusations and counteraccusations. This is why we leave it to  the civil servants to be responsible for the conduct of the  elections.    [Rawlins] But despite this assurance, opposition politicians  complain of bias in government-appointed commission members, and  are worried about President Mugabe's sweeping personal powers  during elections. There are some fears of a repeat of the  violence of the 1990 elections, particularly the incident where  a ZANU Party member and a member of the Central Intelligence  Organization were found guilty of shooting and wounding  opposition political candidate Patrick Kombai. They were given  presidential pardons before starting their sentences. Mr.  Dabengwa gave the assurance that everything will be done to  avoid violence this time around. [end recording]</p>

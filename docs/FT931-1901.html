			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Debt deal likely to be at core of aid for Russia: Clinton aims to outline proposed G7 package at Vancouver summit meeting with Yeltsin A DEBT rescheduling deal worth about Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) is likely to be the main plank of an aid programme for Russia to be discussed by the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries. President Bill Clinton aims to announce the broad lines of the aid plan at his summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3-4. It will then be discussed at an emergency meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers expected to be held later in April before being finalised at the July G7 summit in Tokyo. Western efforts to complete an aid package have if anything been speeded by Mr Yeltsin's announcement on Saturday that he would rule by decree until a referendum on April 25. Japanese officials involved in preparing the ministerial meeting say a multilateral aid programme for Russia for this year is almost certain to reach more than Dollars 30bn and may be as high as Dollars 40bn. The package is expected to include debt rescheduling likely to rise more than sevenfold from the Dollars 2.5bn deferral agreed last year (although Russia had much greater de facto debt relief in 1992 as a result of failure to keep up with service payments). It may also contain funds for monetary stabilisation and special assistance for small business and the energy sector. However, Japanese officials say there are unlikely to be more large pledges of bilateral aid at the April meeting, from Japan or any other country, given G7 fiscal and political problems. They say the package to be discussed at the April meeting is likely to include: Relief worth about Dollars 16bn from the interest and principal on the Dollars 80bn foreign debt which Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. Aid worth about Dollars 12bn. This would be a continuation of the G7 Dollars 24bn programme agreed last year, when only about Dollars 13.3bn was disbursed, mainly in bilateral credits. A monetary stabilisation fund worth about Dollars 3bn administered by the International Monetary Fund. Micro-economic measures which could provide proof of the value of western aid and economic reform. These include boosting investment in small and medium-sized businesses, developing the energy sector, decommissioning nuclear power plants and converting military factories to civilian production. Western countries continued yesterday to support Mr Yeltsin in his confrontation with the Russian parliament. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, yesterday said: 'We are still standing behind Yeltsin. He is the best hope for reform in that country.' She added that President Clinton had no current plans to change the venue of his summit with Mr Yeltsin, but would consider moving the meeting to Moscow if the Russian leader suggested it. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, sent a strong personal message of support to Mr Yeltsin. He underlined that there was 'very wide support for the (Russian) reform process throughout this country and in Europe'. He added: 'I strongly support the emphasis you give in your address to controlling inflation, completing land reform and helping small and medium-sized businesses. These are all areas in which we and our partners have compared experience with you and have offered co-operation and assistance.' Britain is convinced assistance for Russia can be delivered most effectively at the micro-economic level, for example, by support for small businesses or financial services. Officials said Britain was not interested in grandiose schemes that would lead to money being poured down 'a bottomless pit'. Britain is therefore prepared to build on existing programmes such as the Pounds 100m know-how fund for the former Soviet republics; the 'chancellor's scheme', devised by Mr Norman Lamont, to place Russian personnel with companies in the UK financial sector and the various technical assistance schemes organised by the European Community in which the UK participates. Treasury officials said Britain supported a rescheduling of Russia's foreign debt on terms that were as liberal as possible. However, Britain is not one of Russia's biggest creditors and officials acknowledged that UK views might not be shared by other G7 countries, notably Germany. Officials from Russia's creditor governments are due to discuss its arrears at a meeting of the Paris Club this week. This may show how far Russia can look forward to an easing of its debt burden. Any Paris Club deal, however, is still held up by the failure of Russia and Ukraine to reach agreement on how to divide responsibility for the debt of the further Soviet Union. US officials yesterday urged Mr Victor Pynzenyk, Ukraine's economics minister, to settle this problem. At the big international financial institutions in Washington, Mr Yeltsin's move appears to have caused little immediate change in policy. The World Bank signed a new Dollars 90m loan agreement with Russia on Friday to help privatisation efforts, but the funds are not likely to be disbursed for several weeks in any case. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is still a long way from agreement with Russia on the kind of stabilisation programme that could lead to substantial financing under the Fund's normal terms. Both institutions have been asked by the G7 to work on a list of 'deliverable and visible initiatives' to clear the way for concrete international aid to Russia. The Bank has been asked to work particularly on efforts to restructure and privatise Russian companies and on a social safety net to ease the transition to a market economy. IMF staff are looking at ways of expanding the pool of money available to help Russia, such as the General Arrangements to Borrow, whereby the Fund raises money from 10 industrial countries. Meanwhile, some influential voices in Washington are urging the US administration to concentrate, until Russia's political future looks clearer, on humanitarian aid. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a leading advocate in Congress of aid for Russia, called for the US to focus on initiatives such as supplying disposable needles for an inoculation programme, or diverting money from the Nato infrastructure fund to help build housing for the armed forces that have had to be moved back to Russia from the other former Soviet republics and from former Soviet satellite states in eastern Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Barry Parker] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem, May 8 (AFP) -- The on-off arrival of the  first contingent of armed Palestinian policemen to the occupied  territories was delayed again on Sunday [8 May], Israeli  officials said.    A battalion of 270 men carrying M-16 rifles reached the  Allenby Bridge crossing from Jordan to the West Bank, but Israel  said they would not be allowed in until Monday.    An AFP correspondent reported that the men, members of the  PLO's Palestine Liberation Army, had gathered a kilometre  (around half a mile) from the bridge.    The Palestinian representative in Jordan, al-Tayyib  'Abd-al-Rahim, had said the contingent could set off shortly  after formalities were completed. Another 300-strong contingent  was then due to cross Monday after arriving from Iraq.    However Israel's military administration for the West Bank  denied that the police would cross the Allenby Bridge to the  newly-autonomy Jericho enclave on Sunday.    "Nothing will happen today," an administration spokesman  said. "It should be tomorrow, Monday."    The Israeli news agency ITIM reported that the arrivals had  not been coordinated with the Israelis over Friday-Saturday and  would therefore be delayed.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said:  "We are sorry for the delays, which the Palestinians say are due  to technical reasons, we hope they will arrive as soon as  possible."    On the Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said the police  deployment there had been postponed again after being scheduled  for Sunday.    Several hundred policemen were at first scheduled to cross  the Rafah border from Egypt last Thursday. That was delayed  until Sunday, then put back further until the middle of the  following week, before being brought back to Sunday again.    The Palestinian sources blamed "technical reasons" for the  latest hold-up in the arrival of some 300 policemen from Egypt.    No new date has been given for the arrivals to Gaza.    Nineteen senior Palestinian officers, including several  "generals" did arrive in Gaza last Wednesday ready to take  charge from the withdrawing Israelis.    They have formed a liaison committee and toured Israeli army  and police buildings which the Palestinians are to take over.    The bulk of the 9,000-strong Palestinian police has been  recruited from the PLA [Palestine Liberation Army], which is the  PLO's army and has brigades scattered across several Arab  countries.    The policemen are to take over security from the Israeli  army  in the Gaza Strip and Jericho under the autonomy deal Israel and  the PLO signed last Wednesday.    The autonomy agreement gives Israel the right to approve all  the names of the police and details their arms and equipment.    They can carry 7,000 personal arms, 120 machineguns of 0.3  mm  and 0.5 mm calibre and drive 45 armoured vehicles, the accord  says.    The armoured vehicles will need prior Israeli approval to  use  the main north-south road on the Gaza Strip.    Any equipment, weapons and munitions donated or bought from  abroad is subject to Israeli approval.    The police are to maintain order in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho while Israel remains responsible for the protection of  settlers and borders.</p>

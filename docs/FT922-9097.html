			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: London triumphant The UK equity market has reached the point where any remaining bears must find their nerve severely tested. The case for a further rise is still debatable, but looks increasingly plausible. The argument is that the market is going through one of its periodic large-scale adjustments. Having swept through its previous record, it could now establish 2700 on the FT-SE as a floor rather than a ceiling. This would not be without precedent. In the last big adjustment, at the start of the Gulf war, a new floor was established at the previous ceiling of 2400. Again, the FT-SE has risen 14 per cent in the past month. In the first month of the Gulf rally it rose by 12 per cent. In the following month it rose another 9 per cent, before levelling out briefly at 2500. As luck would have it, a further 9 per cent would bring the FT-SE within 30 points of the similarly tempting target of 3000. The parallels should not be pushed. In particular, the approach of the Gulf war knocked the market much harder than the approach of the election, so the bounce was correspondingly dramatic. But again, the defeat of Saddam Hussein left the market in many ways back where it started. This time it has the certainty of five more years of right-of-centre government, new-found popularity with the international investing community and the final evidence of an economic upturn. The scale of the upturn may still be doubtful. But judging by yesterday's crop of annual meetings, UK company chairmen are coming round. The start to 1992, Burmah Castrol said, had been 'very solid'. IMI saw increasing signs of the recession ending. Rugby reported profits ahead of budget. Around 20 FT-SE companies are due to produce results within the next stock exchange account. If they keep that up, the bears will have more to worry about again.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft makes more provisions Metallgesellschaft, the heavily-indebted German metals, mining and industrial group, is to provide DM1bn (Dollars 637.8m) to cover losses arising from its engagement with Castle Energy Corporation, a small North American oil refining company in which MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's New York-based trading subsidiary, has a minority stake. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of the Frankfurt-based group, said the provision would be covered by extraordinary profits realised through disinvestments, especially the DM1.2bn sale of the Buderus engineering group completed last month. However, the provision comes on top of the DM2.3bn losses run up by MG Corp through speculative trading in US oil derivatives, which drove Metallgesellschaft to the brink of bankruptcy earlier this year. The group also warned yesterday that losses for the 1994-95 financial year would probably be around the same level as for the year to September 30 1993, when it lost DM1.9bn. In the first six months of the year, the group incurred a loss of DM1.54bn compared with a profit of DM98.3m. Without MG Corp, the loss would have been DM61.3m, down from a deficit of DM88.6m in first half of 1992-93. Turnover for the six months to the end of March fell 3 per cent to DM12.26bn. The new provisions are the result of 76 individual contracts between MG Corp and Castle, in which MG Corp undertook to supply Castle with crude oil, to finance Castle's purchase of that oil, and thereafter buy the refined product at above-market prices until the year 2000. Metallgesellschaft is trying to renegotiate these contracts, which Mr Neukirchen recently described as 'incomprehensible'. The complicated relationship between Castle and MG Corp, which owns 40 per cent of the refinery, has only been unravelled in the past few months. Consequently, the scale of the potential losses from this quarter had not been quantified when bankers agreed to a DM3.4bn rescue package in January. The Castle problem helps explain why Mr Neukirchen decided to dispose of Buderus, one of the most profitable of the group's 650-plus subsidiaries, when earlier this year he said it would not be sold. It would probably take five years for Metallgesellschaft to recover fully, Mr Neukirchen said this week. He was speaking on his achievements in the first seven months as the group's chairman, and mapping out future strategy. he says the group will concentrate on four core areas: plant construction, trading, financial services and chemicals. This will mean that group turnover will, in the medium term, settle down to DM14bn a year - compared with DM26bn last year - and employees will number around 20,000, compared with 58,000 at the end of March last year. Metallgesellschaft will scale back its traditional metals activities and sell off its mining interests, concentrated in the 50.1 per cent-owned Toronto-based Metall Mining. The reduction in the group's size goes hand in hand with the sale of subsidiaries and rationalisation measures. Group debt is set to fall from DM9.4bn at the end of last year to DM5bn by the end of the 1994-95 financial year. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF PROPOSITION 13 FALLS, WHAT THEN?;  </P> <P> TAXATION: AS LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE MEASURE MOUNT, LEGISLATORS APPEAR  UNCERTAIN ON HOW TO PROCEED IF IT IS DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  </P> <P> With the property tax-cutting measure Proposition 13 facing more legal  challenges now than at any time in its 11-year history, legislators appear to  be far from certain how to proceed if it is ruled unconstitutional.  </P> <P> During a four-hour hearing Tuesday on the mounting legal challenges to the  landmark measure, members of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee agreed  that the proposition seems to be flawed. But they also agreed that no one has  an answer to the vexing problem of how to tax property equitably in California.  </P> <P> And no one, at least in the Legislature, is ready to talk about repealing it.  </P> <P> "There is simply not a constituency out there to change Proposition 13," said  Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), the committee chairman.  </P> <P> Klehs and other lawmakers believe the problem of coming up with a new property  tax system will be dumped in the lap of the Legislature if one of the current  legal challenges to Proposition 13 is successful.  </P> <P> Basically, the biggest flaw experts see in Proposition 13 is that residential  and commercial properties sitting side by side can be taxed at widely varying  rates, with newer property owners frequently paying a tax that is five times or  more the amount their neighbors are paying.  </P> <P> The problem stems from provisions of Proposition 13 that freeze the 1% property  tax assessments to the base year of 1975-76 unless property changes hands. Once  property is sold, it is reassessed and taxed on the basis of the new purchase  price.  </P> <P> Basis of Suits  </P> <P> One of the lawsuits was filed by a San Diego investment firm, Northwest  Financial Co., challenging a tax based on the $730,000 purchase price it paid  for a La Jolla home in 1987. The suit claims that Proposition 13 is  discriminatory because the tax is based on a value roughly four times higher  than the one assessed against the previous owners.  </P> <P> Another suit involves a Los Angeles County woman, Stephanie Nordlinger, who  bought a home in Baldwin Hills and says she is paying a tax five times more  than neighbors who own comparable property.  </P> <P> Still another suit was filed by R.H. Macy and Co., which claims it was put at a  competitive disadvantage when its stores in California were reassessed  following a change in corporate ownership. An attorney for the department store  chain told the committee that a Macy's store in Contra Costa County is paying a  property tax bill that is 250% higher than those paid by competing department  stores in the same Concord shopping mall.  </P> <P> On top of the legal challenges, there is a political challenge developing in  the form of a "split roll" property tax initiative that would boost the taxes  on business and commercial properties and provide some breaks for homeowners.  Petition signatures have been submitted to the secretary of state's office, but  the measure has not yet qualified for a place on next year's ballot. But the  consensus of the tax committee members and those who testified was that the  "split roll" initiative will do little to solve the equity problem.  </P> <P> Klehs said the ideal solution would be for owners of equally valued property to  pay the same tax so that the burden of financing government is spread evenly to  all taxpayers.  </P> <P> Because of political and legal problems, most experts agree that the solution  ultimately will have to be one that provides tax breaks to new homeowners  without raising the taxes of homeowners who haven't moved since 1975 -- roughly  40% of all taxpayers, according to a Board of Equalization estimate.  </P> <P> Lenny Goldberg, a spokesman for the California Tax Reform Assn., suggested a 1%  or 2% transfer tax on long-term property owners when they ultimately sell their  property. He said the transfer tax would be something akin to "a deferred  property tax."  </P> <P> That proposal was immediately challenged by Ernest Dynda, president of the  United Organizations of Taxpayers Inc., the original sponsor of Proposition 13.  He said that would hurt elderly homeowners who count on the value of their  homes for retirement income.  </P> <P> Ralph Abascal, an attorney for the California Rural Legal Assistance Fund,  suggested a property tax based on the income of the taxpayer, rather than the  value of the home or business.  </P> <P> Assembly Majority Leader Thomas M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) criticized the  proposal, saying it would centralize taxing authority in Sacramento and  "ignores the issue of local control." Hannigan has drafted a proposed  constitutional amendment that would require property to be reassessed  periodically, such as once every three years. This would boost the taxes of  longtime homeowners who now don't face a reassessment unless they buy a new  home. But Hannigan conceded it had little chance of passage, saying he  "introduced it in part to create some discussion" among lawmakers.  </P></p>

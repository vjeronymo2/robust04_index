			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ALBANIA OKS ELECTION REFORM  </P> <P> Albania's Communist parliament passed an election law allowing secret ballots  and a choice of candidates and ordered a sweeping revision of the constitution,  the official ATA news agency said today.  </P> <P> It said both issues were approved unanimously at a meeting of the People's  Assembly in the capital, Tirana, on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The decisions mark a further step on a cautious road to reform in Albania,  Europe's last orthodox Communist state. They were adopted a week before a  summit meeting in Paris of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE), at which Tirana is bidding for full membership.  </P> <P> The new election law, aimed at elections to the People's Assembly next  February, stops short of legalizing opposition political parties.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS MAN CLAIMS $10.2-MILLION LOTTERY PRIZE  </P> <P> After waiting eight days, a 69-year-old Encinitas resident finally cashed a  Lotto ticket worth $10.24 million Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Russell Roy Thyret had purchased five Quick-Pick tickets at the Alpha Beta  supermarket on El Camino Real in Encinitas. As a jackpot bonus, the store  stands to earn $51,200, or 0.5% of Thyret's prize, lottery spokeswoman Joanne  McNabb said.  </P> <P> After deducting federal taxes, Thyret will receive $409,600 annually for 20  years. His winning numbers were 44-14-23-27-21-12.  </P> <P> Lottery officials had originally estimated Thyret's ticket as worth $9.9  million but later realized that it was worth $10.24 million, McNabb said.  </P> <P> Thyret's winnings were the second biggest of the month. On Dec. 13, a Santa Ana  resident won $10.34 million. Both prizes, however, are a fraction of the  state's biggest prize, a pot worth $62 million won Oct. 29, 1988.  </P> <P> Winners occasionally wait and get financial advice before turning in their  tickets, or sometimes they simply don't notice that they've won, McNabb said.  In any case, a winner has up to 180 days to cash a ticket.  </P> <P> Thyret, a 5-foot-11 man who enjoys plying the waters in his 51-foot boat,  consulted with his bookkeeper and lawyer before claiming his prize. He said  that he wanted "to keep publicity to a minimum."  </P> <P> Fifty-three San Diego County residents have become millionaires through the  lottery, with total winnings of $208 million, McNabb said.

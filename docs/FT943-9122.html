			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pernod Ricard sales show fall Pernod Ricard, the French drinks group, said first-half consolidated revenues totalled FFr7.51bn (Dollars 1.39bn) in 1994, down 3.6 per cent from FFr7.79bn last year, Reuter reports from Paris. Pernod noted that first-half 1993 sales were inflated by anticipatory purchases ahead of a rise in alcohol taxes which took effect during July 1993. Strong foreign and non-alcoholic drink sales this year largely offset this effect.</p>

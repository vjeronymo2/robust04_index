			<p>BFN     [Text] Upon ending his official visit to the country,  Bertrand Dufourcq, French vice foreign minister [title as  published], said last night that relations and the financial,  scientific, and cultural cooperation with Bolivia are positive  and on the right path.    Within that framework, Dufourcq said that agreements and  protocols for financial aid in various fields were also signed.    Dufourcq said that his country "would be very pleased to  support the Bolivian request to negotiate its foreign debt  before the Paris Club," as France presides over this financial  organization.    He also noted that annual French aid to Bolivia amounts to  approximately $30 million, in addition to indirect help in the  form of the $8 million France contributes to the European Union  for aid.    Dufourcq indicated that Bolivian officials asked for greater  French aid in some sectors, and specifically in the civil  service program for training state employees.    Regarding the financial protocols, the agreement that was  signed involves 45 million French francs for the Cochabamba  water system.    France will also support the construction of a cable railway  from La Paz to El Alto, and will donate 5 million francs for an  aeronautics plan. In addition $50,000 will be appropriated for  the purchase of medicine to fight leishmaniasis.    Dufourcq also said: "France is willing to negotiate new  agreements with Bolivia."    Dufourcq also signed two agreements with the Bolivian  Government. One is a cooperation agreement with the National  Police, which will receive technical equipment and a computer  system. The other agreement refers to the cultural and  scientific area, by which French experts and scientists will  provide their know-how for the development of Bolivia.</p>

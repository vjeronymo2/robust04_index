			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Travel: The river roads of the rainforest - Boats are best when exploring parts of Malaysia THE ANCIENT outboard motor revved loudly, thrashing at the surface of the turbulent water so that the long boat quickly lost way against the immutable force of the current. With great calm the steersman brought the stern almost against the steep bank where the water was dark and deep and the vegetation hung over the channel. Ducking to avoid thick leaves and branches, he dipped the propeller into the river and turned on the power. Once more we surged forward over a shoal of stones and into the deeper pool above. Another obstacle had been overcome and we powered up the River Tembeling through the soaring trees of the Malaysian rainforest. The Tembeling is the main route into Malaysia's largest national park, Taman Nagara, which means, simply, national park. Covering an area of 4,343 square kilometres of virgin rainforest 130m years old, the park is largely inaccessible except via rivers. The journey upstream from Kuala Tembeling to the park headquarters and the new Taman Nagara Resort at Kuala Tahan takes about three hours depending on the water level. The long boats thrust powerfully upstream past small riverside settlements perched on the bank-tops high above the normal river level, for in the monsoon the river can rise by more than 70 metres, as the line on the wall at the park headquarters testifies. I saw a graphic illustration of this rise and fall along one of the Tembeling's tributaries leading deep into the park. Jammed high above in the branches of a tree was a trunk probably 10m long and 1m across. Taman Nagara Resort is incongruous in the remote and wild context of virgin rainforest. Its rooms, in individual and traditional Malay buildings, are comfortable, but the city hotel-style restaurant, 24-hour reception and banqueting hall are incompatible with a jungle setting. I ate, instead, in the fairy-lit cafes set up on the river beach opposite, whistling for a boat to carry me across the black swirling waters and stumbling up the stony beach in the dark. One night I joined a group of forest guides and national park staff for a celebratory meal, clumsily balling rice with delicious pieces of river fish and spicy chicken direct from hand to mouth. From the park headquarters a variety of trails led into the forest. Some are short with numbered points of interest, others are longer and take you to viewpoints or mineral licks. One of them is the route to the highest mountain on peninsular Malaysia, a seven-day trek. I chose a short route as a taster and plunged into the trees along a damp, narrow path. The noise took me completely by surprise - a loud, endlessly repetitive backing of hums, buzzes, whines, drones and purrs enlivened, now and then, by rising and falling bells and whoops. It went on constantly, night and day, a cacophony of insects, frogs, occasional birds and even gibbons. Somehow this barrage of sound, together with the occasional leech looping rapidly across the leaves of the forest floor at the slightest sniff of a meal, produced an atmosphere of malevolence. The problem with the rainforest is that the action is many floors up in the penthouse while you are stuck in the dank basement. It is only along the corridors cut by the rivers and in clearings such as those carved out for villages and the park headquarters that wildlife becomes apparent. Early one morning I fruitlessly searched the grounds of the new resort for some of the 20 bird species which the leaflet told me could commonly be seen there. I spotted just two, although one was the glorious southern pied hornbill, its beak adorned with a huge creamy casque. There were also long-tailed macaque monkeys, raiding the builders' houses for food, and several species of squirrel. I spent one night in a hide overlooking a mineral lick. Here half-a-dozen of us kept vigil armed with powerful torches to flick on at the slightest sound of a visitor. We were alerted by a noise like munching cornflakes, and there in the spotlight was a bi-coloured animal, black at front and back with a broad white belt around its middle, a tapir. Its early arrival promised well for the rest of the night but it was a promise not to be fulfilled. Although the tapir came and went several times, nothing else turned up. An alternative is to visit the animals themselves, so the next day we crawled through a grubby cave in search of bats. There were two species, a large fruit-eating bat and a much smaller insectivorous horseshoe bat. Both were hanging in great numbers from the grey ceiling and festooning the rocky walls. This was no place for the phobic. Along with the bats, a large toad sat darkly in the stream below while a white cave racer with a brilliant red tongue, a bat-eating snake, slid silently around the walls, insinuating its body into cracks and slithering from crevice to crevice. The Malaysian jungle is home to one of the three species of great ape, the orang-utan, though I had to fly to the orang-utan rehabilitation centre at Sepilok, in the state of Sabah, to see these. Here young orangs, orphaned as infants or taken from the wild as pets, are re-introduced to life in the rainforest. A number of learning stages sees them wise enough to live freely in the forest, returning to a feeding area for supplementary rations of bananas and milk, a diet which is supposed to encourage them to forage for more interesting food out of sheer boredom. Even when there are no primates to be seen, Sepilok offers an ideal opportunity to appreciate the beauty and majesty of the rainforest.

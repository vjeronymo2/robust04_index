			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Zaldygin, Dmitriy Likhachev and Aleksandr </F> Yanshin, academicians of the Russian Academy of Science:  ``Environment of Extinction'']    [Text] Adam Smith once declared nature to be one of the  three essential components of production (nature, labor and  capital). All Marxism-Leninism did was make that thesis the  basis of its economy and policy and introduce it into the  day-to-day life of an actual society.    On the basis of this fundamental thesis nature became  nothing  more than a resource and a raw material that needed to be  processed in order for it to have any purpose. It was necessary  to improve it, reshape it and transform it as required by the  projects that were to build communism (e.g. the ``Great  Stalinist Plan for the Transformation of Nature'').    As if nature could create a being much wiser than nature  itself!    But here in the late 20th century humanity is turning its  attention to ecology. We are beginning to realize that we must  not elevate human beings above nature and not remove them from  it, but, insofar as is still possible, make them a part of  nature, and we also realize that human beings' needs are  infinite, while natural resources are finite.  <H5>  The Ministry of Ecotourism </H5>   The state structures of all countries now have ecological  services --assessment agencies, departments and committees.  Predictably, here in Russia we have the biggest of them all: a  ministry. In terms of its staff size that ministry is also at  the top, with 630 people, almost twice as many as previously  worked for a USSR ministry serving all 15 republics.    The parliament has officially adopted a ``Law on  Environmental Protection.'' But can that be considered  satisfactory, when the 1993 federal budget (though it has not  yet received final approval) does not even contain a separate  heading for environmental protection?    What about the fact that this law still is unaccompanied by  various sublegal acts like a definition of environmental  disaster areas and a statute on state environmental assessment,  on monitoring of and compensation for damages to the natural  environment, on economic indicators governing environmental  protection activity, and on incentive measures? Environmental  protection officials at the local level claim they are more  likely to spend time overcoming bureaucratic obstacles in the  ministry's 22 departments than they are to receive assistance  and support from them.    In the United States 85 percent of all projects with an  impact on the natural environment end up in court. That is  understandable: even if a person cuts down his own forest he can  cause damage to air quality far beyond the boundaries of his own  property. Our Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources has not filed a single serious case against those  responsible for many truly state-originated disasters. It seems  that the ministry's favorite hobby is ``international  relations'' -- i.e. innumerable symposiums, roundtable  discussions and ``joint projects.'' What about the regions? They  are completely uninteresting -- they have no round tables and no  luncheon meetings!    One example of this sort of ``ecotourism'' was the World  Environmental Conference held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Russia  sent a group of 150 people to Rio, including a group of  ministerial employees and the minister himself. What were the  results? Where are they to be found? In what materials? There  was apparently no room for those materials in our tourists'  suitcases, nor could they stand the test of meetings, attending  them on something of a rotating basis.    A few words about our public environmental movement. It is  fading away. Once the movement was in a position to become a  source of support for activities by the Ministry of  Environmental Protection and the government. But it did not -- a  missed opportunity. There have been many missed opportunities.  Just recall the idea of establishing an Ecological Fund. The  time is past when the public could force the government to  withdraw its plan to divert Siberian rivers' flow into the  Caspian Sea, when the people of Volgograd were able to stop the  construction of a second Volga-Don Canal, and when Leningraders,  though not always successfully, at least energetically protested  the construction of a dike across Neva Bay.    Another woe: public and scientific ecology are degenerating  into semi-legal private companies. One example: the Ecology and  Peace Association has among its members a company called the  Center for Urban Ecological Studies, which could be called ``N.  P. Yurina and Co.'' It makes dubious deals with Europe's  ``Ecological Building Blocks Initiative.''  <H5>  Ecology: The Science of Stabilization </H5>   Up until now science has worked for progress, and only  ecology makes stabilization its goal.    Science is undergoing a difficult time, a dramatically  difficult time. Under the conditions that exist today scientists  are out of the loop on environmental issues -- doing nothing and  achieving nothing. During this ``time out of balance'' others  are making their careers and reestablishing the positions they  lost during the period when projects like the diversion of  Siberian Rivers into the Caspian Sea, diversion of the Ob River  into the Aral Sea, of the Volga into the Ural and Stavropol  regions, the second Volga-Don Canal and many, many more were  under development. One should not think that all these thoughts  of ``diversion'' and huge projects have disappeared from the  minds of those who came up with them and implemented them. Those  same minds intend to maintain the state's monopoly over major  construction, and if that is the case then both canals and water  diversion projects will be back in the state's budget.    Even now we have before us the findings of certain experts  claiming that the second Volga-Don Canal is essential, as it  will divert a portion of the Volga's flow into the Don River and  thereby help lower the level of the Caspian Sea.    But the second Volga-Don Canal's annual capacity is three  cubic kilometers. That would lower the level of the Caspian Sea  by only three millimeters, while the sea's level is rising by 10  centimeters or more each year. Who stands to benefit from the  canal: the Caspian Sea or the canal builders? At stake are  trillions of rubles, so would it not be more reasonable to  invest that money directly in agriculture instead of in the  construction of irrigation canals?    The primary goal of the ``diversionists'' is to revive the  great construction projects. Well-known engineer P. Polad-zade,  former head of the former Ministry of Water Resources, is  currently selling shares in the remains of that monster, the  Vodstroy Concern -- the ministry's offspring, but an odd one,  with authorized capital of R32.4 million. That is the price of  one or two pieces of earthmoving equipment, even though the  concern owns hundreds if not thousands of pieces of such  equipment. This is who desperately needs a second Volga-Don  Canal!    G. Voropayev, a corresponding member of the Academy of  Sciences and one of the most active proponents of the idea of  adding water to the Caspian Sea using northern rivers, is  currently head of a council whose task is... to combat the  flooding of coastal areas along the Caspian Sea, the level of  which even without river diversion is already rising year after  year. Yet many scientists had predicted that rise in sea level  and warned Voropayev about it.    Voropayev's council -- comprised of more than 30 people --  is  successfully snaring millions of Russian rubles and selling  information on the Caspian Sea to Iran for a pittance, with no  other fruits of its efforts to be seen. Nor has the position of  the ``diversionists'' on solving the problem changed: as before  the focus is on water management, not on broader socioeconomic  principles.    The Russian Academy of Sciences Presidium twice sustained a  motion of no confidence in Voropayev's nomination when he was  appointed head of the current Caspian Council, yet the bureau of  the Division of Oceanology, Atmospheric Physics and Geography  (Academician V. Zuyev) stuck by its guns: the man who saved the  Caspian Sea from ``drying up'' a few years ago would now save  the land that the same sea is inundating!    An equally strange situation is emerging in connection with  the plan for a hydroelectric power station on the Katun River. A  dubious project. Over a period of many years the project was  never proven to be justified, but now there is only one  consideration: Gornyy Altay has become a component of the  Federation. That is all that is needed to proclaim: on with the  construction! There is no money, the region's geology and  geochemistry are cause for concern, the republic's economy does  not justify the project, but still we are going ahead with it!  Next door in Barnaul is the Institute of Ecological and Aquatic  Problems (corresponding member O. Vasilyev). That is who should  have the final word, but the institute's scientists are hedging:  they are afraid to say ``no,'' but it is also dangerous to say  ``yes.'' So many people are happy saying both ``no'' and  ``yes'': some money is being allocated toward this unresolved  issue, but only a little.  <H5>  Pressure From the Nuclear Industry </H5>   On 24 December of last year the government decided to build  a  number of new nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation.  The decision was made unexpectedly, without the prior knowledge  of the scientific community. Ministry of Atomic Energy officials  were well aware, as were their predecessors in the USSR Ministry  of Medium Machine Building, that any open discussion of projects  would elicit many justified objections.    The Ministry of Atomic Energy needs these plants, that is  clear. But does the country need them, a country whose industry  is declining with each passing year and consuming less and less  energy?    The majority of our nuclear power plants have reactors of  the  same type that are at Chernobyl, and the International Atomic  Energy Agency considers them dangerous. IZVESTIYA has repeatedly  reported on the dangerously dilapidated condition of the  Leningrad Atomic Electric Power Station.    Those in the nuclear industry say that we must not lag  behind  France, which gets more than half of its energy from nuclear  power. Yet they forget to mention that in France all nuclear  power plants are located at a distance of at least 15 kilometers  from population centers and are equipped with less dangerous  reactors. They also forget to add that France has a powerful  nuclear waste processing industry, while we store such waste on  the surface (on the Kola Peninsula) or only lightly covered with  earth, as at Sergiyev Posad near Moscow. Plus we have  radioactive wastes both of our own origin and from abroad --  from nuclear power plants that we have built in other countries.  Such were the terms of the contracts under which they were built.    Radiation from underground nuclear weapons testing at sites  near Semipalatinsk, and to a lesser degree on Novaya Zemlya,  covers extensive areas of the former Altay Kray, Novosibirsk  Oblast, the northern Komi Republic, the Arctic Urals and the  West Siberian coastline. Do not let them tell you that the  radiation is slight, harmless and not in excess of permissible  standards. Those ``standards'' are very provisional and have  repeatedly been revised. And Chernobyl showed us that the  residents of similar ``favorable'' areas in terms of their  degree of radioactivity have become very ill and died agonizing  deaths from cancer of the thyroid gland, liver and blood.    Yet Russia possesses tremendous reserves of natural gas,  primarily in Tyumen Oblast. The portion of those reserves that  has been explored and is ready for use totals tens of billions  of cubic meters, with projected reserves of tens of trillions of  cubic meters. That does not include fields that are beginning to  be discovered on the floor of the Barents and Karsk seas, as  well as along both coasts of Sakhalin.    We produce approximately one billion cubic meters of natural  gas annually, and that is the one industrial sector where there  has been no drop in production. That means we have enough  natural gas to last for at least 300 years. By that time  dangerous nuclear fission energy will have given way to safe  nuclear fusion energy. According to assurances from American  physicists, that will occur in the first decade of the 21st  century.    Why are we about to build many dangerous nuclear power  plants  that will soon be outdated yet conserve our natural gas, the  burning of which would produce energy that is environmentally  clean and much cheaper? Or are we saving that natural gas so we  can sell it at a low price to our foreign partners and buy from  them at high prices capron, nylon and porolon clothing made from  that same natural gas? That might be to someone's benefit, but  it does not benefit the state.    Sweden does not have any coal, oil or natural gas fields.  Nevertheless, after Chernobyl the Swedish Riksdag decided not to  build a single new nuclear power plant and to shift all the  country's further power development to heat and electric power  generating stations using imported natural gas from seafloor  deposits.  <H5>  The Nature Giveaway </H5>   In 1917 Russia, or a substantial portion thereof, came to  believe that its greatest wealth in the world -- factories,  plants, railroads, lands with their forests and mineral wealth,  and rivers -- should be forcibly expropriated from their private  owners, including the Romanov dynasty, and become truly the  people's property. That was precisely how Soviet slogans and  decrees framed the issue. And what happened? What happened was  that all that wealth wound up in the hands of the party elite,  which not only had complete control of the country's entire  natural environment, but also arbitrarily experimented with  nature, plundered it and crippled it with gigantic construction  projects.    In our country privatization is like a giveaway. It would  seem that a giveaway is not acquisition, so the matter should be  much simpler. In fact, it is much more complex than a direct  requisition of the socialist type. Why is that so? Because both  those who are doing the giving (the state apparatus, the state  bureaucracy) and those who are receiving (the ``new  capitalists'') have virtually the same opportunities for  personal enrichment. Neither group wants to miss those  opportunities. Neither group currently has the slightest  interest in ecology or any concern over how to preserve forests,  soils, mineral resources, rivers and a clean atmosphere. All  current programs in this regard are not worth the paper they are  printed on, if only because they are in no way connected with  the theoretical principles, much less the practical application,  of privatization. That practical application, in turn, should be  based on new principles of ownership, from which it would be  clear who would have the right to possess what, in what amount  and on what terms. Until we establish those principles of  ownership there can be no civilized privatization, nor any point  in discussing ecology -- it will just be pushed aside.    An oblast boss calls a rayon boss:    ``Petr Ivanovich! Sell this guy a piece of land! With a  little garden plot! Do it!''    That is all that has to be said. The ``guy'' is not just  anybody, he is a restaurant owner!    And so Russia's forests, minerals resources and water are  being exploited (and plundered and polluted) at an  unprecedentedly frenzied rate.    It is impossible to say where privatization will lead under  the current system (i.e. disorder and chaos). Politics without  well-founded projection is nothing more than adventurism. And so  the richest country in the world is going around the world with  its hand outstretched.  <H5>  Not Under Public Scrutiny </H5>   The problem is also with our level of ecological awareness.  Each of us could make various suggestions to the government. For  example, we feel that state authority today requires three  police forces: civil police, tax police and  sanitary-environmental police. But that is just one small  detail. The awareness of every citizen of the Federation is  another matter. It is clear that police forces, even a dozen of  them, cannot fix this situation if citizens today are  indifferent to the task of preserving their greatest wealth --  nature -- and if each of us does not feel ourselves in at least  some way the owner of that wealth and thus obligated to pass it  on to our children and grandchildren.    There is still time to think and realize. Not much, just a  short time, but there is still time.    The reader has probably noticed that articles on  environmental issues have become a rarity in our newspapers. Not  one of our large-circulation publications has launched even a  weekly or monthly environmental column. We can say with  certainty that if our scientific community and our culture  ignore the problems of ecology the cause is doomed to failure.</p>

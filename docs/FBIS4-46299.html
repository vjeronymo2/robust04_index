			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that  Turkey continues to carry out a slanderous campaign against  Greece and to bring unfounded charges by invoking events which  are obviously contrary to the reality. The spokesman made the  above statement when he was asked about the government's comment  regarding the confession of the Kurdish fighter who was tortured  by Turkish authorities to say that he had been trained at a camp  for terrorists in Greece. Once again Venizelos underlined that  our country will not contribute to the effort to cultivate false  tension. We call on Turkey, the spokesman said, to stop  implicating Greece in its internal problems. The Greek state  authority, Venizelos stressed, controls the whole of its  territory which is open and accessible to everyone, especially  to journalists. Finally, the government spokesman expressed the  government's regret for the confirmation of brutal violation of  human rights, such as in the case of detained persons subjected  to torture to sign forged confessions.</p>

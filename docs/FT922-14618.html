			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Ministers back some elements of open energy market A SMALL majority of EC energy ministers has supported elements of draft European Commission laws to liberalise the energy market. During their first discussion of the plans at the weekend, ministers backed proposals to end monopoly rights over electricity production and the construction of energy networks. However, formal ministerial discussions of the directives next month are still likely to stall on the controversial core element of the Commission's liberalisation package, which would give energy users greater access to gas and electricity networks. The majority of ministers at Saturday's informal meeting - led by the French and Dutch representatives - expressed reservations about these proposals, known as third party access. 'We're convinced that third party access would very seriously compromise the strengths of the present system, which guarantees investment, security of supply and equal treatment of consumers,' said a senior French energy official. Continued opposition from big member states could push back the Commission's ambitious deadline of the beginning of next year for implementing the gas and electricity directives. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, said on Saturday he still hoped discussions would be completed this year. He was pleasantly surprised at most ministers' tentative support for an end to exclusive rights and for the 'unbundling' of integrated energy companies' accounts, which would improve cost and price transparency. Most member states were unenthusiastic about the whole package during earlier technical discussions in Brussels. 'Today there was much greater openness to look for the positive elements which could be accepted,' said one official from the UK, the Commission's strongest supporter on energy liberalisation.</p>

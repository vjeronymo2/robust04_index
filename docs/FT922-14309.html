			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Central London bomb attack condemned CENTRAL London was again the target of a bomb yesterday, as it emerged that an incoming government may be asked to move responsibility for counter-terrorism from the police to MI5, the security service. The device, left outside an apartment block in Bridle Lane, Soho, in the West End, exploded at about 9.15am. There were no casualties. Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said the device contained less than 1lb of high explosive, and was typical of those used by the IRA. He said the attack was an 'act of sheer recklessness'. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. The blast occurred 150 metres from the London offices of Granada Television, the independent broadcaster, which was due yesterday to screen interviews with leaders of the main political parties. Police said the distance of the bomb from Granada, and from a police training academy in a neighbouring street, made it unlikely that either was the target. The Home Office yesterday refused to comment on a report that it was about to submit a report on counter-terrorism to Downing Street. However, sources close to the security services confirmed that the MI5 proposal had been under discussion, but faced resistance from some quarters, particularly Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch. It is understood that MI5, under Ms Stella Rimington, its newly appointed director, is keen to reallocate the responsibilities of some employees no longer engaged in counter-espionage. The option being considered is to increase MI5's present involvement in intelligence-gathering on IRA suspects. The police argue, though, that MI5 lacks the necessary expertise.</p>

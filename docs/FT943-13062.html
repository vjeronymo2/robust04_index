			<p>940721 FT  21 JUL 94 / Renewable energy 'has promise' Renewable energy forms 'offer a very long-term promise for a permanent solution' to energy problems, the World Energy Council says today. Renewables, which include solar, wind and wave power, must take account of all environmental impacts, and avoid unsound technology and economics, the group says. It estimates that renewables will account for about 4 per cent of world energy by 2020 if present policies are pursued. But if more ecological policies were adopted, renewables could contribute 12 per cent by the same date.</p>

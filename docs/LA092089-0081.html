			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A House panel voted in Washington to designate another 378,000 acres of  California's Los Padres National Forest as wilderness, which would roughly  double the amount of land in the forest to be preserved in its natural state.  The voice vote by the Interior subcommittee on parks and public lands would  also protect portions of three rivers -- the Sespe, Sisquoc and Big Sur -- from  construction of dams or other permanent structures.  </P></p>

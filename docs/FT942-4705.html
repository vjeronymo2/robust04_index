			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Tribune publisher buys farm magazine The Tribune Company, the Chicago-based newspaper publisher and entertainment concern, has purchased North America's largest farm publication, The Farm Journal. Terms were not disclosed. The acquisition is expected to enhance the Tribune's farm radio broadcast network and provide programming for its on-line computer information services. The Farm Journal is privately held. It comes out 13 times a year, and has 175 full-time workers, including 45 reporters and editors. Circulation is around 700,000, taking in publications such as Top Producer, Beef Today and Hogs Today. The company also maintains a detailed database of demographic information on farm operations, and owns a market research firm specialising in agricultural topics. The Tribune, which publishes Chicago's leading newspaper, has a reputation as an urban news organisation. However, its vast radio network reaches deep into midwest farm communities. 'Farm Journal and Tribune share a commitment to serving the agricultural community, and a vision for developing new products and services for farmers and advertisers,' said Mr James Dowdle, president of Tribune Broadcasting company. 'Our combined resources offer a strong base to explore new opportunities in electronic publishing, television programming, database and other advertiser services, additional print titles and, of course, radio,' Mr Dowdle said.</p>

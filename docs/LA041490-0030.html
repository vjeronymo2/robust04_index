			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANITARIUM REFORM  </P> <P> The newly released Dudley Moore movie "Crazy People" lampoons the very serious  subject of mental health and the patients in mental health facilities.  </P> <P> Funny? Is it funny when 20-year-olds break down in drug-induced psychosis? Or  when no one ever comes to visit them? Or when someone such as myself, whose  only "crime" is to have a trashy home and too many pet cats, is put inside the  "bin" and exposed to violent, screaming patients?  </P> <P> The horror is still in existence, no matter the claims that the "cuckoo's nest"  has been improved. I would suggest a boycott of "Crazy People" if the situation  in mental hospitals isn't changed.  </P> <P> E. JOHNSON, Glendora  </P> <P>  Johnson, the subject of a column by Doug Smith in the Times Glendale section,  was temporarily committed for observation after authorities sealed his home as  a health hazard created by the cats and other unsanitary conditions.  </P> <P> </P></p>

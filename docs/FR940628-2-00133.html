Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Impact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A grant under this program is categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in accordance with 24 CFR part 50.20(p). However, prior to an award of grant funds, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism Impact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government and, therefore, the provisions of this notice do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The notice implements a program that encourages HAs to develop a plan for addressing the problem of drug-related crime, and makes available grants to HAs to help them carry out their plans. As such, the program would help HAs combat serious drug-related crime problems in their developments, thereby strengthening their role as instrumentalities of the States. In addition, further review under the Order is unnecessary, since the notice generally tracks the statute and involves little implementing discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Family Impact.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> the Family <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , has determined that the provisions of this grant have the potential for a positive, although indirect, impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. As such, this grant is intended to improve the quality of life of public and Indian housing development residents, including families, by reducing the incidence of drug-related crime.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Section 102 HUD Reform Act_Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentation and public access.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied.

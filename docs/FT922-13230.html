			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Safe pair of hands could have a grip - The odds are favourable for the shadow chancellor in Labour's leadership stakes UNLESS Mr Bryan Gould has a last-minute change of mind, the Labour leadership contest that begins in earnest today will centre on whether the shadow environment spokesman can resist the juggernaut now rolling for Mr John Smith. The odds are heavily stacked against him. The case for the shadow chancellor lies heavily with his national popularity, his natural gravitas (a sharp contrast to Mr Neil Kinnock) and the widely held perception that he is, to coin a cliche, a 'safe pair of hands'. Furthermore, as one trade unionist put it: 'John has always been seen as the obvious successor of proven weight. Why would we risk it all now for some sort of gamble?' That view is common in the union movement where Mr Smith has more than momentum on his side. He already commands the broad support of two of the three union giants - the GMB and the soon-to-merge engineers and electricians. He may not have to wait long to get the final card in this three card trick  -the mighty TGWU general workers union. All these unions would have to ballot their members, but there is little likelihood that the rank and file would disagree with their leaderships. In consequence, when an electoral college is gathered, many smaller unions would fall in behind the giants, delivering the bulk of the unions' 40 per cent share of the college to his campaign. With Mr Robin Cook and Mr Gordon Brown, respectively the health and the trade and industry spokesmen, now believed unlikely to run, the Scottish party - nearly a fifth of Labour's total representation at Westminster - would also follow en masse. Scots' solidarity is deemed essential. Without it there are real dangers of schism between those now seeking an alliance with the Scottish Nationalists and the 'Unionists', opposed to any such collaboration in spite of the election outcome's dashing of the dream of a Scottish parliament. Mr Smith can also expect the support of the great majority of the shadow cabinet, who know on which side their bread is buttered, and large swathes of the more traditional Labour activists in the constituency parties. Popular in the country and in the the Commons - one hard left MP commented recently: 'John has no real enemies' - Mr Smith's election looks a fait accompli. So why is Mr Gould almost certain to stand? The answer lies in the lingering doubts. Supporters of the New Zealand-born challenger believe that their man has an added ingredient that the shadow chancellor's somewhat old-fashioned, redistributionist style of Labourism lacks. They argue that even had Mr Smith led this year's electoral assault on the Tory hegemony, he could not have won. And they add that only Mr Gould has the broader vision - perhaps, in part, due to his Antipodean roots - that could further develop the Kinnockite reforms to create a progressive 'crusade' that would generate enthusiasm well beyond Labour's working-class base. Try to pin Mr Gould down on the details of this vision and a certain vagueness descends. In a BBC interview yesterday, the shadow environment secretary was scrupulous in his praise for Mr Kinnock's campaign. His critique centred, however, on the party's failure to do much more than eliminate negative policies and past mistakes and its concentration almost solely on issues rather than inspiring the voters' imagination. When it comes to specific policy issues, Mr Gould's differences with Mr Smith are often a matter of tone. Unlike his rival - whose views are undeclared  - Mr Gould is a known critic of proportional representation. Today, he claims he is open to influence by the findings of Labour's Plant committee into electoral reforms, on which he sits. More strongly diverging from Mr Smith, he is a Euro-sceptic and an advocate of at least a debate on sterling's positioning in the exchange rate mechanism - a clear signal that he favours devaluing. All these positions will carry considerable weight with the hard left in the Campaign group, which will put up a merely symbolic candidate - Mr Ken Livingstone or Mr Dennis Skinner are being mooted. But Mr Gould is also something that the old left despises - a bit of a yuppie. His meteoric rise in the aftermath of the 1983 election debacle was halted after 1987 by what was widely thought to be a devilish alliance between Kinnockite insiders, jealous of his growing influence, and the champions of old-fashioned Clause Four socialism. A whispering campaign then poured scorn on his argument that Labour should 'leapfrog' Thatcherism with a radical agenda including such ideas as promoting employee share-ownership schemes as a modern means of enhancing workers' influence on corporate decision-making. He is keen that Labour's close links with the unions, not least in their voting strength at conference, be reduced rapidly. Other arguments for Mr Gould are negative ones. Mr Smith, say his opponents, is already a familiar face and could look stale by the time of the next election. Furthermore, he has had a heart attack - is he up to the strain of the leadership? Mr Smith's supporters reply with a list of the Scots peaks he has climbed. For Mr Gould, his best, perhaps his only, hope of upsetting the Smith bandwagon is to have time to put his case and to go out and take it to the party around the country. For that reason, his camp will fight any effort to bring forward the finale of the contest before the Blackpool conference in October. But on this they may already be too late. If Mr Kinnock today argues that the hand-over should be as soon as possible, Labour's national executive committee could order the process to be completed by June. 'Bryan's problem is that he has a very complex message to sell,' said one of his admirers. 'The election is not a left-right battle, it is much more blurred. For that reason, Smith looks like a shoo-in.'</p>

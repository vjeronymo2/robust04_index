			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Opticians win VAT ruling PART OF the price of spectacles is to be exempt from value added tax. Customs and Excise said that it had been defeated at a VAT tribunal in a case brought against it by Leightons Opticians. Opticians would now be allowed to apportion supplies between VAT-rated and exempt services. Customs intends to fight the tribunal decision. Opticians have argued that some of the price paid for spectacles is for professional medical services.</p>

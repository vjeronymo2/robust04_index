			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY MAY SUE TO RECOUP LOSSES FROM TROUBLED AIR SHOW ORGANIZATION  </P> <P> The city of San Diego will demand that Air/Space America re-pay about $250,000  in debts from the 1988 aerial extravaganza at Brown Field and will file suit  against the financially ailing organization if necessary, the City Council  decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> Conceding that there is little chance of ever recouping $100,000 in rent and an  estimated $150,000 spent on repairs to Brown Field after the 1988 show, the San  Diego City Council nevertheless voted unanimously in closed session to pursue  the debts.  </P> <P> "We assume that they don't have any money, but if they did, or if they are  resuscitated in some form, we want to be on line," said Councilman Bob Filner,  the council's most frequent critic of the air show's organizers.  </P> <P> Plans for a second air show -- scheduled to begin two days from today --  collapsed April 18 when Air/Space America announced its cancellation because of  financial and planning problems.  </P> <P> The show's collapse threatened to initiate a new wave of lawsuits by companies  that had contracted to perform services for Air/Space America. Nearly a dozen  lawsuits were filed by unpaid creditors after the close of the debt-ridden 1988  extravaganza.  </P> <P> Air/Space America founder Bob Wilson, a former Republican congressman from San  Diego, blamed the "city of San Diego bureaucracy" for thwarting a last-ditch  attempt to find financing for the 1990 show.  </P> <P> City officials, who spent more than $186,000 promoting the 1990 Air/Space  America show -- money that the city will not attempt to recoup -- called  Wilson's allegations a "smoke screen" meant to disguise the lack of financial  backing.  </P> <P> The popular inaugural show two years ago left Air/Space America saddled with a  $2.7-million debt. The city also filed suit and won a judgment for $30,033.78,  though the debt has not been paid.  </P> <P> Three Air/Space America creditors have sued the city, seeking repayment of more  than $1 million collectively in debts from the 1988 show, said Deputy City  Attorney Deborah Hollingsworth. The first lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial  in August. The city contends that it had an agreement with Air/Space America  absolving it from responsibility for such claims, she said.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Air/Space officials did not respond to a message left on a telephone  answering machine at their headquarters. But in the past two weeks, the  organization has attempted to contact 170 exhibitors who paid up-front fees to  display their wares at the planned 10-day trade show. Organizers had said that  the show would attract thousands of potential buyers from around the world.  </P> <P> "We're probably out $80 grand," acknowledged Howard Ruggles, San Diego district  manager for Hughes Aircraft, one of seven companies that in 1988 paid $100,000  to become a founder of Air/Space America.  </P> <P> Founders used up $20,000 of their initial payment for booth space at the  premier show in 1988, and expected to use $20,000 at each of the biennial shows  that Air/Space America had hoped to host during the next decade. Ruggles last  week said he was uncertain if the company would sue to get its money back.  </P> <P> Word of the cancellation apparently was slow to spread to some exhibitors,  including the China Great Wall Industrial Corp., which, last week was still  sending parts of its exhibit to a holding warehouse in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I have another shipment coming in this morning," said a Los Angeles-based  freight forwarder for the Great Wall Corp., which produces rockets that carry  satellites into orbit. "Nobody told me about any cancellation," the freight  forwarder said.  </P> <P> Air/Space America evidently has sent letters to some exhibitors, asking them to  be patient. "We have received a letter that says too many companies are asking  too many questions right now and they're not prepared to answer them," said  Guodong Tian, a spokesman for the Great Wall Corp.  </P> <P> The state of South Dakota, which exhibited during Air/Space America's premiere  show in 1988, learned of the cancellation a week after the show was officially  cancelled, according to a trade show industry source who asked that his name  not be used. The governor of South Dakota is now considering legal action to  win back the state's down payment for the trade show, the source said.  </P> <P> As of last week, Air/Space America had yet to officially inform some  contractors that the show had been canceled, said Chuck Hoover, whose  Phoenix-based company had been hired to stage aerial portions of the planned  air extravaganza.  </P> <P> Hoover, who heard about the cancellation "through the grapevine," planned to  turn his Air/Space America contract over to an attorney to determine his legal  recourse.  </P></p>

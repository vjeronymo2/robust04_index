The article says:    Now the Korean-style socialism is making a long drive, not  wavering in any howling wind, because the steadfast faith in  socialism of chuche which is advancing confidently under the  guidance of the party and the leader has struck its roots deep  in the hearts of our people.    The Korean people accept the socialist idea of chuche as  their faith and are making the revolution and construction as  demanded by it. And they are struggling with a great pride and  honor of living and making the revolution in the most  advantageous socialist society in the world.    They are firmly convinced through the course of giving full  play to the dignity and might of the Korean-style socialism  under the banner of the socialist idea of chuche that they can  accomplish the cause of socialism when they take as the  guideline of their struggle the socialist idea of chuche which  is being developed and completed by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    This faith of our people is immutable and strongest even  under the circumstances in which the imperialists are  intensifying anti-socialist moves, loudly advertising "material  prosperity" and "advantages" of capitalism.    The whole society forms one big family and an independent  and  creative, socialist life of the people is in full bloom, with  the entire people united behind the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il in one mind. Our people deeply bear in mind through  the present-day reality and the miserable situation in the  countries where socialism has suffered a setback that capitalism  has nothing to present to the people. Hence, our people's faith  in socialism cannot be shaken with anything.    The Korean people wholly integrate socialism with their  destiny and devote their all to the struggle to defend socialism.</p>

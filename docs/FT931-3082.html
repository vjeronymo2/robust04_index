			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Testing time for air pollution  -Peter Knight examines new methods to gauge emissions More accurate instruments for measuring air pollution, which often give higher readings than expected, are troubling many companies which may have to spend more than anticipated on controlling emissions. This is especially true in the chemicals and petrochemicals sectors, which are under pressure to reduce air pollution levels (mainly volatile organic compounds). VOCs are the vapours given off by chemicals used in industry such as solvents and petrol. These collect in the atmosphere and react with sunlight to form photochemical smog and low-level ozone. 'The new measuring techniques enable businesses to assess realistically what their losses of high-cost products are, whereas they only had estimates before,' says Peter Woods, head of environment standards at the UK's National Physical laboratory. It is this precise knowledge - in some cases much higher than traditional estimates - that is worrying refinery owners and bulk chemical manufacturers. Governments are attempting to meet UN targets for cuts in air pollution and these companies have to be seen to act on new information about the extent of their emissions. However, there are often insufficient funds to pay for the necessary improvements to factories and plants. 'The business has to make a decision about the cost of losing its products versus the cost of saving them. If you are losing Pounds 1m a year in product, but it is going to cost Pounds 20m to save it, then you are probably going to wait until after the recession before you start spending,' says Woods. The pressure is growing because the UK government is thinking of specifying the instruments as part of a legal obligation in the Environmental Protection Act. This says companies must control pollution by using the 'best available techniques not entailing excessive cost'. Joe Draper, health, safety and environment manager for Shell Chemicals UK, says there is some scepticism about the accuracy of new instruments. 'Some of the readings are above our conventional estimates, but others are below or about the same. There is still a great deal of investigation needed before we can come to any definitive statement about their accuracy.' There are four main techniques for measuring pollution and product losses. Simple accounting - measuring what goes in and what comes out of a process. Point monitoring - measurements on emissions or output from specific points in the process, such as the chimney. Ambient measuring - catching gases in tubes and analysing them. Remote monitoring - measuring certain gases from a distance. Significant advances are being made in remote techniques. One of the most important is a system called Dial, developed by the National Physical Laboratory with funding from government and industry. Dial, a laser-based system, measures gas concentrations up to 3km away. The system is useful in locating unknown leaks. 'Certain storage tanks, for example, that industry thought were sound, are now found to be leaking,' says Mike Woodfield, business centre manager at the Warren Spring Laboratory. This type of news worries managers who find it difficult to raise funds to invest in a broad range of expected environmental improvements and do not appreciate surprise information from new instruments. But Draper says if the new instruments are right and more product is being lost, this makes it easier to justify the cost of reducing emissions. Woods agrees there is some scepticism, but other companies see the instruments becoming a necessary part of their armoury to demonstrate their levels of emissions.</p>

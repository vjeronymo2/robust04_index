			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHOLESALE INFLATION SURGES 0.5%;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: PRICE INCREASES IN FOOD, TOBACCO AND AUTOMOBILES BRING THE ANNUAL  INFLATION RATE TO 6.1%.  </P> <P> Inflation at the wholesale level surged an unexpectedly high 0.5% in November,  the Labor Department said today, as slightly cheaper oil failed to offset  costlier food, tobacco and automobiles.  </P> <P> "It's another terrible number.  </P> <P> We have not gotten rid of inflation," said economist Michael K. Evans, a  Washington consultant. The increase translates into a 6.1% annual inflation  rate.  </P> <P> Economists said the advance in the Producer Price Index, which followed  October's steep 1.1% spurt, may delay any Federal Reserve Board move to lower  interest rates. Most economists had anticipated a wholesale price rise of 0.1%  to 0.3%.  </P> <P> The core rate of wholesale inflation -- considered a more reliable indicator of  long-term price trends because it excludes the volatile food and energy costs  -- also gained 0.5%, the department said.  </P> <P> Analysts said the surge in the core rate appeared to reflect the impact of  higher costs for petroleum-based products.  </P> <P> The bulk of the overall PPI increase was in food, tobacco and car prices,  economists said. Tobacco makers raised prices on their products to beat a  federal tax that takes effect in January, and auto makers eliminated some  discounts last month, analysts said.  </P> <P> In another economic report today, the Federal Reserve said industrial  production weakened in November for the third straight month, falling back 1.7%  to the lowest level since last January. It was the steepest decline since  output plunged 2% in December, 1982, as the nation began crawling out of the  last recession.  </P> <P> And the Commerce Department reported that business inventories rose 0.4% in  October, a moderate increase that analysts say is unlikely to accelerate  already growing unemployment.  </P> <P> PRODUCER PRICE INDEX  </P> <P> Nov. '89: +0.1%  </P> <P> Oct. '90: +1.1%  </P> <P> Nov. '90: -0.5%  </P></p>

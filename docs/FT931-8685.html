			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Rover to create 300 jobs at Cowley ROVER GROUP is to create 300 to 350 jobs at its recently modernised Cowley plant near Oxford to double production of Maestro and Montego models to 600 a week. The jobs are being offered initially on a six-month temporary basis and will allow the introduction of two-shift working. This temporary employment approach has been made possible because of Rover's deal with unions last year to sweep away restrictive working practices. Rover Group, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, said last night that it needed the extra shift to meet what it described as a sharp upturn in demand for the cars in the UK and continental Europe. Recently the Cowley plant, which employs 4,700 people, introduced a night shift for the 800 range, which has become the UK executive car sector leader. The shift was also to prepare for the new Rover 600 model, developed with Honda, which is to be launched in April. Mr Paul Kirk, managing director of Rover's large cars division, said that sharply increased UK demand for diesel versions of the Maestro and Montego and a sales surge in Spain were mainly responsible for the expanded output. The new jobs represent the first significant recruitment drive at Cowley - where Rover has invested nearly Pounds 200m in recent years - for more than five years. Throughout much of the 1980s both unions and local authorities expressed fears that Rover's long-term intentions were to close the complex.</p>

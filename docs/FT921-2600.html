			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: OM contracts range extended OM, the Swedish options exchange, starts trading long-dated call options on selected Swedish shares today, writes Tracy Corrigan. OM London is listing one- and two-year options on Electrolux and Ericsson B shares. It will also list some options on restricted shares, which can only be bought by domestic investors: one- and two-year call options on Astra and S-E Banken A shares and Trelleborg and Volvo B shares fall into this category. Previously, OM options ran only up to six months. The contract size is 100 shares and the options are American-style; that is, they can be exercised at any time.</p>

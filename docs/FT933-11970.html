			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Observer: Anthem for an Old Lady The wisdom of Prometheus is something to which all top officials of the Bank of England aspire. So it is fitting that the Bank has hired Geoffrey Burgon, who wrote an opera about the Greek titan and is one of the most eclectic of Britain's modern composers, to think up a tune to celebrate the Old Lady's 300th anniversary next year. The work will be performed next Summer (pencil in June 8 at the Barbican), and looks like being one of the lighter moments in a year of celebrations of the Bank's tercentenary. Other highlights include a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's, a new Pounds 50 note issue, and a conference of 130 central bank governors and other international big-wigs. As for the Bank's new theme tune, new governor Eddie George is giving the composer a free hand and will learn about the score only on the day of the performance. Like 'Hard Eddie', Burgon was a late developer and got interested in music only at the age of 15, when he learned the trumpet. An enthusiast for old cars, Burgon has made a mint by taking an unashamedly commercial attitude to music, mainly through creating easy-listening signature tunes for TV series, such as Brideshead Revisited and Chronicles of Narnia. He has also plunged into serious music through works, such as a Requiem and writing scores for ballets, including Persephone and Ophelia. Given the topsy-turvy environment of central banking, especially in the light of recent exchange-market turbulence, Burgon could seek inspiration from his recent concerto, The Turning World. Better still, he could throw in a few variations from one of his recent songs - I Went to Heaven. Now that would strike a chord with any central banker.</p>

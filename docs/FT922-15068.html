			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Management: Innocents abroad - Social Europe / National borders being replaced with barriers for executives working in the EC Henke Lafebre is a partner in a Dutch firm of accountants who recently began working in its London office. Yet under new European Community rules intended to enhance his job opportunities in Europe, it will be at least six months before he can audit UK companies. He believes that far from creating a free market in labour, the new rules are a barrier. 'It is much harder for me to qualify to work here than it would have been two years ago.' Lafebre's experience is shared by many EC citizens coming to work in Britain. That is because Britain has just swapped its traditionally liberal approach towards accepting the qualifications of other EC countries for new, harmonised, cross-border arrangements. It is thus easier for Britons to work in the community but more difficult for continental European migrants to work in the UK. Freedom to work anywhere in the EC was one of the basic rights laid down in the Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic Community in 1957. It is estimated that about 3m EC nationals work in other EC countries, mainly in skilled manual, professional or managerial jobs. The promotion of maximum mobility of workers has been a 'minimal' goal of social Europe that even the non - interventionist UK Conservative government has supported. Indeed, if the Conservatives win next week's general election, initiatives to remove the remaining barriers to the free movement of people are expected to be a central part of the UK's presidency of the EC Council of Ministers later this year. There are two main issues in EC labour mobility: the co-ordination of social security systems - which affects all workers - and mutual recognition of professional and craft qualifications. There was some progress on the former, particularly on unemployment and state pensions, in the early 1970s. A British worker claiming unemployment benefit in France is entitled to the same treatment as a Frenchman. There are, however, a host of practical problems, with different states stipulating different periods before a person can claim entitlement to benefit, for example. The state pension rights of migrants are relatively straightforward. EC provisions say that an individual must be paid a proportionate amount of his or her state pension from the country of origin, plus a proportionate amount of that of the host country, depending on the length of residence. This creates winners and losers. In Italy where the state pension provision is generous, immigrants often do well and Italian emigrants do correspondingly badly when they go to countries with poorer state provision, like Britain. The portability of occupational pensions is a bigger problem which affects many better-paid migrant workers who belong to such schemes. Efforts to harmonise such schemes were scuppered last year by the EC because pensions are linked to taxation and therefore affect the sovereignity of member states' taxation policies. Migrants generally have to freeze occupational pensions in one country and start a new one in the state to which they move. Watsons Europe, the actuarial firm, estimates that around 150,000 managers are adversely affected by the lack of harmonisation in EC pensions. But, says Watsons, managers leaving one EC country to work in another can often negotiate compensation for loss of pension rights with their new employer. Portability of professional qualifications was identified by the EC in the early 1970s as an area for action and initially, it was tackled profession by profession. The approach was to compare the training required by each member state for a given profession and, as far as possible, harmonise it. This approach has proved slow and difficult and so far only covers jobs like doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, vets, pharmacists and architects. The architects' directive took 17 years to agree. In 1985 the Commission changed tack and introduced a directive laying down the principle of mutual recognition of qualifications so that a professional from one member state could become a member of the equivalent profession in another without having to requalify. The directive is applicable to people with at least three years' university-level education, plus any appropriate job related training. It applies to most professionals. So far just three member states - Ireland, Britain and Denmark - have passed all the necessary national legislation to comply with the directive and the European Commission has started legal proceedings against five other members states for non-compliance. It is too early to tell how efficiently the system will work. Some UK professional associations say they are having trouble getting information from their counterparts in the EC. They also say the tests in other states are much harder and seem designed to keep people out rather than ease them in. Several caveats in the directive give considerable power to the specified national bodies which will assess applicants for recognition within four months of receiving all the necessary papers. Where there are significant differences in the training - as in accountancy  -the host state can ask the incomer to sit a test or undergo an adaptation period. Host states may also ask for evidence of professional experience where education and training is a year short of the home member state. Both these measures can hold up the free flow of professionals. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in the UK requires Lafebre, the Dutch accountant, to sit an exam in UK company and tax law to qualify as an auditor. He applied to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, one of six bodies competent to confer accreditation, last month. It will be at least six months before he can qualify. The Department of Trade and Industry argues that until now, although EC nationals have been free to work in any community country, member states were not obliged to recognise professional qualifications and many did not. An accountant, it claims, would have needed 50 years to qualify to audit throughout the community. Britain has been a special case, adopting a more liberal approach to recognising qualifications than other EC states. Although people like Lafebre lose out, the new system is good for UK citizens who want to work in the EC. Finally, for skilled manual workers, a radical fillip to mobility will be provided if a second general directive is ratified by the EC Council of Ministers. This would give mutual recognition to qualifications of skilled workers including the UK National Vocational Qualifications. Unlike most in Europe, these are competence and not time-based.</p>

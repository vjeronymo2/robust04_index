			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Nine toothy, ravishing pieces from the late '70s and early '80s by Robert  Rauschenberg and strong works by a clutch of younger artists are good reasons  for roaming the vast square-footage of Ace Contemporary Exhibitions.  </P> <P> Several of Rauschenberg's massive works include broad swatches of fabric, often  juxtaposed with monolithic gray passages of newspaper want ads or stock tables.  The thin fabric, with its disciplined designs or loosely woven, almost  painterly wash of color, offers a low-pitched visual hum, setting off the  familiar barrage of images borrowed from diverse printed sources. In other  pieces, reflective metal surfaces add the viewer's image into the piece and  present a colder, post-industrial-age veneer.  </P> <P> In general, the works seem to be about the new coldness of the urban '80s and  its contrast with the values of other times and places. But there is really no  such notion as "in general" in this work, which persistently toys with allusive  -- some would say elusive -- visual rhymes.  </P> <P> In "The Lurid Attack of the Monsters from the Postal News Aug 1875," a  freestanding piece from 1981, four antique sharp-toothed metal cutting tools  form hoops over a wood incline upholstered in all manner of patterns:  geometric, dotted, striped, moire, freeform, flocked and a tapestry-like scene.  The photographic images include stock tables and men who seem to be performing  some kind of physical test, people in gas masks, a skeleton and an owl.  </P> <P> Who could say with certainty how the rhymes shake out here? Somehow the whole  thing has a brash, insistent and oddly lyrical presence that resists decoding,  but lures the viewer to bask in its sensory richness.  </P> <P> The younger artists, glimpsed in mini-shows, are quietly provocative in cooler  ways. Ross Rudel's very small wall sculpture alludes to body parts and rather  unsettling physical states. The center of a square plaster piece looks as  though it's being sucked inward. A black wood square oozes into an  ever-so-slightly veined testicular droop. A fabric-textured plaster piece is  suggestively rubbed soft in one area.  </P> <P> David Amico continues to invent vivid conjunctions of form and engulfing space.  In his painting, "Presenting," a crenellated dark shape repeats -- with  constant variations in shape and brushwork -- in orderly rows washed by a  multicolored soft ground. In "A Sliver of Light Shining Bright," a trio of gray  forms that look like rope tricks are cast adrift in a violet-white atmosphere  cut by a crescent of white light.  </P> <P> Roger Hermann's new paintings vibrate with a teeming curved wrought iron motif  that devours decorativeness in the search for a new kind of energy. When Robert  Zoell isn't doing deadpan, dumb paintings of big dots on solid, bright  surfaces, he is playing slyly reductive perceptual games in a sky-blue painting  in which the thinnest imaginable relief and intaglio lines form a ghostly  octagon.  </P> <P> Pauline Stella Sanchez's work has an impregnable, sullen aura. Real syringes  inject each of a set of dull-green square paintings with troubled surfaces that  erupt in various homely configurations of bumps. John Millei's small, wispy  paintings on paper are hard to figure. Maybe they're about the process of  siting forms in space or attempting to read forms that stray from the high road  of geometry.

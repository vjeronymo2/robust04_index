			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Motor industry seeks to dismiss April sales fall THE RECOVERY in new car sales faltered last month with registrations falling by 1.9 per cent, the first year-on-year decline in seven months. The motor industry said that the April comparison might be misleading, since new car sales have risen year-on-year in 10 of the last 13 months. Sales in April last year were inflated by customers who had delayed purchasing in the early months of the year. Car tax was halved in the 1992 Budget, which helped to fuel a 9.1 per cent rise in car sales in April 1992, the first year-on-year increase in 30 months and the first sign that the severest recession in the car market in the post-war period was ending. Mr Roger King, public affairs director of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'We believe we are still on course for an increase of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent for the whole of 1993, but in line with the state of the general economy the new car market continues to be rather fragile.' New car registrations in April fell to 135,469 from 138,106 in the same month a year ago, figures released yesterday by the SMMT show. Sales of 588,730 in the first four months of the year were 8.2 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. Registrations of new commercial vehicles remained depressed with a 1.7 per cent decline in April, the third year-on-year fall in three months. In the first four months new commercial vehicle registrations at 67,171 were still 4.5 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The main weakness in the commercial vehicle sector is in the van market. Registrations of trucks and buses rose modestly in the first four months. Japanese makes are gaining ground in the new car market, helped by the rapid growth of sources of supply outside Japan. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are produce cars in the UK. Toyota and Honda both ship cars to the UK from the US and Nissan and Suzuki supply the UK from plants in Spain. Mitsubishi has started to export cars to the UK from Australia. Japanese makes won 14.3 per cent of the new car market in April, up from 12.2 per cent a year ago. The Japanese share in the first four months rose to 12.7 per cent from 11.4 per cent a year earlier. Ford, the UK car market leader, saw registrations fall 12.3 per cent in April, depressing its market share to 21 per cent from 23.5 per cent a year ago. Its share in the first four months fell to 22.4 per cent from 23.8 per cent a year ago, but its fortunes should be boosted by the recent launch of the Mondeo family car, the replacement for the Sierra.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK CAR REGISTRATIONS -

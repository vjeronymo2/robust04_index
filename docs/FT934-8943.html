			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: IBM may sell off Federal Systems INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is 'exploring the possibility' of selling all or part of its Federal Systems Company, a US-based division that sells computers and services to the Federal government. IBM said it had been contacted by several companies acting individually, which were interested in acquiring all or part of FSC. In the past, similar inquiries have been turned down. Now, however, faced with declining profits, IBM is apparently more receptive to such offers. 'We are evaluating several proposals,' a spokesman said, while emphasising that no decision had been made. FSC sells almost exclusively to the US government. Its contracts typically involve complex systems integration projects, such as air traffic control. A large portion of its business is with the US Defense Department and the division is also responsible for sales of office computers to all government agencies. The distinctive nature of FSC's business makes it a potential candidate to be sold as IBM struggles to reduce costs and boost its profitability. FSC employs 11,400 people, almost all of them in the US. The division posted 1992 revenues of Dollars 2.2bn, up from Dollars 1.9bn the previous year, but its business has been relatively flat over recent years amid US defence spending cuts. For 1992, the division recorded a net profit of Dollars 71m after being assessed for a portion of IBM's restructuring charges. The sale of FSC would, however, break an historic tie between the US government and IBM. Traditionally, IBM has been one of the largest suppliers of computer equipment and services to the US government. Although the federal government is the largest purchaser of computer equipment and services in the US, it is a notoriously difficult customer.</p>

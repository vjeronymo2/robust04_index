			<p>BFN     [Text] The government today approved the joint Housing  Ministry and Treasury plan to lower the cost of housing. This  was after Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer decided not to  present his proposal for allocating contractors 51 percent of  the land freed in return for building apartments for candidates  eligible for mortgages. The government will meet again on  Wednesday to discuss Ben-Eli'ezer's proposal. This is aimed at  ensuring that contractors winning tenders allocate 25 percent of  the land for apartments to those who have the right to Housing  Ministry support. Harley Braidman reports:    [Begin recording] [Braidman] The government approved the  joint Housing Ministry and Treasury plan of minimum state  intervention in construction. The main point of the program is  an article relating to the marketing of land. The Israel Land  Administration and the Housing Ministry presented a clear  detailed plan for marketing 50,000 units annually in the center  of the country. Contracts will tie down builders to fixed dates  for start and completion of construction to prevent them  stocking up on plots. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat was  pleased with the government's decision.    [Shohat] We think that we decided about the proper things to  do, and I believe that in order to carry out a massive building  program we are creating the proper environment to the market to  start building. I believe that we made a proper decision. The  main thing is that we got clear information about the amount of  plots that are going to be sold on the market in order to build  houses and this is quite a big number of 50,000 in 1994 and  50,000 in 1995. I think that will reduce the cost of the  apartments.    [Braidman] In addition to the 25,000 foreigners allowed in,  the government approved 13,000 workers from the territories to  return to construction in Israel. Planning procedures will be  simplified and infrastructure work speeded up. The government  will not return to budgetary purchase of flats nor promise to  buy apartments in demand areas.

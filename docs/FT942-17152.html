			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT to launch Canadian bond futures trade The Chicago Board of Trade, best known for its US Treasury bond futures and options contracts, plans to launch futures and options on 10-year Canadian government bonds on Friday. The contracts will compete directly with Canadian bond futures traded at the Bourse de Montreal. The CBoT said the Canadian bond futures could lead to the launch of other foreign bond contracts. The Chicago exchange is betting that its large number of financial futures traders will give its Canadian contracts an edge over the Montreal version. However, it would be unusual for Chicago to be successful in winning the Canadian business.</p>

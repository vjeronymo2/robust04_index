There are four candidates -- Pyotr  Romanov, director-general of a Krasnoyarsk production society,  Eduard Rossel, former head of the Sverdlovsk Regional  Administration and currently president of the association for  the Ural Region's economic interaction, Aleksandr Titkin, former  minister of industry and currently president of a  financial-investment company, and Vladimir Shumeyko, first  vice-premier of the Russian Government.    The secret nomination of candidates, held the day before,  showed that Shumeyko is an absolute leader. Seventy-eight out  of the 161 deputies, who took part in the nomination, entered  his name in the voting ballot. Thirteen deputies backed  Romanov, 10 -- Rossel, and six -- Titkin. The number of  nominated candidates reached seventeen, but the rest preferred  to withdraw their candidatures.    A secret vote to elect the speaker will be held today at the  morning meeting, after the candidates take the floor and are  discussed.    According to the procedural rules of the first council  session, adopted on Tuesday, "a candidate will be deemed  elected, if he polls more than fifty per cent of the votes of  elected members of the council as a result of a secret vote".</p>

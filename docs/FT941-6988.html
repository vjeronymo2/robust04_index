			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Investment Trusts (5): Keep an eye on the assets - Trust companies have been tackling the problem of discounts in a number of ways, writes Bethan Hutton, including monthly savings schemes to provide a steady demand Investment trusts have been around for more than a century, but the past few years have seen a spectacular revival in their fortunes. At least part of this has to be due to the popularity of investment trust Peps, particularly since the tax-break was widened to allow the full Pounds 6,000 to be invested in collective funds. Like unit trusts, investment trusts offer investors, even those with very modest savings, exposure to a wide spread of shares, thus reducing the risk. There are fewer investment trusts than unit trusts, but they offer a huge variety, from general UK and international funds to specialist funds investing in a single country or using a particular strategy. Many of the longest-established investment trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial's flagship fund, are general international funds which have been reluctant to become fully qualifying for Pep investment, as this would mean guaranteeing that at least 50 per cent of their holdings would be in the UK or the rest of the European Union. However, many of the same investment management groups have set up newer trusts which are fully Pep-qualifying, using the same investment expertise, but focused on a narrower area. Of course, you can still invest up to Pounds 1,500 a year in non-qualifying funds, and the investment trust sector offers a wide choice of these. Investment trusts have fewer investment restrictions than unit trusts; so, for example, emerging market investment trusts can be more genuinely adventurous than their unit trust counterparts, which can only put 10 per cent of the fund into 'unapproved' stock markets. Investment trusts can also offer some innovative structures, such as split-capital trusts (see facing page). One important difference between unit and investment trusts is that the price of shares in investment trusts fluctuates according to market demand, unlike the price of units in unit trusts, which is set by the trust's manager, and relates directly to the value of the underlying assets. This can mean that if shares in an investment trust are in demand, you pay a higher share price than its underlying assets are worth. When this happens, the share is said to be trading at a premium. More usually, investment trust shares trade at a discount - the value of the assets per share is higher than the price of the share. At the moment, discounts are at historically narrow levels. If you buy shares at a premium or a narrow discount, you run the risk that, even if the trust's portfolio performs well, if the trust itself ceases to be so popular, the share price could slip back to a wider discount by the time you want to sell. A considerable part of investment trusts' outperformance of unit trusts over the past few years can be attributed to the narrowing of discounts, but a widening would lead to underperformance. Investment trust companies have been tackling the problem of discounts in a number of ways, including setting up monthly savings schemes to provide a steady demand. Savings schemes are popular with many small investors who are worried by the ups and downs of the stockmarket. By investing a fixed amount - say Pounds 50 - every month, you buy more shares when the price is low, and fewer when the price is high. This lowers the average cost of the shares you buy, and reduces the likelihood of your putting in a lump sum at the top of the market and seeing your investment take a dive the next week. You can also contribute to a Pep through a savings scheme. Many, but not all, investment trust management groups run their own Peps. The alternative is to take out a self-select Pep with an independent manager, and use it to buy investment trust shares. The choice between these two approaches depends on the charges, but also how wide a choice of funds you want to be able to include in your Pep. Some investment trust groups only include two or three trusts in their Peps, whereas others give you free choice of all their funds, and sometimes those of other groups as well. This gives you greater flexibility if you want to switch between funds - for example, if the performance of your first choice is not what you expected. Of course, with a self-select Pep you can include whatever trusts you like, within the legal limits. The first two months of this year have seen a rash of new investment trust launches. Many of them are not fully Pep-qualifying, as they invest in such areas as Latin America, Israel and Taiwan, but a number are aimed squarely at the Pep market. Buying investment trust shares during the launch period has its attractions, particularly when other trusts in the same sector are trading at large premiums. Buyers of new issues pay only the net asset value, plus the issue expenses, which rarely exceed 4 per cent. New trusts often aim to compensate for the dent made by issue expenses by attaching warrants to the new shares. Warrants give investors the right to purchase shares in the future at a fixed price. They can be traded separately, and acquire a value because investors expect the market price of the shares to rise above the warrants' exercise price by the time they can be used. Warrants attached to newly-issued shares can sometimes be transferred into a Pep along with the shares. Many new investment trust issues offer very attractive terms for investors who opt for a Pep attached to the trust. However, if you commit your Pep allowance for this year to a Pep tied to a new issue, you run the risk that the offer will be over-subscribed, so that applications have to be scaled down, and you may not be allocated enough shares use up your Pep allowance. Rather than Pounds 6,000-worth of shares, you could end up with only Pounds 2,000 or so. To take full advantage of your Pep allowance, you would then have to buy more shares on the open market, probably at a higher price. Some trusts promise not to scale back small applications, or hold a ballot, so that Pep applicants are allocated either their full amount or nothing at all, leaving them free to take out a Pep elsewhere. If you fear a trust might be over-subscribed, it is worth inquiring what the attitude towards Pep investors is likely to be. A potential drawback for keen investors is that buying investment trust shares via a Pep makes it more difficult to participate in shareholders meetings. Most Pep managers make an extra charge - commonly Pounds 10-Pounds 25, but it can be as much as Pounds 50 - if you want to attend an AGM. A few managers, such as Flemings, make a point of not charging for this service. If shareholder participation is important to you, check this point before you sign up.

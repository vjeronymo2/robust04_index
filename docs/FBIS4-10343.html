			<p>BFN     [Text] Rene Steichen, EU agricultural affairs commissioner,  has reported Honduras was excluded from the new Latin American  banana agreement, which favors only the banana exports to Europe  of Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.    According to the agreement, these four countries must  withdraw from GATT, which rejected the quotas imposed by the EU  on Latin American banana imports.    Steichen has said that Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and  Venezuela are supplying the Latin American banana amounts the EU  requires.    In July of 1993 the EU imposed an annual quota of 2 million  tonnes of bananas on Latin American exports to protect producers  from the Canary Islands and the former European colonies in the  Caribbean and Pacific regions.    It was agreed last December to increase the quota to 2.1  million tonnes as of 1 October 1994 and to 4.2 million tonnes as  of 1995.    The new agreement states duties on the fruit will be reduced  from 100 to 75 European Currency Units per tonne.    The quota assigned to Costa Rica amounts to 23.4 percent of  the total amount imported by the EU, while Colombia will export  21 percent, Nicaragua 3 percent, and Venezuela 2 percent.    Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Panama refrained from  supporting the agreement and are demanding suspension of the  restrictive system.</p>

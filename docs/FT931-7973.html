			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Closed-circuit Television system FROM a control room, Mr Gordon Allanson, manager of the Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, surveys a row of giant television screens, Jimmy Burns writes. The centre, one of Europe's biggest, spent Pounds 50,000 in 1990 upgrading its closed-circuit television system. There are 16 cameras continuously recording and monitoring activity in the 17-acre centre, which can have as many as 18,000 people passing through in an hour. At the push of a button cameras can zoom in on an individual and take a colour photograph. Technology to enhance the quality of the images and the scope of the coverage is used. The closed-circuit television system is supported by an integrated fire and burglary system. Mr Allanson said the security is a 'customer service' which has helped rather than hindered business. 'People feel more comfortable when they're shopping if they know we are protecting them properly. They don't see the security as a threat.' A few months ago film and photographs from this system helped convict a gang of 40 on a variety of conspiracy and theft charges, he said. A combination of human and technological security has led to arrests and convictions in two other recent incidents at the centre - one of breaking and entering and the other an assault on a staff member.</p>

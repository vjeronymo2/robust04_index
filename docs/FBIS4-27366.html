			<p>BFN     [Text] If North Korea does not stop the work of replacing  the fuel rods within two to three days, the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] made a final conclusion that the  transparency of North Korea's nuclear issue cannot be verified.  The IAEA plans to make an additional report on this to the UN  Security Council [UNSC] sometime this weekend. Following is a  report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna.    [Begin Cha Man-sun recording] The IAEA believes that the  statement on North Korea, which was urgently adopted at the UNSC  today, will stimulate the resolution of the fuel rods issue, and  anticipates a positive response from North Korea. However, if  North Korea does not show a positive response in two to three  days by immediately suspending the work to replace the fuel  rods, a decisive opportunity to take samples will be lost.    Currently, the work to replace the fuel rods is being  carried  out at a very quick pace with the presence of two inspectors,  and it seems that over 4,000 of the 8,000 fuel rods will be  replaced in two to three days.    Therefore, if North Korea does not immediately implement the  UNSC's demand, the IAEA will make a final decision saying that  it has reached a stage in which it cannot verify the  transparency of North Korea's nuclear issue, and then report  this to the UNSC sometime this weekend to urge that additional  measures on North Korea be taken.    The two inspectors who are in Yongbyon reported that the  work  to replace the fuel rods has reached a limit in which it is  difficult to take samples, and that if the work to replace the  fuel rods was stopped, there would be no safety problem at all  at the atomic reactor.

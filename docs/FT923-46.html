			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes of rate cut stop Dow falling further Wall Street US SHARE prices ended slightly lower yesterday after hopes for another cut in interest rates were overshadowed by more bad news on the economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.46 at 3,266.80, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.18 higher at 416.80. The Amex composite slipped 1.64 to 375.61 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.29 at 577.63. Turnover was 171m shares. The morning's economic news sparked an early sell-off. The Conference Board announced that its September index of consumer confidence fell to 56.4, from 59.0 in August. The decline was bigger than expected, and when combined with news of a 0.2 per cent drop in August's leading economic indicators, confirmed that economic conditions throughout the country remain weak. Although depressing, the figures raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates one more time, and this prevented share prices from falling too far yesterday. Investors were speculating that the Fed may ease policy on Friday if the September employment report is particularly weak. Among individual stocks the big feature of the day was Sears Roebuck, which after a delay because of an order imbalance on the buy side, jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 in turnover of 5.4m shares after the giant retailer announced it was selling off a large chunk of its profitable financial services operations. The deal, which should raise more than Dollars 3bn in cash to reduce group debt, was seen as a move to realise shareholder value and allow Sears to concentrate on core businesses. Rail stocks were also active after securities house Morgan Stanley recommended the sector. Among those to benefit most were Consolidated Rail, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 40 5/8 , CSX, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 59, Norfolk Southern, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 55 3/4 , and Union Pacific, Dollars  5/8 firmer at Dollars 54 5/8 . Times Mirror fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 31 1/4 after the newspaper publishing group warned that August advertising revenues were down 5.6 per cent on a year ago. Middleby soared Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 2 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange after the company said it won a Dollars 27m verdict in its breach of contract action against Whitman Corp, which fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 1/2 . Canada TORONTO stocks suffered their biggest one-day drop since April as a plunging Canadian dollar and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming constitutional referendum affected sentiment. The TSE 300 composite index sank 40.75 points, or 1.21 per cent, to end at 3,327.24. Declining issues swamped advances 414 to 179. Volume was 36.206m shares worth CDollars 396.8m against 23.625m shares worth CDollars 266.6m on Monday. Petro-Canada was up  1/8 to 9 3/4 after it said it will cut its debts. Telepanel shares jumped 0.475 to 5 3/8 after it signed a marketing agreement with IBM Corp. BP Canada stock was up  1/4 to 14 3/4 .</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Santiago, 12 Mar (EFE) -- Today Chilean  President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle, who took over on 11 March,  will announce the main guidelines of his administration which  will have the support of the same political alliance that backed  up his predecessor Patricio Aylwin.    Rather than talking about "continuity," however, the new  administration is announcing "new times", innovations and new  initiatives. [passage omitted]    Interior Minister German Correa, from the Socialist Party,  has announced that in the speech Frei will make today "he will  outline the key objectives of his administration."    One of the main differences between Aylwin and Frei, a  militant Christian Democrat just like his predecessor, is that  the Frei has appointed a Socialist as interior minister and  chief of cabinet.    Correa will also play the role of vice president whenever  President Frei travels abroad. [passsage omitted]    Yet another difference between Aylwin and Frei is that the  latter did not ask or receive suggestions from political parties  that make up the government coalition for the appointment of  ministers, under secretaries and other government officials.  This attitude displeased several people, even some members of  the Christian Democratic Party, the largest component of the  ruling coalition.    Today's presidential agenda includes several bilateral  meetings with visiting dignitaries, beginning with Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori. Later on Frei will meet with  Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy, and OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares.    The meetings will continue throughout the afternoon and at  the end of the day there will be a rally at Plaza Constitucion,  right in front of La Moneda Palace. On this occasion President  Frei will make a speech in which he will outline the objectives  of his 6-year term in office.    [Santiago Television Nacional de Chile Imagen Internacional  in Spanish at 1259 GMT on 12 March reports that "at 1115 local  time (1415 GMT) President Frei will briefly attend a reception  at the Santiago City Hall and will begin his meetings with  foreign dignitaries at 1130 local time. The formal reception  that President Frei will offer to special guests at Plaza  Constitucion will last from 2030 to 2300 local time."]</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading US buying support and a rally in bonds combined to keep stock index futures moving ahead in a session noted for its low turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 3,086 and moved gently ahead on sporadic buying from US institutions for the next two hours. A sell order, together with a brief retreat in UK gilts and European bonds, saw the contract decline to hit a day's low of 3,065 at mid-morning. However, this turned out to be only a brief setback and September recovered to move ahead for the rest of the session, helped by the turnround in bonds. Bear closing and a lack of sellers were said to have contributed to a further advance by the contract in the afternoon. Having maintained a strong premium to cash throughout the day, September finished at 3,098, around 10 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume remained low at 10,737 lots. Turnover in the traded options was a healthy 32,291 contracts, though lower than Friday's total. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 10,716 lots and the Euro FT-SE 3,352. BT was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,145 contracts traded. The total included a single trade of 3,000 lots in the August 420 puts.</p>

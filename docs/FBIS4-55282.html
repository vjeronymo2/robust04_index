			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "wk," "ski," and "dom": "Mother Stabilization"] </F>   [Text] According to Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime  minister and finance minister, to achieve a stabilization that  is to be the mother of Poland's economic success and to maintain  the growth rate, one must construct fiscal policies in a way  that is conducive to the people saving more money. But "the  government is still not clear on how to accomplish that."    "If it were not for last year's strikes, the government or  parliament would not have to raise taxes," Minister Kolodko said  during a meeting with regional press journalists. "Those who  decide to be on strike must know that they do it at the cost of  those who work hard at the very same time."    The new chief of finance is eager to see a comprehensive tax  law and banking law: "We must continue to send messages to  business people that it pays to invest and that they will have  to overcome fewer unnecessary problems in the future," Kolodko  said yesterday.    He also announced that there are no plans to raise the rates  of indirect taxes (VAT [value-added tax], the excise tax, and  customs duties). But he wants to have a situation where more  companies than now would pay taxes, with all types of breaks and  waivers being documented exclusively with VAT receipts. This  would limit the economic "gray area."    Minister Kolodko also anounced that monies for 20,000 job  openings in the customs police will be found in the near future,  and "then we will get real serious on that." Tax obligations  due from enterprises will be collected with more efficiency:  "We will act much the same way as the mighty ones from the  London or Paris Club act with relation to Poland."    Minister Kolodko intends to change the principles of the  zloty's devaluation "sooner rather than later"--the dollar will  get more expensive at a slower rate (the monthly rate right now  is 1.6 percent). According to Kolodko, this would reduce the  inflation rate.    Minister Kolodko does not plan to make any amendments to  this  year's budget, despite the fact that revenue is higher by a few  trillion zlotys [Z] compared with initial plans, because he  fears that "there may occur a reversal of the situation."    Kolodko believes that, in three years' time, he will manage  to foster a significant reduction in the budget deficit--that  is, to a level of about 2 percent of the GDP. This year's  Budget Law provides that the budget deficit will be Z83  trillion, which is about 4.1 percent of the GDP. Kolodko also  portrays himself as "a fervent enthusiast of privatization."  But he expressed criticism of privatization policies conducted  by recent governments because "enterprises were sold too cheaply  and, because of that, the state budget was losing 5 percent of  the GDP per year."</p>

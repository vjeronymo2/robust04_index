This is the sad result of a weekend of clashes between  Tutsis and Hutus in the capital, Bujumbura. Burundi has not  come out of the infernal cycle of violence and reprisals, and  people are living in fear. Jean-Michel Mostaert reports:    [Mostaert] Everything started on Saturday [19 March] morning  with a grenade attack on a bus in the district of Rusaka, east  of Bujumbura. Four passengers were killed. All were members of  the Tutsi community. Immediately, the Tutsis wanted revenge;  they attacked members of the Hutu community, while Tutsis were  victims of reprisals in the areas with a Hutu majority.    These fresh interethnic clashes are reported to have led to  scores of deaths, maybe 100. They reveal the tense atmosphere  which is continuing in Burundi almost five months after the  abortive military coup of October, when almost 100,000 people  were killed in interethnic violence. Since then, the  authorities have not managed to restore a minimum of trust  between the two communities. On the contrary; in the capital,  Bujumbura, Tutsis and Hutus now live entrenched in their  districts. Many are armed and the slightest incident leads to  bloody reprisals.    The government seems to be powerless. It is divided on  whether to disarm people or not. A UN mission is to arrive in  Burundi tomorrow. It will investigate the situation in the  country. It will only be able to see the drift of Burundi,  which is sinking deeper and deeper into chaos.</p>

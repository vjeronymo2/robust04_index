			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Observer: Palace coup Ken Schofield's arrival in the chief executive's seat at MTM, the troubled chemicals company, has to be good news. He did an excellent job in reviving Hickson International and stands as good a chance as anyone of salvaging MTM. Even so, the manner of his arrival must raise eyebrows. When a company gets into the sort of trouble that MTM seems to be in, shareholders might expect the non-executive directors and the financial advisers to hang around and help sort out the mess. Notwithstanding Schofield's excellent record, shareholders can be forgiven for wondering who is keeping an eye on their interests now the non-execs and their advisers have quit. Perhaps there was a danger that Postern, the recently hired firm of company doctors, was becoming too powerful in the company's affairs. But it was up to the non-executive directors to keep them under control. Who is going to tell Ken Schofield what to do?</p>

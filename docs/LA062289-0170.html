			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOING HANDS IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR RACE;  </P> <P> JOINT VENTURE IN MEMORY CHIPS PROPOSED BY 7 U.S. COMPANIES  </P> <P> In a move that dwarfs previous efforts to beat back the Japanese challenge in  technology, seven leading U.S. electronics firms Wednesday unveiled plans for a  $1-billion venture aimed at restoring a strong American presence in the  critical area of computer memory chip production.  </P> <P> The proposed company, U.S. Memories Inc., would be jointly owned by American  computer and semiconductor companies while operating as an independent  commercial entity. It is currently described as "a corporation in formation,"  and a final decision whether to go ahead depends on gaining antitrust clearance  from the government and attracting additional investors. Semiconductor industry  executives expressed confidence that those requirements will be met, however.  </P> <P> Although many of the nation's major electronics companies already are working  together on research to advance America's technology and competitive position,  U.S. Memories would be the first major manufacturing or commercial venture of  its kind.  </P> <P> Sanford L. Kane, a 27-year veteran of International Business Machines, was  named president and chief executive of U.S. Memories. Wilfred J. Corrigan,  chairman and chief executive of LSI Logic, is to be its chairman.  </P> <P> The preliminary business plan is for the new company to manufacture so-called  DRAMs, or dynamic random-access memories, using a highly advanced design  licensed from IBM. Production would take place at a new U.S. facility in a  location yet to be determined.  </P> <P> Kane said building a plant and establishing high-volume DRAM production would  require about $1 billion. He emphasized that U.S. Memories is intended to be a  "significant participant" in the global market and a profit-making company.  </P> <P> The seven companies that announced their participation Wednesday -- IBM,  Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, National  Semiconductor and LSI Logic -- have put up seed money for U.S. Memories and  have agreed to take substantial equity stakes in the company, provided that  additional investors are found. Kane said he expected that the seven firms  ultimately will own less than half of U.S. Memories, with the balance held by  as many as 20 other U.S. electronics firms.  </P> <P> Plans call for shareholders to be in place by year-end and for plant  construction to begin next year. Commercial chip production would begin in the  first half of 1991.  </P> <P> U.S. Memories would employ at least 2,000 people, according to industry  analysts, although Kane would not speculate on the number of jobs. He did say,  however, that he was determined to avoid a politicized site-selection process  such as the one which took place for the Sematech semiconductor consortium.  </P> <P> Unlike the Austin, Tex.-based Sematech, a nonprofit consortium working on the  development of semiconductor manufacturing technology, U.S. Memories will not  seek government funds. Kane and other officials emphasized that other types of  government support will be crucial, however.  </P> <P> In particular, U.S. Memories will have to be approved by the antitrust division  of the Department of Justice, since the member companies are each other's  customers and competitors. Kane said no formal opinion had yet been sought, but  added that lawyers hired by U.S. Memories had indicated that anti-trust  clearance should be forthcoming.  </P> <P> While the government has approved waivers for some 100 high-technology  consortiums, those projects have been purely research and development efforts,  not commercial or manufacturing enterprises along the lines of U.S. Memories.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comment From Antitrust  </P> <P> Charles S. Stark, head of the antitrust division's foreign commerce section,  noted that the anti-trust laws contain nothing to suggest that manufacturing is  more objectionable than research, from an antitrust standpoint. "There's no  specific bar to manufacturing," he said.  </P> <P> Neither he nor other Justice Department officials would comment on specifics of  the group's proposals.  </P> <P> Some other observers, including analysts, industry officials and antitrust  lawyers, noted that the project has the strong backing of the Defense  Department, which desperately wants to ensure that domestic suppliers can  satisfy the massive military appetite for chips.  </P> <P> There is considerable sentiment in Congress for joint efforts to catch up with  Japanese advances in this technology, observers noted. Several pending bills  would broaden the antitrust exemptions for such projects to allow  manufacturing, they said.  </P> <P> U.S. Memories is also counting on continued government help on the trade front.  "Maintaining strong support in Washington and enhancing the anti-dumping  measures will be vital," Kane said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patriotic Promotion  </P> <P> The company's red, white and blue logo and its name indicate the extent to  which the venture is being promoted as a patriotic effort.  </P> <P> Trade in semiconductor memory devices is governed by a trade agreement signed  by the United States and Japan in 1986. That pact resulted in a dramatic  increase in the price of Japanese memory chips, but failed to produce one  desired result: a massive re-entry of U.S. companies into the memory chip  market. Currently, among U.S. companies, only Texas Instruments, Motorola and  tiny Micron Technology are players in the memory chip market.  </P> <P> At their news conference, officials said the project had the support of all the  domestic manufacturers of the DRAM memory chips, who stand to become  competitors in the formidable new enterprise.  </P> <P> In an interview, however, a spokesman for Micron Technology stopped short of a  wholesale endorsement of the project. "It certainly shows the need for more  domestic supply," said Kipp Bedard, noting also that the project's biggest  backers include some of his company's best customers.  </P> <P> Efforts to reach officials of Japanese DRAM makers were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Importance of DRAMs  </P> <P> DRAMs, while not the most complex of semiconductor products, are considered  vital because the production techniques used to make them on a mass scale are  also used for more sophisticated products, such as microprocessors. A shortage  of DRAMs earlier this year also intensified concern about the U.S. computer  industry's dependence on Japanese suppliers.  </P> <P> "Domestic DRAM production is crucial to U.S. defense and economic interests,  and is essential to advanced products" such as high-definition television, said  Gordon Moore, chairman of both Intel Corp. and the Semiconductor Industry Assn.  The industry trade group has been a crucial forum in the development of the  consensus that a collective re-entry into the DRAM business was necessary and  possible.  </P> <P> The plan for U.S. Memories emerged from the same process that gave rise to  Sematech, Kane and others said. Noyce said he expected U.S. Memories to become  a full member of Sematech and to benefit from the research consortium's  production advances.  </P> <P> The technology licensing deal with IBM, which must be completed before U.S.  Memories can move forward, is crucial to the viability of the plan. "By  licensing IBM's advanced memory design, U.S. Memories will have the jump-start  it needs to quickly come on line as a serious player," Moore said.  </P> <P> The IBM design is for 4-megabit DRAMs, each of which can hold 4 million bits of  information. The chips are expected to be put on the market by Japanese firms  such as Toshiba and NEC sometime next year, and IBM is already producing them  for internal use.  </P> <P> Kane indicated that U.S. Memories would remain dependent on IBM for the next  generation of DRAMs, which will hold 16 million bits of information, but he  would not speculate on the source of U.S. Memories' technology after that. It  appears, however, that the company ultimately will develop its own technology.  </P> <P> Jonathan Weber reported from Santa Clara and Paul Richter reported from New  York.  </P></p>

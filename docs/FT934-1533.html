			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Exporters attack DTI on new law The Institute of Export yesterday protested to the government about 'ineffective' consultation with industry and corporate lawyers about the new laws on commercial agents, which come into force on January 1. Complaints about poor consultation have been mounting throughout the autumn as exporters realised the new laws were going to raise costs and that some companies were unlikely to have enough time to adjust. It appears a new section in the final form of the regulations was the final straw. It changed the way agents should be compensated when sacked. In all drafts, Britain appeared to be opting for damages rather than the fixed-indemnity formulae favoured by most other European Union countries. Since damages are negotiable, most lawyers acting for exporters believed this would generally offer the cheapest option if companies and agents fell out.</p>

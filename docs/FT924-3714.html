			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Food &amp; Drink: To port, with no thought of storms - Jancis Robinson lets the (female) side down I HAD felt so flattered to be asked to be the first woman to attend, and speak at, the annual treasurer's dinner at the Factory House in Oporto. The Factory House is somewhere very special: a handsome, 18th century edifice on a patch of British soil in the middle of Portugal's second city, a relic of the days in which British merchants, or factors, needed a place to congregate and, doubtless, lament the lack of home comforts. At one time, these factors would have dealt in all sorts of commodities; but for nearly 200 years the Factory House in Oporto has been the seat of the Port Wine Trade, defined by its Britishness, love of capital letters, and its exclusion of women from its British Association and its weekly Wednesday lunches. This year, it was the turn of port shipper Taylor to field a treasurer and his turn, therefore, to choose a speaker for the annual Treasurer's Dinner. In retrospect, I suspect I was invited because the head of Taylor's, Alistair Robertson, has no sons but three daughters, and a wife who feels strongly about women and the Factory House. It was, probably, hoped that I would behave nicely and demonstrate that no evil would result from giving in to the inexorable dual-gender sweep of evolution (especially as an increasing number of women now play a serious part in the port business, the clever little things). I certainly intended to behave myself. I purposely left in my wardrobe any remotely daring female answer to the black tie and, as I mounted the granite steps to the Factory House's first floor drawing room with its portraits of Grahams, Sandemans, Crofts, Warres and Symingtons, I was absolutely determined to be as unembarrassingly unobtrusive as possible. After rations of white port from golden decanters, 28 descendants of these Sandemans, Grahams etc and their workmates (some of them actually Portuguese), the British ambassador, the incumbent of the British Church in Oporto and I made our way to the dining room. That bit was fine. We chatted our way through a five-course dinner with a white Portuguese table wine, Camarate 1991, Ch Beychevelle 1984 ('hope you approve') and a 30-year-old tawny port. There was a very slight hiccup as we moved to the same places at the table in the near-identical dessert room next door, a tradition as old as the long Georgian tables themselves. Should the lady go first? (No. Frightfully complicated. We'd never find our places in the candlelight.) It was here, over fruit and nuts and beautiful decanters in strictly clockwise motion, that we were to get down to the business of listening to the speeches and polishing off (11 bottles of) 'proper' port: vintage port, Taylor 1948 no less - an absolute dream of mellow concentration. Did I say mellow? Well, the shippers certainly showed signs of concentration on my speech, but I am not sure that it left them feeling at all mellow. I had done my research on previous speakers and, realising I could hardly follow the joky route of Willie Rushton, or the historical tour d'horizon of an ambassador, decided I had better tell them about one of the few relevant things I probably knew a bit more about than they did: port and the British wine market, the one they depend on for sales of better quality ports, and profits. I had honestly assumed that, before suggesting a few ways in which they might improve port's appeal, I would merely be illuminating some of the darker corners of a not particularly bright picture. After all, they must have noticed that port shipments to Britain, and to most other major markets, have been falling. But I felt as though my report on the portlessness of so much of contemporary British society came as an absolute bolt from the blue to this coterie of expatriates. Before flying to Oporto, I had done a certain amount of ringing round to discover just how much port was served where. To my horror, I heard sharp intakes of breath as I gave them what were meant to be the heartening statistics before the dispiriting ones (such as that London's hugely successful Kensington Place restaurant serves 10,000 meals each month - and just four bottles of vintage port). My point was that although port may still be drunk in quantity by shooting parties and pensioners, it is losing its place rapidly in the modern wine drinker's life, cellar, habits and heart - witness the collapse of vintage port prices in the auction rooms as investors offload this unfashionable commodity, and the availability of vintage port at almost embarrassingly low prices from such on-the-ball merchants as Oddbins and Farr Vintners. Most of my friends, I told them heartlessly, love wine and take such advantage of the hugely improved quality of table wine that they just cannot afford the time or bloodstream capacity for a super-alcoholic drink at the end of a meal. And if today's thirty- and forty-somethings aren't drinking it, who will? I did go on to outline various ways of galvanising the wine trade and press; to suggest that they try to promote port with food; and to underline the increasingly popularity of the much lighter and more versatile tawny port that, unlike vintage port, needs no decanting and is delicious chilled. But I am not sure they heard. I suddenly realised that I had probably set back the prospects for women being allowed into the British Association for millennia. I really did think I was being informative and constructive; but I suppose that, if you are a member of a port shipping family, you do drink a lot of port and make sure your friends do, too. So, inevitably, you are somewhat sheltered from the cruel caprices of the marketplace. You are also - and this surely is the key - much more limited in the quality and range of wines drunk before the port. Probably the only way to savour port is to plan ahead for it by deliberate restraint en route. The way to enjoy vintage port to the full, I suspect, is to stand up the heavily sedimented bottles for a few days before decanting them, invite punctual guests, give them a little interesting (rather than stunning) wine to begin with, and to make the cheese/sweet/dessert section of a dinner its focal point. I, for one, owe it to my sisters in Oporto to put this into practice. Both Oddbins and Majestic offer the already enjoyable Quinta do Noval 1982 (listed by non-rapacious Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, at Pounds 16.50) at Pounds 9.99. Whitwhams of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, and Farr Vintners of London SW1 sells whole dozens of keenly-priced top vintage ports from the 1980s and 1970s. See also Christie's December 10 sale (some VAT-free parcels) and Sotheby's sale on January 20. Many 1980s and 1970s are delicious now; 1985 and 1977 are vintages to keep.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Trade deficit grows wider Britain is sliding further into deficit with the rest of the world as overseas earnings from services and financial transactions prove insufficient to plug the gap in merchandise trade, official figures showed yesterday. Fourth quarter balance of payments figures showed that the deficit on the current account widened to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.6bn from Pounds 1.8bn in the third quarter. Within this, the visible trade deficit increased to Pounds 3.8bn from Pounds 3bn while the surplus on invisibles - services, investment income and government transfers - shrank to Pounds 1.2bn from a revised Pounds 1.3bn. The figures mean that the balance of payments deficit for the whole of last year was Pounds 10.7bn compared with Pounds 10bn in 1992. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, forecast a deficit of Pounds 9.5bn in the November Budget. The invisible trade surplus for 1993 was Pounds 2.75bn. The news came as criticism of the government's official trade figures showed no signs of abating. Economists at UBS, the Swiss bank, said substantial under-recording of European Union imports - as a result of the switch to a VAT-based system for gathering intra-EU trade data - and an overstatement of the invisibles surplus pointed to a much larger current-account deficit for last year. The British Clothing Industry Association, a trade body, said EU figures on clothing and knitwear trade were so unreliable that it was refusing to show them to its members. The Central Statistical Office is conducting an investigation into the new system, introduced at the beginning of last year. It said yesterday that it did not accept what UBS said. The latest figures showed that, within the invisibles balance, the surplus on services fell to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 1.5bn in the fourth quarter. Only financial and related services recorded a fourth-quarter surplus, within the category of services. There were also higher net interest payments abroad by UK banks. These were Pounds 1.4bn compared with Pounds 1.2bn in the third quarter. Research by UBS suggests that Britain's balance of payments deficit could be twice as big as the official figures suggest. Its researchers believe the true deficit on visible goods last year was around Pounds 18bn rather than the official figure of Pounds 13.4bn.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SEASONALLY ADJUSTED BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              1991    1992    1993   1992   1992   1992                                                       Q1     Q2     Q3  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Visible trade (balance)    -10284  -13406  -13423  -2770  -3060  -3366 Invisibles (balance) Services                     3657    4202    5145   1038   1045   1082 Investment income             320    4346    2718    499    518   1644 Transfers                   -1345   -5109   -5110  -1150  -1440  -1441 Total                        2632    3439    2753    387    123   1285 Current balance             -7652   -9967  -10670  -2383  -2937  -2081  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1992    1993   1993   1993   1993                                        Q4      Q1     Q2     Q3     Q4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Visible trade (balance)             -4210   -3322  -3260  -3035  -3806 Invisibles (balance) Services                             1037    1460    719   1547   1419 Investment income                    1685      13    477   1328    900 Transfers                           -1078   -1256  -1162  -1615  -1077 Total                                1644     217     34   1260   1242 Current balance                     -2566   -3105  -3226  -1775  -2564  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

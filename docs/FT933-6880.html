			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Equal pay for women IT IS A bold move for the Equal Opportunities Commission to take the British government to the European authorities over Britain's alleged failure to implement an effective equal pay law. If it wins, the commission, whose members are appointed by the government, will have scored a decisive victory for its long campaign against what it sees as half-hearted mechanisms for enforcing the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender. If it loses, the commission will suffer a serious, perhaps terminal, loss of influence. There has been talk in recent years about rationalising the equal opportunities agencies, possibly bringing together the EOC and the Commission for Racial Equality. The commission's case is that in spite of the fact that the principle of equal pay for equal work is enshrined both in the Treaty of Rome and Britain's Equal Pay Act, it is not working well. Proceedings under the act, dealt with by industrial tribunals, are complex and lengthy - taking an average of two and a half years. As a result, there have been only 23 successful claims in almost 10 years. Since 1990, the commission has urged amendments to the Equal Pay Act without success. The final straw appears to have been the government's decision to ignore equal pay in its most recent trade union bill, while abolishing wages councils, which provide, in effect, a minimum wage in low-paid industries, such as catering, where many women work. It is certainly true that the forces driving the narrowing of pay differentials between British men and women have waned in recent years. In 1970, when the Equal Pay Act was passed, the average hourly female wage was 60 per cent of the male. By 1975, when the act came into force, the ratio was 75 per cent. Since then, the figure has only crept up to 80 per cent. It is difficult to be sure how this compares with other EC countries, since comparative figures are judged to be unreliable. The other side of the coin, however, is that in the 1980s, women found it easier than men to get jobs in all advanced economies. This is partly a result of the shift from the manufacturing to the service sector, but also in part because many women are prepared to accept part-time or more flexible working arrangements in return for lower financial rewards. In Britain during the 1980s, female employment grew at about 2 per cent a year, while male employment was static. British women may hold down a lot of low-paid and often part-time jobs, but at least they have got into the workforce. In 1992, 64.5 per cent of British women had jobs, a significantly higher figure than in Germany, France or Italy, although lower than in Scandinavia or North America, themselves polar opposites in their approach to labour market issues. This suggests a picture more complex than advocates either of extreme deregulation or tougher laws are inclined to acknowledge, especially at a time when the whole EC is rightly shifting priorities in favour of job creation rather than further regulation of labour markets. It is not clear that the EOC has adequately recognised this context. Nor is it evident that its most ambitious demand, that individual equal pay awards should in effect be applied as class actions to groups of employees, is practical. One long-running British equal pay case involves a claim by a health service speech therapist (a predominantly female profession) for pay equality with colleagues who are pharmacists (a predominantly male occupation). In a highly competitive world, employers are perhaps also entitled to ask why the process of equalising pay between men and women should necessarily involve raising the remuneration of the latter. It is ironic that this confrontation should be occurring just when Mr David Hunt is establishing himself in the role of employment secretary. Mr Hunt is, by instinct, more sympathetic to the EOC's starting point than was his predecessor. He should now seek urgently to persuade the EOC that he is serious about speeding up tribunal procedures; if he does this, the EOC should negotiate rather than litigate.</p>

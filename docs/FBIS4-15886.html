			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, President Nazarbayev met with members of the  government to discuss the development of the alternative economy  and social insurance for the low-incomed population.    Speaking of the need to accelerate privatization and to  render all-round support for entrepreneurship, in order to boost  the formation of a civilized market and overcome the economic  crisis, the president stressed that this help, at the expense of  the awaited foreign credits, will be targeted first at those  nongovernmental structures that manufacture consumer goods,  which are in great demand, and other products. In order to make  this government support for private enterprise more regular and  targeted, a relevant plan will be worked out in April with the  participation of many representatives of Kazakhstani businesses  who attended today's meeting. Nazarbayev signed a decree to  form a state commission for support of entrepreneurship.    Discussing additional measures of social protection of the  population, it was noted that those who really need such support  will receive it, namely the disabled, war and labor veterans,  families with many children, the lonely, and the sick. Taking  account of the interests of all these low-income groups, during  the meeting the head of state signed a decree increasing minimum  wages and pensions up to 100 tenge as of 1 April. In this  connection financial compensation instead of former allowances  will be increased. War veterans and people of similar status  will receive a further 330 tenge a month; war veterans -- 280;  labor invalids of the 1st and 2d groups -- 230 and 220 tenge.  The salaries of many categories of workers will also be  increased.</p>

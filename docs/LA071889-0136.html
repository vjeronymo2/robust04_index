			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY FIRM RELEASED FROM POLL GUARD SUIT  </P> <P> A federal judge Monday agreed to release a private security firm from a lawsuit  after it promised to pay $60,000 to six voters who claim they were intimidated  when the Orange County Republican Party placed guards at the polls in last  November's election.  </P> <P> The firm, Saddleback Security Services Corp., had provided GOP officials with  20 uniformed guards on Election Day.  </P> <P> Kathleen Purcell, attorney for the voters, said they agreed to spend $24,000 of  the money on legal fees to continue the case and $24,000 on voter education and  voter registration programs. She said the remaining $12,000 was to be split  among the plaintiffs.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts' settlement approval came amid strong  objections from other defendants, who claimed the security firm should be held  accountable for at least some of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that they  will have to pay in legal fees.  </P> <P> Saddleback is "obviously . . . trying to protect itself from the parties it is  really liable to," said Daniel Livingston, attorney for one of the remaining  defendants, of which there are about a dozen, including the state and local GOP  party organizations and their leaders.  </P> <P> David A. Robinson, an attorney for another defendant, agreed and argued that  the judge might ultimately determine that, but for the acts of the security  guards, there was nothing that would have caused the voters to sue.  </P> <P> But Letts was not swayed by their arguments, sticking to a tentative decision  he made six weeks ago to allow Saddleback to settle the case.  </P> <P> While making the ruling, however, Letts said that the lawyers' fees building up  in the case were of "serious concern" to him. One defendant alone -- the state  Republican Party -- has already run up fees that are twice the amount of the  settlement, he noted. While not directly referring to the state party, Letts  said he "would not like to think" that any of the defendants were engaging in  "a wear-out tactic" against the voters who filed the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the guards, who were carrying signs in Spanish warning  non-citizens not to vote, intimidated first-time Latino voters and may have  frightened them away from the polls on Nov. 8. It seeks damages for the  plaintiffs and also to overturn the narrow victory of Assemblyman Curt Pringle  (R-Garden Grove) in the 72nd Assembly District.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Responding to Rumors  </P> <P> Orange County Republican Party officials, who paid $4,000 to hire the guards at  the request of Pringle's political consultant, have said they were responding  to rumors that Democrats planned to bus in illegal voters to tip the election  outcome.  </P> <P> Letts said he was allowing Saddleback to settle with the plaintiffs because if  the case were not political it "would never have been worth more than the  amount being paid right now." He said the firm would in effect be unfairly  punished if required to stay in a drawn-out, politically charged case in the  face of escalating legal fees.  </P> <P> Some of the other defendants have contended that the guards went beyond their  instructions by approaching and questioning some voters.  </P> <P> "The political issues have to do with intent and why the security firm was  there in the first place, not really so much what they (the guards) did  contrary to their instructions," Letts said.  </P> <P> Robinson, who is acting as Pringle's attorney, complained that the state Fair  Political Practices Commission recently made it more difficult for his client  to pay his legal bills by putting a limit on the amount of contributions he can  receive from supporters.  </P> <P> "Currently, the plaintiffs are cash-heavy and we're penniless," Robinson told  Letts.  </P> <P> But the argument backfired on Robinson.  </P> <P> "It suggests to me what I already knew to be true, that the major issues here  are political," Letts said. "We have a political fight being waged in the  judicial arena."  </P></p>

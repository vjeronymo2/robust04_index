			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CBS DEATH WISH?  </P> <P> There are times when it seems that "60 Minutes," as brought to us by CBS, must  have some sort of unconscious death wish. On April 15, this same outfit which  damned itself in the Andy Rooney affair chose to give its viewers a Jewish  segment on Easter Sunday, of all days.  </P> <P> We are not religious, but we would feel it the poorest of taste for TV to be  bringing us a dope-in-the-slums program on the birthday of Martin Luther King.  We would think it a tasteless failure if "60 Minutes" brought us a segment on  the failure of the Latino parent on Cinco de Mayo. Is there no racial or  religious sensitivity at this network?  </P> <P> John D. Andrews, Palos Verdes Peninsula  </P></p>

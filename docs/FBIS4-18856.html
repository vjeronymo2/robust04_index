			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Establishes PHARE </F> Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation With East Europe"]    [Text] Brussels, 07 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- This  Wednesday [6 April], the European Commission established a  programme of cross-border cooperation, within the framework of  the PHARE [Poland-Hungary: Actions for Economic Reconversion]  programme, between the member states of the [European] Community  and the countries of Central and East Europe. This will include  the Eastern countries which have common borders with Community  member states; the Baltic States will be included based on a  broad interpretation of the concept of "maritime borders." In  practice, three Central and East European countries will remain  outside this programme, as they have no common border with the  [European] Union [EU]. They are: Hungary, the Slovak Republic  and Romania. However, the first two will have a common border  with the EU once Austria joins; then Romania will be the only  East European country to be excluded, and its case will require  special consideration. It should be pointed out that the  Commission was not able to include the FYROM [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--Skopje] in the list of countries  eligible for this programme because the Council would not allow  it to be included among the PHARE programme beneficiaries (due  to opposition from Greece). The situation could, of course,  change later on. The new programme, which will have ECU150  million in funding for 1994 is being set up at the initiative of  the European Parliament. Its objective is to promote structural  actions in the regions of the Central and East European  countries which border on the Community and are eligible for  PHARE; in the Community member states, such actions will be  co-financed by the structural funds, notably by INTERREG II  [Community Initiative concerning border areas]. Thus, projects  in the PHARE framework will be implemented in accordance with  structural policies, with INTERREG in particular. The  objectives of the new programme were largely based on programmes  of cross-border cooperation carried out by the Community. The  eligible projects are also nearly identical to those found in  the context of INTERREG II, and include, first of all, measures  for the development of infrastructures; secondly, there will be  various measures in the economic, social and technical spheres  aimed at promoting cross-border cooperation. The process of  identifying joint projects has already been kicked off by a  number of meetings between representatives from the countries of  Central and East Europe, the countries having borders with the  EU, and the Commission services. For some countries, a number  of projects affecting about three-quarters of the available  budget were identified. The draft regulation on the new  programme will be sent for information to the European  Parliament, the ESC [Economic and Social Committee] and the  Committee of Regions and will be presented to the Management  Committee in April, in view of its final adoption by the  Commission in light of this Committee's opinion.</p>

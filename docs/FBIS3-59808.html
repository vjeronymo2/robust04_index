			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shalom Yerushalmi] </F>   [Text] It does not require much imagination to picture the  emergency session of Bibi Netanyahu's strategy team on 27  November, immediately after Rafa'el Eytan announced that he  plans to run for prime minister in the next (direct) elections.  "Raful is in view, passing you on the left," one of those  present, perhaps Ayal Arad, or Dany Eyran or Eyvat Liebermann,  told the Likud chairman. "He's talking about negotiations with  the PLO, Iran, and even Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].  He's also threatening you from the right by taking an  uncompromising position on the Golan Heights. What do we do?"    Netanyahu placed two fingers on his forehead, as he likes to  do in a tough spot, thought for another minute and came up with  a tactical decision. He would adopt a statesmanlike posture,  refraining from an attack on Raful and declaring that everyone  has the right to run, for why else had he himself fought all  those years, even against Shamir and the Likud, for direct  elections? At the same time, however, Netanyahu sent his  loyalist, Knesset member [MK] Tzahi Hanegbi, to the media to  explain that Raful is exploiting the national camp and why this  is liable to cause Netanyahu's defeat.    Since then, one poll after another has been taken, and Raful  is gaining on Netanyahu (and on Rabin) to a worrisome degree.  Netanyahu, those close to him say, has long understood that no  one running for prime minister in the next elections, which will  undoubtedly be held early, will be able to win 50 percent of the  vote and prevail in the first round. Raful wants to force a  second round. In the expected face-off between Rabin and  Netanyahu, the winner will be the one who controls the middle  point. What are they doing now? They are creating an image of  pseudo-moderation. They are speaking, for example, about  cosmetic changes on the Golan Heights, and fleeing towards the  center, the key to success.    So it was that Netanyahu found himself on Tuesday, relaxed  and smiling, in the Labor faction's meeting hall on the fifth  floor of the Knesset, sitting between Avigdor Qahalani, chairman  of the lobby for the Golan, and Eli Dayan, the coalition whip,  working together with other members of the Knesset on how to  strengthen the Golan law in the Knesset and constrain Rabin, who  has drifted to the left. Netanyahu, by the way, made clear at  the meeting that he was not understood correctly, and that his  remarks about some centimeters were meant only to annoy the  prime minister, but that the public had already solidified its  impression of him as a pragmatic person, and that is what was  important.    Netanyahu also argued that he had not intended his comments  for any purpose and that he was not speaking from firm opinions.  Here too, one may believe him and those close to him, who  contend that if he had really wanted to send up a trial balloon,  he could have staked out moderate positions on issues that are  much more popular, such as the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu is no fool,  and he would not deliberately walk into the traps happily laid  for him by his rivals in the Likud's top ranks. MK Moshe Qatzav,  chairman of the Likud faction, headed off a discussion in the  faction leadership this week on "Netanyahu's remarks" after he  heard the explanations, but he asserted in private conversations  that "the government is deep in negotiations with Syria and the  Likud doesn't need to speed it up to lower the price. You can't  talk about centimeters and not about meters."    It is reasonable to suppose that Ari'el Sharon (of whom more  later) also has jumped at the opportunity and is now meeting  with his inner circle and planning how he will get to Netanyahu,  without mentioning his name, of course, during the Likud  assembly on Sunday. Perhaps he will pull out the speech he made  to the Likud central committee, which met on 17 May at the Yad  Eliyahu arena, with only minor changes. One recalls that at that  time, Sharon summoned his most sneering tone to tell those  eyeing the center: "The Alignment wants to hand over the Gaza  Strip. Even among ourselves, we have heard voices on this  subject. Fine, that's popular, it may indicate a readiness to  compromise. That puts us in the middle."    Netanyahu wants to place the Likud in the center and himself  in the center of the Likud. This is a tricky maneuver, bound to  run into obstacles, that Netanyahu adopted with all deliberation  only after the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in  September. His zigzag course since then has made still other  tactical changes of direction. Netanyahu at first totally  ignored public support for the agreement and was swept along  behind Gandhi [Rehavam Ze'evi], Sharon, Benny Qatzover, Uri  Ari'el and many other settlers who led the unruly right-wing  demonstrations outside the prime minister's residence. He failed  to offer any alternative. Even his speech to the Knesset on the  day of the signing was not particularly impressive. Today, there  is nothing to remember of Netanyahu except some superfluous  thoughts he shared with his listeners about the bitter fates  that befell Viet Nam and Korea. Netanyahu also failed to impose  party discipline on his comrades as his image continued to  deteriorate.    He and his staff realized in October that the nation was  waiting to hear a reasoned alternative. Netanyahu planned to  unveil his alternative in the Likud central committee, which  convened at the Cultural Center last month, but the Citadel  leaked out the details one by one before that to keep the  momentum up. The plan, in the end, contained nothing new and  restated his narrow political philosophy: large security zones  and Jewish settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,  which would not be subject to autonomy. The zones and the  settlements, according to the plan, would form a territorial  continuum between the coastal plain and the Jordan Valley.  Earlier proposals raised by Netanyahu's staff for changing  planks in the Likud platform and approving negotiations with the  PLO were rejected eventually by the movement's chairman.    Netanyahu himself has admitted that he has been speaking for  years about the plan that he presented to the central committee.  It represents not distilled pragmatism but only a concrete  formulation of the security aspect of autonomy. One way or  another, this recycling of ideas shook off his back his critics  from both within and without and proved, somehow, that he was  ready to deal with the new reality. He even called on Rabin this  week to hold elections on the basis of one plan against another.    Fortunately for Netanyahu, he has managed to leap into a  comfortable position in the Likud's center, between the  moderates and the extremists, even if some are certain that his  plan wipes the Camp David accords off the map. In an interview  in HA'ARETZ on the eve of the primaries, Benny Begin declared  that Netanyahu's policy was contrary to common sense and the  national interest. Nothing less. "Netanyahu, in fact, is seeking  to annul the Camp David accords," said Begin. "He has adopted  Ari'el Sharon's slogan, `Islands of autonomy in a sea of  security.' What that means is taking unilateral steps and  completely ignoring the need to reach an agreement" (2/18/93).    David Levy, Moshe Qatzav, 'Uzi Landau and Dan Meridor have  also stated since the signing of the agreement with the PLO that  it is necessary to adhere to the Camp David formula. Sharon, as  noted, has stated that we must quickly forget the autonomy plan.  That is how Netanyahu found himself positioned between the  unbending Camp David camp and the movement's "left," which is  represented by MK Me'ir Shitrit, who supports the agreement. In  contrast to all the others, Netanyahu is portrayed as a  politician who does not move too quickly but who also does not  stay stuck in place.    Netanyahu's smoke-screen tactics have worked well on the  issue of Gaza, too. Whether intentionally or not, Netanyahu has  avoiding teaming up with Begin, Sharon, and Landau, who suddenly  are all in the same boat on this subject and consider Gaza an  inseparable part of the state (Begin calls the strip an  "integral part"). On the other hand, Netanyahu has not kept  aloof from the plan offered by Roni Milo to the Likud central  committee in May calling for disengagement from Gaza. According  to a number of sources, the Likud chairman even encouraged Milo  to present his proposal. Netanyahu was heard in the past making  perfectly moderate suggestions about Gaza. Now he wants to apply  his security zone plan to Gaza as well, although he is ready to  be generous with the Palestinian population during the  negotiations over a permanent arrangement.    Inevitably, his office sometimes forces on Netanyahu  middle-of-the-road positions, even if he secretly is against  them. For that reason, Netanyahu, along with David Levy, Begin,  Qatzav, Meridor, and others, promises to observe the agreements  with the PLO even after the Likud returns to power. He knows  that the Israeli public is still prepared to give the process a  chance and that international public opinion will not tolerate  abrogation of the agreements. Any talk of annulling the peace  with the PLO, therefore, must be confined to the mouths of  Ari'el Sharon, faction whip 'Uzi Landau, and Tzahi Hanegbi.  Sharon is Sharon. Landau, an eccentric in a suit, forces his  colleagues to begin every meeting with a rendition of the Betar  [youth movement] anthem. Hanegbi announced this week that when  the Likud returns to office, he will expel every PLO official  and have 'Arafat executed. Hanegbi also gave assurances that the  public would support a platform adopting these warmhearted ideas  on the eve of the elections.    On a number of occasions, Netanyahu has stated that he would  hold talks with whomever wins the elections scheduled to be held  in the territories in another six months. If 'Arafat is elected,  he will sit down with him. Netanyahu also said that he is in  constant contact with Palestinians but, of course, he shares the  opinion of most Likud central committee members, who showered  jeers on MK Ya'aqov Shamai for his suggestion to open a channel  of communication with the PLO to gauge its intentions. And when  someone commits the grave infraction of crossing the Likud's  ideological boundaries, Netanyahu does not put up with it. After  Eli Levy, a member of the central committee, spoke about  returning territories on the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan  Heights, and sought to fly to Tunis for meetings with Yasir  'Arafat, Netanyahu threatened to expel him from the movement.  Not because of his opinions, explained the Likud chairman, but  because Levy had not raised them in the proper forum.    And then there is Shamai. After a central committee meeting  at which he made his proposal concerning a channel to the PLO,  he had a conversation with Yitzhaq Shamir, the former prime  minister. The two had a rather strange dialogue.    [Shamir] What's this proposal? Why do you need all this?    [Shamai] We need to talk with them. Even you, as prime  minister, would have kept the agreement.    Shamir: Get out. No way. This agreement would have blown up  a  lot earlier.    Now that he has found his place in the Likud, over the past  two weeks Netanyahu has renewed his attack for the middle of the  political map in an attempt to displace the Labor Party. He had  three excellent opportunities. It began, as noted, with the  Golan Law, in which he was nearly burned by the right but scored  points from the other side. Ra'anan Cohen said at a Labor  faction meeting that his party has turned left and that the  Likud has seized the center. MK Eli Goldschmidt called on Yosi  Beilin to resign because he had stated that the Jordan River is  not the security border.    Netanyahu also made a visit this week to the Jordan Valley,  another place over which a consensus exists in the Labor Party,  heard complaints from the residents and promised to work so that  the settlements of the Jordan Valley do not fall under autonomy  as a matter of law. Finally, there also came the announcement of  support for a peace agreement with Jordan. Netanyahu, who, just  like Sharon, has in recent years promoted the idea that the  Palestinian state already exists in Jordan, was not bothered by  the intrinsic contradiction. Jordan is Palestine, he explained,  but that doesn't mean that the PLO has to take over there.    Rumors were heard around the Knesset this week that  Netanyahu  is preparing the ground for bringing the Likud into a national  unity government in which he wants to serve as minister of  defense. Netanyahu has vehemently denied that, claiming that he  would go along with it only if the government changed its  platform. Meanwhile, he is getting ready for the next elections.  The municipal elections, mostly in the Jerusalem region, taught  him that in a system of direct elections, the party is only a  means, and not very important. Ehud Olmert heads the  third-largest faction on the city council, only one of its  members belongs to the Likud, and yet Olmert is mayor because he  won public support. "You have to please the general public,  satisfy everyone in some way," said Ruby Rivlin, one of David  Levy's close supporters, this week. "Netanyahu now has to play  to all the galleries. He just has to avoid losing all of them,  and mostly, losing his way."    Bibi Netanyahu is walking a tightrope. That is precisely why  he wishes the next elections were held tomorrow. He knows very  well that many candidates can promise him the second round  against Rabin, but that the war among the right-wing bloc  contestants in the first round will utterly destroy him,  particularly if Levy and Sharon are in the picture. In personal  elections, he knows, there is no mercy. In this respect, one  might consider the cases of Teddy Kollek and Ehud Olmert, and of  Roni Milo and Avigdor Qahalani. And never forget that it was  Netanyahu who got us into this whole mess.    To get down to simple truths, in the next elections  Netanyahu  is liable to bump into not just Raful but also many of those who  are plotting his death in the Likud. By law, the prime minister  will be elected for a period of two terms and his cabinet  composed of no more than 18 ministers, half of them from outside  the Knesset. Moshe Qatzav, Benny Begin, Ehud Olmert, and Dan  Meridor can wait, and perhaps some of them will become members  of Netanyahu's government, if there is one. All of them are  desperate to replace him before the end of the next elections.  Levy and Sharon know that the new system is taking them down a  path of no return. Netanyahu did not find a senior post for  Sharon in the Likud after the primaries; what about in a  government? Netanyahu does not speak to Levy. At the faction  meeting last April after the municipal elections, Levy  congratulated faction chairman 'Uzi Landau but ignored the party  chairman sitting next to him.    Levy, and even more so Sharon, are mercilessly grinding  Netanyahu down and may already have begun their national  campaign against him. Levy has said that he considered leaving  the Likud after the elections for the local authorities, but  there was some success in the meantime and he stayed in the  Likud, waiting for Netanyahu to stumble again (the "amateur," he  calls Netanyahu), particularly in social matters.    Sharon is flaying Netanyahu on practically every issue. He  describes Netanyahu as "wringing his hands on television under  the tutelage of slick personal image experts," claims that he  has a secret fund, and says that he is financially supporting  only his municipal candidates. In a letter to MA'ARIV published  early in July, Sharon contended that Netanyahu has a history of  clandestine recording.    This Sharon is so petty. During the primaries, he performed  an examination and found that Netanyahu, in his mind, has  accepted the Rabinite formula proscribing coming down from the  Golan but not withdrawing from the Golan. This nuance has  occupied Sharon's internal propaganda ever since.</p>

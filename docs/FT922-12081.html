			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Poor results for S Korea brokers SOUTH Korea's 25 securities firms suffered net losses of Won46.24bn (Dollars 58.9m) in the 1991 fiscal year ended March 31, according to estimates by the country's securities supervisory board, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. The figure represents a sharp reversal from year-earlier earnings of Won29.62bn. In contrast, six new securities firms showed combined earnings of Won46.91bn in the same fiscal year. The six firms, most of which started in the second half of 1991, are converting their businesses from short-term lending to brokering. The securities supervisory board attributed the poor results of the older 25 firms to the sluggish local stock market and tighter liquidity, which meant higher interest expenses. Meanwhile, the six new firms benefited from tighter liquidity as they were allowed to do short-term lending business on a temporary basis until the completion of their conversions. Of the 25 established firms, only six reported a rise in earnings in 1991, compared with the previous fiscal year. The six include Daewoo Securities with Won9.59bn in net earnings, up 622.1 per cent from a year ago; Seoul Securities with Won3.55bn, up 96.6 per cent; and Hanyang Securities with Won3.15bn, up 84 per cent. Daewoo, as the nation's largest securities house, fared well in securities investments in the local market compared with other companies. Earnings were also boosted by dividends of Won4bn for investments in a joint securities venture in Hungary, which started up in 1991. Tonyang Securities is the only one which swung to the black, with net earnings of Won6.9bn in 1991 from a loss of Won16.39bn a year ago. Seven companies, including Daishin Securities, Lucky Securities and Dong Suh Securities, showed full-year losses, a turnround from the black a year ago. Three companies, Ssangyong Securities, First Securities and Construction Securities, reported losses for the second straight year.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / This Week: Television Britain chugged on to the information superhighway last Friday with what is claimed to be its first public trial of digital interactive television. The trial is taking place in Cambridge and involves only 10 households at present, but the intention is to extend it to more than 1,000 customers by the end of next year. Customers are able to select from a menu of services including movies, local news and weather. No charge is being made for the trial, but the service should be fully commercial from mid-1996. The trial is being run by a consortium including Anglia Television, ATM and Cambridge Cable, and is led by Online Media, a member of the Acorn Computer Group owned by Olivetti of Italy. Cambridge Cable has some 67,000 homes in the Cambridge area on its fibre optic network. Multimedia specialists are agreed that the Cambridge trial, although small-scale, could prove a milestone for the multimedia industry. Christopher Cowan, multimedia specialist with Andersen Consulting, said that an important feature was the use of a technology called Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) to deliver multimedia services to the home. ATM offers huge transmission capacity and is seen by many as the technology that will underpin multimedia developments in the future. Malcolm Bird, Online Media's chief executive, said the purpose of the trial was to test ATM technology in the real world. A small selection of movies, news reports, documentaries and educational programmes were available for transmission. A key component of the trial is the 'set-top box' responsible for decoding the stream of digital information from the network and transforming it into sound and pictures. The Online Media box uses a microprocessor built by Advanced Risc Machines, in which Acorn has a significant stake. Bird says there had been interest from potential content-providers including Independent Television News, Woolworth and Philips Media. Woolworth was providing an electronic shopping catalogue, although it was not yet possible to use the system to order goods.</p>

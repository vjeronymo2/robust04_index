			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- Although more than 95  percent of both Taiwan's and Japan's industrial firms are small  or medium-sized, the Taiwan firms lag far behind their Japanese  counterparts in technology development, the cabinet's Council  for Economic Planning and Development reported Friday [3 June].    According to data released by the council, the technology  development capability of Taiwan industries is only one-13th  that of Japanese industries. On the scale, which sets America's  technology development capability at 100, Taiwan industries  score just 4.14 points, slightly higher than South Korea's 3.66  points, but lagging far behind Japan's 55.22 and Germany's 21.37  points, the council said.    Council officials attributed the strong competitiveness of  Japan's small and medium-sized industrial enterprises to the  full governmental support and financial assistance they receive.    Subsidies provided by the central or local government for  research and development projects of Japanese small and  medium-sized industrial enterprises are generally about 50  percent of each project, and sometimes more than 65 percent.  Public banks in Japan also offer special low-interest loans for  small and medium-sized enterprises' R&amp;D projects.    In addition, 7 percent of their annual R&amp;D budgets are  tax  deductible, the officials noted, adding that cooperation between  public research and academic units and the private sector is  another major factor that helps boost the technological  performance of Japanese industries, the officials said.</p>

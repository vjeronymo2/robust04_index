			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BELINFORM report: "Why Has It Happened This Way, and What </F> Can Be Next?]    [Text] Apparently, for many people, the results of  the first round of presidential elections were completely  unexpected. Why has it happened this way? What will be next?  BELINFORM has addressed these questions to the following  people:    Anatoliy Maysenya, director of the "East-West" Strategic  Initiatives Center:    "As a matter of fact, the `NOVAK' laboratory for axonometric  research, which had made forecasts concerning the election  course at our request, had predicted Alyaksandr Lukashenka's  victory. Still, we did not expect such an overwhelming lead  over the prime minister. I believe that this happened because  Kebich and the current political elite were unable to develop a  comprehensive platform. Due to that, during the campaign the  Cabinet of Ministers chairman's team placed emphasis not on  convincing the people, but on forceful methods. This  boomeranged. All attempts to discredit Lukashenka brought to  him people who had been undecided until the last moment. Thus,  just as in all post-socialist countries, the election results in  Belarus were a specific form of the people's protest against the  drastic deterioration of living standards."    Alyaksandr Potupa, chief of the Future Research Center:    "According to my forecasts, which are known to television  viewers and readers of many newspapers, Prime Minister  Vyacheslaw Kebich should become president. I am still convinced  that I am correct.    "No one expected such an anomalous outcome. Nevertheless, it  must be taken into account that this was only the first round.  Moreover, such results are very beneficial for our people. They  will serve as a stimulus for `a second brain convolution' to  appear. I believe that our team has every chance for victory in  the second round."    Yevgeniy Babosov, director of the Belarusian Academy of  Sciences Sociology Institute:    "I link such a large margin between Alyaksandr Lukashenka  and  Vyacheslaw Kebich to the poor organization of the prime  minister's last appearances on Belarusian television. I had the  impression that Vyacheslaw Frantsevich was afraid of direct  contacts with his opponents, and that he dodged urgent issues.  However, I know that he can hold out pretty well even during an  unbiased conversation. Therefore, this insignificant slander  against Lukashenka, made public on the eve of the election, had  a completely reciprocal effect, and increased the number of  votes cast for the latter.    "I think that there are three options for the second round.  Either, having united, candidates who lost in the election will  appeal to vote neither for Lukashenka nor Kebich, and in this  way they will `blackball' both of them; or the team, which lost  in the first round, will mobilize its ranks and analyze  mistakes, and as a result, will avenge itself; and the third  option is a landslide victory for Lukashenka."    National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, member of  Stanislaw Shushkevich's team:    "Such a huge margin between first and second places is  really  a big surprise.    "Based on the preliminary results of the first round of  voting, one can also make forecasts for the final return."    Asked whether his statement, made in an interview published  in NARODNAYA GAZETA, that he is ready to work with any president  still remains in force, Stanislaw Antonavich replied: "The  statement has been made, and I do not renounce my words. I am  ready to cooperate even with Lukashenka, but such cooperation  should be based on principles. In general, I believe that the  Belarusian leadership needs to be reshuffled."</p>

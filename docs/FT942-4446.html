			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Volatile markets hit National Mutual National Mutual, the second largest life office in Australia, yesterday announced that its profits after tax in the six months to end-March fell to ADollars 20.6m (USDollars 15.1m), compared with ADollars 112.1m a year earlier. The company said that performance in the second quarter had suffered from volatility in world equity and currency markets and the upward trend in long-term interest rates. Unrealised investment losses in the period total ADollars 50.1m. The company is currently a mutual but has mooted the possibility of changing itself into a shareholder-owned company at some stage. G. E. Crane, the New South Wales-based metal fabrication and plumbing supplies group, said yesterday that it was buying the Mico Wakefield group of companies in New Zealand for NZDollars 54.25m (USDollars 32.2m). The New Zealand company has 28 branches, employs 400 people and has annual sales of about NZDollars 140m a year. Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group which is facing an unsolicited ADollars 294m (USDollars 216m) bid from Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texan oil independent, revealed yesterday that it was in talks with other potential purchasers. P&amp;P's offer is worth 70 cents a share.</p>

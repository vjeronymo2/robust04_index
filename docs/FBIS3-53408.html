Announcing that, Hizballah officials in Beirut said today:  The objective of the Zionist regime by those attacks is to drag  the fighters of the Hizballah movement into an endless war in  order to overshadow the political issues at the coming Syrian  and American summit in Geneva.    He added: Hizballah, with full awareness of the Zionist  regime's ploy, has adopted a policy of self-restraint, but it  will retaliate for the aggressions of the occupier Zionists at  an appropriate time a place.</p>

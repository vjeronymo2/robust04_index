			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY ADDRESSES POST OFFICE PARKING TICKET PROBLEM  </P> <P> Not everybody gets to pitch $1,105 worth of parking tickets into the trash  without fear of penalty -- but Uncle Sam does.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles transportation official said Monday that the U.S. Postal Service  does not have to pay 85 tickets issued to mail carriers who parked postal  trucks overnight in a city-owned lot in North Hollywood without feeding the  parking meters.  </P> <P> The tickets were issued during the past three weeks after parking  administrators warned postal officials to begin paying $1 per vehicle for  parking overnight or to stop using the lot in the 11300 block of Chandler  Boulevard.  </P> <P> But the warning was a mistake, said Bob Yates, the city's parking  administrator. Federally owned vehicles are exempt from city parking  regulations, he said.  </P> <P> "It was a matter of the right hand not really knowing what the left was doing,"  Yates said Monday.  </P> <P> Mail carriers have used the 48-space lot to park up to 27 government vehicles  every night since the early 1970s because there is no other place to park  overnight in the neighborhood, said Bill Guest, manager of the Chandler Station  Post Office, which adjoins the lot. Prior to that, postal carriers used their  own vehicles and took them home at night, he said. Before that, they used  bicycles to deliver the mail, Guest said.  </P> <P> On Nov. 8, postal officials got a letter from the city telling them to stop  using the lot for free by Nov. 13, said Dale J.E. Herbert, acting postmaster of  the Van Nuys division, which includes North Hollywood.  </P> <P> "It's the worst time of year with the holiday mail, and then we had parking  tickets to worry about," Herbert said.  </P> <P> Yates said he signed the letter because a parking enforcement supervisor  happened to notice the postal vehicles in the lot one afternoon and was worried  that residents and shoppers in the area were being deprived of parking spots.  But Yates said more than 600 area residents have signed petitions supporting  the post office's use of the lot.  </P> <P> In addition, Councilman John Ferraro wrote to the city Department of  Transportation, pointing out that the post office maintains the city-owned lot  for free and has installed lights there. "It appears to me that two  governmental agencies must work together for the good of the entire community,"  Ferraro said in the Dec. 1 letter.  </P> <P> In retrospect, writing the warning letter to the post office and directing  parking enforcement officers to issue tickets was "probably a bit ill-advised,"  Yates said Monday.  </P> <P> Acting Postmaster Herbert called Yates' admission "quite an achievement." He  said he will take particular satisfaction in ripping up the 85 tickets because  he got a ticket last month for illegally parking his personal car when he  visited the Chandler Station post office to check out the situation.  </P></p>

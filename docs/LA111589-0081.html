The target of the bombing was Lt. Gen.  David Ramsbotham, 55, commander of the British Field Army and inspector general  of the Territorial Army, the reserve force that had served in Northern Ireland.  The sources said police defused a powerful bomb planted under a car near the  general's front door in London's Kensington area after it was discovered by a  passer-by.  </P></p>

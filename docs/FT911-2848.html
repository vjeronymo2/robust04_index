			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: An uneasy calm in London FT-SE Index: 2,471.3 (-10.8) In a faint but detectable way, the London equity market is showing symptoms of disquiet. The FT-SE is a mere 3 per cent off its record of three weeks ago and turnover is only modestly below its recent minimum of Pounds 1bn a day. But there are at least three things on the market's mind: political risk, the draining effect of rights issues and the worry that the recession may be proving longer and deeper than is in the price. It may be significant that Nomura, one of the most inveterate bulls of the London market, is more sanguine than most on the economy and still draws a bearish conclusion: consumer confidence will recover sharply, the balance of payments will collapse and interest rates will be jacked up again to protect the pound. That apart, there is no denying that the market is showing ominous signs of churning. In the early part of the year, the recovery sectors such as contracting and construction handsomely outperformed defensive sectors like brewers and food retailers. In the past month, that has gone into reverse. There is also a dangerous complacency which says that whether or not the market goes higher, it is not about to fall. But with interest rates still at 12 per cent, the onus is on the fund manager to prove that equities will do better than cash. A serious setback in equities remains hard to foresee. It could still be a good time for hedging bets.</p>

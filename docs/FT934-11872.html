			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Howard cuts Sheehy police plan MINISTERS yesterday announced that they had decided against many of the most radical proposals of the government-appointed Sheehy inquiry into police rewards and responsibilities. But they still propose to cut about 2,000 middle-ranking police jobs and introduce performance-related pay as part of fundamental police reforms. The proposals, outlined in the Commons, will also result in police pay being linked to an unspecified private-sector benchmark. Yesterday's carefully measured response to Sheehy was widely interpreted as an attempt to head off a damaging confrontation with the police at a time of widespread public concern over law and order. The government hopes to secure Royal assent for a bill implementing the changes by next summer. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the 'very far-reaching' reforms would help bring about more effective policing, while recognising the 'unique nature' of a police officer's job. In its response to Sheehy the government: Accepted that the ranks of deputy chief constable, chief superintendent and chief inspector should be abolished. This process is to be completed by April 1995. Ministers will take powers to enable a structural severance package to be implemented but hope that natural wastage in the ranks concerned means they will not have to use them. Rejected the introduction of fixed-term appointments for ranks below superintendent. Fixed-term contracts will apply to chief officer appointments from two months after the bill becomes law. Ministers will consider extending this to superintendents at a later date. Accepted the principle of performance-related pay while rejecting the formula proposed by the inquiry. Arrangements depending on an 'overall appraisal' of performance will be introduced. Under one possible scheme constables may be offered a Pounds 750 rise for commendable performance and Pounds 1,500 for outstanding work. Rejected lifting the police retirement age to 60. Accepted the linkage of pay rises to non-manual private-sector pay settlements and of pay levels to an unspecified private sector benchmark. Accepted the abolition of housing allowance for officers recruited after September 1994. Rejected a reduction in starting pay levels. Undertook to review police pension arrangements. Police leaders welcomed the package as 'a triumph of common sense'. Mr Howard said the money saved by cutting jobs would enable chief constables to put up to 3,000 more police constables on the beat or to improve support services. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / N Korea to receive Japan delegation North Korea yesterday agreed to an official visit by the three parties of Japan's coalition government, paving the way for the resumption of an official dialogue between the two neighbours, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The accord, announced by Mr Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, is part of the general unfreezing in relations brought about by the recent North Korea-US deal. Under that accord, Pyongyang agreed to accept full international inspections of its nuclear facilities in return for improved US ties and aid to replace its graphite plants - which can produce weapons grade plutonium - with safer light water reactors. The Japanese delegation, to arrive some time in November, will discuss Japanese participation in the conversion of North Korea's nuclear plants and the possible resumption of talks, broken off two years ago, on opening diplomatic relations. Of the Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.77bn) required to instal light water reactors in North Korea, Japan is expected to contribute up to 20 per cent, with 55 per cent from South Korea, and the balance from the five members of the UN Security Council, plus Canada, Australia and Germany. However, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's finance minister would like to see clear European backing for the project before going ahead. The North Korean-Japan meeting testifies to the close ties maintained with Pyongyang by the other two members of the coalition, the left-wing Social Democratic Party and the New Harbinger Party, a centre-left splinter group. Japan has shown more interest in Asian affairs since the arrival of the current government in June under Mr Tomiichi Murayama, its Socialist and pro-Asian prime minister.</p>

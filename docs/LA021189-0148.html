			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UPSCALE UNITS LURE AFFLUENT WITH AMENITIES, LOCATION  </P> <P> While young first-time home buyers constitute the biggest portion of the condo  market, there is another, more affluent market out there.  </P> <P> Some people who could afford upscale single-family homes are choosing condos  because of the low maintenance and the amenities they provide such as  recreational facilities, said real estate agent Douglas Ward, an Irvine area  condo specialist.  </P> <P> Others are going condo because the units offer more for the money than a  similarly priced single-family home, or because a condo enables them to live in  a more desirable area than they could otherwise afford.  </P> <P> Mark L. Frazier, president of Barratt American, the home builder that pioneered  500-square-foot condos in Orange County 5 years ago, said about 30% of the  market nowadays is for the so-called upscale condo.  </P> <P> "You have people with two incomes making a lot of money and they still can't  begin to come up with the down payment on a nice enough new detached home in  Orange County," Frazier said. "So they take the next best thing and buy as big  a condo as they can in the best area they can find."  </P> <P> That, said Peter Ochs, president of the Fieldstone Co., is called "the choice  market."  </P> <P> And that is why Irvine Co. owner Donald Bren's development company builds  $230,000 condos in the Westpark section of that master-planned community and  why Lusk Homes is building $500,000 condos in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> And, said Frazier, that is why Barratt no longer builds tiny starter units.  </P> <P> The company has several projects in the $150,000 to $220,000 range in Orange  County, he said, and is planning a golf course-oriented condo project in the  Tustin Ranch development; a place where base prices will run from $230,000 to  $300,000 with an additional premium of $30,000 to $50,000 for units that are  right on the fairways.  </P></p>

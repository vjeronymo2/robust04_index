The paper said the delegation wanted to "stop the  fundamentalists coming from Afghanistan from reaching Cairo  through Yemen" to carry out attacks.    The paper said the delegation was "carrying documents with  the addresses of the homes of fundamentalists" implicated in  recent attacks in Cairo.    The report said Islamic militants arrested in Egypt,  including the alleged perpetrators of an abortive attempt to  assassinate Egypt's Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi in November in  Cairo, had supplied police with these addresses.    They also provided information about camps located in Yemen  where they received training in weapons handling and explosives.    The visit to Sanaa follows a recent meeting in Tunis between  the Egyptian and Yemeni interior ministers, Hasan al-Alfi and  Muhammad Salim al-Mutawakkil.    Al-Mutawakkil told AL-AHRAM then that they had discussed the  possibility of signing a an extradition treaty to enable Egypt  to recover fundamentalists who had fled to Yemen.    He said Yemen had "set up lines of coordination with Egypt  in  the fight against terrorism."</p>

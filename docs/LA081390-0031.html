			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARRY PLANNING TO LEAVE PARTY, TOP AIDES SAY  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry is receiving conflicting advice on whether he should run for  City Council but is planning to drop his Democratic Party affiliation as a  first step, aides said Sunday.  </P> <P> Barry, convicted Friday of one cocaine possession charge and acquitted of  another, plans to drop out of the Democratic Party and register as an  independent today, said top Barry aides who spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> That would be Barry's first step toward a campaign for an at-large seat on the  District of Columbia's 13-member council, the aides said.  </P> <P> Today is the deadline for switching parties. If Barry becomes an independent,  he would then have to gather the signatures of 2,000 registered city voters  before his name could be placed on the ballot. He would compete for two  citywide council seats with winners of the Republican, Democratic and Statehood  party primaries.  </P> <P> While some of Barry's advisers feel he should resume his career, others are  wary of antagonizing U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson or  prosecutors.  </P> <P> Jackson has not yet set a sentencing date for Barry's misdemeanor cocaine  possession conviction, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison  and a $100,000 fine. U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens has not yet revealed whether he  intends to retry Barry on a dozen charges on which the jury couldn't reach a  verdict.  </P> <P> Some of Barry's advisers believe the government would be more likely to pursue  the case -- and Jackson would be more inclined to send the mayor to jail -- if  Barry is actively campaigning for office.  </P></p>

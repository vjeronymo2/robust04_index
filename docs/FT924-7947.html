			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Monitoring range of 4% to 8% set - Broad money THE CHANCELLOR an-nounced a monitoring range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent cent for the 12-month growth rate of M4 for the remainder of 1992-93. The Treasury issued the following statement yesterday: The range takes account of M4's sluggish growth during the first half of the financial year, which will depress the figures for M4's 12-month growth over the rest of 1992-93. The range is lower than would have been set at the beginning of the financial year. Broad money is one of the indicators which the authorities look at in conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates. As the chancellor explained last month, the relationship between M4 and either money GDP or future inflation is not close enough to justify a formal target for M4. Growth of M4 outside the monitoring range will not be sufficient to justify changes in interest rates, but the reasons for such a development would be studied closely and taken into account with other evidence about monetary conditions and the outlook for inflation. In monitoring M4, attention is paid to the behaviour of its components and counterparts, such as lending to the private sector, as well as its overall growth. Monitoring ranges will be set at a level consistent with progress towards the government's inflation objectives. While M4 has increased by 5 per cent over the year to September, over the past six months it has increased, after seasonal adjustment, by only 2.1 per cent, or 4.2 per cent at an annual rate. The relaxation of monetary policy since September will lead to some acceleration of M4, though not necessarily in the immediate future. A continuation of monetary growth over the remainder of 1992-93, at about the rate recorded in the first half, would bring the increase in M4 on a year earlier down close to 4 per cent by next March. This would not necessarily give additional cause for concern. Four per cent is thus an appropriate level for the bottom of the target range. For M4's 12-month growth to reach a rate as high as 8 per cent by the end of this financial year would require M4 to increase by about 1 per cent a month from now on. Persistent growth in excess of this rate might start to throw doubt on the judgments behind recent monetary relaxation. Thus 8 per cent has been chosen as the upper limit for the monitoring range. Target ranges for broad money were published in the first seven editions of the Medium Term Financial Strategy (1980 to 1986 inclusive), but the target ranges were overshot in all but two years.</p>

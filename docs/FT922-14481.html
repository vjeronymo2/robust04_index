			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Fears over UK election fuel rush for BES tax shelters FEARS that the Labour party could win this week's general election sparked a 59 per cent increase in tax shelter investments via the business expansion scheme (BES), according to provisional figures. Enterprise zone property investment, on which top-rate tax relief is also available, equalled the returns of 1990-91, in spite of the problems of the commercial property market. But business for the 1991-92 tax year, which ended yesterday, failed to fulfil expectations, thanks to the recession, which reduced the income available for tax shelter. Provisional estimates from the Allenbridge Group, a large intermediary in the BES and EZ market, are that companies qualifying for top-rate tax relief under the BES took in Pounds 407m this year, 59 per cent up on last year's Pounds 256m, the most taken in one year since the scheme started in 1983-84. BESt Investment, another intermediary, said investment since the budget had run at more than Pounds 5m a day. A surge in demand during the past two weeks brought the total invested in enterprise zone property trusts to around Pounds 160m, roughly the same as last year. EZ schemes were harmed by the financial difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, which withdrew a scheme to attract Pounds 215m last month. Tighter banking practices also dampened demand. EZ investments are often financed by loans, on which tax relief is available. But this year banks have only accepted around 50 per cent of applications, according to Mr Anthony Yadgaroff, of Allenbridge. Accountants urged companies and the self-employed to pay out bonuses in the 1991-92 tax year, rather than wait until 1992-93 and possible higher marginal taxes under Labour. This was done by many financial services companies, such as stockbrokers James Capel, and advertising agencies. Much of the money was put into tax shelters. Record business is expected for the next four days. BES companies with names such as Election Hedge will open for investment today, and allocate shares on Thursday to allow shelter before the election. Labour Party assurances not to abolish the BES in its first budget only slightly dampened demand.</p>

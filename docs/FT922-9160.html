			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: American HDTV rivals agree to share royalties AMERICAN groups offering competing technologies to establish a US standard for high definition television (HDTV) have agreed in principal to share royalties from the licensing of their technologies if one of them wins approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC is currently testing four all-digital HDTV systems. Two are offered by General Instruments, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A third has been proposed by AT&amp;T working with Zenith Electronics. In a move to 'share risks and rewards,' the American joint ventures have agreed that if one of their three systems is adopted they will share royalties. In addition, the two groups have agreed to work together to enhance the system selected as a standard by the FCC if necessary. This might be appropriate, for example, if the FCC testers find a combination of some aspects of two different systems preferable. For the time being, however, the two groups will continue to seek adoption of their respective HDTV systems. The FCC testing is expected to be completed later this year, with an FCC advisory committee scheduled to make its recommendation early in 1993 and its final selection in mid-1993. Mr Richard Wiley, chairman of the FCC advisory committee on advanced television responsible for conducting the HDTV tests, said that the agreement is a 'positive development that will help us to achieve our ultimate goal of the best possible standard'. However, he said that the agreement will not affect the committee's decision or disadvantage other entrants. Also competing in the standard setting tests is an international consortium led by Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France, together with NBC, a unit of General Electric and the David Sarnoff Research Center in the US.</p>

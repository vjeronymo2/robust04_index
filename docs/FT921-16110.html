			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Welsh Development Agency steps up its drive to reclaim old coal-mining tips The Welsh Development Agency is stepping up its drive to reclaim old coal-mining tips, Anthony Moreton writes. South Wales in particular had thousands of tips, the result of more than two centuries of dumping pit waste next to collieries. After the 1966 Aberfan disaster, when a tip slid on to a school killing 116 children and 28 adults, a campaign began to remove tips or make them environmentally more acceptable. About 19,000 acres of derelict land, an area bigger than Cardiff, have been reclaimed and much of it has been used to build factories, houses, shops and sports fields. Many tips can be mined and their coal waste turned into a saleable product. British Coal has a 15m-tonne scheme to reclaim coal in Merthyr Tydfil. Mr Gwyn Griffiths, director of land reclamation at the agency, said: 'Our target is to clear all major industrial eyesores by the mid 1990s. This will involve the reclamation of 30,000 acres of land.' Almost a fifth of the agency's Pounds 150m budget goes towards land reclamation. More than 70 of the reclaimed sites have been used for industry.</p>

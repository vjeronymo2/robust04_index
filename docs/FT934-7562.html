			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Scots enterprise bodies to be probed THE COMMONS committee on Scotland is to inquire into the workings of Scottish Enterprise, the network of enterprise agencies in Scotland set up in 1991. The inquiry, to include Highlands and Islands Enterprise, will look into recent claims by the Scottish media and opposition politicians that the network is ineffective. Scottish Enterprise has also attracted criticism over potential conflicts of interest involving board members of the local enterprise companies. Scottish Enterprise sees the select committee inquiry, which will take place in the new year, as a chance to rebut criticism and to present its record to detailed scrutiny.</p>

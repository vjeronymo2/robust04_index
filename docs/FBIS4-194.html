			<p>BFN     [Text] Ndjamena, April 1 (AFP) -- Human rights groups here  Friday [1 April] deplored a massacre in the eastern town of  Abeche which left over 200 dead and missing in January.    A report issued by a commission of enquiry set up by five  human rights groups said 201 people had been killed and 23 were  missing in the wake of clashes between government forces and  Chad National Front rebels in the town located 500 kilometers  northeast of here.    The government at the time said that 30 rebels and two  soldiers were killed when the armed opposition group attacked  the garrison in Abeche on January 23.    Most of the rebels, who had earlier agreed to a ceasefire  and  then reportedly turned on the government forces, reportedly  escaped with a number of weapons.    But the commission of enquiry said that 201 people had died,  either in the original clashes or in army mop-up operations in  the town afterwards, and that there had been numerous cases of  torture, rape and pillage by government forces against the  civilian population.    "All cases of summary execution were the work of the  gendarmes and of the soldiers, mostly the Republican Guard whose  main leaders are known and have been identified," the report  said.    The Republican Guard is an elite army unit which takes its  orders directly from the head of state.    The government forces combed the city looking for rebels who  might have gone into hiding after the original clashes "and this  operation very quickly turned into a man-hunt", according to the  report which spoke of 136 people killed in the city and the  others nearby.    The investigators also met with 23 captured rebels who were  being held in very poor conditions and of whom those wounded  were not receiving medical attention.</p>

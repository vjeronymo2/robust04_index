			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Best practice must come sooner, not later Sir, I share Barry Riley's optimism in his article on accounting frameworks ('Prudence and pragmatism in German reporting', September 28) that good financial statements will eventually drive out the bad. I wonder, however, whether Europe can or should wait that long? Faced with a requirement for new capital, it will be increasingly tempting for companies to look to the integrated capital market of the US, where the financial reporting rules, although onerous, are coherent. The implications for the fragmented equity markets of Europe are clear. European accounting standards setters, governmental or private sector, must work fast to provide a financial reporting framework that truly matches the concept of the single market.

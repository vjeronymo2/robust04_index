			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Howard sparks race row: European veto issue heightens tensions in campaign The Conservatives yesterday accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of seeking to undermine Britain's immigration controls, as the row over the UK's ability to block decisions made in Brussels gained pace. Raising the race issue for the first time in the increasingly ill-tempered European campaign, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said it was vital that Britain kept its European Union veto over immigration and asylum matters. This was because firm immigration controls were 'the foundation of good race relations'. By espousing policies that would 'fatally undermine' Britain's veto, both opposition parties were putting at risk 'our immigration controls and our race relations legislation'. Mr Howard added: 'They would make race relations in this country significantly worse.' The two opposition parties hit back strongly, with Labour saying it had asked the Campaign for Racial Equality to investigate the Conservative 'race scares'. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour campaign manager, said his party had repeatedly made clear it would retain the British veto on justice and immigration issues as well as on taxation, defence and security matters. 'The Tories go on telling lies about us, and I go on saying that they lied their way through the 1992 general election,' he said. 'We are not going to let them get away with lying their way through this one.' Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, said it was 'distasteful' for the Conservatives to 'play this card at this stage in the campaign'. It was 'not at all appealing to see this sort of jingoism.' Meanwhile, Mr Paddy Ashdown used a visit to Eastleigh, where the Liberal Democrats are hoping to sweep to victory in a parliamentary by-election next month, to attempt to tackle suggestions that the party's policy on Britain's veto was in disarray. Mr Ashdown drew a distinction between the legislative and executive decisions in the European Union. He said the Liberal Democrats supported the retention of the national veto in executive decisions but not in the legislative. National issues, such as defence, finance and immigration would also be subject to an effective national veto because of the party's support for double qualified majority voting. Mr Ashdown also made clear that any change in the national veto would be the subject of a referendum. However, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said Mr Ashdown's distinction between legislative and executive decisions was far too blurred to be of any meaningful use. Mr Ashdown's commitment to turn the Council of Ministers into a 'Euro-cabinet' showed he would settle for 'nothing less than a centralised European superstate'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, also campaigning in Eastleigh yesterday, accused the Tories of dishonestly pretending they were the true defenders of Britain's sovereignty against European legislation. She said that the government had surrendered Britain's veto in Europe eight years ago when it signed the Single European Act - and that this was being conveniently forgotten in the Conservatives' European election campaign. She added that the Tories were insisting that a Labour government would surrender Britain's veto in Europe in spite of repeated denials by opposition MPs. 'We have refuted this silly lie, but repeatedly they allege it and repeatedly it resurfaces,' she said. Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. S.: "Is Part-Time Work Cheaper? Flexible </F> Working Hours as an Employment Policy Tool"]    [Text] According to a study of the McKinsey  Deutschland business consulting firm, numerous jobs could be  created in an economically viable manner with flexible part-time  work solutions. The research study arrives at cost savings of up  to 20 percent, which, at least in part, should be passed on to  the part-time workers. A study presented on Thursday [21 April]  by ETH Zurich points in a similar direction.    Unemployment in Switzerland seems to be declining slowly  once  again, but thinking about possible ways out of the employment  crisis remains a necessity. For one thing, in Switzerland, with  an unemployment rate only half that in many surrounding  countries, we cannot and should not think of ourselves as an  island of the blessed. For another, 180,000 unemployed are far  too many unemployed. The idea of a general reduction of  work time plays an especially prominent role in the public  discussion about instruments of employment policy. Discussion  about this subject in the media has gained in substance  recently, but even with varied arguments, the simplistic and  static notion comes through that a reduction of work time must,  in principle, lead to a corresponding increase in employment.  <H5>  Advantages for Both Sides </H5>   Of particular interest in this context is a comprehensive  research project by McKinsey Deutschland, which in the past few  weeks has been quoted repeatedly and fragmentarily. (Dividing  and Gaining, "The Potential of the Flexible Shortening of Work  Hours," McKinsey &amp; Co., 1994 (Project Management: Helmut  Hagemann). It concludes that the systematic introduction of  flexible part-time work offers the best possibilities  for alleviating the problem of unemployment, and it supports  this with ample microeconomic research and data. According to  the study, a massive acceleration of part-time work in Germany  that pays due regard to the diversity of business and individual  realities could net a maximum of 1.4 million full-time or 1.9  million part-time jobs. If we apply this thesis to Switzerland,  we probably will not come up with analogous figures. In other  words, the effect on employment would clearly be less than  150,000. The part-time rate in the Federal Republic--a good 15  percent--is only a little more than half that in Switzerland (28  percent). On the other hand, what is applicable is the basic  individualistic assessment of the study, which considers only  those jobs as part-time potential the reapportioning of which  would be desirable for both sides, for employers and  employees. According to the study, that applies to 24 percent of  existing full-time jobs. We are talking here about those jobs  for which conversion to part-time, despite conversion costs for  the business, would yield cost advantages and whose present  "holders" would be prepared to accept a reduction in work hours  if losses in wages could be kept within bounds.  <H5>  Gaining Through Dividing </H5>   In a sense, the McKinsey study removes the contrast between  the desire of the employer for a proportionate  reduction in wages in the case of an all-encompassing reduction  in work time and the demand of the employee for at least partial  wage compensation. How is this successful? According to the  study, cost reductions in a significant degree can be expected  through advantages of flexibility: Individually tailored  part-time models should produce average savings of  about 20 percent of the personnel costs of part-time workers.  These savings are rooted first in higher labor  productivity, which is the result of less fatigue as well  as better motivation. Second, flexible part-time work would  produce reductions in costs resulting from fluctuating  work capacity. The thinking here is cyclical part-time  plans, say, annual work hours contracts on a part-time basis or  a "block model" (for example, nine months of work, three months  off). Third and finally, an increase in capital deepening could  bring advantages. With voluntary flexibility and reduction of  work hours, work time and business hours could be expanded, and  thus capital could be better utilized.  <H5>  Destigmatizing Part-Time Work </H5>   McKinsey people feel they can limit the financial effects on  workers in two ways and thus increase willingness to  work part time. For one thing, the progressive taxes and dues  structure causes available income to be reduced less than  performed work time. For another, the study appeals to  businesses to pass along a part of the savings gained through  part-time work to the employees. Without a partial wage  adjustment, the authors feel that sufficient acceptance  cannot be achieved. Besides a lot of detailed technical  analysis, the McKinsey study is mainly an argument for a  positive part-time climate. Part-time work today is  associated too much with marginal activities like janitoring and  cleaning or, at most, simple office work. Managers still think  too much about additional costs and disturbances in the work  plan, which we know from traditional part-time regulations. And  this form of work is too often thought of as a career dead end,  the study says. The study suggests not only giving workers  comprehensive information concerning part-time models as well as  a promotional campaign showing financial advantages, but it goes  further: Should dismissals prove necessary, they should not  primarily affect those workers who agreed to flexible and  shortened work hours. The authors feel that willingness to work  part-time should reduce the threat of dismissal and be seen as a  plus for promotions.    In its principal thrust, the McKinsey study agrees with a  study on the same subject presented in Zurich on Thursday [21  April], which was carried out by the ETH [Federal Technical  School] and sponsored, among other things, by the SMUV [Swiss  Metalworkers and Watchmakers Association]. (Hans Wuergler,  Publisher: Work Hours and Unemployment. A Discussion of  Employment Policy in Switzerland. Zurich, 1994) It, too, rejects  across-the-board shortening of work hours and emphasizes the  importance of voluntarism, individuality, and  flexibility. The Zurich study, published by Professor Hans  Wuergler, points in this connection above all to the  possibilities of moving away into the shadow economy  and to the flight toward overtime, which are contrary to any  general solution. Moreover, both studies, strongly emphasize the  exceptional importance of cyclical work hours models,  which adapt flexibly to seasonal as well as to economic  fluctuations. According to the ETH study, this requires for  Switzerland especially a reform of part-time insurance.  <H5>  The Contribution of Politics </H5>   While McKinsey strongly addresses businesses and attempts  painstakingly to prove to them that flexible part-time models  now and then--more precisely: in about 60 percent of all jobs  after two years at most--pay off, the ETH study reminds us more  strongly of the present political conditions. It  calls especially for a lowering of the fixed costs of labor  through, among other things, a reform of the national insurance  system (mainly greater generosity in the pension funds); through  more preventive measures aimed at further training on the part  of unemployment insurance; through financing unemployment  insurance, say, by means of an energy tax or using general  funds, but certainly not by means of higher wage deductions; and  finally through liberalization of policies governing aliens.    Above all, both studies realize that the potential of making  work hours more flexible is by no means exhausted and that with  the right steps one could do more than reduce unemployment. What  is more, making work hours more flexible could contribute to  social development and to strengthening each  individual's control over his or her time.</p>

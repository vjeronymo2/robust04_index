			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Partnership can deliver vocational education Sir, Regarding your report 'Agency attacks funding of courses' (May 2), your readers will be interested to hear of further developments in our relationship with the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and the progress of the government's programme to develop vocational education. I reported to the select committee on employment that a successful working partnership has been established with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ), leading to recent accreditation for some of our courses. The first diploma in business and finance - to introduce vocational education into schools - was accredited last month. NCVQ accreditation is the key to recognition by the Tecs for funding purposes. Our courses need NCVQ accreditation to gain listing by the Training, Enterprise and Education Division (TEED). This listing in turn frees Tecs to fund students on BTEC-validated vocational courses. My comments about the need for a national strategy for vocational education were made in support of the present government's, and indeed the opposition's, declared intention to put in place a system of vocational education which is linked to vocational training in the workplace. We welcome the prospect of a white paper from the Department of Education and Science on education for 16-19-year-olds. We anticipate that it is likely to create the second pillar of a national strategy which will link schools and colleges with the activities of the 82 Tecs. An especially welcome development from BTEC's point of view is the growing consensus across the political spectrum in favour of vocationally-based education. We believe that the successful delivery of a national vocational education system can only be achieved if there is a positive partnership between education and employers, with government giving the lead.

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Shake-up urged in EC car and aircraft sectors THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday proposed improvements in research and training programmes for the EC aircraft and motor industries as the centrepiece of a series of suggestions for making both sectors more competitive internationally. The long-awaited Commission documents - launched simultaneously by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner - follow an examination of the state of the two industries. The Commission has concluded that neither industry is in crisis, but that both face big challenges over the next decade. Companies hoping for more concrete financial support from Brussels are likely to be disappointed with the documents, however. In line with the broad industrial policy paper produced in December 1990, the Commission steers clear of specific funding commitments in both sectors, and aims instead to encourage the companies themselves to take action. 'The European automobile industry is certainly competitive, although it has some weak points,' said Mr Bangemann yesterday. 'These can take care of themselves if we provide the necessary accompanying measures.' In the automotive sector, the Commission believes that EC production will rise to 16m vehicles in the year 2000, compared with 13.7m in 1991. But at the same time, EC manufacfrom their Japanese counterparts. The latter achieve double the EC's productivity rates with a younger workforce, according to the Commission, and will have full access to the European market from the end of the century under the terms of last July's EC-Japan agreement on imports. Aircraft manufacturers face a more varied series of challenges, according to the Commission, including a drop in military orders, dollar exchange rate fluctuation and fragmentation of Community research funding. In the motor industry, the Commission's principal suggestions include: Improved co-operation on R&amp;D between manufacturers, including greater emphasis, as in Japan, on exploiting the results of so-called 'pre-competitive' research. A new emphasis on prevention rather than cure of unemployment, including improved on-the-job and general training schemes and greater collaboration between car-makers and training colleges to anticipate redundancies. Encouragement for the EC's 3,200 equipment manufacturers to collaborate in competing with Japan's more streamlined equipment sector. In the aircraft sector, the main points include: A suggestion that there should be 'substantial' Community support for research and technology in the EC's 1994-98 research programme, although no specific figure is mentioned. Establishment of a working group to examine ways of coping with exchange rate fluctuation, which could include a self-financed exchange rate guarantee scheme. Improved training, and greater co-operation with east European aircraft manufacturers.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Rolls-Royce hopes for Asian breakthrough Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, has emerged in pole position to supply its new large Trent engines for the latest stage in the multi-billion dollar fleet expansion and renewal programme of Singapore Airlines (SIA). The potential engine order worth Dollars 200m or more would represent a breakthrough for the UK company in the fast growing Asia-Pacific aviation market by penetrating one of the world's most profitable and prestigious airlines which has traditionally opted for US engines. Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said the airline was planning to bring forward its decision to acquire between 10 and 20 new widebody twin engine aircraft both for expansion and replacement of older aircraft. SIA is expected to decide early next year whether to opt for the European A330 twin engine widebody or its rival, the Boeing 777. Rolls-Royce is offering its heavy thrust Trent engines for both aircraft. Although SIA has traditionally chosen Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for its large airliners, Dr Cheong suggested that SIA was interested in diversifying its large engine suppliers now that its fleet was growing. SIA currently operates a fleet of 65 widebody aircraft and expects its fleet to grow to 111 aircraft by 2003. In June, it placed a record Dollars 10.3bn order for 52 Boeing and Airbus widebody airliners including firm orders and options. The new order would complete SIA's fleet renewal and expansion programme. SIA has already had talks with Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong based airline which flies a fleet of Rolls-Royce powered aircraft, over possible co-operation in engine maintenance. 'The idea would be for SIA to service Cathay's CFM engines jointly built by General Electric of the US and Snecma of France while Cathay would service SIA's Trents if it were to go ahead with a Trent order,' said another Asian airline executive in Singapore. SIA has 17 Airbus A340 four engine aircraft on firm order, all powered by CFM engines similar to those equipping the A340s ordered by Cathay. In turn, Cathay has ordered Trent powered Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s. The competition between the three leading engine manufacturers (GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce) to supply their new heavy thrust power plants has become intense because of the huge sums invested in developing these engines in the midst of the worst post-war recession in civil aviation. Senior Rolls-Royce executives have recently stepped up their campaign with SIA including visits this month from Sir Ralph Robins, the Rolls-Royce chairman, and Mr John Rose, head of the UK company's aero-engine activities.

The  private sector has played a positive role in developing the  social productive forces and in improving the people's living  standards.    According to statistics compiled by the State Administration  for Industry and Commerce, by late September last year,  individual industrial and commercial operators had increased to  16 million, hiring 26 million people, up 11.7 and 14 percent  respectively over the same period the previous year. Private  enterprises had increased to 210,000, employing 3.31 million  people, up 72.6 and 62.4 percent respectively over the same  period the previous year. The taxes paid to the state annually  by individual operators and private enterprises averaged 20  billion yuan, accounting for 7.8 percent of the state's total  industrial and commercial tax revenues. The private sector took  on about 1 million redundant laborers, making up 10 percent of  workers employed by all businesses throughout the country.    In Guangdong and Fujian, which carried out reform and opened  to the outside world earlier than other areas, individual  operators and private enterprises have grown faster. In  Guangdong, there are 1.3 million self-employed operators, and  private enterprises with registered capital exceeding 1 million  yuan number 1,000. In Fujian there are 540,000 self-employed  operators and private enterprises, with their total registered  capital hitting 7 billion yuan. In Henan, an inland province,  there are now 900,000 self-employed operators and private  enterprises, the best record for the last 43 years.    At present, individual industrial and commercial businesses  and private enterprises are allowed to operate in bonded areas,  development areas, and experimental areas. In addition,  development areas for the private economy have been set up in  Shanghai, Shenyang, and Dalian, and investment areas for private  enterprises have been set up in Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Anhui,  Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. All this is the first major change in  the private sector on the mainland.    The second change is that the private enterprises have  expanded unprecedentedly in terms of their trades and scope,  with operations having extended to all trades allowed by the  government. There is every indication that they now are  beginning to penetrate such important industries as aviation,  chemicals, electronics, building materials, grain and edible  oils, and even into the cultural, educational, and public health  fields. For instance, private schools and hospitals have been  established in various places.    Private enterprises are allowed to establish horizontal  trans- sectoral and transregional economic ties, and to take  stock in, run by lease, contract to run, purchase, and annex  collectively owned and state enterprises. A total of 46 state  and collectively owned enterprises were purchased and annexed by  individual operators and private enterprises in Zhejiang alone  last year. This is the third change in the private sector.    The fourth change is that more and more private enterprises  are moving toward the international market by setting up joint  ventures with foreign businessmen. According to incomplete  statistics provided by 12 coastal provinces and cities,  Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises set up by private  enterprises and foreign businessmen have topped 400. Private  enterprise groups also have grown in number and scope with each  passing day. Some private enterprise groups have hired more  than 1,000 employees and their annual output value has reached  10 million or even 100 million yuan. About 5,000 to 6,000  private enterprises have earned foreign exchange by exporting  products and have carried on border trade. A number of  self-employed operators and private enterprises have done  business, set up factories, opened companies, and engaged in  property development in foreign countries.    The fifth change is that a number of college graduates,  experts, professors, public figures, and retired cadres have  joined private enterprises over the last few years with the  result that the average age of employees of private enterprises  has dropped and that their cultural level, professional level,  social status, and reputation have been raised greatly.    The private sector on the mainland has risen from oblivion  and is playing a greater and greater role in the national  economy. With the increase in the number of foreign-funded  enterprises and with more and more state enterprises being taken  over by private enterprises, the gap between different economic  sectors gradually will narrow and they will compete on an equal  footing. As private enterprises operate flexibly and adapt  themselves quickly to market needs, they will grow at a greater  pace.</p>

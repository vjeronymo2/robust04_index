			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Consumer prices show 0.4% gain THE UNDERLYING pace of US inflation remained moderate despite a 0.4 per cent gain in consumer prices last month. The Labour Department, which reported the latest figures yesterday, said that the increase partly reflected a 1.9 per cent increase in energy costs after petrol taxes were raised by 4.3 cents a gallon on October 1. The year-on-year rate of inflation rose to 2.8 per cent, against 2.7 per cent in September. The relatively poor consumer price figures followed exceptionally good wholesale price figures earlier this week. The producer price index for finished goods declined 0.2 per cent last month. Bond prices fell modestly as many traders had hoped that the drop in wholesale prices would be reflected in the consumer price data. Taking the two sets of figures together, however, 'inflation is stable to lower', said Mr William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed governors and regional presidents meet next week to discuss monetary policy. Most analysts expect the Fed to leave short-term interest rates, currently 3 per cent, unchanged for the next few months. But a tightening of policy is widely expected sometime next year. Last month's consumer price increase was the largest since April. However, it followed a zero increase in September and moderate gains during the summer. Apart from energy, the main upward pressures on the index came from food prices, up 0.6 per cent from September, and housing, healthcare and entertainment, which registered 0.5 per cent increases. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.3 per cent last month and by 3 per cent in the year to October. The annual increase in core prices was the lowest for two decades. In recent weeks, signs of an acceleration of economic growth in the second half of the year have dented confidence in bond markets. Investors worry that faster growth will put upward pressure on inflation, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates which would cause bond prices to fall. Most forecasters, however, say that there is enough slack in the economy to prevent inflation rising much above its current rate of about 3 per cent. Some predict a further slight decline in inflation.</p>

In its reaction to Thursday's night terror attack in Cape  Town, the AVF called on the government and State President F W  de Klerk to stop shadow-boxing with mere election statements, as  though the country was in a peaceful election campaign.  "Instead it should not evade its responsiblities to uphold law  and order even if the TEC seems to have the de facto power,"  said Mr Maninger.    Government negotiator Roelf Meyer could use this opportunity  to prove his past statements that implementation of the TEC did  not rob the government of its power. "It is clear to us that  since the TEC has come into effect there is a definite increase  in violence. We believe that this is possibly the result of the  fact that the same organisations actively conducting terror  operations against political opponents are perhaps also playing  a major role in the decision-making process within the TEC."    In view of the increasing violence, Mr de Klerk's recent  electioneering attacks on his political opponents were not only  pathetic and fake but reminded the AVF of Nero playing the  fiddle while Rome was burning.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Zurich to pay Pounds 70m to MMI ZURICH INSURANCE expects to pay about Pounds 70m for Municipal Mutual Insurance's local authority and some other insurance business, it emerged yesterday. Neither Zurich nor MMI, the local authority-owned insurer that withdrew from the market last year, would previously disclose financial details of the deal, completed this month. Mr Maurice Stonefrost, MMI chairman, told an extraordinary general meeting that Zurich would pay about Pounds 50m for the new insurance businesses, although the exact amount would be linked to the level of business written by Zurich over three years. Zurich would also pay MMI Pounds 20m to acquire the net assets. MMI retains financial liability for all claims arising on business underwritten before September 30 1992. It proposes that its members (also its biggest policyholders) approve a directors' voluntary scheme of arrangement, averting the need for provisional liquidation should assets be insufficient to meet liabilities.</p>

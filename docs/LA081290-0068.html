			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ETERNAL COMBAT OF HAN AND JONG;  </P> <P> THE SHADOW IN THE SUN BY MICHAEL SHAPIRO (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $19.95; 252  PP.)  </P> <P> In the past four decades, more than a million Americans have spent up to two  years each in South Korea. Although American servicemen have been to Japan and  Europe in large numbers too, South Korea occupies a unique void in the American  consciousness. With the exception of a few scholarly works, nothing has been  written by a serious American writer about Koreans and their society.  </P> <P> With this collection of 20 portraits of ordinary -- as well as some very  extraordinary -- Koreans, Michael Shapiro has gone a long way toward filling  this void, and he has done it with a mixture of sympathy, criticism and irony  that will fascinate even those readers who never will visit Korea.  </P> <P> Shapiro is there when a family of squatters is forced to move from their  hillside hovel to make way for new apartments they are too poor to afford. He  interviews a woman who makes her living by having her breasts fondled by  customers in a rural coffee shop. And he briefly follows the life of a shy  young man who resists family pressure and refuses to marry the woman of his  parents' choice. He talks to a released political prisoner, a family of  refugees-turned-millionaires, and an elderly male dancer who at the height of  his career was the greatest exponent of the female dance of salpuri, through  which Korean women traditionally have rid themselves of the all-encompassing  sense of bitterness which Koreans call han.  </P> <P> Perhaps the one unifying theme of "The Shadow in the Sun" is the concept of  han, and the mercurial shifts of mood which many Koreans are given to as they  catapult themselves between han and jong (passionate love), the other extreme  of the emotional spectrum.  </P> <P> There is han in the lives of the evicted squatter family, in the moods of the  coffee-house hostess unable to collect debts from the men who fondle her and  leave her with worthless IOUs, and -- by a recent leap of logic -- there is  also han in the hearts of Korean student radicals who demonstrate against their  country's military-backed regimes and the United States government, which they  see as the ultimate sponsor of the domestic forces that oppress them.  </P> <P> "There is the han of the police state and the han of progress," writes Shapiro,  "There is the han imposed by outsiders -- especially the great powers, most  especially the United States. And there is the han that is not acknowledged,  the han of the hatreds and cruelties Koreans inflict upon one another."  Earlier, Shapiro observes that "each day in Korea somebody is fighting and  losing to another fellow, who is always wrong and who will not be forgiven."  </P> <P> Shapiro is at his best in his vignettes of the daily lives of ordinary people.  In one episode, two greedy women come to a fortune-teller, who disappoints them  by failing to give his approval for the marriage of the son of one to the  daughter of the other.  </P> <P> "What's wrong with marrying him off this year? Why can't we hurry this marriage  along?" asks one of the women. "The girl's mother has approved my son. I like  her too."  </P> <P> But the fortuneteller is practical. "Who cares if you and the girl's mother  like her? They have to like each other."  </P> <P> Warned against lending money for a while, the woman pleads with the  fortuneteller. "Not even a little?" Shapiro concludes with the sentence,  "Luckily, she knew other fortunetellers."  </P> <P> "Shadow," however, is not without a number of flaws, some of which are likely  to irritate those familiar with Korean history. One recurring problem is the  author's acceptance at face value of the myth of Korea's "5,000-year history."  The earliest existing Korean dynastic history dates only from the present  millennium, and the earliest Chinese reference to a kingdom in Korea (ruled in  fact by a Chinese refugee) is in the second century BC. A reader who accepts  that Korea is 5,000 years old might be only mildly surprised by the members of  the fringe religion the author interviews who claim that the Korean nation  actually was founded 10,000 years ago.  </P> <P> Another problematic figure is the number of Americans who died in the Korean  War (54,000 according to Shapiro, 33,629 according to UN statistics). There  seem to be a few others too, such as the numbers of incidents along the DMZ.  Shapiro lets stand the ludicrous figure of 99,952, given by a tour guide. This  works out to more than eight hostile acts per day every day since the 1953  cease-fire.  </P> <P> Some readers also may find it difficult to accept the author's starkly  black-and-white view of the regime of former president Chun Doo Hwan. While it  is true that Chun was heavy-handed with the press, it also is worthwhile to  take note of how he successfully co-opted the media in truly Machiavellian  fashion by giving those papers he did not close down a chance to reap enormous  profits. Under Chun, news reporters were a pampered lot who kept quiet not so  much out of fear as out of the knowledge that they had a vested interest in the  regime. Chun gave 20% tax breaks to reporters, sent scores on "overseas study  tours" and provided generous scholarships to their offspring. Exposing the  calumnies of fallen dictators may make one feel good, but understanding how  they succeeded is in the long run probably more useful.  </P> <P> In spite of its flaws, "The Shadow in the Sun" does what it sets out to do,  which is to reveal the emotional flavor of a country that both attracts and  repels at the same time. In an unusual twist, the author starts his book with a  scene of himself at an airport eagerly awaiting the departure of his plane. "I  am drained by Korea. I am exhausted by its moods," he writes.  </P> <P> It was the last day of the Seoul Olympics and Shapiro, a sports- writer, was  fleeing from an example of Korean han that became news around the world.  American reporters had been warned of the outpouring of Korean ill-will against  them because of the wide coverage NBC gave to a boxing match a few days earlier  which ended with Korean boxing officials pummeling a New Zealand referee who  had had the audacity to rule against a Korean contestant. According to Korean  logic, NBC -- and by extension all of the United States -- had humiliated Korea  before the world by using its high-tech satellite equipment to beam this  embarrassing scene to all corners of the world.  </P> <P> Three years earlier, the author had fallen in love with South Korea when he  arrived from cold and reserved Tokyo, which "had none of Seoul's vibrancy, none  of its life." But upon leaving at the end of the Olympics, he writes, "(I) have  begun to feel as if I were locked in a small room with a manic-depressive."  </P> <P> The phrase is likely to be repeated often by many a visitor forced by business  or the whims of air carriers to remain an extra day or two in limbo between han  and jong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> (Excert)  </P> <P> Sometimes her eyes hurt, especially after a long shift. A long shift might last  eighteen hours. But this work, she explained, was better than the work she had  done before, at a fabric factory where it was hot and dusty. Miss Kim came from  the countryside. As her older brothers and sisters had, she left her parents'  home the day after graduating from high school. She stayed with her brother  and, through a friend, found a job.  </P> <P> 'I heard through the older girls that I would work hard all day but I could  earn lots of money,' she said. 'I thought I'd save more money, but my savings  plan was unrealistic. I was going to send a third to my mother and save the  rest for my dowry.'  </P> <P> 'Do you enjoy the city?' I asked.  </P> <P> 'No, I want to go home,' Miss Kim said. 'There is no green here. I was  disappointed in city people. They have bad values. . . . I've tried but I'm  becoming like that.' -- From "The Shadow in the Sun"  </P></p>

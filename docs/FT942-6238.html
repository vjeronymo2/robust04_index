			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / German health scandal claims Mr Horst Seehofer, German health minister, gives evidence to a parliamentary committee today about mounting charges that heart surgeons have been falsifying the cost of operations, part of an alleged network of abuse which may total up to DM45m (Pounds 18m). The federation of health insurance funds said some doctors had been pocketing up to DM3,000 per cardiac valve they fit. Another insurance association said it had evidence that prices for artificial joints and other products had also been inflated. Mr Seehofer said a senior official had been discussing the claims since February. Public prosecutors and local health insurance funds had meanwhile taken over the investigations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 2 -- President Lech Walesa said on  Sunday [2 January] in an interview for the Italian daily LA  STAMPA that there was a threat of new east-west confrontation  like the cold war unless the European Union embraced the East  European countries that had been in the Eastern European bloc.  If the European Union and NATO do not admit the Eastern  European countries, Russia would seek to re-assert its influence  in the region, said the president. If Europe and NATO decided  within a short period of time, six months at the most, to expand  gradually towards the European countries that were communist,  then the field of confrontation would diminish, Walesa stressed.  He added that otherwise Russia will take the initiative,  exercising economic pressures on Poland and countries more  important than Poland like Ukraine. We will have to give in to  compromises and the former Soviet bloc will organise itself  again, concluded Walesa.</p>

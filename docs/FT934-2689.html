			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Hungary mourns death of premier Antall Mr Jozsef Antall, Hungary's conservative prime minister and eastern Europe's longest- serving leader, died yesterday afternoon at the age of 61, after heart trouble compounded his cancer condition. His death, after 3 1/2 years in office, follows a long battle against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer with which the prime minister was diagnosed in 1990, the year he and his centre-right coalition were elected. The demise of Mr Antall, leader of the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum, threatens political turbulence, coming shortly before elections pencilled in for next May, Taking over as interim prime minister is Mr Peter Boross, the interior minister, who deputised for Mr Antall during his hospital treatment. But the succession is by no means certain and other candidates such as defence minister Lajos Fur may emerge. The struggle is set to shift the centre of political gravity within the Forum to the right as contenders seek the support of party activists. A potential kingmaker is Mr Sandor Lezsak, who runs the day-to-day affairs of the Forum and has publicly played down his desire to do the job himself. Last night he said on Hungarian television: 'The HDF's leading bodies are determined not to have a struggle for succession so that the country can maintain its creative calm and security without which, I believe, we cannot have firm prospects for the future.' A possible alternative to the election by MPs of a new prime minister is that the parliament dissolves itself and Mr Arpad Goncz, the president, calls early elections. Mr Antall's death is a loss for the Forum because, though his popularity ratings were low, he was widely respected, even by his opponents, and seen as an electoral asset. Thousands of mourners gathered in front of Budapest's ornate parliament building last night to sing Hungary's national anthem and light candles in Mr Antall's memory as the caretaker cabinet met in emergency session. Ministers, Mr Goncz and leaders of the Democratic Forum party later emerged to join the throng. Mr Antall's departure from the political scene depresses the Forum's chances of staging a recovery in public support from the 10 per cent recorded in the latest opinion polls. The Forum now faces an uphill battle against a resurgent Hungarian Socialist Party, the former communists, as well as a liberal bloc. The change in leadership will raise concerns about the country's reputation as an island of stability in an unsettled region, an achievement tied to Mr Antall's personality. Nevertheless all the potential successors to Mr Antall share a commitment to the market economy and Hungary's integration into the western community.</p>

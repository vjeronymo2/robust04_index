			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: R-R goes on attack over air subsidies ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aero-engine group, yesterday called for the extension of last year's EC-US agreement on civil aircraft subsidies to cover aircraft engines. His call coincided with the start of talks in Brussels yesterday between US and EC trade negotiators to review their recent agreement. Sir Ralph Robins, the Rolls-Royce chairman, claimed that US aero-engine manufacturers received more than Dollars 700m (Pounds 492m) a year in financial support from the US government. Rolls-Royce received just Pounds 15m a year for research from the UK Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence, he said. 'There is no doubt that the level of US government support to its industry makes life very difficult for us,' Sir Ralph told a House of Commons committee reviewing the UK aerospace industry. Rolls Royce had received Pounds 494.2m in UK government launch aid for civil aircraft programmes since 1972, he said, but it was repaying about Pounds 30m a year to the Treasury. Between now and 2001, the company is expected to repay nearly Pounds 500m to government. The turmoil in the civil aviation industry has revived transatlantic trade tensions over direct government support for the European Airbus programme. But the EC has in turn accused the US of continuing to support its civil aerospace industry with indirect subsidies through state agencies. The dispute has focused on the airframe industry. Rolls-Royce is now seeking to extend the agreement to cover engines. It said civil aircraft engines had so far been excluded from the pact because of opposition from General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US. Sir Ralph urged the UK government to provide greater research and development support for the UK aerospace industry, especially in the field of advanced materials. 'A new family of materials is coming to revolutionise aviation and its first application will be on engines.' Unless Rolls-Royce remained in the forefront of new materials technology, it risked losing out, he warned.</p>

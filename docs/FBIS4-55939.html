			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 20 (CTK) -- If the Stability Pact  guarantees existing borders, space will be created for the  inclusion of this document in a Slovak-Hungarian basic treaty,  Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said today.    The conclusion of the Stability Pact between the European  Union (EU) and Central and East European countries is primarily  aimed at solving ethnic minority problems as well as the border  issues between some states, he said. He said that though the  current working shape of the document is acceptable to Slovakia,  certain changes could be expected at the Paris conference  scheduled for next week as some states voiced certain  reservations against it.    "The inclusion of the passage on the inviolability of the  existing Slovak-Hungarian border in the basic treaty was  proposed by Slovakia," Moravcik said. He said that Slovak  diplomats proceeded from the fact that during the discussion on  a similar treaty with Ukraine certain reservations were raised.    The guarantees for the joint border, about which the  Hungarian side is "reserved", is a sensitive problem for  Slovakia. "We have to unambiguously and consistently reject the  fear of irredentism in Slovakia," he said, adding that the  guarantee of borders have been and are part of international  documents.    "We have come to believe that EU participation in the  formulation of a Slovak-Hungarian treaty would not necessarily  to bring positive results," Moravcik said asked why Slovakia  refused to conclude a treaty with Hungary under EU supervision.  "There is no reason for such treaties to be agreed upon under  the auspices of third countries," he added.    He pointed out, however, that the Stability Pact could  provide necessary guarantees for its member states and create  the necessary conditions for the "gradual integration" of nine  Central and East European countries into the EU.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Letter: No time for exaggeration Sir, In your piece entitled 'On Parade' (July 14) you mentioned that Sir Peter de la Billiere has become a director of Robert Fleming, with duties to see 'how can Fleming executives negotiate the maze of Saudi airport customs procedures in less than the traditional two hours'. Last time, these procedures took precisely 1 hour 55 minutes. I see no reason for you to exaggerate] Ghazi Algosaibi, Ambassador, Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, London</p>

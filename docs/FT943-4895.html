			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Shock waves spread among the powerful: The troubles arising in Mexico from the Carlos Cabal affair The decision by the Mexican government to order the arrest of Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, and take over the country's seventh and eleventh largest banks, has sent shock waves through the country's business and financial community. Mr Cabal is one of the country's most prominent businessmen and, apart from controlling an important financial group, owns by far the largest agro-business in Mexico. He has powerful friends in the Mexican government, and the move against him is expected to embarrass those who actively backed him, lent him money, and gave him authorisation to run not one but two banks. A government official said the finance ministry suspects three cases of illegal loans, ranging from Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to as much as Dollars 700m, paid from Mr Cabal's banks to his private business interests, mainly involving the purchase of Banca Cremi. However, the official did not exclude the possibility of more cases when a thorough audit was completed. The government moved against Mr Cabal in part to prevent his imminent purchase of Del Monte Foods, according to the official, with concerns that the near-Dollars 1bn transaction would be financed illegally. Mr Cabal had intended to re-merge Del Monte Foods with Del Monte Fresh Produce, which he and a group of investors bought for about Dollars 500m in 1992. Del Monte Fresh lost money last year, partly because of low international banana prices. The finance ministry says it may claim the assets of Del Monte Fresh if the company turns out to have benefited illegally from its relationship with Banco Union and Banca Cremi. The adequacy of Mexico's financial supervision is expected to come under scrutiny, following the charges against Mr Cabal. The finance ministry gave Mr Cabal authorisation to buy Union (then called BCH) in 1991, citing his 'administrative experience and integrity.' It gave him permission to take over Cremi and, earlier this year, to merge the two banks. Separately, Nafinsa, the state development bank, financed 25 per cent of Mr Cabal's acquisition of Del Monte Fresh. Mr Cabal's investor group includes current or former governors in the Mexican states of Campeche, Tabasco and Quintana Roo. The deals were approved despite the fact that Eastbrook, the former US trading house, has alleged in a civil suit that Mr Cabal and two former employees of Eastbrook directed more than Dollars 70m of loans to Mr Cabal's personal bank account or to shell companies between 1986 and 1991. Eastbrook claims just Dollars 30m was paid back. These financial dealings with Eastbrook, were being investigated until earlier this year by the US district attorney's office in Manhattan. Mr Cabal's lawyer has denied that he was the target of an investigation by the attorney's office. The Cabal case follows a fraud of more Dollars 100m alleged to have been perpetrated by top executives at Grupo Financiero Havre, who are alleged to have created shell companies to borrow money from Nafinsa. With Mexico's banks already suffering from high rates of default on their loans, and from intense competition, the latest allegations come at a difficult moment for the financial system. Officials strongly denied that the Cabal case would have any effect of the Mexican banking system. They said all of Mexico's banks have now been audited over the past eight months and that the only ones with suspected serious irregularities were Union and Cremi. They said that problems at other banks - of a different magnitude - had been sorted out. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, advised Mr Cabal in his planned acquisition of Del Monte Foods. Salomon Brothers was to have managed an issuance of Dollars 150m of high-yield debt on behalf of Mr Cabal, which was registered on August 29 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

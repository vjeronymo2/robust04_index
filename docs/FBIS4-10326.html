			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second "Open Agenda" program segment on Cuba's nuclear </F> program with host Antonio Resillez and guest Gilberto Salazar,  vice secretary of the Nuclear Affairs Executive Secretariat,  SEAN -- live]    [Excerpts] [Resillez] Today's program is rather unusual in  that most of the information will come not from dialogue but  through videos. We have prepared several reports that we are  confident will give our viewers a comprehensive idea of the  practical application of nuclear technology in the Cuban  economy's principal developing sectors.    "Open Agenda" will include exclusive statements by the  director of the radiation health and safety center, as well as  by SEAN executive secretary, engineer Andres Garcia -- a rather  important part of tonight's program.    We wish to begin with a report by Cienfuegos correspondent  Omar George. [passage omitted]    [Resillez] Salazar, the SEAN gives particular attention to  the completion of the isotopes production center. I recall that  on last Tuesday's program we talked about isotopes and their  characteristics. I would like you to explain the importance of  this center.    [Salazar] The Isotopes Production Center is going to be the  largest and most complex nuclear-technology facility, and is  extremely important for economic as well as strategic reasons.  At its temporary facility at Quinta and 30th Streets, three  radiopharmaceutical products are manufactured, but there are  certain products that cannot be made there. The new facility  will make producing more products a reality. It will also allow  us to increase the volume of these products. In a short period,  we will be able to produce 25 items. At the temporary facility,  we can produce only three items. By 1995, we expect this  increased production to save Cuba approximately $1 million;  hence its economic importance. In strategic terms, this increase  in production will allow us to increase the application of  nuclear technology nationwide, and reduce our foreign dependency.    Moreover, this work of producing, receiving, and handling  the  isotopes in a centralized manner will increase safety in this  area. This new center will thus be of tremendous importance to  the country.    [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. We are now going to run a  video that will confirm and perhaps increase understanding of  this center, and will also show the current stage of  construction of this isotopes production center here in Havana.    [Begin video recording by unidentified reporter] Among the  priorities of Cuba's nuclear program is a modern isotopes center  that is being built in the vicinity of Pedro Pi in the eastern  part of Havana. Conceived as a production, research, and  development unit, this center seeks to extend nuclear techniques  to medicine and industry. Its basic objective is to organize  reception and quality control, distribute the primary  radioisotopes, and produce whatever is needed in Cuba.    This center intends to carry out a number of tasks, among  them production of radiopharmaceutical products and tracer  compounds [compuestos marcados] essential for medical diagnoses  and therapy. The tracer compounds are practically irreplaceable  instruments in developing new medicines, a program the country  is implementing.    The requirements for registering and marketing these  medicines include complex pharmacokinetic studies, many of which  are possible only when the molecules are marked with radioactive  isotopes that allow them to be followed through the living  organism, tracing their body's accumulation and excretion  processes, as well as other characteristics.    A group of radiochemists from this center are in charge of  doing the radioactive marking of this new medicine known as PPG.  This has allowed a savings of $17,000, and above all, protection  of the formula, which should be revealed to the foreign company  in charge of the marking.    Because of its production capacity and characteristics, the  new plant -- which employs Argentine technology -- will be the  largest facility in Cuba to handle radioactive material.  Consequently, SEAN has paid special attention to the work in  order to guarantee its safety from the very beginning. [end  recording]    [Resillez] Probably very few people are aware that nuclear  technology is employed in vital areas of the country's economic  and productive spheres. Some may be aware of this, but for many  it will come as a surprise.    When I say vital areas of the country's economic  development,  I am referring, for instance, to the sugar agroindustry,  nonsugarcane agriculture, the nickel industry, biotechnology,  and others, which could include exploration for and extraction  of Cuban crude oil. In all these lines of development, nuclear  technology is used. I think the best way to convey this to our  viewers is through the following report:    [Begin video recording of unidentified correspondent] The  use  of nuclear technologies in various spheres of national life is  one of the main objectives of Cuba's nuclear program, which  received a special thrust in the 1980's. The areas in which  these techniques are used includes agriculture, the sugar  industry, and iron and steel production, as well as geological  exploration for oil and minerals.    Cuban agriculture has especially benefited from the use of  nuclear techniques. Through the use of ionizing radiation, an  important phytotechnical program of mutation has allowed us to  obtain a variety of new plants of great economic importance. An  accelerated program using the technique that leaves plants  insect-free has been implemented to control pests that affect  several crops; the most important results achieved have been  with the borers that attack sugarcane. Radioactive tracers and  nuclear analytical techniques in the sugar agroindustry have  allowed us to evaluate the operations of our installations and  learn about the chemical composition of the products and  by-products obtained.    The use of radioisotopic instruments has developed greatly  over the past few years. The iron and steel and mechanical  industries must be highlighted. Factories in these industries  use monitoring systems based on this type of equipment. This  production line is currently being strengthened, with the  possibility of developing and producing equipment for these  purposes in Cuba. An example of this is the nickel industry's  humidity-measurement system based on the method of reflecting  neutrons that was designed and manufactured in Cuba. This system  gives us a tremendous saving in fuel.    The other area in which nuclear techniques are used is  petroleum research. Determining the point of interphase between  water and oil and establishing the causes of failures in wells  under exploitation are two of the objectives of the use of  radioisotopic techniques in which foreign companies currently  operating in Cuba have expressed interest. [end recording]    [Resillez] Engineer Salazar, before going on to discuss the  use of these practical techniques, I think our viewers might be  interested in learning whether our nuclear development program  is maintaining fluent international relations or is at all  isolated.    [Salazar] It maintains good relations, internationally.  [Words indistinct] to show that our program is consistent and on  the right path. We have bilateral relations with approximately  15 countries, and multilateral relations through the assistance  and cooperation system of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA], of which we are a member. Proof of this is that we have  been elected to the board of governors by Latin America for a  fourth time. This will give you an idea of the prestige we have  achieved and of our current relations in this regard.    We have received support from the IAEA for the period  1993-94  in support of the work we have been developing in Cuba involving  the use of nuclear techniques. This support amounts to $1.2  million and has been provided to Cuba in equipment, training,  and advising. This cooperation increased to $8 million over the  past two [as heard] years and includes a food irradiation plant;  a gamma chamber; modern nuclear-medicine equipment; modern  equipment for other techniques applicable to industry,  agriculture, (?and) computer laboratories; and technical  assistance.    I also want to point out that when we talk about $8 million  over the past 10 years, we are referring not only to SEAN but to  the nation. The Cuban nuclear program, through SEAN, supplies  the entire country: Over 56 percent of those resources is in  other organizations such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the  Public Health Ministry, et cetera.    [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. I see Engineer Salazar's  reference to the health program and the presence of nuclear  techniques in the health system as opportune. I am almost  convinced that this is nothing new for our viewers, but let us  see what happens with the practical use of nuclear techniques in  the health system and in biotechnology.    [Begin video recording of unidentified correspondent]  Nuclear  science and technology are becoming increasingly more important  in the health program, in biotechnology, and in the  pharmaceutical industry. Diagnostic methods with the use of  radiopharmaceutical instruments are indispensable to the public  health system. Among the radioisotopic techniques we can mention  is the gammagraphic technique broadly used in neurological,  cardiological, oncological, renal, and other studies. Cuba has a  total of eight gamma cameras installed in nuclear medical  services nationwide, in which professionals and experts in  nuclear matters are working. National consumption of  radioisotopes and tracer compounds has increased to more than $1  million annually over the past five years, although this cost  has dropped over the past few years thanks to a group of  radiochemists from the SEAN who have produced three tracer  compounds used in renal, bone, and brain studies. This has  allowed a savings of more than $100,000 annually. The  radiosterilization system has allowed the decontamination and  sterilization of bioprepared plastic materials and of  medical-pharmaceutical products. The tracer compounds are in  great demand in the genetic engineering and pharmaceutical  industries. They facilitate the demand for studies of new  pharmaceutical products before their registration. The task of  the Cuban nuclear experts has also been extended to producing a  small quantity of medical equipment. This equipment, which is  produced in the country, are of high quality and very  competitive. An example of this is the Degos bone density  measurer for the diagnosis and treatment of problems in bone  metabolism and in osteoporosis. It operates through a nuclear  method called (photonic) absorption. This is very important for  the studies of bone metabolism implemented by the Public Health  Ministry. [end recording]    [Salazar] Resillez, with the opportunity presented by this  video, I would like to mention a few things. The video says that  we have eight gamma cameras in the country. I would like to add  that nationwide today, we have 17 nuclear medicine modules. This  shows the high-level diagnoses that can be made of given  diseases anywhere in the country.    The video also mentions the production of some medical  equipment we already discussed in the previous program. As you  can see, the quality achieved is outstanding, and not only for  this show. This has been confirmed by our own medical personnel  who are using this equipment, although they are still facing a  medical registration process.    [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. The use of all these nuclear  techniques, not only in Cuba but in any country in the world,  demands very professional work and severe safety measures to  prevent damage to people or the environment. In Cuba, of course  we are doing this. In the following video we are going to see  what is happening in this field. Then we are going to listen to  Dr. Luis (Jova), who is head of the Center for Radiation  Protection and Control [centro de proteccion e higiene de las  radiaciones -- CPHR]. We therefore consider this video and these  exclusive comments for Open Agenda of great importance to  national public opinion.    [Begin video recording by unidentified correspondent] Since  its founding in 1985, the CPHR has been the coordinator and  leading guide for radiological activities in Cuba. Together with  the territorial delegations to the SEAN, it controls the  radiation dosage received by each worker professionally linked  to ionizing radiations in the 192 radiation institutions  operating in the country. One of the most relevant activities  carried out by this center is the research entitled:  Environmental Radiological Studies Carried Out in Cuba Between  1984 and 1992, awarded by the Cuban Academy of Sciences.    The radiation control task includes study and control of the  local and regional influence that man has on the environment, of  nuclear and radiation installations, and the influence of  overall radioactive discharge. The data released by the national  network is representative of the whole country. For their study,  zones of economic interest have been prioritized, such as  Juragua in Cienfuegos, and those of interest to tourism such as  the northern coast of the provinces of Ciego de Avila, Camaguey,  and Las Tunas. One of the conclusions of the radiation studies  is that the radioactivity to which current and future visitors  could be exposed in a tourist zone as important as Cayo Coco,  Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Paredon, or Cayo Sabinal, and the beaches  of Santa Lucia, Covarrubias, or Por Ella, is much less than the  average level throughout the world.    Cuba is a territory with a normal radioactive background. It  is a place with radiological conditions favorable to the  development of any human activity in general, as well as being a  magnificent place for those people who, in addition to the  beauties of the area, enjoy the environmental cleanliness. The  CPHR has demonstrated this with solid scientific arguments. [end  recording]    [Begin (Jova) recording] In fact, in addition to what you  just saw, we can add that our center, as a center in charge of  all scientific and technical services in the area of  radiological safety, has participated [passage indistinct]  treatment of children from the area affected by the Chernobyl  accident, our experts have been charged with making a review and  evaluating the amount of radiation these children received.  Other studies have been developed in the field of radiology.    In 1986, our center was also given the mission of collecting  all radioactive sources no longer in use in the country, and to  confine them safely in quarters owned by the SEAN and specially  designed and built for that purpose. We were also charged with  collecting all radioactive waste generated by institutional  users of these sources. These wastes were also treated and are  safely kept, thanks to technology designed by experts from our  institution and our country.    As you were able to see in that video, our center has an  important responsibility concerning environmental radiation  control. This, linked to services rendered in the radiation  protection area by workers who are professionally exposed to  radiation, guarantees radiation protection of the people, of  workers who are exposed because of the work they do, and of the  environment throughout the country. [end recording]    [Resillez] Cuba has been working on its nuclear program for  almost 20 years. Preparation, production, and training have been  the essential pillars of this complex project which, as you have  seen through these two consecutive programs on Open Agenda, the  country can already witness the results it has achieved.    A few hours ago we had a long chat with Engineer Andres  Garcia, executive secretary of the National Atomic Energy  Commission. As we said in the beginning, we attribute great  importance to this conversation, especially regarding  information for national and international public opinion. We  have taken one segment of that dialogue, which basically  discusses the prospects of the Cuban nuclear program. With that,  we wish to conclude these two programs devoted to this issue,  but not before expressing our gratitude to the SEAN and its  information center for all the support they have provided us for  this program. I would also like to thank Engineer Salazar, and  you, viewer, for tuning in to this Open Agenda program.    [Begin Garcia recording] First, I would like to thank  everyone involved in this program, and especially you, Resillez,  for this opportunity you are giving us to inform our people  through this program about the Cuban nuclear program.    Those videos have demonstrated that our nuclear program is  in  good health. Concerning future prospects, we are making efforts  to begin the nuclear energy program. Thus, in the development of  increasingly more complex installations, we have begun with the  principle of using our own efforts -- in this case, the  scientific potential created by the Revolution -- in this  scientific-technical structure.    Apropos to this idea, I wish to say that our development  must  be essentially based on the capacity created by the country to  design and build complex installations in this field. We thus  consider it a priority to keep our experts united, and  especially to keep them developing their knowledge in the  scientific-technical field.    The world must think more and more about how to solve future  energy problems. It is not only Cuba facing this energy crisis  today. Man must think about how to solve this problem in the  future. In this regard, nuclear energy plays an important role,  and great efforts are being made today to develop sophisticated  reactors, fast-breeding reactors, and nuclear fusion, which have  greater potential than the current methods.    What we have been doing so far is a way of keeping ourselves  up to date on possibilities for beginning a much more complex  energy generation system in the near future. However, if we  abandon this idea, the potential created over the years by the  Revolution would be dispersed. I think we, the men working in  this field, have an obligation to be realistic and sensitive to  the country's situation, confronting tasks that have to do with  current times. But we must also have a view of the future, and  work on this view. This is the way we think at the SEAN, and I  think I can say, to sum up this idea: We must be able to  daydream.    I think our commander in chief, in his historical allegation  -- and history will support me -- being a young lawyer, was able  to have a future view of nuclear energy. In his allegation then,  he was already referring to the importance of nuclear energy to  solve the country's economic problems. Imagine! In 1953, we were  a year short of operating the first nuclear power plant in the  world. [end recording]</p>

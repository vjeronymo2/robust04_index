			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Offer by Japanese carmakers The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association yesterday announced a voluntary plan to increase access to the Japanese market for foreign vehicles and parts. The plan, which follows persistent US pressure on Tokyo to improve the market environment for foreign vehicle and parts makers, is aimed at deflecting US criticism of trade barriers to the Japanese market. It is being offered as an alternative to US requests for government-led action to open the country's vehicle market. The plan calls for increased exchanges among vehicle and parts industries worldwide, support for foreign vehicle makers in Japan and better availability to foreign companies of information concerning the Japanese market. The issue of car and parts sales has been particularly thorny, as the sector makes up 60 per cent of the US trade deficit with Japan. Japan has been criticised for providing insufficient information to foreign carmakers and for regulations and business practices which hinder sales of foreign-made parts to the Japanese after-market. Japanese officials have refused to commit themselves to US proposals for government action in the industry, claiming on the grounds that such activity in the private sector would constitute managed trade. The association's plan was timed to precede the government's launch of a programme to open up the country's markets.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck to shed 2,000 jobs SEARS, ROEBUCK, the large US retail and financial services company, announced that it will eliminate 2,000 management and clerical jobs by early 1993 to produce cost savings of Dollars 30m this year and Dollars 80m annually thereafter. About half of these jobs are based in Chicago. The cuts follow a Sears study of competitors' headquarters. Sears, which has cut more than 40,000 jobs during the past 20 months, has been on a drive to curtail its expenses, regarded as relatively high in the retail industry. The jobs to be phased out this year include posts in buying, replenishment, marketing, finance, human resources and administration departments. In addition, Sears announced that 3,200 sales associates have accepted a severance scheme as a result of its new compensation policy. The policy, expected to bring an annual cost savings of Dollars 60m, was designed to weed out less productive salespeople. In mid-February Sears set new sales commission standards and said that those whose commission fell by 10 per cent or more as a result of the new standardisation would be eligible for severance. Details of the severance costs were not available. Some 650 of these positions will be eliminated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Glavkos Kliridhis yesterday confirmed  reports that he intends to resign if the Security Council  decides to continue the current procedure on the  confidence-building measures, despite the UN secretary general's  clear evaluation that the Turkish side has no political will for  a solution. [passage omitted]    Political observers yesterday interpreted Kliridhis' open  warning as an answer to insistent efforts at the Security  Council and in Cyprus -- with the continuous meetings between  Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special  representative in Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas -- to help the Turkish Cypriot side, even though the  "agreement" on the 21 March document is set.    It must be noted that there has been no reply so far to  Kliridhis' letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British  Prime Minister John Major.    Asked to explain the reasons that may force Kliridhis to  resign, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis clarified that  this is a strictly personal issue for the president and noted  the "inconsistency" of others, implying the United States and  Britain.    Kasoulidhis mentioned that there are three hypothetical  scenarios: a) Denktas accepts the 21 March UN document, and  there is an agreement on the confidence-building measures; b)  negotiations begin on issues other than the 21 March document;  c) a dialogue begins and our side raises its objections.    Kasoulidhis said that in the first case we would have  immediate agreement. The National Council's decision, to which  the president is committed, clearly states that discussion on  the confidence-building measures has ended. However, the  president made it clear to National Council members that he has  accepted the 21 March UN document, and if Denktas accepts it,  even now, he will accept it too.    A serious issue would be created if talks begin on issues  other than the 21 March UN document, because the UN secretary  general's representatives told the president it was the last UN  document. As a result, Kliridhis lifted his objections to reach  an agreement.    In the third case, Kasoulidhis said reservations and  objections would return to the negotiating table if we were led  to an endless procedure. He added: Although we will also raise  objections, our side will be in a very difficult position  because the president has accepted the 21 March document.    The spokesman stressed that the president believes that, if  necessary, he would make it easier for the Cypriot Hellenism to  call for presidential elections in order for the new president  to receive a public order without the obligation of accepting  the document.    Commenting on an observation that Denktas may finally give a  positive answer, the spokesman said: "Denktas supposedly has  approached some UN positions, but not the 21 March document."</p>

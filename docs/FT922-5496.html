			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: Why this may be the time to turn green - Worried about the rainforest, pollution, gambling, alcohol and the arms race? No need for the Samaritans. New and positive forms of ethical investment are at hand WOULD it cost you the earth to go green? Even if you do not have pro-environmental views, the Earth Summit, which opens on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, could have substantial effects on the growth and performance of many companies. There was a time when political and/or moral sensibilities held some investors back from the stock market - some thought it ideologically incorrect to invest in capitalist fat cats, others found the ethics of large companies too questionable. Companies involved in South Africa and the arms trade were among the favourite taboos. One way around this for those without ideological objections to stock market investment, but with scruples about where to invest, was to put money into 'ethical' funds, which took off in the 1980s. Friends Provident was the pioneer; its Stewardship Unit Trust avoided companies involved in armaments, South Africa, gambling, alcohol and tobacco. With Pounds 105m under management, the fund is easily the largest ethical. But fashions have changed again. Debate on environmental problems, backed by laws geared towards cleaning the planet, produced a new breed of 'green' funds towards the end of the 1980s. It has led to 'positive' investment by ethical investors - instead of people choosing stocks by refusing to invest in certain companies on ethical grounds, they can now pick companies which contribute to the environment. Some investors, of course, will continue to invest negatively by vetoing companies with a bad environmental record. Choice of green funds is still limited but most are to be found in the unit trust sector, with a smattering of investment trusts and some pension and insurance funds. Homeowners, the friendly society, has a Green Chip growth bond and StartRight, its children's savings plan, has a green option. What is 'green'? There are two main ways to invest environmentally. The first is to choose companies which follow environmentally-friendly policies. The second is to select companies which produce goods and services for cleaning the environment, such as waste disposal companies. The first green fund was a unit trust launched by Jupiter Tarbutt Merlin in December 1988. It has since added an investment trust. Merlin selects companies whose products and manufacturing processes are not causing excessive harm to the environment. It also looks at the management's record on these issues. In its latest bulletin, it highlights National Westminster Bank, which has an environmental management unit, for 'reviewing its entire lending portfolio for potential liabilities in its attempt to achieve effective environmental risk management.' The object is different at Commercial Union, which launched its environmental investment trust in April, adding to its environmental unit trust and pension fund. It tries to identify stocks which will be beneficiaries of the green revolution and has mainly chosen small companies, involved in specialist goods and services for the green market. The largest proportion is in the US where environmental legislation is stricter than in Europe. Companies include makers of air filters or water purifiers. This is a clear shift away from companies which are demonstrating environmentally friendly behaviour in their own operations. The main reason for the shift is performance. 'You can't mix emotion with investment,' said Peter Foster, marketing manager at Commercial Union. Eric Hathorn, research director at Henderson Crosthwaite, private client stockbrokers, which is recommending the new trust, agrees. 'We have to make money for our clients. Commercial Union has gone for those companies which provide services to improve the environment. The money they make out of that is good environmental profit.' Clerical Medical, which has insurance, pension funds and a unit trust in this field, tries to marry the two main criteria for stock selection. Like Commercial Union, it chooses companies involved in the environmental field but does not include companies whose proudction process has adverse environmental effects. While National Westminster, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Ireland have committed themselves to the protection of the environment, Hill says: 'I can't see what a bank does that makes a positive contribution to the environment. Companies such as Shell and ICI have vast resources but there are still parts of their operations which could not be considered environmentally friendly.' The investment route chosen is very much a matter of personal choice for the green investor. But interested investors should ask fund managers to state their investment criteria because there is the risk that a green fund may not be the right shade throughout. For example, Ethical Investment Research Information Service, which screens companies for private investors to see whether they meet ethical and environmental criteria, identified companies involved in water pollution. It then looked at green funds to see what percentage of their portfolio was invested in the identified companies. Those funds with high avoidance rates were NPI Global Care Unit Trust (97 per cent), Ethical Investment Fund run by Bromige &amp; Partners (92 per cent), Equitable Ethical Unit Trust (89 per cent) and Clerical Medical Evergreen, but TSB Environmental Investor Fund had only a 14 per cent avoidance rate. TSB does not claim to avoid companies causing water pollution but some green investors may assume that that this is a necessary condition for an environmental fund. Performance Reliable performance measures are difficult to establish. James Capel, the broker, produces a green index which covers 30 stocks, including the Body Shop, British Polythene and water companies such as Severn Trent and Wessex. The index starts at 100 on December 30 1988 against a FT-SE 100 rebased, also to 100, for the same date. At May 15 the green index stood at 136.06 against 145.52 for the FT-SE 100. The figures for the previous year May 17 1991) are 118.55 for the green index and 136.55 for the rebased FT-SE 100. 'The green index has shown growth of 17.2 per cent against 9.4 per cent for the Footsie over the past 12 months,' said Roger Hardman, co-author of the James Capel Green Book. 'On the two year view, the two indices are bang in line.' Hardman believes the outlook is good for green companies. 'For companies with exposure to the environment, new markets are opening up and existing ones expanding.' He believes companies which are not environmentally conscious are going to find their operating costs increasing as tighter environmental legislation is introduced. 'If you are producing toxic waste, charges to get rid of it will increase and your profits will be hit.' Nevertheless, there are very few points at which the green index has overtaken the rebased Footsie and, when it has, the outperformance has been short-lived and fractional. In a paper on environmental investment produced last autumn, KPMG, management consultants, found the performance of green funds 'uninspiring.' 'Both green and ethical funds tend to be heavily weighted in favour of smaller companies, which have been hit hard by the recession, and by high interest rates in particular,' it wrote. 'Furthermore, many of their stocks in the waste management and environmental services sectors were over-rated at the time of purchase. However, there are signs of improvement.' One of the main problems affecting performance is that there are still not enough investors, according to Commercial Union's Peter Foster. Its investment trust, launched last month, has Pounds 17.5m under management but this was mostly placed with institutions because there was not enough interest on the retail side, according to Foster. 'There is about Pounds 100m in green funds in the UK but this actually is not a lot of money. People like the concept of a green fund but when it comes to putting their hands in their pockets, they are less keen,' he said. This is particularly true of green pension funds. Large companies are, perhaps understandably, reluctant to commit too large a proportion of money set aside for employees' pensions in such a small market. 'Returns have been respectable on our unit trust and the pension fund has not done badly, but there have been bigger returns elsewhere,' said Foster. Henderson Crosthwaite's Hathorn believes that a contributory factor limiting the size of green funds was, ironically, the sudden interest in green companies. 'The share price of companies spending on the environment went through the roof and that is not the best way to increase the size of the fund.' He, too, believes the outlook is good. Green funds are limited in their choice of suitable stocks. This, and the fact that many tend to be small companies, has resulted in these funds being volatile in performance. 'We try to counteract the volatility by making our fund international because there are not enough British companies for us to choose from,' said Clerical Medical's Peter Hill. The Evergreen trust holds about 50-60 stocks, half of which are in the US. The rest are evenly divided between the UK, Japan and Europe. The unit trust has shown a decline of 8.1 per cent in the year to May 1 against a 4.2 per cent decline in the FT-A World Index over the same period. 'The Gulf crisis made the price fall and it has been a process of slow recovery ever since,' said Hill. 'But it has tracked the World Index closely throughout that period and since it is a volatile trust, that 4 per cent differential can appear and disappear quite quickly.' Jupiter Tyndall Merlin also complains of volatility but says it is taking less risks to give a more balanced performance. The size of the Ecology unit trust dropped from more than Pounds 10m last autumn to Pounds 8.6m today, after one of its large institutional holders decided to withdraw. 'We used to be heavily in the US market, but when the dollar weakened against the pound, we were at a disadvantage,' said Clare Brook, fund manager at Merlin. Its environmental research unit is seeking out companies for good profitability. 'We have also tried to identify the greens among the blue chips,' said Tessa Tennant, head of Merlin's the research unit. 'We found that many of the companies that had a good environmental record were also good performers in their sector. For example, Argyll came out top in food retailing, Wessex in water and Manweb in electricity.' For the future, along with other fund managers, Clerical Medical's Hill takes a very positive long term outlook. Events such as the Rio summit should put pressure on governments, in the US and West Europe, at least, to promote measures for the protection of the environment. The process is slow, which is why green investors need to be patient, he said. 'The legislation is passed, and it takes time for the government to allocate resources,' said Hill. 'It may not be until two or three years later that you get opportunities occuring so that private companies can then compete for those opportunities thrown up by the legislation.' The cynical may find it too long to wait and there would be no point in trying to persuade them otherwise, since green funds have not performed well. But the arguments for future growth are both logical and persuasive. They have convinced Citibank which says green companies are becoming profitable. It thinks the time is right to launch a green fund and is launching an insurance fund which will be managed by Jupiter Tyndall Merlin and is offering a pre-launch bonus allocation from June 1 to June 12 to coincide with the Earth Summit. This may be the time for investors attracted by green funds but worried about performance, to be less reticent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT AND INVESTMENT TRUSTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Launch       Fund          1 year Fund                     date    size (m)   Growth (%)   Ranking  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unit trusts (offer to bid, income reinvested)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS Environ              1990   Pounds  7.5     9.9        6/159 Clerical Med Evergreen   1990   Pounds  7.1   -14.1      148/159 CU Environmental         1989   Pounds 10.1    -7.6 Eagle Star Environ Opp   1989   Pounds  8.1    14.7        6/142 Merlin Jupiter Ecology   1988   Pounds  8.6     0.6       30/159 NPI Global Care          1991   Pounds  1.3 Sovereign Ethical        1989   Pounds  5.3     4.6       52/145 Target Global Opps       1987   Pounds  5.5    -3.4       63/159 TSB Environ              1989          20.3     7.5       27/145  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment trusts Merlin Int Green         1989   Pounds 27      10.1         5/18 CU Environmental         1992   Pounds 17.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Finstat, figures to 1 May 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

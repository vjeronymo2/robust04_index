			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Special Program on the NPC and CPPCC Sessions"] </F>   [Text] As a frontier province in China's reform and  opening up, Guangdong has achieved remarkable progress over the  past 15 years. However, as the Central Committee's policy of  reform and opening up is being implemented in depth throughout  the country, overseas investment is gradually moving inland.  Moreover, other coastal provinces and cities have also opened  up in an all-round way. Consequently, Guangdong has been  steadily losing many of its former advantages. In these  circumstances, what can Guangdong do to create new advantages  and advance its economy to a new level?    In an interview with station reporter Zhao Yihong, Xie Fei,  NPC deputy and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC  Committee, spoke about Guangdong's plans for the future and its  strategic goals.    [Begin recording] The general idea is to lay a foundation.  There are three aspects to this foundation. For short we call  them three mountains -- all for the purpose of laying a  foundation.    First, the institution of three mechanisms. The first is the  mechanism of the socialist market economy, a mechanism of broad  significance. The second is the legislative mechanism, and the  third that of democratic supervision. These three mechanisms,  we believe, will be crucial to the accomplishment of our future  goals. They are economic as well as political mechanisms. In  other words, we will simultaneously promote reform of two types  of mechanisms that promote one another.    Third [as heard], making improvements in three areas: 1.  Optimizing the industrial structure. Guangdong is developing  industries based on high and new technology; there should be a  reasonable ratio between the primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries; and industry should change in a way that lays  greater emphasis on economic efficiency. 2. Improving the  environment. In achieving modernization, we should try to  avoid the problems that developed countries have encountered  before -- that is, pollution of society and the environment  brought about by modernization. We are studying ways to avert  these problems. Our goal is to achieve modernization and  industrialization without polluting the environment. 3.  Improving the quality of the population. It has a two-fold  meaning. One is family planning, the second is related to  education. It is important to improve the quality. [end  recording]</p>

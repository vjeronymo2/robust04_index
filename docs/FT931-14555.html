			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Outline deal agreed for power sales REGIONAL electricity com-panies in England and Wales have agreed with the generators the broad commercial principles by which - in the next batch of long-term contracts - they will buy at least some of the power that will be generated from coal. The successful outcome of the heads-of-agreement talks is important because it will help negotiations on the final contracts after the energy white paper is published next month. The heads of agreement, negotiated between 11 of the 12 regional companies on one side and National Power and PowerGen on the other, cover issues including the impact of possible tax changes and the effect of inflation on prices. Details of prices per electricity unit and volume - which could cause some conflict - will be completed in bilateral contract talks between each of the regional companies and the generators. It is unlikely, however, that any of the 11 will sign anything before publication of the white paper. One regional company executive said the preliminary deals were likely to form the commercial basis on which most, and possibly all, coal-fired power is traded from April. He said: 'They are not the answer to the pit closures, however. They sustain the rump of pits which can survive in the competitive market but they do not create in themselves any extra room in the market.' The agreement is based on the assumption that the generators will buy 40m tonnes of coal from British Coal in the year from April and 30m for each of the next four years. Letters, Page 10</p>

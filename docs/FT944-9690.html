			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Norway's pro-EU camp steps up pace Norway's Labour government yesterday stepped up its campaign to win approval for joining the European Union in a referendum on November 28, following neighbouring Sweden's vote in favour of membership on Sunday. With both Sweden and Finland now set to join the Union on January 1, the pro-EU camp is hoping to swing Norwegian opinion to a Yes vote with an appeal not to leave the country isolated. Up until now the opposition has held a strong lead in the opinion polls, reflecting deep-seated suspicions in Norway that membership will erode Oslo's independence and control over its rich oil and fish resources. 'Norwegians are well aware that Sweden is both our closest and most important neighbour. It's our main trading partner and that has implications for Norwegian jobs,' said Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister. She underlined the belief on both sides of the campaign in Norway that the outcome will be strongly influenced by the Swedish vote. 'Many people waited until the Swedish vote was known before making up their minds and many more are not likely to decide until the last week or even during the last days before the referendum,' Mrs Brundtland said. The prime minister will have an important platform this week to press home the Yes message as she hosts a regular meeting of her fellow Nordic prime ministers in the northern city of Tromso. Among them, only she and the Icelandic prime minister will be a non-member, or non-member elect. Norway is the last to vote of the four European Free Trade Area applicants aiming to expand the EU to 16 members. Austria voted heavily in favour last June. The Swedish parliament will ratify accession by the end of December. The Finnish parliament is expected to complete ratification of its October referendum approval by the end of this week. It had been held up until after Sweden had voted In Norway, the Yes campaign plans a big push in the final two weeks, arguing that EU membership will help secure jobs at a time of high unemployment, warning that investment, production and jobs would be moved outside the country if it is rejected. 'It would be a nightmare for Norwegian companies should we decide to stay outside the European co-operation,' said Mr Svein Aaser, president of the Confederation of Business and Industry. But Mrs Anne Enger Lahnstein, head of the Centre party and the leading anti-EU campaigner, called for anti-EU activists to mobilise all their resources in the final battle. 'I believe our arguments against the EU will remain valid irrespective of Sweden's decision to join,' she said. On Saturday, one opinion poll put EU opposition at 48 per cent, with the Yes camp at just 29 per cent. But some surveys have suggested that Norway's Eurosceptics would be more inclined to vote for membership if Sweden joined. Reflecting this was another poll giving the Yes camp 49 per cent and the Nos 51 per cent. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

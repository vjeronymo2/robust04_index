			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sahel's crops at mercy of airborne invaders - Defences against the locust threat remain woefully inadequate THERE ARE strong signs that another desert locust plague is about to hit Sahelian Africa, and according to a recently-published report, unless a comprehensive approach to the problem is implemented the region's already struggling agriculture will be further devastated. 'Events in late 1992 and early 1993 in East Africa suggested that a desert locust plague could once more be brewing, starting in the Red Sea hills of Sudan, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia,' says the report by the Panos Institute of London. It refers to warnings from the Food and Agriculture Organisation that there is need for better quality information from surveys if the impending plague is not to be as damaging as the last in 1986-1988. The painful irony for Sahelian farmers is that while drought destroys the prospects of improved agricultural production, it is also unfavourable to the breeding and proliferation of the desert locust. The report says it was the good rains of 1985 that seem to have stimulated the increased breeding which triggered the 1986-1988 plague. 'So just when there is a year or two of improved rainfall and the prospect of better yields, the threat of locust damages increases,' the report says. 'Many a Sahelian farmer has suffered seeing the first crop after years of poor rains being ravaged by locusts and grasshoppers.' Any attempt to deal with the problem must first come to terms with the fact that it is not only locusts, but grasshoppers, which threaten agriculture in the region. The Panos Institute points out that while locusts are notorious for their capacity for destruction, grasshoppers have no such notoriety. It argues, however, that this distinction is 'false'. 'While grasshoppers may not have caught the imagination of chroniclers of plagues as locusts have, they too devastate crops and rangeland. In fact, over the last five years they have caused more damage in the Sahel than locusts.' The experience of the 1986-1988 plague indicated that the fast action and flexibility needed to deal with the pests were not available, and that once the locusts were on the move the resources supplied to combat their onslaught was sometimes inappropriate and often came too late. The fight to reduce the locust population and to prevent a plague, or to contain them when they are on the move, is severely hampered by poor communications in the Sahel. It is more difficult to fly to different areas from within the region than it is to reach them from Europe, the Panos Institute says, and moving equipment, fuel and pesticides in the region is far from easy. 'A drum of pesticide to be used in August has to be moved up country by May at the latest,' it says. 'This means it has to be in the country no later than April, which in turn means being despatched from its country of origin in January. Yet firm predictions on campaign requirements eight months ahead are impossible.' Few Sahelian national budgets can stand the cost of aerial surveys and efforts at locust and grasshopper control in the region are complicated by difficulties in regional co-operation, while collaboration among institutions in the region has become more difficult because of conflict between or within countries. The report cites the case of Chad, which it says contains areas of suitable breeding ground for the desert locust that are too large to be covered by ground surveys. In 1987 and 1988 the continuing conflict with Libya meant that aerial surveying in the north was forbidden. In October 1990, poor relations between Chad and Sudan prevented aerial surveying of large areas on both sides of their common border. Dealing with the problem demands the establishment of a 'single comprehensive and authoritative starting point' for all those concerned with grasshopper and locust control, the report argues. 'The cost of pulling together the relevant information is insignificant. While a number of information networks exits, the FAO remains the best forum for the exchange of ideas between scientists, administrators and decision makers.' While donor countries and institutions and Sahelian plant protection agencies are becoming increasingly aware that there is a need for new approaches, the Panos Institute warns that another plague on the scale of that of 1986-1988 could as easily build up. 'Luck may not be on the Sahel's side this time,' it concludes. 'If technical and institutional capacities are not strengthened and if more sustainable strategies are not developed, the farmers of the Sahel will continue to be vulnerable to devastating crop losses.'

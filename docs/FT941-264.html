			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (12): Big names line up to test the water - India's textiles increase their share of the world market Deregulation has transformed textiles into an export-driven industry to attract the foreign investment essential for upgrading products. All segments of the industry are working flat out, following two successive years of bumper cotton crops. Meanwhile, textile exports, including garments, rose to Dollars 4.32bn in the year ended March last year, 7.5 per cent higher than in the the previous year. Exports for the year to March of this year are projected to rise strongly by more than 15 per cent to Dollars 5bn. When the industry succeeds in technological upgradation and enhances value addition, exports are expected to jump to more than Dollars 8.5bn. in three years. Even so, with only 2 per cent of the world market, India is still only a minor player - China's exports last were worth Dollars 23bn. Big names such as Arrow of US, Pierre Cardin, La Coste and Benetton are all testing the Indian waters. Others are already trying to weave strategic alliances with Indian counterparts. Their first target is to win a slice of the growing local market. They also see India as a springboard for exports to other countries with no quota restrictions. 'The Indian middle class is as big as Germany (in population),' says Mr DK Gupta, director of the apparel export promotion council. These world leaders are waiting for the dismantling of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) in six years to exploit the free market in Europe and the US. The MFA is to be phased out over the next 10 years to integrate textile exports with Gatt in two stages - to a level of 51 per cent of quotas under MFA by 2001 and full integration by 2005. Cotton, jute and silk have been kept out of the MFA and India will have to negotiate bilateral agreements with US, Canada and the European Union. La Perla of Italy is to buy a 40 per cent stake in a joint venture with Bombay-based Mafatlal group to make shirts, undergarments and lingerie. Mafatlal, a traditioinal fabrics exporter, has opted for forward integration to produce value-added garments. Prem Malik, executive director of Mafatlal Industries, says, 'We are looking at the upper end of the European and US makets and aim at 40-60 per cent value addition.' The joint venture will use Mafatlal fabrics. Two suit-making companies - Morrotto of Germany and Samsung of Korea - are talking to two Indian textile exporters in New Delhi to turn out 100,000 woollen suits a year, using cheap Indian labour. Critical inputs such as know-how, textile designs and marketing skills will come from overseas partners. As the overseas market became profitable by the 40 per cent rupee devaluation two years ago, Indian textile groups are preparing to seize export opportunities. Most are building facilities to produce yarn for export. More than 50 spinning mills are coming on stream to take advantage of the duty-free import scheme for such plants. In other segments, strategies differ but the aim is to find niche markets overseas. Lalbhai group of Ahmedabad, the textile city in western India, has chosen to put Indian denim on the world map. He plans to nearly treble denim exports to 120m metres from the present 48m metres. 'We want to strategically locate our manufacturing units,' says Mr Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director. One plant is to be sited in Mexico to gain free access to Canada and the US as fellow members of Nafta. Another will be in Mauritius, which as a signatory to Lome convention, will gain duty-free entry to European Community. An unnamed Israeli textile group has proposed to its Indian counterpart a joint venture in India, to export yarn to Israel for conversion into fabrics, which will be shipped back to India for making garments for export to Europe. The garments will qualify for duty-free import into Europe if the Israeli content is 40 per cent. Knitwear is also benefiting. Courtalds of the UK is talking to New Delhi-based Parasarampuria group to relocate its socks plant to India. Delta Socks of Israel is setting up a joint venture to produce socks in India. Delta will pick up 50 per cent of the new venture's output. Sinterama, an Italian conglomerate, plans to shift its acrylic yarn plant to India, management expertise being provided by Modern group. JCT Ltd. of Thapar and an Italian company plan to make specialty yarn for export back to Italy.</p>

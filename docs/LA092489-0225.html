			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIMPSON LOSES SENIOR AMATEUR IN PLAYOFF  </P> <P> Bo Williams blew a 4-up lead Saturday, but won the U.S. Amateur Golf  Championship in sudden death when San Diego's Joe Simpson missed a six-foot  putt on the first extra hole.  </P> <P> Williams chipped from off the green to within three inches for a conceded four.  Simpson then missed a six-foot putt for par.  </P> <P> The victory enabled Williams, 60, of Ocala, Fla., to become the eighth multiple  winner of the championship. Williams won in 1986 at Edina, Minn.  </P> <P> Simpson was attempting to complete the first father-son combination to win a  national championship of the United States Golf Assn. His son, Scott, won the  1987 U.S. Open Championship.  </P> <P> The final began as a rout as Williams rode a sizzling short game to a 4-up lead  after eight holes. He chipped in from off the green to halve the par-4 sixth  hole, then holed a 25-foot bunker shot at No. 8. Williams also won the first  two holes after bogeys by Simpson.  </P> <P> The match then took a dramatic turn on the back nine as Simpson won four  consecutive holes to even the score. He holed a 30-foot putt for a birdie at  the 12th hole and followed that with a near hole-in-one at the par-3 13th. His  ball rolled completely around the hole and stopped six inches away for an easy  birdie.  </P> <P> Williams bogeyed the next two holes. He hit his third shot at the par-5 15th  into the water, then missed a 3-foot par putt at No. 16.  </P> <P> He advanced to the final by defeating Bob Lowry of Huntsville, Ala., 2 and 1,  in the first of Saturday morning's semifinals. Simpson eliminated Amos Jones of  Atlanta in his semifinal match, 3 and 2.  </P></p>
